Title: Abkhazian Consonants
Date: November 18, 2005

Abkhazian has fifty-eight consonants. By contrast, English, a language which
is not consonant-poor, has twenty-three: the ones for which there are the
alphabetic letters such as b, d, f, etc. plus sh, ch, dz, ng, the occasional
trilled r, and the two sounds that are indicated by th (voiced in 'soothe' and
unvoiced in 'sooth').

Twenty-three consonants can make an infinite number of words; fifty-eight
consonants are even more of a mouthful. How can the human speech apparatus
produce so many distinguishable sounds?  "By utilizing all points of
articulation from the lips back to the larynx," says an Abhakazian linguist, and
"by associating with plain consonants such secondary features as labialization,
palatalisation, and pharyngalisation." More simply, everywhere that tongue,
lips, teeth, palate, or throat can either stop the flow of air or allow air to
pass through must be put into play. Moreover, If I understand correctly, a sound
made by vibrating, for instance, the area of the uvular might occur in both
labialized (i.e. rounded lips) and unlabialized variants.

I'm guessing that Abkhazian would be formidably difficult to understand,
especially for those who are acquainted only with Indo-European languages.

Abkhazian is one of the indigenous North West Caucasian languages, distantly
related to Circassian and the now extinct Ubykh). It may be descended from
Hattic, which may have been spoken in the empire of the Hittites. There are
something like a million Abkhazian speakers, half in Abkhazia itself, a country
that borders the Black Sea to the northwest of Georgia, and half in Turkey and
other locations in the Abkhazian diaspora. Written language came only in the
mid-nineteenth century to the wild Caucasus. Abkhazians have been described as
20% Muslim, 80% Christian, and 100% pagan, their religion "a peculiar mosaic of
fragments of religious beliefs" in which "Christian ceremonies, Muslim rites,
and pagan observances are so closely interwoven that it seems impossible to
separate them."

Though the Abkhazian consonant system is daunting, it's a relief to learn that
the language uses only one vowel - ah - and also that both the extinct Ubykh and
a still existing dialect of Abkhazian named Bzyp (pronunciation??) employed "a
minimum of eighty consonants." Is eighty the record?

Title: The Clocks of Rome
Date: November 21, 2005

On the library's shelf of new books a few days ago there was a biography of
Gaius Valerius Catullus (Aubrey Burl, Catullus, a Poet in the Rome of Julius
Caesar, 2004). I’ve had a warm feeling for Catullus since translating, line
by line as a schoolboy, the great erotic epithalamion written for the wedding
of Junia Aurunculeia and Manlius Torquatus. An epithalamion is a song for the
bedding of the bride, and Catullus’s poem overflows with a sexual urgency,
an emotion unacknowledged in the public discourse of my younger days. While my
teacher attended to such chilly questions as whether the meter was glyconic or
pherecretean, I understood with my whole body that Manlius and Junia were warmer
than Rock and Doris or Ozzie and Harriet.

I borrowed the biography of the poet because I remembered being informed that a
life of Catullus could never be written. Too little was known of him—only that
he was raised far to the north of Rome, somewhere in the vicinity of Verona,
that he was of half-Celtic stock, that he was very wealthy, and that he died at
the age of thirty in 54 B.C. And sure enough, the new biography isn’t really
a biography at all, but rather a gossipy account of political, military, and
social doings in Rome during the years when Catullus flourished.

Much was familiar, but an aspect of Roman reality that I should have remembered,
yet didn’t, was that the ancients kept time differently than we do. They were,
for example, weekless. Moreover, they allotted twelve hours to the period from
sunrise to sunset and twelve hours from sunset to sunrise. But of course, days
are longer in the summer and shorter in the winter, so an hour at the summer
solstice would be about twenty-five per cent longer than an hour at the equinox,
and an hour in midwinter about twenty-five per cent shorter. On any given day,
the length of an hour would be slightly different than yesterday’s hour or
tomorrow’s. It seems like a complicated system and I think that the modern
method of keeping the hours constant in length regardless of the season is quite
a sensible improvement. Rome was largely a world of sundials. Mechanical clocks,
a late medieval invention, were almost a millennium and a half into the future,
and the clepsydra, the ancient water-clock, was not so adjustable or so subtle
an instrument that it could be altered slightly from day to day.

The Roman system leads naturally to another question. When the Romans lengthened
or shortened the hour, did they also vary the number of minutes – say,
seventy- five minutes to an hour in summer, forty-five minutes to an hour in
winter? Or did they keep the number of minutes constant at sixty, but allow the
minutes to fluctuate in their duration?

And why does Roman horology put me in mind of James Thurber’s observation when
he turned sixty-- that if there were fifteen months in every year, he’d only
be forty-eight?

Title: The Black Sea;  Lermontov
Date: November 27, 2005

In the Black Sea just off the Bulgarian coast lies Nessabar, an island (nowadays
artificially an isthmus) that has been a trading center for several thousand
years. Still standing in the old city are churches and fortifications that date
from the 8th and 9th century. It's authentic and it's intriguing, but it's also
one of the very few places in Bulgaria that's distinctly over-touristed, so it
was a relief to hop the informal ferry (really no more than a glorified dinghy)
from Nessebar back to the mainland. To be afloat on the fabled Black Sea felt--
how else can I say it? -- Romantic and a far cry from landlocked Colorado. It
was that windy boat ride that pushed me into reading about the inhabitants of
the Black Sea littoral and of the neighboring Caucasus. This is the land of
the ancient Thracians, builders of tumuli, of the Scythians, who went to war
with mares only, and also of the Sarmatians (of whom the sum of my knowledge
had been the story of the ten virgins of Sarmatia deflowered in a single night
by the Emperor Procopius -- who was, according to Montaigne, a "master workman
and famous in the task." It's a land that is presently the home to Abkhazians,
Georgians, Circassians, Ossetians, Chechens.

My ruminating eventually brought to mind that I've read a novel set in the
Caucasus -- Mikhail Lermontov's A Hero of our Time. The novel was written
in the late 1830s (its author was killed in an idiotic duel in 1841 at the
age of twenty-seven). A sickly but wealthy Muscovite, Lermontov had been sent
to the frosty Caucasus several times in his childhood for the bracing air
and the healing baths. Later, as a Russian officer, he participated in the
displacement and genocide of the Caucasian peoples -- a war that began in the
days of Peter the Great and continues to this very moment. Of the novel itself I
could recall only vaguely the deep romantic chasms and rushing mountain streams,
the unlettered tribesmen, the gallant horsemanship. Re-reading was, as always,
a revelation. The nominal hero, Pechorin, of whom I'm embarrassed to say I had
not the least memory trace -- but let's face it, forty years is a long time--
is a hyperconscious but conscienceless cad. He's the underground man as cavalry
officer.

Here's a sample hunk of plot: at a wedding, lustful Pechorin is taken by the
sight of a fair young Circassian girl named Bela. Bela is also sought by
Kazbich, a swarthy Chechen fighter, the owner of a most remarkable horse. The
horse is coveted by Bela's younger brother Azamat. Azamat and Pechorin conspire:
Azamat will kidnap and deliver his sister to Pechorin if Pechorin will help
him abscond with the horse. The intrigue succeeds and Pechorin takes the "wild
girl" Bela as his concubine. She, of course, sickens. One day, while Pechorin
is out hunting boar, Kazbich returns and attempts to re-abduct Bela. Pechorin,
returning home, shoots at Kazbich and wounds him; Kazbich escapes but not before
fatally stabbing Bela with his dagger -- preferring, it's assumed, to kill
rather than surrender her.

It seems like a horribly racist tale -- made worse by the fact that the Chechens
are regularly characterized as thieves, the Ossetians as stupid, and so on. The
equation of horse and woman is inherently offensive. But the story is redeemed
from bigotry because blonde Pechorin is by far the nastiest character in the
novel, and because the whole episode can be and perhaps should be interpreted as
a rebuke to the brutality of Russian imperialism.

It's obvious that the novel's themes are not specific to the Russian-Caucasian
frontier. It's easy to imagine a translation of A Hero of Our Time into a film
set in the American west where Chechens become Sioux, the Caucasus becomes
the Rockies, Pechorin is played by James Stewart while Bela transmutes into
Debra Paget in a buckskin skirt, and racial, imperialist and genocidal themes
are enacted in a frontier that is more familiar but equally falsified and
romanticized.

Title: Bushlingo 1 -- Malapropisms
Date: November 29, 2005

Bushlingo is rich in malapropisms. The simplest occurs when an intended word is
displaced by one that is similar in sound or cadence, as in the wannabe-stirring
pronouncement that "we cannot let terrorists and rogue nations hold this
nation hostile." The word "hostile" is similar, kind of, to "hostage," but
unfortunately it is opposite in meaning, so that the effect of the malapropism
is to depict the United States not as a nation under attack but as an aggressor.
In the Bushlingo sentence, "we are making steadfast progress," it would appear
that the On-Message President meant to say "steady progress"; nevertheless,
"steadfast progress" is not without meaning. Ludicrous in Bushlingo, the near-
miss might even have had a touch of grandeur in a more able mouth, say that of
Winston Churchill. There's less ambiguity in the assertion that "reading is the
basics of all learning"; surely the Education President meant to say "basis,"
but perhaps his spongy brain had been infiltrated by the conservative slogan,
"Back to Basics." Another example of simple malapropism occurs in the defiant
"I don't have to accept their tenants," where the college-level word "tenets"
proves to be beyond the The Uniter's linguistic competence; the substitute
"tenants" inadvertently presents him not as an embattled orator but as a testy
landlord.

Bushlingo deploys malapropisms more excitingly when it replaces the anticipated
word with a coinage, as in the piteous Bartlett's-quotation-quality wail, "don't
misunderestimate me." "Misunderestimate" is a portmanteau comprised of the "mis"
in "mistake" or "misjudge" and "underestimate" and seems to mean something like
"don't underestimate me in a bad way." Perhaps, deep in his heart, the guy
knows that it is impossible to underestimate him. There is less self-betrayal
but equal novelty in the insight that "the United States and Russia are in the
midst of a transformationed relationship," where "transform" and "formation" are
packed into an overcrowded portmanteau. An even less less clever coinage appears
in the Bushlingoid judgment that "this issue doesn't resignate with the people."
"Resignate" and the intended "resonate" are near homophones;  so close in rapid
speech that the difference between the two is obvious only to those who can
read. A very similar example is contained in the proclamation "I want to reduce
our nuclear capacities to the level commiserate with keeping the peace." 
"Commensurate" is too hard a word for someone who's never seen it in print.

Coming soon: subject-verb agreement in Bushlingo.

Title: What We Read in the Fifties: The Late George Apley
Date: December 03, 2005

My father was a great admirer of the popular American novelist John P. Marquand
and I remember that he specifically urged me to read Marquand's best known work,
The Late George Apley. Marquand's heyday was in the 1930s and 1940s, and I don't
think that he's much read now, although it's good to see that two of his many
novels are still in print. Yesterday I re-read The Late George Apley. It's a
fine book. The conceit is this: George Apley, an extremely wealthy Bostonian
of the Cabot-Lodge-Saltonstall class, has recently died, and an old Harvard
chum has been hired to condense Apley's letters and papers into a biography.
The fatuous editor, who portrays Apley as an exemplary being, reveals to his
readership much more than he himself can possibly understand. We hear of Apley's
rectitude, his generosity, his civic-mindedness, his loyalty to his class --
but along the way we indirectly learn many truths; for example, that Apley
should have married the beautiful and intelligent but alas Irish Mary Monahan,
but instead was hustled into a ceremony with a drab woman of his own circle.
"Remember," his father assures him, "beauty is only skin-deep." Apley upholds
proper Louisburg Square values, but occasionally he catches a glimmer of the
idea that the rules of upper-class Boston have circumscribed and warped his
life. At the end, his daughter has married (gasp) a journalist and his son
(double gasp) a divorcee. In his last weeks, Apley becomes just a trifle less
unbending: "It even occurs to me tonight, although this is simply a whim of
the moment and probably not quite sound, that you (he's writing to a long-time
friend) and I may have missed something in our day." But he can also say of his
daughter's husband, that "his peculiarity of speech and manner indicate that he
comes from a very long distance, probably the Middle West, a place I have not
seen, nor do I wish to see it."

Here's Marquand at his best. Young George (we're now in the 1870s) has a
daft grandmother. One day, at a "festive occasion," she turns to her aged
contemporary the Reverend Nathaniel Pettingill, and blurts out:  "Young man,
should you ever go blackbirding, be sure to select Negroes that are brought
down from the mountains, they are stronger and healthier than the Blacks from
the coast." Our brainless narrator explains that her outburst "displays the
vagaries of a dear old lady's mind," but readers now know that the great Apley
fortune was built on slave-trading. (The artistry of the moment is borrowed from
Dickens, and specifically from Mr. F's lunatic Aunt in Little Dorrit, who, at
dinner, for no discernible reason, suddenly cries out to the company that "when
we lived at Henley, Barnes's gander was stole by tinkers." But on the whole
Marquand owes far less to Dickens than to Howells).

I can't help wondering why my father was so insistent that I read the book.
My father had as much rectitude as anyone I've ever known, and perhaps he
was attracted to the nobler side of Apley's personality. Or was he trying to
warn me away from the kind of conformity which stifles poor George? Or, a
very conventional man himself, did he suspect that he himself was enmeshed in
Apleyan-like coils?  Or did he simply enjoy long ironic narratives?

Is it time for a Marquand revival?

Title: Addendum to Lermontov
Date: December 04, 2005

On November 27, writing about Lermontov's A Hero of our Time, I found it
offensive that Azamat trades his sister for a horse. I found fault with
Lermontov for employing what I judged to be a fraudulent plot device. I've since
read Amjad Jaimoukha's The Chechens (2005) where the following appears: "In
Ingush society, a man had the right to give away his sister in marriage without
her consent." (The Ingush, like the Chechens, are a subset of the Vainakh.) What
appears to be a bit of crudeness in A Hero of our Time might in reality be an
accurate representation of nineteenth-century Caucasian society. Apologies to
Lermontov.

Title: More on Malapropisms in Bushlingo
Date: December 07, 2005

In a recent post, I conjectured that some Bushlingo malapropisms must have
originated when their bookless coiner parroted words that he had heard in
speech but had never seen in print.  I gave two examples:  the meaningless
"resignate" for "resonate" and the wildly off-target "commiserate" for
"commensurate."  Bushlingo offers other examples of such self-betraying
approximations.

Drawing from his profound well of historical knowledge, our deep president has
mused that Americans are endowed by their creator with "uninalienable rights." 
He has also proclaimed his disbelief that advertisements contain "subliminable"
messages;  he has threatened that an Iraqi who does not cooperate with us will
be "persecuted"; he has made the claim that corporate "malfeance" has affected
our economy. The inerrant President has also whined that he's been "pillared"
in the press. "Pillared" might mean "strapped to a pillar," just as "stocked"
used to mean "set in the stocks," but more likely it's a Bushlingo invention
for "pilloried" -- an unusual word far beyond the President's ninth-grade ken.
In all these cases the President, whose attention span appears to be minuscule,
has managed the first syllable --"res," "com," "sub," "mal," "pil" etc. -- just
perfectly but hasn't had the old-fashioned American stick-to-it-iveness to
persevere all the way to the end of the word.

Though no doubt Bush embraces a dark belief in the "fallacy" of human beings,
his Calvinism would be more theologically orthodox if he had pushed past the
opening "fal" and managed the full five syllables of "fallibility."

The transformation of misunderstood or incorrectly reproduced oral forms also
occurs in the incomprehensible assertion that "however they delineate, quotas
vulcanize society." To vulcanize is to add sulfur to raw rubber to make it
tougher and less elastic. What sort of mysterious social alchemy is envisioned
in the presidential use of the word vulcanize? Is it possible that he meant to
say "Balkanize?" Balkanization generally refers to a political situation in
which larger entities are subdivided into small competing units, as occurred in
the Balkan peninsula. But where in the world would Bush have encountered such a
hard word? Only orally. My guess is that he was briefed by some foreign policy
assistant who insufficiently dumbed down his presentation, and the Education
President heard a V where a B was in fact spoken.

On occasion, POTUS reveals that he's using a word that he has recently stumbled
upon, as in his observation that there are enemies of the United States who
"had been trained in some instances to disassemble--that means not tell the
truth." It sounds very much as though he had recently been introduced to the
word "dissemble" and, monkey-hear, monkey-speak, attempted to replicate the
word in his own conversation. He generously added a bonus syllable, and then,
evaluating his audience by his own dim light, thoughtfully explained the meaning
of the novel word.  No doubt his audience was galvanized.

Title: What We Read in the Fifties:  H. M. Pulham, Esquire
Date: December 09, 2005

I re-read J. P. Marquand's H. M. Pulham, Esquire, which was published in 1940
and was still widely read during the 50s. It's disappointing that the new novel
repeats so much of The Late George Apley. Pulham is a mock autobiography,
and once again Marquand satirizes social norms by using the device of the dim
narrator (in this case Harry himself). Pulham is an upper-class Bostonian who
should have married the enterprising and highly sexual Marvin (sic) Myles
(played by Hedy Lamarr!!! in the King Vidor film version) but instead finds
himself fastened to a whiny woman of his own set. He's stuck in an unrewarding
job, his children dislike him, and he clings so blindly to respectability that
he cannot see that his dear Kay is sleeping with his best friend. It couldn't
happen because "Bill King is a gentleman." There's much about the suffocating
miasma of Boston society, but also a pointed critique of the only alternative
that's offered -- the hollow world of New York advertising. It's a post WWI
novel, and Harry served in combat, but he can't seem to leverage the lessons of
the war to free him from his Bostonianism.

Re-reading brought to mind that the buzzword of the 1950s was "conformity." It
was an age of mass-produced housing, the routinizing of jobs, and of the ascent
of mass advertising. So far, the two Marquand novels that I have read have both
taken conformity and the failed resistance to conformity as theme. Next up:
Point of No Return. I'm curious to discover whether Marquand repeats himself
again or whether he tackles other aspects of American culture. He certainly
knows how to tell a story.

Title: Thing Is
Date: December 10, 2005

Here are two consecutive sentences written by Neill Woelk, a writer for
the Boulder Daily Camera. They appeared in today's paper. "Simply, if Bohn
decides to leave for another job, CU should be fairly compensated. Thing is,
Bohn doesn't have a contract yet." My questions: is "thing is" an acceptable
substitute for "moreover," or "the point is that"? and b) if it is, when did it
come to be so? To my ear, it's lazy, substandard writing far too colloquial and
slangy even for a provincial newspaper. Our of electronic curiosity, I googled
"thing is," but 43,200,000 hits was too big a basket to sift.

I take "thing is" to be a sloppy distillation of "the thing of it is." It turns
out that "the thing of it is" is well-established in American speech. Rush
Limbaugh's a big "thing of it is" guy. On the missing weapons in Iraq, "the
thing of it is, this is a serious matter"; "thing of it is, no substantive
evidence has been offered to justify any of this." So is Pat Robertson. In
answer to the question, "is it possible to receive a specific answer to a prayer
directly from the Scriptures, Pat hedges:  "Well, the thing of it is that you
can't force the Bible to say,`Judas hanged himself; go thou and do likewise.'
" So too, surprisingly, is the supposedly erudite William F. Buckley: "Now
the thing of it is, we don't know — and we won't accumulate this knowledge,
without experience...." But it's not only a right-wing locution. Here's Robert
Frost, in 1915 (in "A Servant to Servants"): "Bless you, of course, you're
keeping me from work,/ But the thing of it is, I need to be kept." And it's
older: Bret Harte also used the expression.

I can't track "thing is."  It's well established in speech, but it ought to be
beneath the dignity of a morning paper. Can anyone comment on the history of
"thing is?" I suspect (without evidence) that it's rural in origin.

Title: What We Read in the Fifties:  Point of No Return
Date: December 13, 2005

Still another novel by John Phillips Marquand, this time Point of No Return, a
great big book (550 pages) that's too long by half. A blockbuster, I think, in
its day -- 1947 -- but disappointing to re-read after fifty or so years. Just as
in Marquand's earlier novels, the central figure, Charles Gray, feels himself
bound down like Gulliver among the Lilliputians. The many ropes are the social
ties that connect him, not this time to Boston, but to a small Massachusetts
seafaring town which Marquand calls Clyde but which is most likely modeled after
the Newburyport of the author's own childhood. Charles is deeply in love with
Jessica Lovell, who's a step above him in the social ladder (everything would
have been just fine if he had been born one street over and had gone to Harvard
instead of (gasp!) Dartmouth), but the marriage is blocked by Jessica's scheming
dad, and Charles escapes to New York, where he marries a sensible, no-nonsense
kind of gal with whom he subsists in something that more resembles a partnership
than a romance. He finds work with the Stuyvesant Bank, and the plot revolves
around two suspenseful topics: a) will Charles be promoted to vice-president of
the bank, and b) (more important to me) what will be the outcome when Charles
returns to Clyde and meets Jessica after a twenty-year absence. I read this
very long novel waiting for the climactic interview between the long-separated
lovers, and I felt cheated when Marquand dodged what I felt ought to have been
the novel's resolution. It would have been an opportunity for fine writing
and a proper resolution to the novel. Instead, I was forced to settle for an
anti- climax: Charles makes V.-P. Nor is his promotion reported ironically, as
it might or should have been-- Charles gets his promotion, but then comes to
realize that he's jumped through hoops all his life and that the Stuyvesant
Bank is just another piece of equipment.  No, no. Nothing but rhetorical drums
and trumpets for his achievement. Worse yet, the long anticipated meeting with
Jessica never comes to pass.  Marquand evades the issue. Charles returns to
Clyde, meets various friends and relatives (including his doppelganger Jackie
Mason -- not the cornball pseudo-Semitic comedian, but the accountant from
Clyde) -- who's recently become engaged to Jessica, and then hightails it back
to the big city, leaving in his wake at least one very frustrated reader.

What to make of a novelist who has made a career of satirizing the stuffy,
constricted business world and who then gives us a novel in which we're expected
to rejoice because someone makes vice-president! There's always been a certain
glamor to the lonely entrepreneur, the Thomas Edison figure, puttering in his
garage and coming up with a Big Idea, struggling to find support among the
banker-skeptics, and then, against all odds, becoming rich and successful,
providing employment for untold thousands, leading Americans to a new world of
progress, etc. etc. But what in the world can be glamorous about climbing the
corporate ladder (an action, which, as Samuel Johnson said, is performed in the
same posture as creeping)?

Charles is the conformist, not one who rebels inwardly against conformity, but
one who embraces it and turns conformity into achievement. It's no wonder that
the Fifties were so oppressive.  While in The Late George Apley, Marquand
punctured social constriction, in this novel he's come around to the dark side.

Not only that -- the linguistic surface of the novel is bland. There's no style
-- just serviceable gray prose.There are a number of good moments: a little
flirtation -- just winks and nods -- carried on between Charles and a bored
daughter-in-law while Charles discourses on stocks and bonds that's insightfully
written and suggests that there might be a bit of distance between our hero and
his chosen profession. But it's a loose end that goes nowhere.

Is this the end of my Marquand project, or do I have the initiative to tackle
yet another big novel? Stay tuned.

Title: Bush's Knowledge of Geography
Date: December 14, 2005

Our president's knowledge of geography is famously shaky. He seems to be under
the impression that the Kingdom of Jordan is a gulf coast country, that Africa
is a nation, and that Europe is one of America's key allies. On being shown a
map of South America, he said, to the president of that continent's largest
country, "Wow, Brazil is big." Perhaps he merely misspoke when he said that
"border relations between Canada and Mexico have never been better," but you
never know, do you?

Iraq is a large country -- over 170,000 square miles. It's larger than
California and two-thirds the size of Texas. In population it's just about the
same as Texas-- about 22,000,000 people. Does our president know these facts? 
Did he know them when he decided to invade and occupy Iraq?  Did anyone on the
diplomatic side say to him: Iraq is comparable in size and population to Texas.
Imagine that Texas was invaded and occupied by Iraqis who overthrew a native
Texan dictator and tried to replace him with a sharia-based government. How
would Texans respond?  Will it be a cakewalk?  Will Texans throw flowers at
the Iraqi soldiers?  Or will they, possibly, make a bit of a fuss?"

Title: Flower Names
Date: December 17, 2005

When I was a just a young sprout, every summer I would grow, from seed, in my
father's crowded backyard garden, a small plot of snapdragons. Inasmuch as I
had, or seemed to have in those years, endless time, I became a connoisseur of
the plant's growth habit: its elongated long smooth leaves with their pastel
undersides, its spikes of buds, opening from bottom to top, its varied colors,
and especially its unusual flower. I'd watch the bees lift the "dragon's"
jaw, squeeze inside, sometimes to temporarily trap themselves within. As much
as loved the flower, I think I loved its name even more. "Snapdragon"-- a
euphonious, crunchy, satisfying, evocative sound -- scary too, but how can a
flower be scary?

I recently opened the first of this year's seed catalogs to find the favorite
flower of my springtime listed as "antirrhinum." The scientific name is not
inaccurate -- it's Latinized Greek for "snoutlike" -- but I have to say that
antirrhinum is not a word that sings to me. It sounds less like a border annual
than a cold remedy..

The modern plant breeders, intent on appearing to be learned and scientific,
have gone too far. I want the old names back. Not lathyrus, but sweet pea;
not achillea, but yarrow; not dianthus barbatus, but sweet William; not
calendula, but marigold. Let us even do away with the almost naturalized name
of delphinium; bring back the larkspur. Not veronica, but speedwell. I want
a garden that's filled with stocks, lilies of the valley (not convallaria),
loosestrife (the yellow variety, not the invasive purple), love lies bleeding,
love-in-a-mist, marguerites, brushwood.

I make one exception: liverwort. Not that anyone would want to grow it, but just
in case. In fact, I banish all flower names that contain the element "wort." In
my garden, spiderwort grows under the name tradescantia. (Tradescantia, poor
thing, has a second and equally unacceptable name: cow slobber.)

Am I alone in this preference?  Not a bit.  I'm in the best company. In the
noblest poem in the English language, John Milton lists the flowers that "strew
the laureate hearse" of the dead poet Lycidas. ("Rathe" means "early"-- it
survives in "rather," which used to mean "earlier";  "freaked" is "streaked.")

Bring the rathe primrose, which forsaken dies,

The tufted crow-toe, and pale jessamine;

The white pink, and the pansy freaked with jet,

The glowing violet,

The musk-rose, and the well-attired woodbine,

With cowslips wan that hang the pensive head.

It's a great swelling litany. Savor again the music of that lovely last line:
"With cowslips wan that hang the pensive head." Instead of cowslip, Milton
might have written "primula veris, family primulaceae," but he was too smart to
do so. Words like cowslip, lady's mantle, goldenrod, forget-me-not, and, yea,
snapdragon live and breathe and are laden with metaphorical perfume. Cowslips
hang their heads; primula, like antirrhinum, have no heads to hang. Moreover,
if Milton had been looking about for alternatives for the cowslip, he would
not have consulted the plant breeders but returned to popular lore and he
would have chosen from such tasty words (alternatives all to cowslip) as herb
peter, peggle, key of heaven, fairy cups, mayflower, lady's keys-- all of which
are human, humane, and evocative. But John Milton, who exhorted "daffodillies
to fill their cups with tears," had an ear, and I can therefore affirm with
absolute, unimpeachable, and total confidence that he would have rejected with
horror another synonym for the common cowslip: the palsywort.

Title: "Crosspatch, draw the latch" and Industrial Capitalism
Date: December 18, 2005

One of the most joyful of nursery rhymes, and a personal favorite, is this:

Crosspatch,

Draw the latch.

Sit by the fire and spin.

Take a cup,

And drink it up.

Then call the neighbors in.

The clicky rhymes and jaunty meter are undeniably beautiful -- and there's much
more meaning than poems of this kind usually contain.

In the first triad, a "crosspatch," -- a "cross or ill-tempered person, usually
a girl or woman" -- is at work, spinning. In the second triad, she's exhorted to
drink and also to invite her neighbors "in" -- presumably into the room, or just
as likely, the tiny cottage -- where she lives alone. In the first strophe, the
theme is isolation, but in the second, isolation is challenged by the calls of
society and by the hope of a more satisfactory and convivial life.

What can we know or imagine about the surly individual addressed by the
evocative designation, "crosspatch?"  The first element in the name --"cross"--
implies not only sourness, but also resistance, as in "cross-grained." The
second element -- "patch" -- suggests that the crosspatch's discontent is
not without cause. We can infer that she's poor because she's a person
whose garments are either assembled from various rescued materials, as in
"patchwork," or that her clothes are, in another sense of the word patch,
repaired. In addition, it's possible that ill health has caused her skin to
become "patchy."  But "patch" also signals a degree of mental stress, as in
Shakespeare's "patched fool." In this signification, patch derives from Italian
pazzo, crazy. The crosspatch is therefore disabled physically, socially and
psychologically.

At the outset of the poem, our "crosspatch" sits glowering, impoverished,
perhaps muttering indistinctly, friendless, without family, her youth blighted
by poverty, huddled against the last embers of her dying fire. What is it
that she is spinning? No doubt she ekes out a meager living in the impersonal
mercantilist "putting-out" system. Some exploitative proto-capitalist venturer
has delivered to her lonely door a quantity of unspun wool or cotton;  her job
is to return the material to him in the processed form that will then be passed
on to an equally poor weaver, then to a tailor, etc. She works alone and never
sees the fruits of her labor except for the occasional, paltry farthing that
allows her a bare subsistence. No wonder she is slightly barmy and has "drawn
the latch" -- closed herself off from her fellows. But then, suddenly, comes
the antistrophe, and in a series of importunate injunctives the crosspatch is
asked to rejoin the company of humanity. "Take a cup,/ And drink it up,/ Then
call the neighbors in."  What's in the cup?  Spiritous liquors, no doubt,
which, though designed to dull the pain of wage-slavery, also act to augment the
revelry with which the poem climaxes. The wine is not sipped, but it is drained
to the lees. And once the door is unlatched, and the neighbors -- neighbors of
both sexes, no doubt -- are called "in," why then, let the libations and the
wild rumpus begin! Alienated labor is suddenly set aside and replaced by the
natural bonds of one human being to another, and the stasis of the opening lines
of the poem transforms in a flash into a wildly kinetic bacchanal. Emotional
weakness transmutes into healthy liberated pleasure. Dour Puritanism, with its
punishing work ethic, yields to the spirit of holiday and to pagan, perhaps even
dionysian, excess. Here, in miniature, is the essence of the comic vision. In
a few powerful lines, freedom, good humor, and natural appetite triumph over
bondage, artificiality, social constriction and repression; the justifiably
sullen crosspatch, in a burst of energy, reintegrates herself into the social
nexus from which she has been banished.

Whether or not the crosspatch can permanently liberate herself from the
oppressions of industrial capitalism, or whether the anodyne and spurious relief
of alcohol is a merely transient solution is left unresolved. To ask a short
poem, however dense with meaning, to answer so difficult a question would, just
possibly, be to ask too much of it and, perhaps, to push the evidence the merest
tad too far.

Title: What We Read in the Fifties:  The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit
Date: December 23, 2005

Sloan Wilson's 1955 best-seller is saturated with alcohol. Nary a character can
carry on a conversation without first mixing a highball, a scotch, a manhattan,
or a batch of martinis. "Let's have a drink" is the lubricant without which the
novel couldn't proceed. In The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit, the characters
not only drink like fishes but they also smoke like chimneys. There's not a
social interaction that isn't punctuated with lighting up, puffing, flicking,
extinguishing. But the use of alcohol and tobacco do not pose moral challenges;
they're just there, like food and water, and do not become issues for either the
characters or the author. Were the 50s so rich in nicotine?  I think they must
have been: our house, like everyone else's, was a thick blue haze. Between my
mother's cigarettes and my father's pipes and cigars, I must have inhaled many
lifetimes worth of second-hand smoke during my childhood. On the other hand, we
departed from the norm in that we were not spiritous. While there was always a
bottle of something or other on hand to offer to the very occasional guest, I
never once noticed either of my parents drink liquor, or beer or wine for that
matter, unprompted. Omnipresent alcohol, or rather the manners that surround its
consumption, dates The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit. Right there, in the middle
of the Beat Generation, is an old-fashioned Bourbon Generation novel.

The "gray flannel" of the title refers to the ubiquitous 50s costume of the
upwardly mobile. I re-read the novel, which I remembered more from the Gregory
Peck-Jennifer Jones epic than from the book, with the expectation that it would
be another Marquand-like story of conformity and thwarted rebellion among the
aspiring execs. In truth there is some of that, for Tom Rath, the central
figure, is for a while caught up in corporate climbing. But the button-down
world is not as vividly realized as is the prevailing suburban angst. Basically,
the novel is a story of a marriage that's lost its juice. Rath, a good man but
one who's become extremely cautious and tightly-wound, had been a paratrooper
who dropped behind enemy lines in Europe and in the Pacific. He's killed
seventeen men, most with his bare hands -- one an eighteen-year-old, and one
(accidentally) his best friend -- but he's never been able to tell his wife
Betsy about the war and about the way the war altered his values. In the last
chapter he finally breaks through the barrier, but only because he has to admit
to Betsy that, while waiting to be shipped from the European to the Pacific
theater, he lived with and fathered a child with a Roman "soldier's girl." Rath
asks a very good question -- why is it that he's not ashamed to have killed,
but he is ashamed to have loved. Rath's revelations are the heart of the novel,
but they're given curiously short shrift (as though Sloan Wilson unconsciously
allies himself Tom Rath's impulse to suppress the truth).

I think the book was so popular because it must have helped to purge some of
the psychological traumas of the war. It's a moderately good story written in
moderately bad prose.

It was sad to read Sloan Wilson's obituary (he died in 2002) and discover that
he was an alcoholic for much of his life.

Title: The Caucasus; Hadji Murad
Date: December 24, 2005

When I read Neal Ascherson's Black Sea, I had to admit that I knew nothing at
all about a huge and contested part of the world. I followed up on Ascherson's
bibliography and read a series of ethnographic studies of ancient Black Sea
peoples -- Scythians, Sarmatians, etc. -- and from there moved eastward to the
Caucasus and leaned about the Abkhazians, the Ossetians, the Chechens, etc.
Yesterday I finished Nicholas Griffin's Caucasus (2001), which is half travel
book and half a biography of Imam Shamil. Shamil, of whom I also knew zero until
a few days ago, is the legendary Avar guerrilla leader who led the opposition to
the Russian conquest of the mountains in the mid-nineteenth century. He's the
national hero of the Chechens, and is a compound of Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse,
and Geronimo-- with a little Islamic fervor added in. The Russians conquered
the Caucasus with a combination of overwhelming force, superior technology,
and ruthlessness: they systematically obliterated villages, murdered as many
civilians as possible, and when all else failed, cut to the ground the primeval
beech forests -- defoliation not then an option -- in which Shamil and his
Murids found refuge.

Reading about Shamil led me to Hadji Murad -- Tolstoy's extraordinary last novel
and one in which Shamil is a minor character. In 150 pages or so, Hadji Murad
says as much about the brutality, the stupidity, and the vanity of war as War
and Peace says in ten times as many pages. Tolstoy, who had soldiered in the
Caucasus, wrote in his diary (according to Griffin) that the war was "so ugly
and unjust that anybody who wages it has to stifle the voice of his conscience."
Hadji Murad is a charismatic leader who's involved in a foolish feud with
Shamil; he surrenders to the Russians, tries to escape, and is killed and
beheaded. That's the plot, but the genius is in the telling. After recounting
an atrocity in which the Russians, in sport, destroy a small settlement, ruin
the crops, and bayonet a small child, Tolstoy describes the feelings of the
remaining villagers as they set about the hopeless task of rebuilding: "It was
not hatred, because they did not regard those Russian dogs as human beings,
but it was such repulsion, disgust and perplexity at the senseless cruelty of
these creatures, that the desire to exterminate them  -- like the desire to
exterminate rats, poisonous spiders, or wolves  -- was as natural an instinct
as that of self-preservation." Tolstoy is disgusted by the Russian actions, but
he's equally repelled by the brutal mountaineers, and he goes out of his way
to draw parallels between the utterly cruel Imam Shamil and the fat, ignorant,
vainglorious Nicholas, the Czar of All the Russians.

In the nineteenth century, the Russians cut down the forests; in 1999, they
conquered Grozhny (the capitol of Chechnya) by dynamiting every significant
building in the entire city.

Title: What We Read in the Fifties:  Women and Thomas Harrow
Date: December 28, 2005

Women and Thomas Harrow was John P. Marquand's last novel. It was published in
1958; Marquand (born in 1893) died in 1960. It's another good but not great
book. Despite the witty surface, it's very sad. Thomas Harrow (clearly a
surrogate for Marquand himself) is a successful but not brilliant playwright;
in the course of the novel, he comes to realize that he's squandered his talent
and made a mess of his personal relationships. The last line of Women and Thomas
Harrow: "In the end, no matter how many were in the car, you always drove
alone."

I'm still trying to figure out why my father thought so well of the novels of
John Phillips Marquand. For one thing, Pop was clearly in tune with the author's
relentless anti-modernism. In form, Marquand's novels are Victorian. There's
no experimentation, nothing unusual or original in content or presentation.
Moreover, in all the novels, not a landscape but has been destroyed, not a
custom but has deteriorated, not a value but has been compromised. The modern
world in Marquand's view has become too subject to analysis, too Freudified.
Sometimes Harrow employs, with some resistance, the exact words that I heard
without irony from my father's mouth: "No one could escape from convention for
long....  It was advisable to accept the mores of one's time, no matter if they
shifted. It was better to be in tune... with the beat of marching music."  No
dancing to a different drummer either in Marquand or in my father.

Title: Otto Preminger's Laura (1944)
Date: December 28, 2005

Laura is a stylish noir whodunit that holds up well even after the passage of
sixty years. It is cleverly written and handsomely cinematographed but it also
comes with some murky psychological baggage that may or may not make sense. At
the heart of the enigma is Waldo Lydecker (played by Clifton Webb). He's so
head-over-heels in love and so ferociously jealous of Laura (the ingenue Gene
Tierney) that he'll resort to anything, even murder, to keep her from other
men. The premise is good whodunit fare, but it would make more obvious sense if
Lydecker weren't both old and gay.

Clifton Webb was fifty-five when the picture was made, but he looks and acts
ten or fifteen years older. He may be a bachelor, but he's not an eligible one.
There's a rumor that Webb had a clause in his contract with Twentieth-Century
Fox that barred the company from alluding to his homosexuality, but the
prohibition, if it existed, didn't stop him from playing Lydecker with a
pronounced gay affect. He's fussy, he's bitchy, he's a queen -- in short a stage
homosexual in every aspect except that he's not obviously interested in men.
(Well, almost never;  he does expose himself to the detective Mark McPherson
[Dana Andrews] when he steps out of the bathtub and asks McPherson to throw him
a robe.)

One clue to Lydecker's character occurs in the first scene. He's spying on the
detective, who's wandering around Lydecker's apartment, browsing an extensive
collection of fragile objets d'art. McPherson goes to pick up a piece of glass
and Lydecker calls out "Careful, that's very valuable" (I'm quoting from
memory). From this incident we learn two things: Lydecker is a collector of
beautiful works of art, and he's willing to let people look but not touch. This
same attitude controls his relations to Laura: he cherishes her beauty, he
molds her in a Pygmalion-like way, but he's also hyper-protective. For him, she
becomes an untouchable work of art (the portrait of Laura, on which the camera
focuses so obsessively, is the metaphorical signifier of her place in his mental
world). His cool sexuality (he's perfectly content with twice-a-week dinners)
and his age (he's more interested in fathering Laura than in making love to her)
are less significant than his pygmalionism.

By transforming Laura into a work of art, he attempts to preserve her virginity.
He therefore shoos away her potential lovers: he destroys the career of Jacoby,
the painter, by writing a vitriolic attack on him; he collects revealing
information about the southern gigolo Carpenter (Vincent Price), and he competes
with McPherson. It's a neat turn that to do so he becomes a detective himself
-- loitering in the snow outside Laura's apartment, eavesdropping behind a post
in a night club, etc. Eventually he comes to understand that he can't preserve
Laura's "purity;" it's then that the film turns to violence. After all is lost,
he gives away the game when he says to McPherson, with horror, "I suppose you'll
have a disgustingly earthy relationship" [i.e. with Laura].

It's fascinating that McPherson, though he has all the outward marks of the
macho gumshoe, is himself tepid about sexuality, lacks charisma and emotion, and
that the film allows him and Laura only one slight awkward peck of a kiss.The
detective is not a creature of passion, but he may be, like Lydecker, a lover of
art; it's revealed that Laura's portrait will be auctioned and that McPherson
has put in a bid on it.

Title: What We Read in the Fifties:  Blackboard Jungle
Date: January 01, 2006

In Blackboard Jungle, neither the author Evan Hunter, nor his lead character
Richard Dadier, who recently started to work at North Manual Trades High School,
can keep their eyes off teacher Lois Hammond's "full and rounded breasts."
She's so "busty" and "big-breasted" that every time she so much as shrugs her
shoulders, both Hunter and Dadier continually focus on the way that "her breasts
move." These remarkable bazooms are at some times concealed by a blouse that is
"thin nylon" and at other times by one that is "peekaboo." There are occasions
when the Hammond breasts are enhanced by "the delicate lace of her slip and the
slender straps of her brassiere," and other times when the "firm abundant cones
of her breasts [are] caught tight in a white cotton bra." But whether enhanced
or restrained, not only the "thrust of her brassiere," but even more so "the
obvious thrust of her breasts" are under constant scrutiny. After an inadvertent
sighting, Hunter and Dadier are able to report that one of these breasts (it
isn't specified whether the left or the right) is "a youthful breast, firm, with
a nipple large and erect."

It is dispiriting to recall that for high school students in the 1950s, this
romance-novel twaddle seemed like a breakthrough in the direction of realism.
But consider the context: in the novels that were read in Erasmus Hall English
classes, none of the heroines (Eppie, Rebecca and Rowena, Lucy Manette) had
any breasts at all, or at least, none that came to the attention of author
or reader. The Blackboard Jungle seemed to be frank, honest, down-to-earth,
and it was recognized in the schoolyard-and-drugstore culture of mid-century
adolescents as a "hot" book, and along with The Amboy Dukes and Forever Amber
was passed in cheap paperback editions from hand to sweaty hand. It reflected
a reality (bad language, sexual urgency, near-anarchic disorder, gratuitous
cruelty) far more present and immediate than did our 'official' reading.

Returning after all these years to Blackboard Jungle has been a sad revelation.
As a work of literature, it's piss-poor. The tough-guy prose aims to be hard-
boiled, but it's undercooked ("the boys in the class considered English a
senseless waste of time, a headless chicken, a blob without a goal"). The story
is padded with interminable didactic digressions, and many of its episodes are
either woefully overwrought or just simply meretricious -- Dadier's infant son,
for example, is stillborn for no earthly reason except to squeeze a sob from the
reader.

Nevertheless, and in spite of its amateurism, it's still a disturbing
book. Blackboard Jungle covers the first four months of Dadier's teaching
career: in the course of one melodramatic semester, he prevents the rape of a
fellow teacher, he's attacked and beaten on the street by a gang of students,
and he's slashed in a knife-fight in his own classroom. So much violence in
so short a period of time seems to be beyond belief. Does it accord with the
facts?  Wasn't it the case that the local bully-boy, Herbie W.,, attacked
Mr. Proshan, our seventh-grade social studies teacher and wrestled him to
the classroom floor?  Didn't the gang leader Runzi Marfeta terrorize the
schoolyard? Weren't there fights outside the Bedford Arch almost daily? Wasn't
it the case that every tenth student wore a "garrison belt," the three-inch
buckle of which was ground razor-sharp, just in case? It was the heyday of
"juvenile delinquents" and zip-guns and gravity knives and gang fights, and in
many of my classrooms the out-of-control ambience was established and sustained
by the psychopaths and sociopaths among whom I was educated. And isn't it also
the case that Blackboard Jungle doesn't even tell the whole truth but is a
sanitized version of real life? There's not a single mention of drunkenness,
of heroin and other widely-used drugs, of accidental pregnancy and illegal
abortion, or even of what used to be called, euphemistically, "broken homes."

Almost entirely anti-nostalgic, the novel did nevertheless provoke an occasional
smile: Delaney cards, "official class," "daddy-o," street corner harmonizers.
There's also one very brilliant comic touch in Blackboard Jungle. At North
Manual Trades High School, there's a men's teacher's lounge in which Richard
Dadier seems to pass a lot of his time, smoking. In the lounge is a couch, and
on the couch is a man -- a teacher -- lying prone, his face concealed. He's
asleep at the beginning of the novel, and he's still asleep at the end; Dadier
never sees his face and never learns who he is or what subject he's supposed
to be teaching. It's an exquisite metaphor for an exhausted and overwhelmed
educational establishment. Blackboard Jungle is a bad book, but Evan Hunter
earned his place in the story by bringing the scandal of high schools like North
Manual Trades to public attention.

Title: One of the Only
Date: January 01, 2006

Call me prescriptive, but the all too common phrase "one of the only" offends
both ear and logic. What does it mean to say that "the $11 billion Crusader
artillery rocket system is one of the only weapons systems canceled by the Bush
administration?" If it's the "only" cancellation, say so. If it's "one of the
few," or even, one of "very few," why then, let's just go ahead and say that.
"One of the only" is an unpleasant and chilling redundancy -- it means no more
than "one of the one."  What's wrong with the word "only" that it needs help?
 Isn't "only" only enough?  Perhaps "only" is wearing out, and "onliest" --
now confined to rural or comic speech -- will someday replace it. Onliest has
the appearance of a superlative, but, logically speaking, "only" can't have a
superlative. But logic, as we know, doesn't always govern the path of language.
Redundancies and illogicalities abound, and awkward formulations such as "one of
the only" aren't all that very one-of-a-kind singly unique.

Title: The Replacement Child:  Juliet
Date: January 06, 2006

In the narrowest definition, a "replacement child" is a being who is
intentionally conceived because an older sibling has recently died. Such
substitutes must endure the lifetime burden of competing with a lost and often
idealized child. Because it is almost impossible for them to please their
parents, they easily become confused and frustrated, or worse.

Here's a dry summary from a learned journal: "When bereaved parents give birth
to a child or children subsequent to a perinatal death, their constructions
of the family necessarily change. The subsequent child is thought to be at
risk of psychopathology (the replacement child syndrome) if parents have
not sufficiently grieved their losses."  "At risk of psychopathology" is a
hesitant, euphemistic formulation.

The term "replacement child" has also been defined more broadly: it may, for
example, refer to any child in a family that has lost one or more of its
offspring (rather than solely to one conceived as a direct consequence of a
death). In an even larger sense of the term, there are all kinds of 'symbolic'
replacements: one psychologist has gone so far as to suggest that any Jewish
child born after the European holocaust should be so considered. This idea seems
extreme.

In pre-industrial societies, replacement children received no particular notice
because infant deaths were so very commonplace. While there must be many
replacement children in traditional literature, the earliest who comes to mind
is Juliet in Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, which was written in 1595.

Juliet's biological mother is aloof and distant, but she has a second and more
loving parent -- her nurse -- who does much of the actual work of mothering.
The nurse has lost her own daughter, Susan, and has become wet-nurse to Juliet.
"Susan and she -- God rest all Christian souls --/Were of an age. Well, Susan is
with God;/ She was too good for me." Clearly, Shakespeare suggests, Susan has
been idealized in her natural mother's mind. The Nurse has a replacement child
in Juliet, a state of being that goes far to explain the profound bond between
surrogate mother and surrogate daughter.

It is uncharacteristic of Shakespeare to discuss the infancy of his heroines,
nor can I think of any other pre-modern work that devotes so much space to
wet- nursing or to the trauma of weaning. Although he depicts in detail the
relationship between Juliet and her nurse, Shakespeare does not seem to
anticipate or foreshadow the interest that later centuries would take in the
replacement child syndrome. Instead, he focuses on Juliet's sexual alacrity.

The nurse tells a pertinent story (and leaves us with the impression that she
has told it many times before): when Juliet had just learned to walk, she fell
and "broke her brow"-- cut her forehead, as we would say. "And then my husband
--God be with his soul,/ He was a merry man--took up the child,/ 'Yea,' quoth
he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?/ Thou wilt fall backward when thou has more
wit,/ Wilt thou not, Jule?'  And by my holidame,/ The pretty wretch left crying
and said 'ay.'"  "Falling backward" is bawdy talk for a woman's posture in
sexual intercourse. Retelling her husband's tale, the Nurse dramatizes her
expectation that when Juliet comes of age, or "has more wit," she will be eager
to fall backward. To this proposition Juliet -- "the pretty wretch"-- says
'Ay.'  Juliet's personal psychology, Shakespeare seems to hint, formed itself
to gratify the suggestions of her surrogate mother.

The vigorous sexuality that might be appropriate for the nurse's natural
daughter Susan, who would have been a servant girl, has been transferred to the
bourgeois Juliet, who, if she had followed the example of her birth mother,
would have been properly restrained, repressed, and diffident. In effect, the
nurse contrives to live her own desires through her replacement child; the
result is Juliet's sexual impetuosity and subsequent death.

William Shakespeare was born in 1564, but an older sister Joan was baptized in
1558 and another, Margaret, in 1562. Both died in infancy. The future playwright
was therefore doubly a replacement child.

There's an additional complexity in the family drama because the infants he
replaced were female. How this oddity affected his own psychological development
is open to speculation. Perhaps because he was the oldest son in a family that
had lost two daughters, he was especially cherished. Or perhaps a boy who
replaced girls developed the empathy to create complex female characters in an
English drama that, until Juliet, had limited itself strictly to one-dimensional
stereotypes.

Title: Phrasal Verbs:  Put .*.
Date: January 13, 2006

The caprice of phrasal verbs (formerly called verb-adverb combinations) came
to my conscious attention sometime in the 1950s, when I first read Mansfield
Park. Fanny Price, the heroine, is lying on a couch; her sailor brother William
cries, "Poor Fanny!... how soon she is knocked up! Why, the sport is but just
begun. I hope we shall keep it up these two hours." I was shocked. In the P. S.
217 schoolyard where I learned my English, "knocked up" had one and only one
definition: made pregnant. There could be no doubt-- especially when the meaning
of knocked up was confirmed by such transparent sexual equivocations as "sport,"
and "keep it up these two hours."  When did proper Fanny Price find time to get
herself knocked up and how could I have been so inattentive a reader as not to
notice?  And where did Jane Austen learn schoolyard slang?

How in the world was I to know that in nineteenth-century England, "knocked up "
was an innocent phrasal verb that meant "tired.                                "

Phrasal verbs are treacherous. There's nothing in the basic definitions of
either "knock" or "up" that yields tired (or pregnant either, for that matter).

I was equally confused when Othello, quelling a disturbance, commanded the
contending parties to "Put up your bright swords, for the dew will rust them."
Inasmuch as I wasn't familiar with the phrasal verb, "put up," which means
"sheathe," I guessed that "put up" meant its exact opposite -- "brandish." "Put
up" is misleading: what's "up" about sheathe?

Just as there is nothing "up" about "up", there is nothing "out" about the
"out" in "put out." The meaning that I knew was the demotic one to which my
dictionary provides the formal "to indulge in promiscuous sexual intercourse." A
woman who puts out can get herself knocked up. But "put out" has other equally
unpredictable meanings: "make an effort," for one, and "annoyed" ("I was put
out by his use of verbs") for another. Moreover, a person who's put out, can
also be "put off," or dissuaded; "put on," or deceived; "put up," or lodged;
"put up with," or tolerated; "put down," or harshly criticized. A person can
be persuasive and "put across" a point, or be insane and be "put away" in an
institution, or can be frugal and "put by" money for a rainy day; or can be
gullible and "put upon."  Phrasal verbs are exceedingly nasty little critters,
and they must drive English language learners off their collective gourds.

Next week; same time, same station: got .*.

Title: My Campaign for City Council
Date: January 16, 2006

My positions:

1)  NO DOGS WITHIN CITY LIMITS. Rationale: fatal and near-fatal dog attacks,
dog bites, barking dogs, whining dogs, ubiquitous dog "waste," dogs annoying
citizens in parks and open space, the indulgence of dog owners. But what about
seeing-eye dogs? Slippery slope, that. Sorry, no dogs (except for purposes of
vivisection).

2)  NO CHRISTMAS LIGHTS. Rationale: waste of electricity and other scarce
resources. Global warming. Bad taste.

3)  NO MUSIC WRITTEN AFTER 1897. Rationale: obvious. Why 1897? Death of
Johannes Brahms. Also, no amplified music in a motor vehicle that is audible
outside the vehicle.

4)  NO SMOKERS. Rationale: lung cancer, heart attacks, emphysema, ashes, bad
odors. Note: not "no smoking" -- "no smokers."  No going outside of city limits
to light up and then re-entering.

5)  NO IDLE CHATTER. Rationale: incontrovertible.

6)  NO VISIBLE TATTOOS. Rationale: I don't like tattoos. Why visible?  Whole-
body inspections would be intrusive.

7)  NEW ANNUAL HOLIDAY: Charles Darwin's birthday, February 12. Rationale:
uncontroversial celebration of a great thinker. I reject out of hand those
extremists who want to move the holiday to December 25. I'm a uniter, not a
divider.

My slogan:  Brilliant!  Charismatic!  Omniscient!  Hyperbolic!

Title: Words New to Me
Date: January 16, 2006

There's a small mystery in Tolstoi's Sebastopol in 1855. An officer drives "a
telyezhka, which [says Tolstoi] stands halfway between a Jewish britchka, a
Russian travelling-cart, and a basket-wagon." How in the arithmetical world can
any object be "half-way" between three different kinds of wagons? A translation
problem, let's hope. Moreover, the word "telyezhka" doesn't appear in any
of my English dictionaries. An internet search located the not very precise
definition, "baggage cart." And what the heck is a "Jewish britchka?" In
nineteenth-century Russia, did horse-drawn vehicles have religion?  Not
according Gogol in Dead Souls, where a britchka is specifically located in
terms not of ethnicity, but of class; it's a "light spring-carriage of the
sort affected by bachelors, retired lieutenant-colonels, staff-captains,
and land- owners possessed of about a hundred souls." (Is it like or unlike
a troika or a drozhky?) "Telyezhka" and "britchka" made me realize that my
notions about horse-drawn vehicles are extremely hazy, and that when I read
pre-internal- combustion novels I pay too little attention to the distinctions
that separate Jaguars from jalopies; they're all coaches to me. But surely it
makes a difference whether our hero arrives in a fly ("a horse drawn public
coach") or a trap ("a light, often sporty, two or four wheeled carriage in
which passengers sit face-to face") or a landau ("a large four-wheeled covered
carriage"). Not to mention chaise, phaeton, cabriolet, sulky, surrey, curricle,
barouche, brougham, gig, hansom, buggy, victoria, four-wheeler, and dogcart.

Also in Tolstoi's Sebastopol; frequent references to "gabions," which are
"hollow cylinders of wicker or strap-iron like a basket without a bottom which
are filled with earth and used in building fortifications." If they have no
bottoms, how are they filled?

Other words new to me: from The Return of the Native, a number of lovely
dialect words from Thomas Hardy's county of Dorset: "nunnywatch," predicament;
"stunpoll," blockhead; "gallicrow," scarecrow; "kex," the dry, hollow stem of
a plant; "knap," the summit of a small hill; "vlankers," sparks; "huffle," a
gust of wind; "fess," lively; "withywind," bindweed; "scroff," firewood debris;
"scammish," clumsy; "twanky," complaining; and, most relevantly, "spring-van," a
van "resembling a large wooden box with an arched roof that opens from behind."

Title: Sonia Green
Date: January 18, 2006

My daughter continues to urge me to write something autobiographical. To which I
reply, it’s all autobiographical. But since she wants hard news, not indirect
revelation, I offer this account of my grandmother, born Sonia Chafetz, later,
by marriage, Sonia Usilewski and finally, after a legal name change, Sonia
Green. She was born in 1884 somewhere in darkest White Russia (now called
Belarus). I have no idea exactly where, but I know that she was a distinctly
rural girl -- she loved to fish, to pick berries, to grow plants. Of her life
in the old country, I know almost nothing -– only that she was raised in a
cottage with a dirt floor and that the family brought the cow inside in the
winter to keep the place warm. I know that she didn’t have a proper bed,
and that at least for part of her childhood she slept on the mantle over the
fireplace, which sounds mighty precarious to me. She couldn’t have had much
in the way of formal education, but she did read and write Yiddish and still
understood Russian in her old age. I know this because in the late 1940s or
early 50s I would occasionally sit with her and listen to the broadcast of
debates at the United Nations (in those days there were subsequent rather than
simultaneous translations) and she would render the Russian to me, as best she
could in her halting English. She never did become fluent in the only language I
knew so our conversations were stilted and confined to utilitarian topics.

When she was young -- I’ve seen the pictures—she was dark, attractive, and
voluptuous. By the time I came to know her, when she was close to sixty, her
looks were long gone and she was disfigured by goitre and other diseases and
no doubt by the consequences of her many self-induced abortions. The family
story was that both she and Joseph were engaged to other people when they eloped
to America (my grandfather deserting from the Russian army, where he had been
drafted for the usual twenty-year term, and where his salary was a ruble every
other month). They arrived in New York in August of 1904 from Rotterdam. How
they found their way from Minsk to Rotterdam I was never told, but the Ellis
Island records report that they came through London.

My mother was born in June of the following year, or just about ten months
after her parents arrived in this country. My mother’s story was that at
first her parents had only one pair of shoes between them, so that Sonia had to
stay at home until Joseph returned from work. The family settled in Harlem; my
grandfather, who was urban and more sophisticated than Sonia, had been trained
as a pharmacist, but never found work in his field in the new world. I don’t
know what they did for a living (was he some sort of salesman?) except that for
a short time my grandparents owned a delicatessen at the corner of 4th and 10th
streets in Greenwich Village. I’ve gone to that corner many times and tried
imagine such a restaurant, but of course not a clue remains.

As far as I can guess, their marriage was uneasy. My grandfather was frequently
absent (my father once darkly hinted, “I don’t know whether it was other
women, or what”) and my grandmother frequently ill. My father also told me
that when he and mom married, he laid down a prohibition — it was in the days
when men made prohibitions -- that she wasn’t to act as intermediary between
Sonia and Joseph any longer.

I know that my mother had to leave school six weeks into the ninth grade to
care for her mother and two younger brothers. But that’s about all I was told
and there are no documents. I have a few memories: Sonia trying to teach me to
play fan-tan and five hundred rummy -– I was as bad then as I am now at card
games; Sonia planting in wooden Philadelphia cream-cheese boxes every orange or
grapefruit seed that came into her house, so that her tiny apartment had the
pleasant aroma of a hot-house; Sonia growing avocados in the winter but setting
them in my father’s garden (just around the corner from her third-floor
walk-up) in the summer. And I also remember her attempt to cure my father’s
sterile apple tree with an old-country remedy — rubbing the cut half of an
apple on the tree trunk in midwinter. I remember also stuffed cabbage, the
world's finest blintzes, and jars of apricot jam sealed with paraffin. In her
last years, Sonia lived with my parents; she had her own kitchen, a room that
had been remodeled from my former bedroom. She was weary of life and I suspect
that she died at least in part of malnutrition. I remember also that she owned a
pressed-glass ruby bowl that was always filled with hard candies. I was allowed
one candy per visit.

When Sonia died in 1971, she had no money and precious few possessions, but I
inherited the bowl. It was pretty, and I’m sorry to say that after a few years
I accidentally broke it. But it was easily replaced (it was in a popular pattern
and every second-hand store had the item for sale) and I bought one for about
$25.00. Some years afterward I broke the second one and bought another, but by
that time the price had gone up to $50.00. So, although my inheritance in cold
cash was a negative $75, I was left with grateful appreciation and many warm
memories.

Title: What We Read in the Fifties:  The Return of the Native
Date: January 24, 2006

In Thomas Hardy’s The Return of the Native (1878), Clym Yeobright and Eustacia
Vye are brimming with impetuous youthful lust. They meet at a deserted spot on
Egdon Heath -- a “vast tract of unenclosed wild” in southwestern England.
Here’s how Hardy describes their moment of passion:

“’My Eustacia.’

‘Clym dearest’

They remained long without a single utterance, for no language could reach the
level of their  condition: words were as the rusty implements of a bygone
barbarous epoch, and only to be occasionally tolerated.

‘I began to wonder why you did not come,’ said Yeobright when she had
withdrawn a little from his embrace.”

Instead of the eager hands and tongues that a modern novelist would supply,
Hardy substitutes a sentence about the inadequacies of language. Even so mild an
allusion to physical pleasure was shocking to Victorian moralists, who regularly
rebuked Hardy for ‘vulgarity.’ Hardy’s last and best novel, Jude the
Obscure, was derided as Jude the Obscene.

I myself had no idea that Hardy was a breaker of sexual taboos when I first read
The Return of the Native in 1955. During the fifty intervening years, I’ve
read almost every one of Hardy’s many books, some of them--Jude the Obscure in
particular—repeatedly and with great admiration. Why did I not revisit The
Return of the Native until this past week? The silly truth is that the novel
was required reading in English class, and inasmuch as I was an alienated and
unhappy high school student, I made it a point of honor to dislike assigned
books.

There’s also a second and more substantive reason:The Return of the Native
was truly disorienting for provincial city kids like myself simply because
so much of it turns on landscape. The novel is all about the way various
characters respond to Egdon Heath, a furze-covered “somber stretch of
rounds and hollows,” that is isolated, extensive, unchanging, brooding,
dotted with primeval pagan barrows, and populated by sheep, shepherds and
heath-croppers. To understand Hardy’s Wessex landscape,I would have had to
overcome two barriers: my appalling lack of imagination and my inexperience with
geography. Perhaps some of my classmates could visualize Egdon Heath. Many of
them came from families that owned automobiles, and had consequently voyaged
beyond city limits. They had looked upon an expanse of land larger than a
baseball field and upon feathered bipeds more exotic than the flocks of pigeons
that guanoed the steps of the Newkirk Avenue subway station.

Had I been less put off by unfamiliar scenery and less hostile to assigned
texts, I might have recognized that sparse Egdon and my crowded concrete
neighborhood had much in common. Both places were backwaters untouched by
modernity. Neither offered much in the way of education -– either individuals
who possessed any, or schools that were genuinely dedicated to providing it. My
territory, like Egdon Heath, was a place which anyone who happened to prosper,
even a little, speedily abandoned -- to the port city of Budmouth in Hardy’s
world, and to “the island,” that is, the new prosperous suburbs of Queens
and Nassau, in mine.

In the 1950s, I myself had only one big idea -- that there must be a world
elsewhere. Why then did I not sympathize with Eustacia Vye, whose sole and
only desire is to get herself away from Egdon?  She is as out of her element
treading aimlessly on the heath as I felt myself to be when I bicycled an
endless series of claustrophobic streets. More to the point, why didn’t I
identify with the reddleman Diggory Venn? Diggory lives alone in his spring-van
and wanders the heath selling reddle (a red dye used for marking sheep). If
I had been capable of reading imaginatively, I would have taken Diggory to
heart. He is Romanticism’s archetypical outsider and a character whom I
should or could have recognized as a fellow sufferer. I too was solitary,
introspective, and on a quest for knowledge, but these traits were not
understood –- as I understand them now -- as healthy questioning but instead
were stigmatized as psychological disability (“Why are you moping? Why is your
nose always in a book?”) An understanding of Diggory Venn might have lent
dignity and historical context to my private woes.

Even more to the point: there I was, awash with the imperious hormones of
adolescence, and yet unable to notice that, although reticent about gropings and
thrustings, The Return of the Native attaches enormous importance to sex. While
I was mesmerized by the superficiality of Blackboard Jungle and suchlike novels,
I somehow failed to observe that Thomas Hardy was very very serious about love
and lust, loyalty and betrayal, passion and jealousy — and that The Return of
the Native challenges its readers to acknowledge that sexuality was as dangerous
as it was redemptive. Was there a more important lesson for me to have learned?
Did my sixteen-year-old self catch the least glimmer of it? Not the slightest.

Title: What We Read in the Fifties:  The Caine Mutiny
Date: January 29, 2006

In 1951, Herman Wouk won a Pulitzer prize for The Caine Mutiny. The novel
itself was a giant best-seller and along with it came the movie with Humphrey
Bogart and also a Broadway play. It was a big 1950s literary event.

It's almost exactly fifty years since I last read the book, and it's obvious
why it was such a triumph. The Caine Mutiny is a first-rate popular novel:
it’s long but fast-paced, clearly written, literate, suspenseful, timely,
and patriotic. The characters are carefully differentiated (although they veer
toward stereotypes). It’s memorable. Parts of it were as vivid as if I had
read them five months rather than five decades ago. I imagine that anyone
who read the book, no matter how long ago, will remember “the strawberry
incident,” “old yellowstain” and especially Captain Queeg and the two
little steel balls that he rolls in his hand when he is under stress.

The Caine Mutiny is not a novel that requires sophisticated exegesis. Wouk
is heavy-handed; he has a few points to inculcate, and he doesn’t allow
his readers much wiggle room. Perhaps the lack of ambiguity accounts for the
novel's popularity. While the The Caine Mutiny raises important questions about
war and authority, it resolves them too easily. Wouk lays on the patriotism
with a trowel. Although his navy is a nasty, inefficient place, individuals
(at least American individuals) regularly rise above their institutions. Wouk
preserves the optimism about war that Tolstoy lost in the Caucasus.

The main action of the novel turns on the mutiny and on the subsequent court-
martial. There’s also an engaging secondary story that could have been
extracted from a novel by John Marquand. Willis Seward Keith is an upper-class
Princetonian whose mother opposes his romance with Marie Minotti. Marie is
Italian, Roman Catholic, working-class, unschooled, and a night-club chanteuse
to boot, and she may been to bed both with her (gasp!) Jewish agent and with
her (horrors!) saxophonist. Is it possible that Willie can free himself from
maternal authority and marry her? In the Marquand universe, he would jilt Marie,
marry Constantia de Vere Buff-Orpington of the Newport Buff-Orpingtons, and
live a respectable bland country-club (and sexless) existence. But Marquand was
a proper Bostonian born in the nineteenth century, while Wouk was the son of
Jewish immigrants who was born in the twentieth. At first, Willie Keith bows to
his mother and puts an end to his romance, but Wouk rescues him. When the U. S.
S. Caine is kamikazeed, and Keith thinks he’s going to die, he realizes that
he’s made a big mistake. He survives, writes a long, eloquent proposal of
marriage, and in the very last pages of the novel seems to have persuaded Marie
to come aboard. She's amenable and he's euphoric, but whether or not Willie and
Marie can make the marriage work is left very much in doubt.

Is it mere coincidence that my two favorite novels during adolescence were
The Caine Mutiny and Mutiny on the Bounty?  If it's not coincidental but
meaningful, what ever happened to the incipient, budding mutinous spirit?

Title: Edward Dmytryk's The Caine Mutiny (1954)
Date: January 31, 2006

In my experience, film memories are generally sharper than book memories. Film
images crowd out the words. An exception is The Caine Mutiny. I remembered
the novel very well, and I was astonished that the film version, which I saw
last night and must have seen in 1954 or thereabouts, had almost completely
evaporated from my increasingly porous mind. I thought that I remembered
something in black-and-white, but this film is in very bright colors.

Perhaps my memory faded because the movie can't hold a candle to the novel.

Some of my many reservations: a) the actors are just too darn old. The novel
is about young men, dislocated in early maturity, coming to terms with harsh new
experiences. But the sailors who are supposed to be in their early twenties were
played by Van Johnson (38), Fred MacMurray (46), and Jose Ferrer (45). Captain
Queeg, who should be about thirty years old, was Humphrey Bogart, who was 55
and looked it, and who had, in fact, been wounded in World War I. The casting
completely compromises the story and skews naive into conspiratorial. Robert
Francis, who played Willis Seward Keith, was in fact twenty-four;  because
he's so much younger than his shipmates, he looks more like their mascot than
their contemporary. B) the romance between Keith and May Wynn (Marie Minotti in
the novel), which is marginal or decorative rather than intrinsic in the novel,
occupies far too much time in the film, and considerably dilutes the tension. C)
the ship model that’s used in the typhoon scene was ludicrously inadequate.
D) the ethnic tensions that are a source of complexity in the novel are elided:
May Wynn is no longer an Italian Catholic, so it’s impossible to understand
exactly why Keith vacillates about marrying her; Barney Greenwald (the defense
lawyer) is no longer Jewish. Simpler, in this case, is not better.

It seems that the U. S. Navy wouldn’t cooperate with the project until the
writers made certain changes in the script. It would be fascinating to learn
how much of the film was censored, and for what reasons.

Title: An Overheard Conversation
Date: February 03, 2006

I was at Peet's Coffee in Alameda, California this morning, drinking hot
chocolate and reading Lord of the Flies. There were three retired guys a couple
of tables away, chatting. I overheard the following story:

"He was a lawyer for an intellectual property firm--a big-time litigator. He met
this woman and fell in love with her. She wasn't at all interested. She owned a
window-washing company. He quit his job and went to work as a window washer so
that he could be close to her."

That's as much as I heard, but I would have liked to know what happened next.
It's possible that the lawyer's perseverance was rewarded. The window-washer
lady came to understand that he loved her so much that he was willing to give up
his career to follow her. Eventually, she relented, married him, and together
they developed the biggest window-washing company in San Francisco. But then
again, perhaps she realized that he wasn't really in love -- in fact, he was
one of those obsessive stalkers that regularly appear in horror movies. So she
was forced to escape by selling her company, taking a new name, and moving to
Pocatello. He continued to wash windows, and started to specialize in eighty-
story buildings. One day, he failed to hook his belt properly and fell. No one
ever knew if it was an accident or suicide. Meanwhile she was happy in Idaho,
where she married a mild-mannered lawyer.

Or --another thought -- he forgot all about her but found that he liked washing
windows more than corporate law. But one day, he was hooked outside a skyscraper
window, and looked inside and there she was at a meeting. And he fell in love
all over again.

February 13:  I now think it most likely that he forgot all about the lady,
moved to rural Connecticut, changed his name to Seymour Glass, and became a
recluse who lived a house with very clean windows.

Title: What We Read in the Fifties:  Lord of the Flies
Date: February 06, 2006

In my daughter's basement I found a dried-up, stained, pages-hanging-out 1959
paperback edition of William Golding's Lord of the Flies. On the cover:
"Copyright 1954." "Over 4,450,000 copies in print." "Sixty-second impression."
"Now Available For Students And Teachers: the Casebook Edition  containing
the full text of the novel, critical essays, notes, and bibliography." Lord of
the Flies leaped into public prominence in the mid-1950s and quickly became a
classroom staple. A quick googling found half a dozen websites designed to help
high school students generate reports on the novel's "symbolism," etc.

I didn't like Lord of the Flies when I read it back then and it's become less
likable-- and less worthy of respect-- over the last half-century. It's a
variation on Robinson Crusoe, except that this time a score of boys land (how?
and not a one of them injured!!) on an uninhabited island in the Pacific. They
very quickly degenerate into savages, murder two of their own number, and are
hunting down the last boy who possesses a modicum of civility when a naval
officer (nauta ex machina?) arrives to take command. Lord of the Flies is a
dyspeptic, dystopian novel; it's also, according to the websites, a story of the
contest between civilization and barbarism and,-- guess what?-- it's barbarism
by a country mile.

Robinson Crusoe himself was no perfect model of psychological health, but
Defoe's story has been admired for centuries (it's the most reprinted novel in
history) at least in part because it asserts that a resourceful human being
can triumph over a bad situation. Crusoe reads his Bible, keeps a calendar and
a diary, domesticates goats, develops a working agricultural system, learns
pottery, carpentry and other crafts, and builds himself both a summer and a
winter domicile. Lord of the Flies, on the contrary, is entirely pessimistic
about human capabilities: its flat, book-less, unskilled characters devolve
rapidly into war-painted, violent tribesmen. Robinson Crusoe embodied Age of
Reason optimism; Lord of the Flies is a post-Nazi novel in which there is no
culture, government is nothing more than incipient dictatorship, and religion
deteriorates into cruel scapegoating.

Why was it imagined that Lord of the Flies had something of value to say about
about human nature? It's a sure thing that if Golding had written a novel
in which an isolated group of people behave like reborn Crusoes and work
cooperatively to tame the forest and create a communal utopia, he would have
been derided as a simpleton. No room in the Cold War inn or on the best-seller
lists or in high school curricula for optimism!

Golding arranges it so that the descent into barbarism appears to be not
circumstantial but inevitable. He banishes from his island women and therefore
any need for reciprocity in social institutions. (Violence without heterosexual
sex--just what's needed in the high school classroom!) Moreover, the boys who
land on the island are not a representative set of human beings: they are
English public school children who've already internalized poisonous notions of
hierarchy, hazing, power and class. When, at the outset, they choose a chief,
they're really selecting a head boy for whom lesser creatures will "fag." Of the
island's inhabitants, the only one with more brain than earwax is the physically
repulsive Piggy, while the only boy whose instincts are democratic is slow,
tongue-tied, and indecisive. Meanwhile, Jack, to whom Golding grants leadership
abilities, is a slick soulless demagogue. The author may appear to be impartial,
but in fact he's stacked the deck so that the emergence of a proto-fascism
appears "natural." Golding, both a student and a teacher in English public
schools, seems to think that adolescents of his own circle somehow represent
common humanity. His analysis of culture is therefore as shallow as a parking-
lot puddle. And because it's so shallow, the novel is a treasure-trove for the
kind of teaching where the identification of "symbols" substitutes for genuine
thought, or emotion, or aesthetic revelation. It's a convenient opportunity
-- a casebook -- for the kind of bad reading that has damaged generations of
students.

Golding's island abounds not in intelligence but in absurdities. Is it credible
that three or four pre-adolescent boys armed only with sharpened sticks could
a) confront a wild boar and b) actually bring down a mature sow, and that the
sow would lie still, or allow herself to be held to the ground while one of
the boys repeatedly stabs and eventually kills the animal with a penknife, and
c) that the same boys, using no other tools than the single penknife, could
quickly skin, butcher and behead the sow, and then d) cut and drive into the
ground a post stout enough on which to mount that head?  Or e) that a few boys
could dislodge and push a rock that is "as big as a tank." Or that f) there
could exist an uninhabited Pacific atoll so small that a group of boys could
systematically search every inch of it like beaters on a hunt, but yet so large
that, without experiencing much in the way of rain, it could have streams and
pools of fresh water and, in addition, g) an inexhaustible supply of wild pigs
(indigenous? feral?).

If Lord of the Flies is an allegory, then perhaps such howlers don't matter. Yet
even an allegory should not cause a reader to guffaw at inappropriate moments.

Title: Beethoven Manuscript;  Missing Shakespeare Play
Date: February 12, 2006

The latest New Yorker reports the discovery of a long-lost manuscript by
Beethoven. It's not a new piece, but an arrangement for piano, four hands, of
the composer’s “Grosse Fuge,” or “Great Fugue,” -- which is one of
the most exciting and challenging pieces of music in the known universe. The
manuscript was sold at Sotheby's in December to an unnamed buyer for $1.95
million. I know the Grosse Fuge very well in the form of a string quartet; I
would love to hear the four-hand piano version sometime soon.

The Beethoven discovery renews my hope that some day another long-lost item
will re-emerge -- the Shakespeare play that's been missing for just about four
hundred years.

In 1598, Francis Meres compiled a list of the plays of Shakespeare that were
known to him: he mentioned, among a dozen others, Shakespeare's "Loue Labors
lost, [and] his Loues labours wonne." No one gave much credence to Meres, who
was thought to have hallucinated the second play, until 1953, when a book by
Thomas Gataker called Certaine Sermons (1637) was rebound and two sheets of
paper covered with Elizabethan handwriting were discovered in the backing. The
papers were part of the ledger of an otherwise unknown stationer in Exeter and
listed the books that were in his stock in August, 1603. Among them: "marchant
of vennis," "taming of a shrew," "loves labor lost" and "loves labor won."  So
Meres was right all along; Shakespeare had in truth written a play called Love's
Labor's Won. And it had been published. But the play must have soon disappeared
because the diligent compilers of the great 1623 Folio either didn't know of it
or couldn't locate a copy.

It's possible that the play has vanished into oblivion, but it's also possible
that a copy lies in a closet, drawer or vault. The Beethoven fugue was found by
a librarian who was cleaning a cabinet at the Palmer Theological Seminary in
Wynnewood, Pennsylvania  -- how the manuscript found its way to that location
is anyone's guess. The Thomas Malory manuscript -- one of the most important
literary discoveries of the last century -- was lying unidentified in plain
sight on top of a safe in Winchester Cathedral. So it's not at all impossible
that a quarto of Love's Labor's Won still lurks somewhere, waiting.

There are some other Shakespeare items of interest (and no doubt of monetary
value) that might also resurface. There's the missing quarto zero (Q0) of The
First Part of King Henry the Fourth (only a few pages of which are known,
and then only because they were accidentally bound into a copy of a later
quarto); there's Cardenio (co-authored with John Fletcher), which was probably
Shakespeare's last effort; there might also be a fuller manuscript version of
Macbeth (the Folio play seems to have been deliberately shortened for provincial
performance).  Also of interest: the anonymous Hamlet that was written a
decade or so before Shakespeare's, and which the playwright used as the basis
of his revision. Only a single line of the earlier play has survived: the ghost
is known to have cried, as shrilly as a street-seller of oysters, "Hamlet,
revenge."

Here's the description of a project posted on a literary website by (I'm
guessing) a young Shakespeare scholar: "I want to create a comprehensive
XML schema for Shakespeare's plays, and then apply the schema in an online
prototype. The schema will conform to TEI standards where possible and
appropriate, and exceed them where necessary. Creating a DTD will not give us
the versatility we want, so we have moved to a schema instead."

Title: Reading Proust to the Grandchildren
Date: February 18, 2006

We were in California tending the grandchildren (a girl, 6, and a boy, 4) while
"the daughter" and her husband were on a sun-and-sand vacation down in Baja. The
children are in the habit of coming into their parents'  bed when they have
trouble going to sleep. We're in the habit of reading aloud before putting out
the lights. At present, I'm reading Swann's Way. One night, the children, as is
their custom, came in to snuggle. After they settled down, I resumed reading:
"I was not quite Bergotte's only admirer; he was also the favorite writer of a
friend of my mother's, a very well read woman, while Dr. du Boulbon would keep
his patients waiting as he read Bergotte's most recent book; and it was from
his consulting room, and from a park near Combray, that some of the first seeds
of that predilection for Bergotte took flight...." The children fell almost
immediately to sleep; Proust's undiagrammable sentences were too much for them.

The next night, same scenario. We're in bed. The children came in to snuggle;
they thrashed about for a few moments, giggled, eventually settled down.
I picked up Monsieur Proust. "To Mme. Verdurin's great surprise, Swann
never abandoned them. He went to meet them wherever they were, sometimes in
restaurants in the outlying districts where no went went much yet, because it
was not the season, more often to the theater, which Mme. Verdurin liked very
much;  and because one day, at her house, she said in his presence that on
evenings when there were premieres, or galas, a pass would have been useful
to them, that it had inconvenienced them very much not to have one the day of
Gambetta's funeral...."  And then, the young lady looked at the young man, and
he looked at her, and without a word, the two of them rose from our bed and
padded back to their own room.

Literary criticism in its most elemental manifestation.

Title: Alien Abductions and Other Irrationalities
Date: February 18, 2006

In Abducted:  How People Come to Believe They Were Abducted by Aliens (Harvard,
2005), Susan Clancy recounts interviews with fifty or so "abductees." Each
person's experience is unique, but the various stories can be melded into a
composite narrative. "I was having problems with anxiety and depression. I was
at Fenway Park with my buddies watching a game. The next thing I remember, I
was on Mission Hill and it was five in the morning. I was always interested in
science fiction. I read Communion; I saw E. T and Close Encounters. I went to a
hypnotist, and memories started flooding back. I started sobbing uncontrollably.
They were long and tall, with huge black eyes that went around their heads. I
remembered them fastening a device like a suction cup to my genitals to suck out
the sperm painfully. They inserted a foot-long tube into my nostril. I know it
happened because I get nosebleeds. My dad thinks it's a transmitter they put in
there.  They've programmed other memories to disappear. Until I experienced the
aliens, life was empty, meaningless. Now that I have my memories, I understand
everything. What happened to me was overwhelming. It was real. I can't explain--
I felt it. I was changed from the person that I was.  It was the most positive
event of my life. It helped me to see life as beautiful, as a gift."

Alien abductees may hold to false beliefs, but they have powerful faith. Clancy
reports that once, at a convention of abductees, she tried to talk about the
unreliability of anecdotal evidence, the fragility of memory, the nature of
the sleep-paralysis syndrome, the creation of false memories under hypnosis,
Occam's Razor (the employment of the most economical hypothesis to explain a
phenomenon), etc. According to Clancy, there was a long silence, and then one of
the participants said, "tell her about the metallic tube that came out of Jim's
nose, the one that went down the sink before you both could catch it."

Eventually Clancy brings herself to discuss the obvious parallel of abduction
to religion, which, she says, she is reluctant to do because she has "about a
thousand Irish Catholic relatives [she] doesn't want to offend." Nevertheless,
she concludes that "alien-abduction beliefs can be considered a type of
religious creed, based on faith, not facts." Kind to her extended family, Clancy
does pursue the argument to the next logical step: that ordinary, accepted
beliefs of supernatural intervention in human affairs are exactly as credible --
no more, no less -- as belief in macrocephalic waifs with black wraparound eyes
who stick needles into your navel to produce hybrid children.

She also reports that one of her informants, when challenged, responded, "I
trust my gut and my gut says aliens." Is there a better argument for listening
not to our guts but to our brains?

Title: Reduplicatives
Date: February 22, 2006

Reduplicatives, sometimes called "echo words," or "echo phrases" are
formulations such as hobnob, pell-mell, herky-jerky, hoity-toity, itsy-bitsy,
niminy-piminy.

In English, there are two principal classes of reduplicatives. Category one
consists of rhymes such as hodge-podge, willy-nilly, helter-skelter, kowtow,
harum-scarum, jeepers-creepers, okey-dokey, heebie-jeebie, gang-bang, hocus-
pocus (reputed to derive from the words of the Latin mass:  hoc est corpus
meum);  the second category contains words that are formed by ablaut or vowel
shift, such as ping-pong, shilly-shally, zig-zag, bibble-babble, pitter-patter,
splish-splash, flim-flam.

There are also some lovely oddities that resist classification: dipsy-doodle,
topsy-turvey, hunky-dory, tilly-valley, and, at the outer limit, hullabaloo.

Of the hundreds (perhaps thousands) of reduplicatives, almost all are comprised
of one or two syllables, but there are occasional threes: higgledy-piggledy,
jiggery-pokery. To the best of my knowledge, there are no four-syllable
reduplicatives.

Many are diminutives or are dismissive: hanky-panky, namby-pamby, claptrap,
mumbo-jumbo.

The language continues to generate reduplicatives. Some now common
reduplicatives were unknown to my youth: Maui-wowie, boob-tube, creature-feature
(a horror movie), fender-bender, gender-bender, chick-flick, AC-DC, fag-hag,
chop-shop (a place where stolen cars are cut into parts), brain-drain, artsy-
fartsy.

But reduplicatives are as old as the language. Shakespeare, who was fond of
reduplicatives, used them not just for comic effect, but at critical dramatic
moments. Some well-known examples: the weird sisters in Macbeth will meet again
"When the hurly-burly's done,/ When the battle's lost and won." "Hurly-burly"
signals the sisters' contempt for human effort. In Hamlet, Claudius admits that
it was a mistake to bury Polonius in secret haste: "we have done but greenly/ In
hugger-mugger to inter him."  The Catholic Hotspur (in The First Part of King
Henry the Fourth) complains that the great pagan magician Glendower speaks "such
a deal of skimble-skamble stuff/ As puts me from my faith."  A less famous but
still wonderful reduplicative appears in All's Well That Ends Well, where the
braggart soldier Parolles argues in purple pentameters that his young master
Bertram should abandon his bride and go the wars:  "He wears his honor in a
box unseen,/ That hugs his kicky-wicky here at home,/Spending his manly marrow
in her arms,/ Which should sustain the bound and high curvet/ Of Mar's fiery
steed."  The rare "kicky-wicky," which some derive from French quelque chose,
is brutally insulting.

Three men come into a restaurant: one is from Walla-Walla, one from Pago-Pago,
and one from Ryukyu. They order cous-cous, mahi-mahi, and a kiwi salad. They ask
the mu-mu clad waitress (who suffers from beri-beri) about the quality of the
food. In some versions of this edifying story, she replies, "So-so."  What else
might she have said?

Title: What We Read in the Fifties:  The Catcher in the Rye
Date: February 22, 2006

J. D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye is an anti-bildungsroman -- a "novel of
education" without the least shred of moral, intellectual, or spiritual growth.
Holden Caulfield, the novel's naive yet jaded narrator, learns absolutely
nothing either about himself or about life. Unable to profit from his various
encounters, he dismisses almost everyone he meets as "phony." The incessant
drumming on that one particular adjective leads a reader to hope that Holden
will find authenticity somewhere in his horizon, but The Catcher in the Rye
is not a novel that rewards optimism. It concludes with a vision of Holden's
pre- pubescent sister Phoebe going "round and round" on a symbolic carousel --
going nowhere, it would seem -- and in a brief coda Holden himself has been
institutionalized and placed under the care of an unsympathetic psychoanalyst.
Nor does the whiff of Humbertism in the relation between Holden and young Phoebe
contribute any last-second learning or cheer.

Even in the 1950s, The Catcher in the Rye enjoyed a cadre of fiercely loyal
partisans who powerfully identified with Holden Caulfield. I didn't believe
then, and certainly don't believe now, that Holden Caulfield mirrored the
anguish of my own particular soul. I was not a true believer, and I was not
entranced by Holden. For me, the novel was nothing more than a better-than-
average coming-of-age story -- although a dispiriting one because Holden does
not mature but instead remains stranded in perpetual, painful adolescence.

A novel without hope, The Catcher in the Rye has become an inspiration for the
hopeless. In Los Angeles, in 1989, twenty-one-year-old Robert Bando shot and
killed a young actress whom he had been pestering with trinkets and messages. In
a nearby alley, police found a .357-caliber handgun, a bloody shirt, and a copy
of The Catcher in the Rye. Two years later, John Hinckley shot and crippled
James Brady and almost succeeded in assassinating Ronald Reagan. Hinckley had
fantasized that killing the president would impress the actress Jodie Foster,
whom he imagined that he was wooing. In his pocket he carried a well-read,
tattered paperback of -- you guessed it --The Catcher in the Rye. In 1980, on
Manhattan's West Side, Mark David Chapman, concealing his pistol under a copy
of The Catcher in the Rye, shot John Lennon five times at point blank. He had
inscribed his copy of the novel with the words "To Holden Caulfield from Holden
Caulfield" -- Chapman had tried to legally change his name to that of Salinger's
troubled narrator. From jail, the proud murderer issued an endorsement: "My wish
is for all of you to someday read The Catcher in the Rye." At his trial Chapman
asserted that he had killed Lennon because the singer had become "phony,"
and at his sentencing he read to the judge the section of the book in which
Holden tells his sister Phoebe that he imagined himself in a field of rye with
"thousands of little kids" whom he must prevent from falling off "the edge of
some crazy cliff."

The Catcher in the Rye still sells well (15,000,000 copies in print by 1996) and
has become a fixture in the high school and college classroom, where successive
generations of adolescents can calibrate their degree of angst against Holden's.
But increasingly, and paradoxically, attention has turned from the novel to
Salinger himself, who has not published anything since 1965 and, secluded in his
Cornish, New Hampshire retreat, has become the world's most notorious hermit
since St. Simeon Stylites mounted his pillar in sixth-century Antioch.

Although he is a hermit, Salinger is anything but a saint. In 1987, in a bizarre
echo of Holden-obsessed stalkers, Salinger, then sixty-eight years old, flew to
California and barged onto the set of the TV show Dynasty in search of one of
the series's starlets, Catherine Oxenberg, with whom he had apparently fallen
into long-distance electronic infatuation. He was "escorted" off the set.

Did Catherine Oxenberg have a precursor?  She did, indeed she did. Several, in
fact, including Joyce Maynard, described as "the Lolita of all Lolitas," who
was eighteen and a freshman at Yale in 1972 when Salinger, at the age of fifty-
three, initiated a romance by sending her a fan letter.

These and other even less savory details about Caulfield-Salinger's life can be
found in Paul Alexander's thin, amateurish biography Salinger (Los Angeles: 
Renaissance Books, 1999), which does not propose, although it might, that J. D.
has learned as little about life as his most famous character.

Title: Naked Came the International Publishing Conglomerate
Date: February 24, 2006

When The Naked and the Dead was published in 1948, the word "naked" still had
shock value. Mailer's novel was followed by books with such titles as The Naked
Society, The Naked Ape and the moderately oxymoronic Naked Lunch.

It wasn't long before shock devolved into cliche. The publishing world has
now transformed itself, at least as far as book titles are concerned, into an
enormous, sprawling colony of nudists. Amazon lists over a thousand books in
English with "naked" in the title.

A reader interested in religion may choose from The Naked Christian, Naked
Buddha, Naked Buddhism, The Naked Soul, The Naked God, The Naked Church, Naked
Angels, Naked in the Promised Land and Praying Naked. The Naked Parish Priest
may imply more than is strictly proper and Buck-Naked Faith suggests that
ordinary nakedness is insufficient.

For the button-down corporate world, there's The Naked Corporation, The Naked
Consumer, The Naked Employee, The Naked Investor, Naked Imperialism, The Naked
Entrepreneur, Naked Marketing, Naked Imperialism, Naked Economics, The Naked
Capitalist, Naked in the Boardroom, The Naked Manager, The Naked Trader, Naked
at the Interview, The Naked Factory, and Work Naked.

There's hardly an area of interest that hasn't been touched by the advent of
naked titling. Politics?: The Naked Empire, Naked Liberty, Naked Justice,
The Naked Communist. Geographical?:  The Naked Tropics, Naked Sun, The
Naked Island, Naked Heartland, The Naked Mountain, The Naked Tree, Naked
Savages, The Naked Airport, Naked in Baghdad, Naked in Da Nang, Naked City,
The Naked Tourist, Naked Wanderlust, The Naked Jungle, Naked Germany, even 
Naked in Cyberspace, wherever that is. Social?: Naked Conversations, Naked
Bitch, The Naked Leader, The Naked Duke, The Naked Marquis, The Naked
Warrior, Naked Ambition, The Naked Roommate, Naked Conversations, The Naked
Crowd.  Gastronomical?: The Naked Chef, Naked Chocolate, Naked Fruit, Eat
Papayas Naked, The Naked Martini. Anatomical: The Naked Face, The Naked
Neuron, The Naked Chiropractor, The Naked Quack. Domestic: Naked Rooms, The
Naked Wall. Artistic?:  Naked Clay, Naked Vinyl, Writing Naked, The Naked
Cartoonist, Naked Poetry. Athletic?:  Naked Skydiving, The Naked Rower,
Swimming Naked, The Naked Runner, The Naked Hunter, The Naked Pilot, Naked
Weightlifting.

It's disappointing to find nothing in the arena of naked basketball, despite
Dennis Rodman's expressed desire to play his last professional game naked-- to
which the NBA commissioner is supposed to have responded, "it would definitely
be his last."

Other professions: The Naked Therapist, The Naked Detective, The Naked Bird
Watcher, The Naked Spy, The Naked Civil Servant, The Naked Counselor, The Naked
Anthropologist.

The field of dance has produced a series of related titles:  Dancing Naked
Under Palm Trees,  ...in the Mindfield, ..at the Edge of Dawn, ...in Front of
the Fridge, ...in the Material World, ...on the Floor, ...in the Sun. There's a
whole genre of books for people whose tastes are more specialized than mine. A
sample:  Naked Hairy Jocks.

Nearly Naked is refreshingly modest.

As might be expected, naked has its parodists. The faux-romance Naked Came the
Stranger was followed by Naked Came the Manatee and Naked Came the Sasquatch.
Naked and the Undead is bloody good, and Naked Brunch is, I think, delicious.
The most exquisite parody: Rita Rudner's Naked Beneath My Clothes. I'm staking
my claim to Naked Came the Nudist.

I was entirely wrong to jump to the conclusion that The Naked Mole Rat was a
parody; it's a serious study of Heterocephalus glaber by an academic zoologist.

Title: Hoop Words
Date: March 01, 2006

Now that "March madness" is nearly upon us, it's appropriate to reflect on
basketball jargon, which is distinguished by its many colorful monosyllables:
hoops, hops, bigs, stuff, slam, jam, slash, dish, board, glass, dunk, pick,
screen, paint, lane, point, wing, trey, rim, post, trap, "D", roll, box, press,
tip, swish, bank, brick, feed, stroke, hole, "J", rock, range.

But down-home slang is not basketball's only linguistic register. Curiously,
there's a contrary tendency toward polysyllabic words of Greek and Latin
origin. Some teams, for example, are said to be "physical." "Physical" (from
Gr. physicos = nature) means, in basketballese, "rough" and does not imply that
the other team plays either an ethereal or spiritual game. Until recently, a
guard played on the "outside" and the center on the "inside"; nowadays they've
become "perimeter" (Gr.) and "interior" (L.) players.  A fast break has become
"transition offense." A player doesn't drive to the basket; he "penetrates." 
Players no longer jump; they "elevate"; they don't block a shot, they "reject"
it.

In an odd linguistic development, a point guard no longer passes the ball; he
"distributes" (Latin: distribuere, to allot) it. In its ordinary meaning, to
"distribute" a basketball would be to cut it into pieces like a loaf of bread
and give each teammate a slice. Only a few years ago, it was still possible
to "switch" from guarding one man in order to guard another; now players
"rotate."  "Rotate," derived from the Latin word for wheel, means "to turn on
an axis, to spin."  A defender who did not switch but rotated would pirouette,
and pirouetting is not an effective defensive strategy. (A better classical
equivalent for switch would be "revolve.")  Even sillier than rotate: "rotate
over" or "rotate around"-- a usage that evokes the grotesquerie of a big guy
in a tutu pirouetting across the baseline -- a vision that is all the more
picturesque now that traditional basketball shorts have been replaced by big ol'
bloomers.

March 5:  Last night I heard a TV announcer say that a seven-foot tall player
had "a lot of verticality."  If he fell to the floor, I suppose that he would
have "horizonality." March 27: Also, "convert" for score, as in, "they had a
transition opportunity  but failed to convert."

Title: What We Read in the Fifties:  Lolita
Date: March 02, 2006

I know that I read Lolita sometime during my senior year in college, which was
the last year of the socially-constricted Eisenhower presidency. Nabokov was a
celebrity at Cornell and I remember attending a lecture in which he delivered a
hilarious destruction of Soviet realism. He was the first novelist whom I ever
saw with my own eyes (I had sat next to Tom Pynchon in a course in Eighteenth-
Century English literature every day for a semester, but although Pynchon had
published a story or two in Epoch, he was just another gangley guy and hardly
the artist--or the enigma--that he would soon become).

Lolita had been published in Paris in 1955, so it's just a bit more than fifty
years old, and therefore halfway to its centennial, when, it's often asserted,
it becomes possible to distinguish between works for the moment and works
for the ages. An interim report: Lolita is doing very very well.  It's as
impressive now as it was then -- but for different reasons. When I read the
novel In 1959, I was dazzled by its verbal surface: the allusions to Poe, to
Hamlet, to Joyce (whose Ulysses I had read closely even then). Of course I
missed much, especially because at that time I had read almost no continental
literature. But I loved being able to decipher some of the novel's playful
mysteries: that, for example, "Vivian Darkbloom" -- who is Clare Quilty's
accomplice in crime -- was an anagram for "Vladimir Nabokov" and that Lolita's
teachers "Miss Horn" and "Miss Cole" spoonerized an obscenity. It pleased me
immensely that Charlotte Haze ordered a mattress from "a firm located at 4640
Roosevelt Blvd., Philadelphia," because I had spent three dreadful summers
working in the Sears Roebuck warehouse on Utica Avenue, where I might have
composed an Anatomy of Boredom. I knew to whom "Brown, Dolores" alluded, and I
knew why she squatted outside the gates of the cloister. And then there were
Nabokov's extraordinary rhetorical displays. Had there ever been a novelist
who cared enough to write a sentence like "the least pressure would suffice to
set all paradise loose," where "least" balanced "loose," "paradise" balanced
"pressure," and "set" offset "suffice?"

I loved Lolita and I read all that I could find of Nabokov's early works and
then all the new ones as they appeared. But it's been a long time since I last
read the novel and the sexual abuse of children is no longer, if it ever was, a
matter for flippancy. I was worried that Lolita would be insensitive and dated.
But it's not so. It's still satirical, and it's still fun, but now it's less
comic than it is sad. Humbert is still clever, but he's clearly a madman, and
the murder of Quilty is the best apology that he can render to Lolita. Humbert
knows he's the blackest of villains, that he's robbed Lolita of her childhood,
that he lived in "a world of total evil," and that "even the most miserable of
family lives was better than the parody of incest, which... was all I could
offer the waif." The novel shocked Eisenhower America because it was thought to
be lurid -- but it's no more lurid than Oedipus. It's fully, designedly, and
beautifully tragic.

Title: Annoying Locutions:  "Within"; "Beg the Question"
Date: March 10, 2006

Why in the living heck do they say that the Nuggets are "within" two points of
the Lakers?  "Within" means less than than the proclaimed margin -- 1.9 points
perhaps. Why not say that the Nuggets are two points behind? Or trailing by
two points?  But not -- goodness gracious -- "within."  It's a perpetually
annoying piece of basketball-announcer slang and a good reason to keep the TV
sound muted. Moreover, why, given everything that I know about language change
and about prescription versus description, does such an ugly locution fill me
with grievous indignation?

And by all that's holy, "beg the question" does not mean "raise the question"
or "leads to the question." "Beg the question" is a term in logic which means
that the conclusion is implicit in the premise. It's a form of circular
argumentation. Aristotle first defined petitio principii and his analysis
served until a dozen or score of years ago, when, for some reason, "beg" became
confused with "beget." Let's try to hold the line on this one-- we need all the
logic we can muster in these perilous times.

Title: A Brush with Greatness
Date: March 13, 2006

I'm not generally given to boasting, but it's a fact: the great Don Newcombe
once spoke to me -- me! He asked me to refrain from conversing with him. This
noteworthy event occurred in 1949.

During summer vacation, it was the custom for neighborhood kids to arrive
at Ebbets Field early in the morning. The games didn't start until 1:30, so
we'd take a half a day's supply of salami sandwiches and stand outside the
players' entrance at 10:00 or so in the morning, hoping to catch sight of
Robinson, or Cox, or Furillo walking up the ramp to the clubhouse.  After
the stakeout, we'd watch a couple of hours of batting practice, and then some
fielding practice, and then there would be a long pause while the groundskeepers
spruced up the field, and then we'd listen to Gladys Gooding at the organ,
and at last, anticlimactically, we'd watch the actual game. I sometimes paid
the 60 cents for a seat in the bleachers, but just as often I was admitted
with one of the free tickets that were distributed by neighborhood fraternal
organizations -- the PAL (Police Athletic League) or the Sons of Italy or the
Sons of Norway. What a treat -- you could go to a Dodgers' game and at the same
time be Norwegian for a day!

One morning, there I was, loitering among a crowd of kids just as Big Don
arrived. He was huge. I can't remember exactly what I shouted to him, but it
was probably something like "Hey Don. Are you going to pitch today? How's the
arm?  Do you think you'll pinch-hit. Huh. Huh?" Newk turned and looked directly
at me and said, and I quote, verbatim, "Shut up, kid."  What a thrill!  I had
been noticed by the great man himself. It was a transcendent moment -- even more
exciting than the time when, sitting in the left field lower deck, I scrambled
for a home-run ball off the bat of third baseman Bobby Morgan (a ball that, to
my eternal regret, I later sold for five bucks. But hey, five dollars could take
you -- at 60 cents a ticket, two 5 cent subway fares, and another 5 cents for "a
big delicious glass of Nedick's tasty orange drink,/ It's cool refreshing flavor
you'll adore" -- to five or six games, one of which might be a double-header.)

How can I emphasize this sufficiently?:  Don Newcombe spoke directly,
personally, to me.

Here's another event of titanic importance: in the last innings of a game, when
the guards who policed the bleachers were too bored to pay attention, kids
would sneak down into the good seats. At Ebbets, the Dodgers' bullpen was along
the right-field foul line, so it was possible to sit just behind the relievers
and try to engage them in intimate conversation. One day I was involved in an
exciting unidirectional chat with Hal Gregg, then on the downside of his career
(he had won 18 games in 1945) when the frustrated reliever impatiently swung
himself around and said to me, and once again I quote absolutely verbatim, "What
are you, kid, a magpie?"

As long as I'm in full bragging mode, I should also boast that I once possessed,
on a treasured scrap of paper, the penciled autograph of Bob Ramazzotti, a
Dodger infielder, who, in 1949, batted .154 with one home run and three rbi's.

Let me also add that it was considered the utmost pinnacle of schoolyard wit to
sit in the front seats of the Ebbets Field upper deck and drizzle sticky orange
Nedick's upon the spectators beneath.

Title: What We Read in the Fifties:  The Naked and the Dead
Date: March 14, 2006

I had great hope that I would love to read The Naked and the Dead. Although
Norman Mailer is quite a few years older than I, he's a Brooklyn boy who became
a somebody. Mailer went to neighborhood schools, then on to Harvard and the
Army, and made a quite a splash. (As a matter of fact, he attended P. S. 161 in
Crown Heights, a school that we at P. S. 217 regularly trounced in the summer
softball league.)  But The Naked and the Dead was less fun than I had hoped. It
is 721 exhausting pages long. It has too many words, too many characters, too
much flashback, too much repetitive talk. It's not epic; it's just long.

The profusion of detail swallows an exemplary story: on a south Pacific island,
a platoon of soldiers is assigned to perform an impossible task. The platoon
suffers deaths, injuries, wounds, tensions, and a variety of psychic traumas,
even though, unknown to any of its members, by dumb luck and superior numbers,
the American forces have long since broken through the Japanese lines and the
battle for the island has been won.

The novel had a huge impact in 1948 and throughout the fifties and it started
Norman Mailer on his astonishing and perplexing career. It was much discussed
in the P. S. 217 schoolyard not only as a hot book (lots of talk about sex and
a superabundance of "fugs") but also as a scary account of life in the United
States military.  It certainly frightened me.

It's hard to believe that fifty years have gone by I last read The Naked and the
Dead. I still admire its ambition and I'm impressed that Mailer was just twenty-
five years old when it was published, but I'm deeply offended by the want of
economy, the lack of discipline, the narrow perspective, the philosophical
incoherence, the plot lapses, and especially by the reliance on shallow ethnic
stereotypes. I can't help thinking that, if Mailer had had patience and wisdom
and, most of all, restraint, The Naked and the Dead might have been not a seven-
hundred page monster but a two-hundred page masterpiece.

But I doubt that P. S. 161 put much emphasis on the virtue of restraint.  In
storytelling, Brooklyn guys choose hyperbole over litotes.

Title: No Ham in Your Hamburger?  It's a Cranwich.
Date: March 17, 2006

The word "alcohol" originates in Arabic as "al-kuhul" (said to mean "tincture
of antimony") and comes into English through Old Spanish. "Alcoholic," as in
"possessing the qualities of alcohol," is an old word, but "alcoholic" does
not acquire the meaning "addicted to alcohol" until 1880. In recent years,
"holic", which had no independent existence, has become detached from its
word of origin and appears as an enclitic or suffix to produce such useful
coinages as "workaholic," "shopaholic," "chocoholic, ""sexaholic."  Holic
is now so well- established as an indicator of compulsive behavior that it's
quite permissible to take almost any noun, slap a holic onto it, and invent a
decipherable adjective. A vacationer, for example, could be a beachaholic, a
swimaholic, or a sandaholic.

A fate similar to that of alcoholic befell the word sandwich. Originally a town
in Kent, Sandwich was later the name of a culinary-minded Earl. "Sand" is self-
explanatory and "wich" designated a tract of salty land. Wich, like holic, has
set out on its own career path and has generated such apparently essential new
words as "bagelwich" and "croissantwich." A croissantwich consists of a quantity
of something or other between two slices of croissant. If a bagelwich is made of
bagel and a croissantwich of croissant, of what is a sandwich made? The obvious
answer: bread, which, by a quirk of language, is signified by the morpheme
"sand."

There's no precise linguistic term for words created by the addition of
holic and wich, but they are closely related to a group known as "cranberry
morphemes." (A morpheme is the smallest unit of sound that carries meaning.) Why
cranberry?  Compare the two words "blackberry" and "cranberry."  Blackberry
resolves into two free morphemes: black and berry. Cranberry, however, is a
horse of another color, because "cran" all by its lonesome has no meaning at
all. (It did, once upon a time; cranberries were eaten by cranes.) "Cran" is
therefore a "bound morpheme." Unlike the black in blackberry, which functions
quite well on its own, "cran" is "bound" because if it were free it would be
meaningless. Technically, a cranberry morpheme is a bound morpheme that exists
in only one lexeme. Workaholic is a variety of cranberry morpheme because, like
cran, holic cannot stand alone; but while cranberry is unique, words containing
holic and wich occur in numerous manifestations.

It's therefore the case that English does not have an adequate word for
workaholic, bagelwich and their proliferating analogues. To supply this need,
I nominate "cranwich" (a coinage that is less than minute old as this is
written and is therefore a neonate neologism). The definition: a "cranwich"
is a cranberry morpheme that has gone wild and no longer limits itself to a
single appearance (like cran), but proliferates (like holic) -- and is easily
proliferable.

A hamburger was originally from Hamburg. At some point, burger detached itself
from hamburger, went wild, and produced such cranwiches as cheeseburger,
baconburger, bocaburger, and gardenburger. Along with these new words comes a
rather paradoxical phenomenon. Just as the sand in sandwich now means bread, so
the ham in hamburger means beef. This linguistic oddity will some day be a thing
of the past: more and more, the word hamburger is being replaced by the less
amusing but more precise beefburger. (Still beyond the horizon: breadwich.) It's
impossible to say why the hamburger yielded burger while the frankfurter (from
Frankfort) failed to cranwich: why do we have chicken franks and tofu franks
rather than chickenfurters and tofufurters?

Other cranwiches of note: Dracula has produced blackula and chocula: "ula" seems
to mean something both frightening and funny (although not in the case of uvula.
A scary uvula would be a uvulula). Godzilla produced hogzilla and bridezilla,
coinages which might lead the cranwich-naive to conclude that the god in
godzilla means god, which it certainly does not. Marathon, the Greek word for
fennel, was also the name of the city where the Athenians defeated the Persians
in 490 BC and from which the messenger Phidippides ran twenty-six miles to bring
the good news home. "Thon" has now severed its relationship with marathon and,
as a suffix, has produced innumerable cranwiches such as as knit-a-thon, jog-a-
thon, dance-a-thon, blog-a-thon, and, believe it or not, masturbate-a-thon. The
"Mc" in McDonald's has not only generated "mcmansions" and "mcjobs," but has
also opened up the possibility that an inferior or sub-standard cranwich could
someday be called a mccranwich. A compendious display of mccranwiches would be a
mccranwichorama.

March 24.   We're in Washington D. C.  On a cab ride we passed the Watergate
complex, the presence of which reminded me that I'd failed to mention one of the
major cranwiches of the last decade. The "gate" in Watergate has become a suffix
that denotes a scandal, as in Korea-gate, Iran-gate, Plamegate or, my favorite
(I like odd rhymes), debate-gate. Debate-gate, now largely forgotten, occurred
during the 1980 presidential campaign, when the fatuous hypocrite and ex-Jesse
Helms speechwriter George Will, using a stolen Democratic briefing book, coached
Ronald Reagan for his debate with Jimmy Carter, then later went on TV to praise
Reagan's "thoroughbred performance."

Title: William Merritt Chase;  Makamah Beach
Date: March 22, 2006

The American artist most dear to me is the impressionist William Merritt Chase
(1849-1916). Chase painted plein air scenes in Brooklyn's Prospect Park and
Coney Island and also produced a truly wonderful series of landscapes set in the
south fork of eastern Long Island. I knew nothing of these Shinnecock paintings
nor of Chase himself until one day in 1987 when I happened upon an exhibition
of his work in the National Gallery in Washington. Even though I was much
taken with the paintings, I was too frugal to buy the catalog. By virtue of
Amazon, I've at last located a copy (D. Scott Atkinson and Nicolai Cikovsky, Jr,
"William Merritt Chase, Summers at Shinnecock 1891-1902 [Washington:  National
Gallery, 1987]).

In "At the Seaside" (1892), a group of women and children enjoy a lazy day on
an otherwise empty beach. In the distance to the left is a sailboat and to the
right, almost at the horizon, a sandy point. The costumes are of the 1890s,
but the sea and the surf and the clouds are timeless. It's a busy but very
peaceful scene. Similar Chase landcapes depict sea-grasses, scrubby trees,
sandy beaches, empty roads. Many of his canvasses are populated by his wife and
children.

Fully as idyllic as Chase's "Summers at Shinnecock" were my own Wordsworthian
"Summers at Makamah Beach, 1947-1949." Although Makamah was on the Sound (on the
north shore), it was as like as like could be to Shinnecock in the 1890s. My
family spent three magical summers there -- the best summers and by far the best
times of my otherwise entirely citified, asphalt childhood. We rented a very
simple wood-frame beach house. If my memory is correct, the house was mostly
deck with a minimal kitchen and a few sleeping rooms. It seemed like a great
distance to the nearest neighboring beach house, but, in retrospect, it was
probably no more than five hundred or at most a thousand feet. But to a kid from
the schoolyard, a thousand feet was more than plenty. I loved the emptiness --
no trolleys, no radios, no people. I remember wandering alone for hours at low
tide examining, with the patience of childhood, the crabs, snails, seaweeds and
the infinite variety of dead fish. To my vocabulary, I added such novelties as
inlet, point, cove, high tide, squall, blowfish, starfish, perch, sea urchin,
shiner, sinker, fiddler crab, hermit crab, razorback, softshell, float, outboard
and inboard, "sheared a pin," oarlock, dinghy -- words and concepts previously
beyond the outer limit of my imagination. There were porpoises almost every day
-- once I was all alone on the beach when two of them battled furiously for
several minutes right in front of my astonished eyes. No one else saw them, and
no one believed me. There was also an abundance of horseshoe crabs-- not crabs
at all, as I later discovered, but trilobites left over from the Paleozoic.
I think it was the horseshoes that started me reading about paleontology. I
remember also old Mr. van Etten, already more than a child when Chase was
painting at Shinnecock, who took me out in his rowboat to trawl for bluefish.

Wordsworth wrote about his childhood's "fair seed-time" and that he was
"fostered alike by beauty and by fear." While it's easy to exaggerate the amount
of fear back in 1950s Brooklyn, it's a fact that there was an almost absolute
absence of beauty. Makamah Beach offered not only beauty and variety but also
the possibility of different kind of life.

Title: The Mayflower Hotel
Date: March 28, 2006

We're in Washington  D. C., this week and inadvertently wandered by the
Mayflower Hotel.

A memory: in July of 1952, I stayed at the Mayflower for a few days with my
father's sister, my peripatetic and eccentric Aunt Mollie. It was a rare and
unique event. I came from an automobile-less family, and my parents were not in
the slightest bit adventurous. The trip to Washington was the sole occasion in
my childhood when I was in a city other than New York (and by New York I mean
deepest Brooklyn, with an occasional foray to the Bronx Zoo or to the Museum
of Natural History). It's hard to convey the full measure of the naivete with
which this schoolyard boy approached a new city. I knew that Washington was
smaller than New York and therefore assumed that it would consist of a smaller
Brooklyn, a smaller Manhattan, etc. I had no conception that different cities
had different geographies -- let alone different characters.

Highlights:  the Lincoln Memorial (I was exhilarated), the Jefferson
Memorial, a boat ride to Mount Vernon. My strongest memory is of exciting and
down-to-earth Harry Truman addressing a crowd from the base of the Washington
Monument on the Fourth of July. The result of this voyage into the unknown was
the realization that there were other cities, that they were accessible -- in
short, that there was a world elsewhere.

I'm permanently indebted to my Aunt for allowing me the opportunity to grasp
such a big idea.

And also that there was such a thing as a restaurant. It might seem incredible,
but from birth to college, I didn't enter a restaurant more than a half-a-dozen
times at the very most. In our family, there was neither the money nor the
inclination toward such extravagance. I still consider it a something of a
miracle that a guy like me can walk into a shop, sit down, and that people will
generously put food on my plate. All that I have to do in return is fork over a
few bucks.

Exactly thirty-five years later, I stayed at the Mayflower a second time when
AGP was honored and celebrated. At this Mayflower reprise, it was not Truman
but Ronald Reagan whom we encountered. I remember the dyed hair, the unnatural
orange skin, the ventriloquist's-dummy delivery of the speech that was handed
him, and the undeniable inference that he was already deeply incapacitated by
the Alzheimer's that would eventually kill him.

Title: And Speaking of Berries...
Date: April 02, 2006

The cranberry, some say, is so named because it is eaten by cranes. Perhaps.
But it's just as likely that the word derives from the similarity between the
plant's stamen and the crane's beak --  as the common geranium or cranesbill
is named after the flower's distinct enlarged pistil. (The American cranberry
has an English cousin that is known, from its watery habitat, as the fenberry.
The fenberry is neither eaten in nor by fens.) But if in fact cranberries were
the food of cranes, what about the common bearberry (also known as crowberry,
foxberry, and hog cranberry) -- did this plant also derive its name from its
consumers?  I'm skeptical, as I am skeptical about the derivation of the word
lingonberry or cowberry, cows not being famous for berry eating. In fact, lingon
means berry in Swedish, so the lingonberry is, etymologically speaking, a
berryberry. Inasmuch as berryberries contain thiamine, they may help to prevent
beriberi.

The bunchberry, a member of the dogwood family, is also known as the
squirrelberry, pigeonberry, and crackerberry (from crake = crow), but never as
mooseberry, though it's prized by moose, who have themselves provided a name for
a favorite food -- the mountain maple or moosewood.

The circumpolar cloudberry is sometimes called the salmonberry, but no one
claims that it is nibbled by salmons. And what about the gooseberry?  There's
no discernible relation between gooseberry and geese.  There are also
gooseberries that have shed whatever goosiness they may once have possessed.
The plant that was originally known as the Chinese gooseberry was transported
to New Zealand, where it was selected, hybridized, and cloned, to emerge after
commercial re- christening as the kiwifruit or kiwi -- the name gooseberry not
considered classy enough for international export. To the best of my knowledge,
kiwis are not eaten by kiwis.

Blackberry and blueberry pose no etymological challenge, but raspberry is a bit
of a mystery, there being no obvious rasp to the berry. The word raspberry was
most definitely not derived from the slang term for a rude derogatory sound
-- a usage that is only traceable to the last part of the nineteenth century.
The unpalatable bristly dewberry has no particular connection to dew. It's
popularly said that the serviceberry is so called because, when it flowers early
in the spring, the ground has thawed enough to bury -- or conduct a service --
for last winter's dead. But it's a false etymology -- in fact, the service in
serviceberry comes directly from its Latin ancestor sorbus (just as the mul
in mulberry derives from Latin morus). The juneberry does in fact derive its
name from its month of flowering. The loganberry is named for its hybridizer,
James Logan, who crossed the blackberry and the raspberry. Although the name
huckleberry -- also known as a hurtleberry or whortleberry -- is sometimes
applied to the blueberry, it describes a botanically distinct species. The
slang term huckleberry for a layabout -- nowadays a slacker -- was in use a
generation or so before Mark Twain made it famous. Huckleberry Finn might just
as easily be known as Whortleberry Finn. The bilberry is more distinguished
when it is called a fraughan. The jostaberry is brand-new to the market; it's
a cross between a gooseberry and a blackcurrant. (Currants are berries even
though not called so; the word currant derives from their older name -- raisins
of Corinth.) The strawberry has nothing whatsoever to do with straw. Some
think that name derives from the chaff-like external seeds or achenes which
cover the fruit, but it's more likely that the name is drawn from the plant's
habit of growth: runners stray or are strewn over the ground. A thousand years
ago strawberries were called earthberries, a name not especially suitable for
commerce.

Title: Quintessence of Motherhood
Date: April 04, 2006

A friend, a retired nurse, was keeping watch when her ninety-plus-year-old
mother was about to breath her last. The mother, who had not been coherent for
some days, was either unconscious or sleeping deeply when she suddenly roused
herself, looked closely at the daughter, uttered the words "you need rouge," and
died.

This story is self-explanatory but nevertheless I feel compelled to embark on a
course of no doubt supererogatory explications. The mother expresses a variety
of emotions: some positive, some not so good.  Primarily she is affectionate
and protective. She wants her daughter to take care of herself and be her best,
so she proposes a practical cosmetic enhancement. But at the same time, she is
intrusively judgmental, because the statement "you need rouge" clearly finds the
daughter deficient and in need of cosmetic enhancement.

The mother is also impolite -- but only in the way that people who know each
other intimately can sometimes be unmannerly. This particular mother wouldn't
speak nearly so frankly to anyone in the world but her own daughter. In
addition, she's competitive. "You need rouge" means not only "you're pallid, you
need help," but also hints at "I never needed rouge."

It's a humorous anecdote, because it's about the eternal continuity of
mothering.  Even at the moment of death, the mother remains entirely and
unequivocally maternal. The phrase "you need rouge" also makes us smile because
it displaces other last words  -- words of wisdom or serenity or love -- that
we might anticipate or for which we might hope.

And what about the daughter?  Was she, or should she be, pleased, resigned,
offended, amused?

Title: Beast in the Backyard
Date: April 08, 2006

On the night of August 23, 1990, an eighty-pound, two-year-old female mountain
lion wandered into our backyard.

The story appears in a book on cougar-human interactions (David Baron, The Beast
in the Garden [New York: Norton, 2004], 182-187) -- a book which also contains a
picture of "our" lioness, lying drugged on the ground (167).

My strongest memory of that encounter doesn't appear in the book and deserves a
report.  The lioness was crouching on a low branch of a box elder, and a goodly
number of police loitered on the street and in the yards and alleys waiting
for the wildlife-control officer and his tranquillizing dart. Eventually the
marksman arrived and shot the lioness. The animal leaped down from the tree.
As soon as she hit the ground and started to run, we could hear the sound,
resonating throughout the neighborhood, of car doors being slammed shut as
the officers rushed into their vehicles -- to re-emerge only when the lioness
collapsed.

Last week, there was another mountain lion in a near neighbor's backyard. It was
daylight;  the owner of the house had her video camera available and produced
a very clear record of a magnificent animal -- much larger and more formidable
that the one we had seen. Two nights ago, the neighbors held a meeting and the
author of The Beast in the Garden, who lives in town, came to tell us about
cougars in our county and what to do if we encounter them. The good news is
that the odds of being attacked are small: only one local person (a high school
student jogging alone near Idaho Springs) has been killed -- or taken, the
word is -- during the last decade. The author's advice: bring a companion with
you when you go walking in the mountains-- it's unlikely that a catamount will
attack two people, and if he should attack, then there are two of you to fend
him off. (He didn't repeat a familiar bit of local humor: "Always bring  a
friend with you when you walk in mountain-lion country. Remember, you don't have
to outrun the lion; you just have to outrun your friend.")  He also reminded
the audience that it's wrong to run away (because you will look like prey) but
that you should make yourself look big, make noise, throw rocks, etc. Do not,
repeat do not, play dead -- or worse yet, get down on all fours and try to crawl
away. But on the whole it's not the mountain lion you see who's the danger; it's
the mountain lion whom you don't see, but sees you. The one you feel.

A jogger was in the mountains with his faithful pooch at his side.  He came to
the top of a rise and there, on the road, was a big panther.  The jogger's dog
immediately disappeared into the roadside vegetation. The man did everything
right -- shouted, threw things, stared the lion down. Eventually, and slowly,
the big beast moved away and the jogger continued on his run. When he came to
the bottom of the hill, Faithful Companion, who had taken the long way around, 
reappeared and resumed running  with his master.

Man's best friend, but within sensible limits.

Title: Prayer Science
Date: April 10, 2006

According to The New York Times (3/31/2006), the world of prayer science is
all in a dither. A new study has apparently demonstrated that "prayers offered
by strangers had no effect on the recovery of people who were undergoing heart
surgery." The study was a big, expensive deal: ten years of work at a cost of
$2.4 million (contributed by the ever-zealous Templeton Foundation, a powerful
supporter of prayer research). The details are utterly and weirdly fascinating.
"Researchers monitored 1802 patients at six hospitals who received coronary
bypass surgery. The patients were broken into three groups. Two were prayed
for; the third was not. Half of the patients who received the prayers were told
that they were being prayed for; half were told that they might or might not
receive prayers. The researchers asked the members of three congregations -- St.
Paul's Monastery in St. Paul; the Community of Teresian Carmelites in Worcester,
Mass.; and Silent Unity, a Missouri prayer ministry near Kansas City -- to
deliver the prayers, using the patients' first names and the first initials of
their last names. The congregations were told that they could pray in their own
way, but they were instructed to include the phrase "for a successful surgery
with a quick, healthy recovery and no complications.'" The shocking result:
"researchers found no difference between those patients who were prayed for and
those who were not." Prayer, it would appear (or intercessory prayer as this
variety is called), does not change things.

I admire the dedicated men and women of science who put heart and soul into this
project, but with all due respect, I must question both their conclusions and
their protocols. For starters, the inference that prayer doesn't work is far too
broad. Inasmuch as the scientists engaged only Christians to pray, all that they
proved was that Christian prayer doesn't work. It's marvelously ethnocentric to
suggest that just because Christians tanked, other religions could not succeed.
It was Bailey Smith, the President of the Southern Baptist Convention, who
authoritatively proclaimed that "God does not hear the prayer of a Jew." And
yet, in a stunning theological upset, the scientific evidence now proves that
God Almighty does not hear the prayers of Christians. But such a conclusion
is itself far too hyperbolic. In actual fact, all that the study established
is that God did not hear the prayers of three particular groups of prayer-
providers. It's certainly a black mark against the Teresian Carmelites and their
friends, and it will be a cold day in hell before they see another Templeton
prayer contract, but there's nothing to say that Southern Baptists, even Bailey
Smith himself, with his private line to the Almighty, might not have had more
sway with the Great Jehovah.

If the researchers had not been so blindly and thoughtlessly ethnocentric,
they might have solicited the prayers of people of various faiths, especially
those praying to different gods. Or even better: they might have assembled
disparate groups of prayer providers. In one set, for example, there would be
a Catholic, a Jehovah's Witness, and a Hindu; in another, a Muslim, a Wiccan,
and a Methodist; in a third, a Scientologist, a Baptist, and a Muggletonian.
Although the number of possible permutations is intimidating, the cause is
noble: to determine impartially which of these groups can best cut the prayer
mustard. It's wrong to put the entire burden on Christians. Scientists need to
mix and match the various religions so that they can discover the most effective
synergistic combination, or as it might better be called, the appropriate prayer
cocktail.

In addition, the study is guilty of flagrant mishandling of dosage. There was
simply no control over the amount of prayer that was administered. Just as
traditional medicines come in cubic centimeters, prayer comes in units of time.
Let's say that one person praying for one minute yields one prayer unit. 
Pending further study, there's no way to establish exactly how many prayer units
a heart patient might need. For a bypass, fifty prayer units might be a minimum
dosage, but perhaps twice or three times as many units might be necessary to
alleviate the symptoms of a hallucinator of witches, extraterrestrials, or
other supernatural beings. It's entirely possible that the prayers in this
study failed simply because they didn't meet a minimum prayer-unit threshold.
Moreover, it's important not to over-prescribe. For all we know, excessive
prayer might precipitate iatrogenic illnesses. And it's also a question of
efficiency: once an optimum dosage can be established, prayer providers can
go about their business and not waste their time generating superfluous and
expensive prayer units.

Moreover, prayer scientists seem to have given no serious consideration to the
group power of prayer providers. Given the present abysmal state of prayer
science, it's still unknown whether prayers are more effective when delivered by
just one or a very few providers, or in large choruses. Jews seem to think that
a minyan, or quorum, is ten, but hard science has not confirmed this number.
It's therefore imperative to experiment with different size groups in order to
establish a proper medical-minyan. This is not easy, or inexpensive, but it's
essential.  It would indeed be unfortunate if it turns out that a thousand
prayer providers are necessary to improve the condition of just one bypass
patient, but good golly, the Ancient of Days works in mysterious ways, and it's
not for us to question His prayer needs.

There are some other areas in which more scientific rigor is required. A) 
different diseases: just because prayer didn't work for bypasses doesn't mean
it won't work for scrofula. Perhaps some diseases are more prayer-responsive
than others. B) fervor: prayer science has made the naive error of assuming that
all prayer providers are equal. Yet the unalterable laws of random distribution
determine that some people will pray more effectively than others. In point of
fact, it's entirely likely that some prayer providers will be more effective
with one disease than another. If I were a patient, I'd be mighty bent out of
shape (and might even seek legal recourse) if I were assigned a prayer provider
who had a proven track record with ulcers but who amounted to zilch for my hip
replacement.  C) identification: prayer providers were given only the first
name and initial of their prayee. But "Bob S." is entirely too vague-- there
might be hundreds of "Bob S"'s all over the world undergoing bypass surgery at
any given time. How the blue blazes is the Lord of Hosts supposed to know which
particular "Bob S" is meant?  Fortunately, there's an easy solution to this
problem. Prayer providers should continue to pray for Bob S., but just remember
to add the last four digits of his social security or major credit card number.

I'm not the only person disappointed with this study. According to the Times,
"Bob Barth, the spiritual director of Silent Unity, the Missouri prayer
ministry, said the findings would not affect the ministry's mission. 'A person
of faith would say that this study is interesting,' Mr Barth said, 'but we've
been praying a long time and we've seen prayer work, we know it works, and
the research on prayer and spirituality is just getting started.'"  Bob B's
assertion that "prayer works" is anecdotal thinking and has absolutely no merit
whatsoever, but I can't imagine a single person who wouldn't agree with him that
prayer science is "just getting started"-- and also that it has a long bumpy
road to travel. Fortunately, the Bush administration invested over $2 million
of our tax revenues in prayer research, with more in the pipeline, so some
revolutionary breakthroughs in the spiritual sciences soon might be achieved. 
We'll be waiting.

Title: More on Prayer Science
Date: April 12, 2006

In my post on the Templeton prayer study, I did not mention the outcome least
congenial to prayer enthusiasts: not only did prayer do no good, it also caused
real harm. “A significantly higher number of the patients who knew that they
were being prayed for — 59 percent — suffered complications, compared with
51 percent of those who were uncertain [whether or not they were being prayed
for”].

How could it happen that prayees did worse than patients who were just let
alone?  Dr. Charles Bethea, co-author of the Templeton study and cardiologist
at the Integris Baptist Medical Center in Oklahoma City proposed that "it may
have made [patients] uncertain, wondering am I so sick they had to call in their
prayer team?"  It's a possible scenario -- it’s no secret that depressed and
anxious patients do worse than happy ones. But the “patient is anxious”
explanation doesn’t work for those who didn’t know that they were on the
receiving end of prayers.  Among the group of unwitting prayees, “18 percent
suffered major complications, like heart attack or stroke, compared with 13
percent in the group that did not receive prayers.”  Researchers offered no
hypothesis for this unanticipated result except to say that it was a chance
outcome.

So let us review: when prayees know that they’re being prayed for, their
decline is a product of anxiety; when they don’t know that they're being
prayed for, their decline is the result of chance. In both cases, the unwanted
phenomenon is explained by natural rather than supernatural causes.

Let us now imagine that the study produced contrary results and that the prayees
had lower rates of complications than the unprayed. Would there not have been
banner headlines in newspapers and on Fox proclaiming that prayer has been
proven to be effective remedy for the complications of surgery?

The error in logic is enormous and obvious. When prayer fails, it's for
natural reasons. If and when prayer succeeds, it's because of supernatural
intervention. It's a flagrant double standard where a symmetrical standard
should be mandatory. If prayer succeeds because of divine intervention, it's
only logical that it must fail because of symmetrical supernatural intrusions --
because, for example, malificent demonic forces located the prayer providers,
hijacked their prayers mid-flight, and turned good into evil. It's a difficult
hypothesis to prove, it's true, but it's exactly as credible as the ideas that
are put forward by prayer science.

Title: Predators Then and Now
Date: April 16, 2006

There's more neighborhood mountain lion news: yesterday a seven-year-old boy,
walking in the rearward of a group of six or seven hikers, was pounced upon in
the mountains just west of town by a big guy. The child was bitten and clawed
but is now recovering. Family members drove the lion away.

In my view, they should never have allowed the child to pull up the rear.

I’d been thinking about predators even before this last attack (see the
entry for April 8).  By one of those curious convergences that make life so
rich, I just happened to be reading Bruce Chatwin’s The Songlines (New York:
Viking, 1987), a travel narrative ostensibly about the sacred but invisible
paths along which the ancestors of the Australian aborigines traveled and
'sang the world into existence.'  The thesis of this quirky, self-indulgent
and intermittently brilliant narrative is that human beings are by nature not
sedentary but migratory.

But the book isn't only about migrants;  n one of The Songlines' many meanders,
Chatwin writes a few pages on the age-old interaction of human beings with big
predators like the mountain lion. He takes issue with the much-loved claim of
right-wing thinkers that human beings are naturally territorial and aggressive
-- that we are nothing more than naked apes who must continually strive to
control larger and larger dominions. Instead, he offers the alternative view
that because of our long history of fending off predators, human beings are
naturally not aggressive but defensive  -- and, moreover, that It's the
defensive imperative that caused our species to move from savagery to civility.
He asks us to think of the situation of the earliest humans. "The first men were
humbled, harried, besieged -- their communities few and fragmented… clinging
to life and one another through the horrors of the night."  "Might not,"
he asks, "all the attributes we call ‘human’ – language, song-making,
food-sharing, gift- giving, intermarriage... have evolved as stratagems
for survival, hammered out against tremendous odds, to avert the threat of
extinction?"  It's a challenging, overarching hypothesis -- and whether or not
there are facts to validate it is beyond my ken.

It's certainly true that first humans in Africa had to cope with a variety of
nasty predators -- lions were there long before people -- and that when  our
ancestors migrated to Europe they walked into a wild, dangerous country. The
European lion, panthera leo, widespread from 900,000 years ago to the end of the
last ice age, was a third taller and longer than surviving African lions, which
themselves can weigh 450 pounds and reach a length of 8 1/2 feet. The lions in
the virginal land that our ancestors crossed the Mediterranean to colonize would
have been as tall as a fully grown Paleolithic man and might have weighed as
much as 880 pounds.  And remember that for 99% of our time on earth, humans
were either entirely unarmed or possessed only of the hand ax -- a palm-size
piece of sharpened but haft-less flint. No matter what theory of the origins
of civilization we embrace, we should remember that our genes were selected
in a world of woolly rhinoceroses, mammoths, aurochs, and wolves and that we
competed with the big bears for what were then the best residences on earth--
the limestone caves in the Ardeche region in France.

It's in these caves that the memory of European lions is beautifully preserved.
Thirty thousand years ago, a long tradition of animal representation climaxed
in the paintings in the Chauvet Cave. There are beautiful representations of
European lions on the hunt and at rest in Jean-Marie Chauvet's The Dawn of Art:
The Chauvet Cave (New York: Abrams, 1995) --  irrefutable evidence that our
forefathers knew them at first hand.  It's unquestionable that many a child
-- and many an adult -- fell prey to these adversaries. And perhaps Chatwin
is right; perhaps those humans who survived to reproduce were selected not
for aggressiveness but for congeniality and especially for artistic ability.
How else can we account for our species' continual preoccupation, or perhaps
obsession, with all the many forms of beauty?

April 17.  The authorities tracked and killed an 80-pound female panther. I
sincerely hope that it was the offending animal and not an innocent bystander.

Title: Three Cheers for the Blue, White and Red
Date: April 18, 2006

It's been a Krzysztof Kieslowski festival here the last few days. We've watched,
two times each and with concentrated and astonished attention, Kieslowski's
Trois Couleurs films: Bleu, Blanc, and Rouge. Individually (which is how
we viewed them in 1993-94 when they first appeared) they're splendid; taken
together, they're an even more wonderful achievement.

Kieslowski tells complicated stories with economy and precision; I don't know
any filmmaker who can make every corner of the frame count for so much. It must
be his training as a maker of documentaries that accounts for the rich, factual
surface of his narrative. And yet his chosism -- his thing-ism -- is always in
the service not of plot only but of the enigma as well. Kieslowski knows what
accomplished novelists also know -- that an object, studied closely, becomes
a metaphor. The three films share a common theme -- that it's impossible to
find happiness outside of society  -- but the presentations are so various and
imaginative and the characters so rich that philosophical questionings are as
unobtrusive as they are omnipresent.

Kieslowski swore off directing when he finished Rouge, but had apparently
relented and had started on another trilogy (Heaven, Hell, Purgatory) when the
heart attack killed him. But there's the earlier work; we'll track backwards to
watch, once again, The Decalogue and The Double Life of Veronique.

Title: A Little Spellcheck Humor, Maestro
Date: April 20, 2006

I first stumbled over Spellcheck's wayward sense of humor years ago when I was
writing about Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. Spellcheck rejected Capulet,
which is Juliet's family name, and presumptuously instead offered the choice of
either "co-pilot" or "copulate."

Spellcheck is deeply offended by proper names, uncommon words, neologisms, words
in a language other than English, etc., and sometimes makes its impatience known
by suggesting dadaist or absurd substitutions.

For example, everyone (everyone except Spellcheck, that is) knows that
Muggletonians are members of a religion founded in England in the 1650s by
Lodowick Muggleton which held, among other doctrines, the idea that heaven was
only slightly above the reach of our uplifted arms. Spellcheck has an irrational
animus toward this harmless, near-extinct religion and proposed as substitutes
for Muggletonian, the words "Argentinian," "Miltonic," "Macedonian," "Justinian"
and (as a pure instance of spellcheckian whimsy) "melatonin."

Apparently untutored in geography, Spellcheck rejected the ancient north African
and modern upper New York state city of Utica in favor of "Attica," which makes
a kind of sense, but also "Utah," which is a bit off-the-wall, "Utopia," which
is nowhere, and the imaginative but bizarre "erotica."

A recent entry on berries provoked an orgy of spellcheckian absurdity.
For fenberry, "Canberra"; for crowberry, both "crowbar" and "crockery";
for lingonberry, "linguine," "lingerie" and "nunnery"; for whortleberry,
"wheelbarrow";  for earthberry, "authoress"; for cloudberry, "glittery" and the
truly wild, out-of-left-field "Goldberg."  Speaking of left field: for rbi's,
Spellcheck proposed both "ribs" and "rabbis"; for Ebbets (as in Ebbets Field),
simply "beets";  for Newcombe, as in the great Dodger pitcher Don Newcombe,
"encumber."

In another recent post I invented the word "mccranwichorama," defined as a
display of inferior coinages of words in which detached segments (such as the
wich in cranwich) acquire new meaning. I knew that when I batted mccranwichorama
over the net, I would probe the outer limits of Spelllcheck's powers, but I must
say that the program rose to the occasion when it parried with a transcendent
absurdity: for mccranwichorama:  "mercurochrome."

Title: Baseball Purity
Date: April 30, 2006

My father played excellent tennis and basketball -- he was a guard on the CCNY
team under Nat Holman until he left school to put a few cents in the family
coffers.  During the 20s and 30s he also played some semi-pro baseball. He'd
make $5.00 or $10.00 a game as a "ringer" -- and in those days, an extra buck or
two went a long way.

He was a catcher and had the busted-up fingers to prove it. He paid for the
broken bones when the arthritis caught up with him. Although he had been an
unusually strong man, in his last years he didn't have enough left in his
twisted fingers to pull the match out of the matchbook to light his pipe. But he
could still discuss "inshoots" and "outshoots."

Sometime in the early 80s (it was after mom died), he was in the hospital
recuperating from a hip replacement. He was not a good patient and the
confinement left him testy and bored, but he could be a little cheered by
watching whatever sports were on the TV. One day I visited him and found the
television off.

"Pop, there's a Yankee game on. Why aren't you watching it?"

He waved his gnarled old hand. "American League. DH rule. Not baseball."

I'm glad he didn't have to see the changes since he left the scene. It's a new,
impermanent, history-hostile, TV-friendly, high-scoring production: franchises
jumping all around the country; new stadiums with mighty short porches; players
coming up to bat wearing not only gold necklaces and earrings, but also helmet,
gauntlets and greaves; the incredible shrinking strike zone; pitchers no longer
allowed to knock down the over-aggressive batter; an epidemic of steroids that
has led to  unnaturally bulked-up sluggers; balls flying out of the park as if
the guys were playing Sunday-afternoon slow-pitch softball; mediocre hitters
slamming 40 hr's a year -- not to mention baseball played in the thin Colorado
atmosphere where the batted ball takes off like a rocket and where curve balls
can't curve.

I know exactly what my father would have said: "Not baseball."

Title: What's the Deal with Mike Yamagita?
Date: May 02, 2006

In Fargo, a tightly structured film, the extraneous Mike Yamagita episode might
easily have been cut.

Here’s the story (Fargophiles may bypass the plot summary). Mike is a
high- school classmate and possibly an old boy friend of Marge Gunderson. He
telephones Marge when he learns that she’s the police chief investigating the
Brainerd triple homicide. When they  meet in a hotel bar in Minneapolis, Mike
makes a half-hearted pass which Marge decisively rebuffs. Mike then reveals
that he had been married to a mutual friend, Linda Cooksey, but that Linda
died of leukemia. Because he’s lonely and, it would appear, because he’s
embarrassed to have crossed the line with Marge, he breaks into sobs. A couple
of scenes later, Marge is on the phone with a girl friend. She is surprised to
learn that Mike never married Linda, that Linda is very much alive though she
had been “pestered” by Mike for over a year, and that Mike’s been having
psychiatric problems.

The Mike Yamagita excursion doesn’t easily connect to the gruesome botched-
kidnapping main story. What, then, is its reason for being?.

The Coens like to toy with audience expectations. When we first hear Mike on the
phone, we recognize the same flat upper-Midwest accent with which we've become
familiar -- and so, we're taken aback to discover that Mike is Asian-American.
But is it a gimmick or does it matter?  Mike himself plays against type. Almost
everyone in the film (although not Carl Showalter, the excitable talkative
funny-looking guy who's destined for the wood-chipper) is laconic and stoical.
Mike's bawling opposes him to both the stereotypical impassive Asian as well as
to the stereotypical low-key Swedish Lutheran. But can his display of sentiment
be trusted? Mike is no less insane than Gaear Grimsrud, the psychopathic killer,
but he’s addled in a sweeter way. He wants desperately to be part of a family.
It's because of this longing that he harasses Linda Cooksey and fantasizes
a romance with Marge. In its own Coenesque way, Fargo is a film that extols
families. Although the Lundegaards are not a good model, Marge and Norm are
emphatically in the process of creating a good and decent family. So perhaps,
taken all together, the Mike Yamagita episode adds an unexpected quirky element
to the film, challenges ethnic assumptions, and reinforces, in a 'funny kind of
way,' Fargo's family values.

The Mike Yamagita subplot also deepens the character of Marge Gunderson.
Although she’s interested in Mike--she primps for their "date" -- she’s not
a bit flirtatious. There must be hundreds of policiers in which the tough cop
engages in gratuitous sex, but Marge is not that kind of policeperson. When she
confines Mike to his side of the table, she reinforces her status as the moral
center of an otherwise amoral film. But Mike catches her off guard and she’s
not nearly as discerning in fancy duds as she would be if she were in uniform.
The Fargo screenplay describes Mike as “bald, paunching.” (The coinage
“paunching” must mean “becoming paunchy.”) By changing direction and
casting the handsome Korean-American actor Steve Park,-- a native of Vestal,
New York, by the way -- in the role of Mike Yamagita, the film makes him less
pathetic and more sexual. While Marge does resist, she’s curious enough about
him to make it her business to investigate. She ably balances restraint with
curiosity.

Finally, there’s a broad sketchy parallel between the Mike Yamagita sequence
and the main action of the film. Jerry Lundegaard attempts a scam that
eventually kills his wife; Mike Yamagita attempts a similar scam when he tries
to insinuate himself into Marge’s life by, so to speak, 'killing' his own
imaginary wife. Marge thwarts both scams.

Three different approaches, then: one about Mike, one about Marge, and one about
plot parallels. But has the heart of this mystery been plucked?  Do we now know
what Mike Yamagita is doing in Fargo?  I don't think so. Is there anyone out
there in the cinemablogosphere who can improve on these suggestions?

Title: A Rare Baseball-Shakespeare Confluence
Date: May 03, 2006

It's not often that there's an intersection of the disparate universes of
Shakespeare and baseball. Yet even such distant areas of experience occasionally
overlap.

A contributor to a Shakespeare discussion group of which I am a member recently
wrote about Jim Bouton's Ball Four (1970) (a very good baseball book),
"Like Bill Bradley's excellent Life on the Road, it was written from the
player's perspective." If I remember correctly from my own reading, it neither
sensationalized nor glamorized professional athletics.

This Shakespeare correspondent had "recently read Howard Bryant's earnest
history of baseball in the 1990s called Juicing the Game (Viking, 2005) and was
reminded that Ball Four did not make Bouton's fellow ballplayers happy." "Bouton
revealed to the world what most everyone in baseball already knew, and what most
people outside it suspected: Players took amphetamines.... They had girls in
different cities.'  Ball Four sold two million copies but Bouton himself was
ostracized and eventually harassed out of baseball."

Now comes the baseball-Shakespeare confluence. Juicing the Game reports
that sometime after Ball Four appeared, Bouton was "on the mound against
Cincinnati... when he heard the voice of Pete Rose bellowing from the top step
of the dugout, 'Fuck you, Shakespeare'. Literary criticism has seldom been more
explicit."

It's a good story, but the correspondent to the Shakespeare list does not
fully explicate its significance. "Fuck you, Shakespeare" uses the epithet
"Shakespeare" as a generic term for a writer -- almost as though Pete Rose could
not think of the name of any other author. Under ordinary circumstances, to call
someone a Shakespeare would be laudatory. This particular usage is either a very
uncommon or a unique instance of the epithet serving as a term of derogation.
In a way, it's a tribute to Shakespeare's prominence. "Fuck you, Flaubert," had
such words been bellowed by Pete Rose, would have carried a dissimilar valence.

I myself feel confident in surmising that Rose's acquaintance with Shakespearean
drama -- and with the written word in general -- is less than profound. No one,
even those who vastly admired the convicted rapscallion's skill with the bat,
has ever confused 'Charley Hustle' with 'Bertie' Russell or Charley Dickens.

"Fuck you, Shakespeare" reminds me of two of my favorite baseball/intelligence
anecdotes. The first is the laudatory evaluation of Yale-educated Yankee
pitcher Ron Darling by his teammate, center-fielder Mickey Rivers: "he knows
the answers to things what I don't even know the question of."  A second
anecdote has a similar valence. I 'll call the participants in the following
genuine conversation Player A and Player B because I no longer recall who they
were (although I do remember that both were Yankees). Player A: "That guy is a
total idiot." Player B: "What are you saying? He has an IQ of a hundred thirty."
Player A: "Yeah?  Outta what?"

May 9.  My brother Jon called to say that Ron Darling never played for the
Yankees. He hypothesizes a memory failure on my part: Darling was with the
Mets and the center-fielder in question therefore must have been Mookie Wilson
(former Rockies outfielder Preston Wilson's uncle and stepfather [note Hamlet
reference] and the man who hit the grounder that went through Bill Buckner's
legs). But the identification of Darling's admirer isn't crucial; let's just
agree that he was someone with the linguistic competence of a Pete Rose.

Title: A Writing Family
Date: May 07, 2006

Yesterday we learned that my nephew Steven's book on the philosophy of martial
arts will appear in July. Hosannas to him. Steven's wife, Terrylynn, has a book
out on criminal justice.

It's a writing family. The direct descendants of Isaiah and Eta have produced
books on a wide variety of subjects.

It began when my father construed and annotated the standard form of real estate
contract. And then my brother Jon published that novel about the dance and
another family member of his generation wrote that introductory book about
Shakespeare and a bunch of stuff on English literature. NGP''s book on election
technology. My cousin Marian's twin daughters (upon whom I haven't set eyes
since their grandfather's funeral, which was in 1965, I believe) have written a
number of books. Nancy, a folklorist wrote about the hammered dulcimer and about
musical instrument making in New York in earlier centuries. Nora, a medical
anthropologist, has written a classic account of sign-language on Nantucket as
well as volumes about third-world medicine. And then there's Eve's journalism
(not yet in hardcover). If we look to the descendants of Isaiah's father, we can
include Hiram C's book on global justice.

I bet there are other books -- I've lost track of many members of the extended
family.

Also:  my sister-in-law Ellen's book on the internet; my daughter-in-law's
writings on advanced technology, and probably all sorts of other things by non-
genetic family members.           I have no statistics, but I'd guess
there's a higher concentration of published authors in our family than in most.
Is there a gene for scribbling?

It's interesting to me that except for the one novel, there are no other
stories, poetry, screenplays.Our inheritance: facts rather than fantasy.

Title: Seven Years Later and Still Going Strong
Date: May 08, 2006

Here's a letter that I wrote to the local newspaper. It appeared in 1999 when
AGGP retired.

"I have read all sorts of commentary in this paper about the public school
system -- letters from parents, students, board members and from both grudging
and supporting taxpayers -- but I can't ever remember reading a letter from the
spouse of a teacher. So here's the perspective of a person who has sat on the
sidelines for almost forty years.

'My wife, AGGP, retired this June from a career in teaching secondary
mathematics that began at Warren Junior High School in Newton, Massachusetts,
in 1960 and continued in the local schools, initially at the junior high school
level and since 1977 at BHS.

'In my considered opinion, public school teachers, especially secondary school
teachers, rank among the genuine heroes of American society -- right up there
with hospice nurses, smoke-jumpers, and astronauts.

'Consider the conditions of employment. Perhaps readers of this letter can
bring themselves to think back to their own youth, or possibly they can remind
themselves what it was like to share a home with one or two young people.
Remember the mood-swings and the erratic behavior. Then try to extrapolate from
this recollection and imagine two thousand energetic adolescents crowded into an
ungracious old building where the air is always too hot, too cold, or too fetid.
Imagine a world in which the girls are slightly more rounded and boys just a bit
hairier on Tuesday than they were on Monday. Two thousand hormone-fueled young
people who are so supercharged that they can't make it from history to English
without playing keep-away with each other's shoes; whose normal mode of greeting
is to shoulder their best friends into a bank of lockers. It is a world of games
and exuberance but I'm sorry to say that it is also a world of troubles -- of
cliques, of alcohol and drug abuse, of private pain and of public disorder. And
yet five times a day, five days a week, an accomplished teacher manages to keep
thirty or so of these young ones focused for fifty minutes on conic sections or
sinusoidal graphs.

'A high school is also a place of increasing expectations and shrinking
resources. Five teachers in an office suitable for one. Larger and larger
classes. it was only a few years ago that BHS's mathematics department could
employ a para-professional to xerox the exams and keep track of the textbooks
and calculators and overhead projectors. Not too long ago there was released
time for a department chairperson to make the schedules and screen prospective
teachers and advise students. No longer: the public as said, "cut out the fat,"
and has decided that teachers can handle these chores between classes.

'What happens after school is out for the day? Piles of exams and notebooks and
homework to be read and returned tomorrow. Lessons to be prepared. I have seen
with my own eyes that it is ordinary for a teacher to put in two solid ten-hour
days on the weekend. And the phone calls. I'd be willing to wager that there are
several hundred people reading this letter who have called our home between 5
p.m and 9 p.m. because Amber or Zack has stopped attending classes and hasn't
handed in homework for a week, or just "can't get" hyperboles, or will have to
miss school next week because of a family ski trip.

'And what of that much-vaunted summer vacation? In my experience, the first half
is spent in a state of profound collapse, and the second spent gearing up for
the the one hundred and fifty new students who will roll in come August.

'But let me report on AGGP's response to working conditions that would crush
mortals not as strong as your heroic secondary school teacher. "I love my
functions class. My algebra students are trying so hard. My basic students are
great. They did a splendid job on matrices. I have such wonderful kids this
year."

'Is it a good job?  For those who are fortunate enough to have a genuine
calling, as AGGP has so clearly had, and who possess tremendous physical
stamina, and who can look with amusement rather than horror at an infected
navel-ring, it's great; for others, better to choose an easier profession.

'And what are the rewards for four decades of teaching?  There is a warm
retirement ceremony and a letter from someone in human resources, a plaque and a
handshake and a very modest pension (health insurance not included).

'But then there are the rewards that truly matter. The first is the pleasure
of knowing that in an "I, me, mine" culture, a teacher has honored the precept
that asks us to promote the general welfare. But more particularly, there's what
happens whenever we stand in line at the movies or take a walk on the mall.
"Oh, Mrs. P. You don't remember me, but I was in your algebra class a few years
ago. I've been meaning to write to you and thank you. I learned so much in your
class. Now I'm a doctor/engineer/chemist/businessperson." And not regularly, but
every once in a while: "Oh, Mrs. P. You'll never guess. I'm a teacher now. it's
exhausting but I love it. You're my model. And someday I hope to be as good a
teacher as you."'

Title: Angels and Fools
Date: May 12, 2006

"Earth Angel," by Jesse Belvin's Penguins, offered, or seemed at the time to
offer, a succinct and accurate distillation of relations between the sexes. The
song appeared in 1954, when I was a vulnerable 15-year-old, and was a monster
hit, perhaps because of its ideological clarity. "Earth Angel" is of the genre
that has lately come to be called "doo-wop"; in the P. S. 217 schoolyard, we
just called it "juke-box music." Here's a pithy stanza: "Earth angel, earth
angel, will you be mine/ My darling dear, love you all the time./ I'm just a
fool, a fool in love with you." The heart of the matter, and the essence of life
as we knew it -- the simple-minded, retro-Victorian doctrine that  girls are
angels, boys are fools.

Looking back, I have no doubt that such an oppressive formula was painful for
girls. It must have been hard for young women who knew themselves to be flesh
and blood to pretend to be angelic. But I didn't concern myself with the effect
of the song on them -- girls were clearly and obviously different from us. Not
that I knew anything at all about female culture; the world in which I lived was
rigidly segregated by gender. I didn't have sisters and while the guys talked
obsessively and ignorantly about girls, we almost never talked with them. Even
in the high school lunchroom, girls sat to one side, boys the other. On the
stoop, and In the schoolyard and the drugstore, we talked baseball, flipped
cards, played softball and basketball and stickball, and practiced spitting
for distance. I didn't have a clue what girls were doing -- probably at home
starching their crinolines. It was therefore easy to believe what "literature"
told us: girls were or should be beautiful, aloof, distant, polite, ethereal,
sugar and spice and everything nice, and certainly not sexual -- in short,
angels. Boys, on the other hand, were not just nasty and foul-mouthed, as we
knew from first hand experience, but also pathetic, filled with longings that
they gratified imperfectly several times a day, fumbling, awkward, big-eared,
pimpled, and sloppy. The girls were all Bettys and Veronicas -- desirable but
unattainable. Perhaps in better neighborhoods there was an occasional Archy, but
at the corner of Newkirk and Coney Island, there were only Jugheads. We were, in
brief, exactly what "Earth Angel" had described: anguished adolescent fools.

The notion that girls were unburdened by the flesh took a big hit when I
found myself in one of those lower-level high school English classes where
the disorder was such that weeks would go by without the teacher attempting a
single lesson. Two very young but very tough girls (huge hair, pounds of makeup,
stiletto heels, and bras so pointy that they could a bore a hole in the chest
of any guy brave enough to risk an embrace) were discussing a "health" class in
which chastity had been advocated by one of the maiden-lady teachers. One of
the girls whispered: "She should take up a candle and see how it feels." Whoa,
daddy! And then, a few days after I arrived at college, on a dark, moonless
night, I overheard one "older" woman say to another, "there must be a mile of
cock on this campus and I can't get six inches." At the sound of those words,
"angels" all over America plunged to earth.

And a few months afterwards, "fool," too, gave up the ghost.

Date: May 13, 2006

On March 10 of this year, I registered an objection to use of the word "within"
in sportscaster-slang. Here's my complaint: "Why in the living heck do they
say that the Nuggets are "within" two points of the Lakers?  "Within" means
less than than the proclaimed margin -- 1.9 points perhaps. Why not say that
the Nuggets are two points behind?  Or trailing by two points?  But not
-- goodness gracious -- 'within'."  Now, at the website Language Log, an
accomplished young linguist, Benjamin Zimmer, has independently offered a
theory of the origin of this idiom. He claims that "within" is short for "pull
within," as in the case of a rower plying his oars to literally "pull" within a
certain distance from his opponent. Over time, he says, "pull within" migrated
from sports such as racing and rowing, which measure advantage in distance, to
sports such as baseball and basketball, which measure advantage in discrete
numbers, and where, he concedes, "the metaphorical fit was not exact." It's an
interesting theory, and it might very well be correct. It's consoling to imagine
that there's a reason for the irrational use of "within."

Zimmer is less persuasive when he moves from linguistics to chronology. 
He claims that "it became common by the mid-20th century for announcers and
reporters to talk about teams pulling (to) within a certain number of runs,
points, goals, or even games in the standings." He offers no evidence for the
"mid-20th century" assertion. I can't say that my memory supports his version of
history. I've been listening to basketball games on the radio since just after
World War II, when the NBA succeeded the old BAA, and I'm moderately sure that
I didn't hear the idiom "within two points" until the 1980s at the earliest. It
was an unpleasant innovation in language that stuck painfully in my ear. To the
best of my recollection, "within" was the relatively recent invention of Marv
Albert  -- one of his limited repertoire of linguistic tics. Others: "from
downtown," "served up a facial," " yesss," "a spec-tac-ular move."

Marv Albert, it may be remembered, was a protege of the late great Marty
Glickman, sprinter and sportscaster, and (regular readers of these essaylets
will be delighted to learn) as far as I know the only genuine celebrity to
have set foot in the fabled P. S. 217 schoolyard. Glickman would not have been
proud of Albert, who is less well known for his creativity in language than for
his strange sexual exploits. In 1997, Albert plead guilty to sexual assault.
He had proved himself to be a man without a tad of castration anxiety and of
exceptional, perhaps unparalleled, courage, when he first bit a woman fifteen
times on the back, drawing blood, and then forced her to perform fellatio. A
spec-tac-ular move!! Just a couple of months after the Albert nonchalance,
Mike Tyson bit Evander Holyfield on both ears, taking quite a chunk out of one
of them -- the left, I believe. I had high hopes for a great TV moment: the
sportscaster Marv Albert interviews the boxer Iron Mike. Two Brooklyn boys
discuss the theory and practice of oral incorporation. Yesss!

May 19: On Language Log, Benjamin Zimmer responds to my reminiscence that
"within two points" was a creation of the 1980s. He offers comprehensive
evidence that the idiom "pull within" was in print as long ago as the 19th
century. Although he hasn't offered a chronology for "within" without a
preceding "pull," and hasn't discussed radio basketball (how would he access
radio archives, even if they exist?), he's certainly a thorough and imaginative
researcher. But just because a phrase can be found deep in the archives
somewhere, doesn't mean that it was in common oral usage.

Title: Adolf Award for Worst Person of the Century
Date: May 18, 2006

The winner of the Adolf for worst person of the century goes to Pope Urban
II. The century in question is the first one of the previous millennium, or
1000-1100. Like many other Adolf award winners, Urban perpetrated evil deeds
that have continued to provoke hatred, war and suffering even to the present
day.

HIs principal crime: Pope Urban fabricated a litany of Muslim atrocities in
order to incite Christians to wrest Jerusalem from a “race” that he called
“absolutely alien to God.” In November, 1095, in Clermont in the south of
France, Urban told an eager audience that Muslims had circumcised Christians and
spread their unspeakable blood on baptismal fonts; that they had “cut open the
navels of others, tearing out their vital organs” and that they had committed
appalling atrocities upon women “of which it is more evil to speak than to
keep silent.”

Some say that his catalog of mutilations and barbarities was based on faulty
intelligence but most think it was his own invention. Urban did not just incite
and condone warfare, he sanctified it. His crusade would be a pilgrimage --
and therefore a form of penance. Combatants who died in its course would be
purified. God, it was claimed, has instituted “holy wars” so that knights
might find a new path to salvation.

Roughly one hundred thousand crusaders answered his call and set out for the
Levant to take Jerusalem from the infidels.On the way, they warmed to their
task by conducting genocidal attacks of unprecedented brutality upon the Jewish
communities of the Rhineland (communities that had been in place before the
advent of Christianity). These quasi-sanctioned raids are now known as “the
first holocaust.”

The passage of the crusaders to the middle East was made easier because
the Muslims were divided into two factions --Shiite and Sunni -- that were
perpetually at daggers drawn. The crusaders laid siege to Antioch in October,
1099, and when they took the city, slaughtered its entire Muslim population.
In possession of Antioch, they found themselves entirely surrounded by
hostile armies. But God was on their side. The timely intervention of
“countless armies with white horses… led by the saints George, Mercurius,
and Demetrius“ allowed them to fight their way out of the city.

The crusaders headed south and in midsummer of 1099 besieged Jerusalem. Muslim
defenders taunted the crusaders by setting up crosses and urinating on them;
in response, the Christians catapulted the bodies of captured Muslims over
the walls. When Jerusalem fell, the celebration was euphoric. The Provencal
crusader Raymond of Aguilers reported that “some of the pagans were mercifully
beheaded, others were tortured for a long time and burned to death in searing
flames. Piles of heads, hands and feet lay in the houses and streets. Infants
were seized by the soles of their feet from their mothers’ laps or their
cradles, and dashed against the wall, breaking their necks.” Covered with
gore, weighed down with plunder, “rejoicing and weeping from excessive
gladness," the crusaders "worshipped at the Sepulchre of Jesus the Savior.”

Although Pope Urban II died just two weeks after the fall and sack of Jerusalem,
there is no question but that his Adolf was well and truly earned and that his
legacy lives on.

Title: The Holy Lance
Date: May 20, 2006

In 1098, crusaders were trapped inside the walls of Antioch and their mission to
capture Jerusalem was gravely jeopardized. When things were at their worst, one
of the crusaders -- a Provencal peasant named Peter Bartholomew -- was visited
by St. Andrew, who revealed to him that the lance with which the Roman soldier
Longinus had pierced the side of Jesus was hidden in Antioch's Basilica of St.
Peter. St. Andrew informed Peter that "he who carries this lance into battle
shall never be overcome by the enemy."

Bartholemew's claim met with initial skepticism because it was an established
fact that the Holy Lance lay safely in the relic collection of the Byzantine
emperor in Constantinople. Nevertheless, the authorities agreed to investigate.
Twelve men dug until overcome by exhaustion at the spot to which Bartholomew
pointed, but they could find nothing. Finally, Peter himself dropped into
the hole and brought forth a shard of metal. "All across the city there was
boundless rejoicing." Suddenly invigorated by the possession of this powerful
relic, their morale euphoric, the crusaders broke out of the city, overcame the
armies that surrounded them, and proceeded to Jerusalem.

Some months afterward, Peter Bartholomew had another vision: that the entire
crusade  was compromised because some of its soldiers were polluted by pride or
cowardice. He announced that he himself would choose and put to death soldiers
of the cross who were steeped in sin. There was a backlash against Peter and the
authenticity of the Holy Lance was challenged.

Peter decided to prove his truth in a trial by ordeal. After fasting for several
days, he ran, carrying the Holy Lance, between two piles of burning olive
branches four feet high and thirteen feet long. He was severely burned and died
several days later. The Holy Lance lost its magic and morale plummeted. The
crusaders were forced to seek an alternative. The ingenious Raymond of Toulouse
dispatched his follower Hugh of Monteil to Latakia to retrieve a fragment of the
cross on which Jesus had been crucified. In the end, the discrediting of the
Holy Lance proved to be only a temporary setback.

The facts in this and the previous essaylet come from Thomas Asbridge, The First
Crusade, a New History (Oxford University Press, 2004).

Title: My Cyberfriends
Date: May 22, 2006

People out there misjudge me. Marcia Wainwright, for example, is certain that I
need to lose thirty pounds in thirty days. She proposes that I use her "miracle
African weight loss herbs." OK, maybe I'm a few pounds above my fighting weight,
but certainly not thirty -- what the heck is she thinking? Joellie Adella is
concerned about my hair loss situation. Elsie Bertie thinks that I need fuller
and more erotic lips. Susan van Elk wants to help me discover the benefits of a
healthy colon. The "enormity" of my "manhood" is a worry of Penelope French; its
lack of "rockhardness" seems to make Hoodiea Gordoni mighty eager to come to my
aid. Jacklyn Hughes feels that my sperm count is low; she can help (but how? and
for goodness sake-- why?). Thank you very much, guys, but I don't really need
your assistance: hair, lips, colon, etc. are all doing just fine.

There's more:  Caroline McPherson and William McWilliams both think that I need
to accessorize: she suggests "bling watches and designer handbags" while he
proposes "Rolex replicas." I don't know what Natasasha (sic) thinks she  knows
about me, but, frankly, I'm not especially anxious to employ her services as a
"screwbuddy"; nor do I welcome the efforts of Ms. Ginger Snapz -- possibly a
pseudonym -- who has big surprises in store for me and whose specialty is pole-
dancing. These ladies have a wrong impression. So too does Teressa Brandel,
who offers to solve all my problems by introducing me to "horny teen barnyard
slutzz." Not this grandpa.

Considering all the negativity, it's good to know that there are not only
Russian princesses but also a former Nigerian cabinet official out there who
are eager to improve my finances. They both have "unbelievable offers" for me.
Sure I have to send a few thousand bucks to an offshore bank, but I'm promised a
return of great enormity on an investment that is rockhard.

Title: Life with Gilbert and Sullivan
Date: June 01, 2006

When I was no more than a hemidemisemiquaver, I would listen attentively as my
mother sat at her old Hardman piano and sang ditties by Gilbert and Sullivan. I
believe that the first song I ever learned “by heart” was “I’m called
Little Buttercup” with its still mysterious “pretty polonies.” In 1947,
when the D’Oyly Carte company made its first post-war American tour, I was
taken to see a performance of H. M. S. Pinafore. I was utterly transported. No
subsequent theatrical experience has worked equivalent magic. I still think that
it’s a little miracle that I saw with my own rapt eyes such legendary Savoyard
stalwarts as Ella Halman, Darrell Fancourt, and Martyn Green.

Pinafore was the only stage play that I saw until I was past adolescence and
out of the house. What could have prompted such uncharacteristic extravagance
on my parents' part? Whatever the cause, the result was that my infatuation
with Gilbert and Sullivan's operas was early established. The attachment was
difficult to sustain because there was no family phonograph; moreover, those
thick, heavy albums of 78s would have broken the budget. I was fortunate to
possess a tattered old anthology of G  & S songs from which I would pick out
tunes as best I could.

In college I had a roommate who was a genuine savoyardophile and who arrived
with a "hi-fi" and an extensive collection of ‘long playing’ records. I
took advantage of his resources and his knowledge. During the fifties and
sixties I attended performances of the full G & S repertory in various amateur
and semi- pro productions-–even a rare Utopia Ltd. at the Loeb Drama Center
in Cambridge. I also acquired a treasured collection of D’Oyly Carte and
Glyndebourne performances on vinyl. During the seventies and eighties, I
couldn’t clean the house or cook a meal without the assistance of Sir Arthur.
But turntables and 33s went the way of 78s, and then the vinyl itself came to be
sequestered in plastic tubs in the basement.

I was G & S-less for a decade or so, but Topsy-Turvy (1999), the great Mike
Leigh film, rekindled an unfaded love. Now, sixty years after my first Pinafore,
I’m compiling a new collection of recordings (everything’s out there on CD
if you’re patient). I now own reissues of classic D’Oyly Carte recordings
and also of a sparkling Mikado by the Welsh National Opera. In the fall, the
entire collection will be transferred to the iPod. Who would have guessed that
I'd have gone through four or five new technologies in my lifetime? And yet the
song remains the same.

What is the attraction? Gilbert and Sullivan, I think, gave me early
authorization to be silly. The operas licensed criticism of oppressive or
irrational social norms. Everything was fair game. Inasmuch as I was raised in
a rigidly conformist society, the G & S precedent was a great liberation. I’m
absolutely convinced that a great big hunk of my sense of humor was formed
around a Gilbertian core.

When I was a boy, it was the clever patter songs that most struck me. They’re
still good, and some are brilliant. Bunthorne’s soliloquy in Patience,
in which he confesses that “he’s not fond of uttering platitudes/ In
stained glass attitudes” is as fully on target now as it was in 1881. Simply
substitute tired modish Derridadaism for the "high aesthetic line," and “the
meaning doesn’t matter if it’s only idle chatter of a transcendental kind”
jumps right out at you.

But nowadays, it’s not Gilbert's free-standing wit but Sullivan's glorious
ensembles that cause the shiver of delight. Instances: Iolanthe's “Oh, many a
man in friendship’s name”; Ko-ko, Pooh-Bah, and Pish-Tush singing “To sit
in solemn silence in a dull dark dock”; in Ruddigore, the trio “In sailing
o’er life’s ocean wide,/ No doubt your heart should be your guide/ But it
is awkward when you find/ A heart that does not know its mind.” And many
others, including, certainly, the quartet from Yeoman of the Guard: “Strange
adventure, maiden wedded/ To a groom she’s never seen.” Still another
transcendent moment: the high silliness in Pirates, when the assembled choruses
kneel to sing the resplendent, ridiculous: "Hail poetry, thou heaven-born
maid…  All hail, divine emollient." I think that the touchstone of all
touchstones is a truly wondrous brief duet in Iolanthe, when the lovesick Lords
Tolloler and Mountararat, tenor and baritone, rejected by Phyllis, who chooses a
simple shepherd over their dignities, leave the stage singing "Neath this blow/
Worse than stab of dagger/ Though we mo-/ Mentarily stagger,/ In each heart,/
Proud are we innately,/ Let’s depart, dignified and stately.”

In addition to the satire, and the splendid music, G &S also supplies great big
helpings of joy. G & S manage to persuade me, at least for the duration of the
play, to give credence to “rapture, rapture,” and that “pleasures come
in endless series,” and “joy unbounded,” and “laughing song and merry
dance,” and “happier than any/ A pound to a penny,/ A lover is when he/
Embraces his bride."

There’s much to deplore in Gilbert’s creations: nasty racism, an
insufferable obsession with class (embraced even as it appears to be refuted),
jingoism, which is sometimes satirized but often (as in the faux-japonisme
of The Mikado) unconsciously accepted, as well as the constant distasteful
bludgeoning of middle-age women. But just as we forgive Shylock in order to
embrace King Lear, so we must suspend our moral indignation to revel in the best
of Gilbert.

Last week, two of the grandchildren visited for a few days. We rented the DVD of
the Central Park Kevin Kline-Linda Ronstadt Pirates. The kids were attentive,
engaged. Next time they visit: more Gilbert and Sullivan. Perhaps we can plant a
savoyardian seed.

Title: Everything is Crepuscular
Date: June 02, 2006

When I encountered an excerpt from wunderkind J. S. Foer's Everything is
Illuminated in the New Yorker, I was dazzled. The writing was witty, focused,
intelligent, and emotionally rich.

Now I've read the whole book, and I'm deeply divided about this Jekyll-Hydish
performance. The good parts are still excellent. Jonfen's Ukrainian adventures
in search of Augustine are beautifully managed  -- although I must say that the
joke about Alex's English, so wonderful in the excerpt, quickly grew wearisome.
But the interspersed history of the shtetl of Trachimbrod is just plain bad.
It's boring, embarrassing, and imitative, consisting not only of helpings of
I. B. Singer and of the least attractive aspects of Marquez and his numerous
unmagical epigonoi, but also of an unhealthy dollop of supermarket-checkout
prose. Can Foer discipline his talent, find his own voice, and move into the
big leagues?  It would be tragic if he continues to indulge his genius for
imitation. Or perhaps he'll be both good and bad, like Larry McMurtry, who's
written world-class novels (Leaving Cheyenne,  Lonesome Dove) but has also
squandered his talent on pounds and pounds of glossy trash. Time will tell.

Title: How to Deal With Enormous, Man-Eating Pythons
Date: June 07, 2006

A few weeks ago, I noted that in The Songlines, Bruce Chatwin made the case that
early humans were prey more than they were predators. Now I've read a new book
on the subject: Donna Hart and Robert W. Sussman, Man the Hunted (Westview,
2005).

The book's title is a bit misleading because it concentrates on primates other
than modern man. Nevertheless, it was good to be reminded of the circumstances
under which our hominid ancestors lived. Seven million years ago and until
recently, our diminutive forbears were forest dwellers who were pursued by huge
crocodilians, outsized eagles, packs of hunting dogs, a variety of giant cats,
and hyenas the size of modern lions who had jaws strong enough to crunch human
skulls in a single bite.

And also man-eating snakes. In the course of their discussion of snakes,
the authors of Man the Hunted report on the instructions provided to early
missionaries to Africa on the proper response to pythons. (A 25-foot-long
reticulated python can weigh up to 300 pounds.)

Remember not to run away; the python can run faster. The thing to do is to lie
flat on the ground on your back with your feet together, arms to the sides
and head well down. The python will then try to push its head under you,
experimenting at every possible point. Keep calm, one wiggle and he will get
under you, wrap his coils round you and crush you to death. After a time the
python will get tired of this and will probably decide to swallow you without
the usual preliminaries. He will very likely begin with one of your feet. Keep
calm. You must let him swallow your foot. It is quite painless and will take a
long time. If you lose your head and struggle he will quickly whip his coils
around you. If you keep calm, he will go on swallowing. Wait patiently until
he has swallowed about up to your knee. Then carefully take out your knife and
insert it into the distended side of his mouth and with a quick rip slit him up.

Well-meant advice, I'm sure, but perhaps difficult to follow. Suppose you're
just not in the mood to allow the python such liberties with your person.
Suppose you've forgotten to bring your knife; suppose the python decides to
start with your head rather than a foot. Suppose you involuntarily wiggle just a
teensy bit. Suppose you just don't feel that it's a good day to be engulfed.

I think that, on the whole, running away and screaming at the top of your
lungs is a more sensible reaction. But then again, I never signed up to be a
missionary.

Title: The Colorado Rockies and the Christianists
Date: June 13, 2006

From 1947, when Jackie Robinson broke the barrier, until 1957, when Walter
O’Malley hijacked the franchise to Los Angeles and cut the heart out of
Brooklyn, the Dodgers represented the best of America. While the United States
remained legally segregated by race and fractured by religion and ethnicity, it
was the Brooklyn Dodgers who offered the nation a vision that was more inclusive
and more just.  One year before Harry Truman issued an executive order banning
segregation in the armed forces, eight years before Rosa Parks refused to give
up her seat on a Montgomery bus, eighteen years before the enactment of federal
statutes protecting the right to vote, the Brooklyn Dodgers hired Jack Roosevelt
Robinson to play first base. And on an unforgettable day in April in Cincinnati,
when racist fans hurled taunts at Robinson, Pee Wee strolled over and put his
arm on Jackie’s shoulder.  It was an iconic moment and one that transformed
not just baseball, and sports, but the world.

The boys of summer made us proud to be democratic, proud to be Americans. All
good men were Brooklynites, at least some of the time. Moreover, the Dodgers
were talented: they won five pennants during those years, and, in 1955, they
won the world championship. Half a century later the Dodgers are still the most
loved, most chronicled, most mythologized team in history.

What will be written about the Colorado Rockies fifty years from now? 
The Rockies’ watchword is not inclusion but exclusivity. They are a
team not of destiny, but of narrow sectarianism. They search for and
hire players of “character”-- which means players of their particular
"Christian" denomination. Their general manager, Dan O’Dowd, is thoroughly
delusional. "You look at some of the moves we made and didn't make. You look
at some of the games we're winning. Those aren't just a coincidence. God has
definitely had a hand in this." A hand in what?  In a history of failure?  In
a losing record?  Last place in their division once again?  God takes sides in
baseball games? Either God is bush league with bat and glove or O’Dowd is a
one helluva sloppy theologian.

O’Dowd, along with club president Keli McGregor and manager Clint Hurdle,
join together for telephone prayer sessions. Is it possible that they hold
on to their jobs not because they are capable of assembling a winning team,
but because they subscribe to the same beliefs as owner Charlie Monfort (“I
believe God sends signs, and we're seeing those")?

Baseball is not about religion. It’s about 95-mile-an-hour fastballs, about
hard sliders, about come-from-behind ninth-inning victories.  Colorado
taxpayers didn’t fund three-quarters of the cost of Coors-–Coors!!! -- Field
so that evangelical ballplayers could testify to their faith.

And what a curious faith! The Rockies depart from established Christian thinking
and veer toward the banal new cult of “prosperity gospel.” Reformation
Calvinism had asserted that an omnipotent deity elects some for salvation and
consigns many more to damnation. Believers sometimes understood material
success to be a sign (but never, ever a reward) of salvation. The Rockies’
unChristian theology turns Calvinism upside-down and defies common sense when
it proclaims that faith leads directly to base hits. (As a matter of fact,
“prosperity gospel” seems to work better for the capitalist owners than for
the players. The team loses, but the franchise increases in value).

There's no hint of supernatural intervention in the Rockies unremarkable record.
If the Rockies were to run away from the opposition, it would indeed constitute
a "miracle" -- but a miracle only in the common secular sense of the word. It
would be a miracle indeed if an incompetent skinflint ownership could somehow
stumble into success.

Are the Colorado Rockies the most foolish, fatuous, and vain organization in the
mountain west?  Not in the least. There's a church in Broomfield that has a
website where “you can send your prayers and encouragement for the Rockies by
clicking here.” Click for Christ. Good Lord!

I wonder if the Rockies ever knew, or if they would like to learn, who it was
who said “do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves
the world, the love of the Father is not in him." If they could answer this
question,they'd be in a position to recognize that there's less real religion
in the entire history of the Colorado Rockies than in five seconds of Reese and
Robinson.

Title: A Fish Story
Date: August 20, 2006

The pond, once brimful of brekkekkek-kexing, has become virtually silent. What's
happened to all the frogs?  Is it acid rain?  Or is it the great blue herons
who patrol the shoreline morning and evening?

I think we've located the culprit. The pond has been colonized by catfish,
specifically, by the brown bullhead or horned pout.  Omnivores that they are,
the pouts must have been dining on those gelatinous strings of frog eggs, or
perhaps even hunting down the tadpoles. At least that's the theory.

To reproduce, pouts scoop out a nest near the shoreline and deposit a cluster
of eggs. Then they hover nearby for a week or so, fanning the area with their
tails.  One pair made a nest just where we enter the pond to swim and they were
guarding their clutch a little too aggressively, so I decided to take action.
There I was, spade in hand and poised to strike. I felt as though I was a figure
in a diorama at the natural history museum -- "Paleolithic Man Hunted Fish with
Sharpened Sticks."  My technique might have been primitiive, but nevertheless
I managed to nail one of the ugly suckers -- a twelve inch guy with a flat face
covered with nasty barbels -- and a few minutes later I planted him in the
vegetable garden, where he's now recycling himself into tomatoes. Later in the
summer, a guest caught a second pout with a net.  More juicy red tomatoes.

But what about the hatchlings and fingerlings?  Perhaps the herons are on our
side.  Meanwhile, we'll put out a call for a fisherman. Although horned pouts
are hideous, they're reputed to be good table fare -- not my table, however.

We're looking forward to a froggy renaissance.

September 5.  I've now read in Scientific American that herons kill and eat
catfish. They spear them with their long beaks, carry them to dry ground, and
repeatedly wound them. Then they swallow them whole. So when the herons come to
visit the pond, we'll have to maintain both distance and silence and let them
work. It's good to know that the great blues are our allies.

Title: An Iris Anecdote
Date: September 11, 2006

In my Vermont garden, I grow a number of different varieties of German (also
called bearded) irises. One variety -- a bicolor I inherited a decade ago from
my sister-- had died. I put a spade into the ground to see if I could discover
the source of the problem, and I found that the rhizomes had deteriorated to a
loathsome smelly unholy mess the consistency of overripe bananas. It was a truly
disgusting situation and one that I had never encountered before. For the sake
of garden sanitation, I dug out the decay and some surrounding soil and carried
the filth to the local dump.

Later in the summer, I read this sentence in a garden book: "we cannot confirm
the folk wisdom that bacterial soft rot in irises can be caused by horse
manure."  I knew that rot in iris rhizomes could be spread by iris borers, but
these irises were borer-free. On the other hand, I had been working the soil
with load after generous load of horse manure. So perhaps there's some truth to
the derided superstition. In any case, since I switched to fertilizing irises
with the abundant droppings of sheep I haven't had a recurrence of the disease.
But then again, I haven't been able to re-test the particular susceptible
variety--it being an iris now extinct in my garden.

On the second Monday of September,1956, I found my way to Rockefeller Hall and
my very first college class. It was a laboratory section of Chemistry 105.

There were more than a thousand people enrolled in the course.

We had all taken a mathematics aptitude test, and I had been placed in an
advanced section of twenty so-called mathematically gifted students.  (Only
rarely in my lifetime have my skills been so badly misjudged.)  In my section
there were nineteen young men, all armed with slide rules -- a device, now
blissfully extinct, that I never mastered -- and one very pretty brown-haired
brown-eyed maid (still sixteen, I was later to discover) with an athletic step
and a musical voice. The guys, brandishing their slide rules, clustered around
the young lady-- bees, or drones rather, drawn to the solitary flower. Many were
the offers to help her insert her thistle tube into her cork. Alas, I could
offer no assistance, introductory chemistry class being both the alpha and omega
of my scientific career.

Nevertheless, in despite of my laboratorical inadequacies, this sunny September
day fifty years later, I'm still married to that brown-haired brown-eyed young
woman.

So today we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the first sighting.

Title: Bush Read "Three Shakespeares"
Date: September 13, 2006

More outrageous even than "mission accomplished" is the absurd claim that,
during 2006, our very own president, George W. Bush, has read fifty-three books.
It's a fool's game to try to re-invent the class dunce as an intellectual, but
they're trying.

There's some incriminating videotape floating around the "internets" in which
POTUS, heretofore known to devour only the box scores, boasts that he's an "ek-
a-lek-tic" (his pronunciation!) reader. Not only has he been laying into Camus,
he's also read "three Shakespeares." He's both full o' shit and unidiomatic.
Native speakers of English don't say "three Shakespeares"; they say they've
read "three Shakespeare plays."  Next the Great Decider will tell us he's just
hustled over to the Kennedy Center where he listened to three Bachs.

The White House press office has supplied the names of two of the plays to which
Bush lays claim  -- Hamlet and Macbeth. Was there a third play?  If there was,
it's name, like the third murderer and the fabulous WMDs, is lost to history.

If W. had actually turned the pages of Hamlet and Macbeth, he might have noticed
that in both plays, a bad man has become head of state by extralegal means. 
Claudius poured a bit of poison into the ears of Hamlet's father and Macbeth
stabbed Duncan. Neither ruler thrives in his ill-gained position, and neither
has been able to repent his evil deed. Claudius can't bring himself to pray and
Macbeth's way has fallen into the sere and yellow leaf. Fat chance that our
unelected president would notice the parallel to his own situation -- or that
he would be moved to repentance and renunciation. In the world of literature,
there's justice:  Claudius is run through with a sword and Macbeth is beheaded.
No such luck in real life.

And what about the mysterious third play that the Uniter claims to have read? 
If he were looking for parallels to his own career, he could flatter himself by
reading one of the three plays that dramatize the life of King Henry V, in which
a scapegrace prince reforms, gives up alcohol and screwing around, and becomes
the conqueror of France. The parallel is inexact, because Henry enjoyed some
traits of character that George distinctly lacks: courage, eloquence, and the
willingness to endure the same hardships as the soldiers who serve under him.
A better parallel to George II is the succeeding Henry-- Henry VI-- a pious,
immature, weak man unable to control his powerful advisers.

In truth, the character in the thirty-seven "Shakespeares" whom Bush most
resembles is neither Claudius, Macbeth, nor either of the Henrys, but Lepidus
in Anthony and Cleopatra. Shakespeare depicts Lepidus as a man who's happened
into a position far beyond his natural abilities. He's way over his head in
the Second Triumvirate, not at all of the stature of the heroic but flawed
Anthony or the efficient, masterful Caesar. Even the servants recognize that
Lepidus is simply bush-league. One of them tells the audience that "to be
called into a huge sphere, and not to be seen to move in't, are the holes
where eyes should be, which pitifully disaster the cheeks."  This is a bit
of Shakespearean obscurity certainly beyond the budding intellectuality of
incurious George. It means simply that Lepidus must fill a position as huge as a
Ptolemaic sphere, but he can't because he's tiny and makes no impression at all,
and as a consequence his circle is as vacant as an eye-socket that lacks an eye.
Shakespeare does not think well of Lepidus and soon allows him to be carried off
the stage, drunk. So much for morally and intellectually pitiful men who try to
play with the big boys!

Bush might be even less than a Lepidus, who, when he's not drunk, speaks
plainly enough. Perhaps a better comparison is to one of Shakespeare's braggart
soldiers, like Parolles in All's Well That Ends Well, or to one of the
malapropizing clowns -- as for example Much Ado About Nothing's Dogberry. 
Dogberry is given to such Bushlingo moments as "is our whole dissembly
appeared" and "be vigitant."  And other illiteracies.  But it was beyond even
Shakespeare to imagine a world in which a clown could become head of state.  To
him, such a reversal of the natural order would have been unthinkable.

Title: My New Tooth
Date: September 15, 2006

Toward the end of July, while I was in Lyme, New Hampshire celebrating a
friend's third marriage, I bit into a fancy cracker that was topped with a
fragment of sun-dried tomato. With my tongue I felt what I assumed to be small
stone. I spit it into my hand and after a few disorienting moments realized that
I was looking at one of my very own teeth. Number 10, in dentist's language,
upper left front.

I was shocked;  I'm not used to teeth falling out of my head-- especially so
undramatically. No pain, no cracking sound. I put the tooth in my pocket and
found a mirror to inspect myself -- mighty vampirish, I thought.

The next day I saw a dentist down in Thetford and was advised that I needed a
root canal, followed by a "post and crown," which sounded less like a dental
process than a London pub. A week or so later and I was off to White River to
a root canal guy, who hummed Joanie Mitchell songs while digging into my mouth
and kept checking the weather to see if he could get in a golf game before the
rains came. I asked him why the procedure was so damn expensive and he muttered
something mighty unconvincing about the "level of technology."  What with the
abscess and all it took two long visits for him to finish rooting around in my
canal.  And then one day I took a drink of homemade lemonade and felt another
tooth fall out, but -- false alarm -- it was just a lemon pip.

The root canal didn't do anything about the big empty space in my head.  I've
heard that there are some ladies who find that other-side-of-the-tracks look
quite attractive, but in all honestly it didn't seem to do much for my woman. So
back home to Colorado and a visit to still another dentist, who installed a post
and also a temporary artificial tooth and sent me to the "lab" for a "custom
color."  The lab was a surreal experience-- way out in the country in a dumpy
building there's a oversize space where several rows of white-coated-scientist
types with microscopes and very official looking tools sat crafting teeth.
Probably out-of-work sculptors, or possibly impoverished MFA students.

Custom color -- why would I want a custom color?  After the house and the
car, this prosthesis is going to be the most expensive object I own.  I think
it should be gleaming white, not mottled and yellowed like my native teeth.
I'm paying big money, and I want everyone to know that #10 is brand new.  I
wouldn't  buy a new car and immediately dent and scratch it, would I?

Another couple of weeks and I should be all custom-colored, posted, and
crowned.  And from now on I'll remember to stay away from sun-dried tomatoes. 
Dangerous stuff.

September 20.  I've been putting the old tooth under my pillow for a month
now, but no luck.  Apparently the tooth fairy is indifferent to sexagenarian
choppers.

September 28.  The permanent fake tooth has now been installed. I like it
better than the original. It does its job and it's not going to have cavities or
fillings or pain. If I had the cash I'd give thought to a full set.

Title: On Tenure in Colleges and Universities
Date: September 20, 2006

Most people either don't understand academic tenure or regard it as a flagrant
scam -- nothing more than a lifetime cushy job burdened with little work and
rewarded with long summers vacations. Popular wisdom is entirely incorrect.
Tenure is a good deal for those who achieve it and it's a bargain for America.

The conventional defense of tenure is that it protects freedom of speech.
 Professors, it's thought, are natural born dissenters who are likely to
propound unusual ideas, which, unless they're 'dangerous,' should be tolerated.
(Even though it should be obvious that it's only the dangerous ideas that need
protection.)

There's some truth to this proposition. Some jobs have been saved (but those who
remember the McCarthy period know that university administrators often tripped
over themselves to appease the attackers). The professoriat should be encouraged
to dissent -- it's good for the country to encourage divergent and challenging
views. But it's also true that on the whole, professors are not particularly
controversial. If there have been cases in which scientists, or business
faculty, or professors of literature or music have needed the protections of
tenure, they must be rare indeed. Occasionally, very occasionally, a social
scientist says something just a bit too anti-establishment, and then along
comes some yahoo legislator to demand that the dissenter be fired and tenure
be 'investigated.'   Nevertheless, it's hard to make the case that a hundred
thousand faculty in non-controversial fields need to be tenured so that one or
two people a decade can say something outrageous. I myself think that first-
amendment rights as confirmed by the courts are just as good and perhaps better
protection than tenure for dissenting views.

In my opinion, the best justification for tenure is not freedom of speech but
frugality. Let's begin with the self-evident truth that a person who earns
tenure in a respectable institution possesses some very positive intellectual
and psychological traits. While one doesn't have to be a genius to write a
dissertation, one has to be able to amass evidence and structure a logical
argument and write a decent sentence or two. One must be diligent;  one must
be self-motivated (only half of people who finish graduate courses manage
to complete a dissertation); moreover, in the process of securing tenure, a
person gains experience in presenting information to groups and also learns a
great deal about management and mentoring. These various skills are readily
transferable to the private sector of the economy where they would be well
rewarded. But when a person of talent and ability chooses to work in the
academy, he or she forgoes a large part of his potential earning capacity.
 nstead of a high salary, he receives a lower salary plus the security which
comes in the form of tenure. So it's perfectly reasonable to conceive of tenure
as compensation in lieu of cash.

When an accomplished individual accepts tenure and a diminished salary, society
benefits in a number of ways. It hires talent on the cheap, so education becomes
less expensive. If universities had to match private-sector salaries, the cost
of sending a million young adults to universities would become prohibitive.
There's also a less obvious but equally important benefit. Without tenure, only
the independently wealthy would be able to specialize in, say, in old Mayan,
or Tokugawa Japan, or any of thousands of subjects that require concentration
and effort but do not have any particular market value. These important but
exotic subjects would either disappear from the curriculum, or they would
be taught by faculty who would bring to the table the biases of the moneyed
classes.  (This was indeed the case in America before the 1940s when tenure
became institutionalized.)  Faculties would revert again to what they were when
Harvard had its Gold Coast: social clubs for amateurs and coupon-clippers. More
than any other innovation, tenure has produced the modern democratic university,
where faculty can be drawn from any social class.

I don't mean to say that there aren't problems with tenure.  Tenure is
difficult to obtain, but it's also difficult to lose, and faculties could
do a much better job at self-policing. If a professor isn't doing his job,
isn't keeping up with his subject, isn't make a good faith effort to make
a contribution to learning, then he should surrender his claim to lifetime
employment. There certainly is such a thing as "deadwood"-- though much less
of it than popular mythology would claim. But the deal is this:  lifetime
security for a lifetime of learning. Those who don't honor the agreement should
be speedily purged. No free rides for the lazy dogs.  But this caveat aside,
tenure is a fine, successful institution.

American universities have become and still remain the envy of the world; 
the tenureless university would be less innovative, less democratic, and less
distinguished.

Title: Did Roz Chast Attend P. S. 217?
Date: September 21, 2006

Diligent readers of this blague (a "fit audience though few," as John Milton
said in a slightly different context) will remember that I've reported on the
language, the culture and the sexual politics of P. S. 217 and its neighborhood.

Newsflash!! It now appears that P. S. 217 contributed to the worldview of the
century's finest cartoonist, the New Yorker's Roz Chast.

I had long suspected that Roz Chast was a neighborhood girl -- where else but in
darkest Flatbush would a nine-year-old go to bed with "The Big Book of Horrible
Rare Diseases?" The most overt clues to her place of origin are found in the
'cartoon a clef' "Ultima Thule," in which a young girl imagines life in various
exotic non-Flatbush neighborhoods: "Red Hook, which was filled with drunken
sailors, loose women, and stevedores; Flatland, which stretched flatly and
unpopulated, into oblivion; and Sea Gate, with its maze of Venetian canals,
from which, once you entered, you'd never emerge." In the last panel of this
masterpiece, a girl in a green pleated skirt floats freely in outer space: "I
just wanted to see what was on the other side of McDonald Avenue."

McDonald Avenue, during my childhood, was the outer limit of homey Flatbush.
Every once in a while, when I was feeling particularly adventurous, I'd ride
my bicycle across McDonald, but I always hustled back. Two reasons: a) it was
different there -- different architecture, different kinds of stores, different
people, and b) the streets ran at a 45 degree angle to the norm. Very scary,
very 'here be dragons.'

I had a job on McDonald Avenue when I was in high school: I shelved books at the
Kensington Public Library (which was scarcely more than a storefront operation),
but the building was on our side -- the Flatbush side -- of the street. I don't
think that I ever crossed to the foreign side -- why would a sane person want to
do such a thing? So my intuition was that if Roz Chast grasped the mystical end-
of-the-earth aura of McDonald Avenue, she had to have grown up somewhere in the
vicinity of P. S. 217.

More evidence:  In the New Yorker for September 4, there's a Roz Chast
bildungscartoon called "What I Learned." After nursery school, where she was
informed that "if you swallow your gum, your guts get all stuck together, and
you die," our young heroine "went to grade school in [her] neighborhood." And
there's a full panel of a square featureless brick building labeled "P. S.
217."  The building doesn't resemble the P. S. 217 of my memory except for the
concrete schoolyard and the chain-link fences that surround it, but it must be
the real thing. The curriculum is ever-so-familiar: Vasco da Gama, "Our Friend,
Corn," chain-stitching. Although nothing about the compass and the protractor,
for some reason.

I had read that Roz Chast grew up in Brooklyn, and that her parents still lived
in the old neighborhood. Just for fun, I looked up the surname Chast in the
white pages. It's an uncommon name;  in fact, there's just one Chast in all
of richly-populated Brooklyn. Here's the relevant map. The Chast apartment on
Webster Avenue is a block or so from the corner of Newkirk and Coney Island
Avenue where P. S. 217 is located; even more startling -- it's no more than a
couple of hundred feet from East 9 Street, where I lived from age zero to age
17. Case closed.

Roz Chast's genius cannot be circumscribed.  She's the master of the
mock-heroic for which Flatbush is famed; she's to the cartoon what Woody Allen
is to movies -- someone who interprets the world through Brooklynish eyes. She's
the sly queen of kvetchitude. And she's a graduate of fabled P. S. 217. I'm so
proud.

Title: "Geographical Dyslexia," or "Directional Disability," or, People Who Lose Their Way
Date: September 23, 2006

[January 17, 2012.  There are at this moment three pages of comments appended to
this entry, which I wrote almost six years ago. The comments are most
interesting and revealing.  Don't miss 'em -- Vivian].

In The Accidental Tourist (New York [Knopf], 1991), Anne Tyler describes
a malady that, as far as I know had never before been acknowledged in
literature.  All four of her eccentric Leary siblings share "a total inability
to find their way around." Macon Leary, who writes travel books for a living and
is the novel's focal character, christens this trait "geographical dyslexia."

I'm not convinced that "geographical dyslexia" is a good name for the Learys'
condition. An alternative, "directional disability," is not much better.
Whatever the name, sufferers will know what is meant.  There's a class of
people (I'm one of them) who are chronically lost; who take a few steps in a
strange city and can't find their way back to the hotel; who don't know how to
exit the building they've just entered because they've strolled a corridor or
two; who are totally befuddled and even panicked when they drive into a familiar
intersection from an unaccustomed direction; who break into a cold sweat when
someone says, "you know how to get home -- just reverse the directions"; and
who, because they're frequently lost, are subject to ridicule and mockery from
their very own families and from their most intimate friends.

Macon Leary has a theory about his persistent dysgeographica. He thinks he's
disabled because all his life he's moved from house to house, and "people who'd
been moved around a great deal never acquired a fixed point of reference,
but wandered forever in a fog." I know of no evidence to support this wholly
improbable suggestion. Macon clutches at a straw because there's no data (and
there's no data, at least in part, because there's no accepted name for his
condition).

Every sufferer nurses his own unscientific, anecdotal theory. I was once
convinced that my dysgeographica was related to my total absence of rhythm --
as a child I could never learn to pump a swing or even to jump rope. My brother
thinks that it must be connected to his aversion to heights. My niece takes
the view that it's somehow related to her motion sickness and to her bouts of
dizziness. A friend thinks that the trouble stems from the fact that she was
naturally left-handed but was trained to be right-handed. In fact, no one knows
whether dysgeographica is connected to any other trait, or whether it's one of
a cluster of traits. In terms of hard science, the directionally disabled have
been allowed to languish in the dark ages.

I'm almost convinced that dysgeographica runs in families. My father was
monumentally disabled, and one of my brothers is so impaired that he's
occasionally looked to me for directional advice. Barking up the wrong tree, is
he!! (I have another brother who always knows exactly where he is -- perhaps
he's adopted.) In The Accidental Tourist,  Anne Tyler, who's a very sharp
observer of mankind, tellingly attributes dysgeographica to all four Leary
siblings.Tyler also notes that Macon has learned how to cope: he "kept a
stack of index cards giving detailed directions to the houses of his friends
-- even friends he'd known forever." Coping mechanisms are essential to the
dysgeographical. When I have to drive any distance without a navigator, I
write the directions with a thick pen in a notebook and keep it open on the
passenger seat. For some reason, I can't seem to retain more than one or two of
the approaching turns in my mind, so I must continually refer to the notebook.
Mapquest has proved to be a boon, especially if I remember to print out in very
large type.

In The Accidental Tourist, no one pokes fun at the Leary siblings. But in real
life, it's considered quite amusing to laugh at the chronically lost. People
don't understand that dysgeographica is a disability like colorblindness.
I can't say how many times I've been instructed to "concentrate," or "pay
attention' -- advice which is just as effective as commanding a color blind
person to make an effort to register shades of yellow or blue. Without a label
and without a support group, the dysgeographical will continue to be ridiculed.
It's time for us to unite. Unless we do so, we are not only doomed, like Macon
Leary, to be "adrift upon the planet, helpless, praying that by luck [we] might
stumble across [our] destination," but doomed to be humiliated as well.

(July 22, 2007.  I've written again on directional dyslexia.  If anyone is
interested, take a look here, here, and here.    And now one more.)  And
also.

Title: The Leader Theater;  Our Leader
Date: September 24, 2006

I was not a committed moviegoer as a youth -- punchball, basketball, softball,
stickball in the street all having more appeal. But often enough, on a Saturday,
especially when the weather was bad, there were double-feature matinees at the
Leader Theater on Coney Island Avenue.  =Admission for children was fourteen
cents when I first started attending; I think that by the time I reached high
school the price had risen to as much as a quarter. It was a harmless way
to spend a long afternoon. The theater was usually over-crowded with noisy
ragamuffins who threw popcorn at each other during the love scenes. There was an
impotent "matron" with a flashlight who had the frustrating job of maintaining a
modicum of order.

Musicals mystified me-- I remember waiting for the dance numbers to end so
that we could get on with the plot. I loved westerns and detective stories and
tolerated, though I was frightened by, the war movies.

In the cavalry-and-Indian movies (Stentorian voice :  "In the Years Following
the Civil War...") there was a recurring scene that made quite an impression
on me. Indians have attacked an "isolated farmhouse" or a wagon train. The
colonel who has just come from West Point to take command of Fort Apache or Fort
Bragg or Fort Collins summons the wizened scout who has spent his life on the
frontier. The fresh-faced colonel tells the experienced old buckaroo that he's
heard that there are Indians camped down by the bend of the river, and that he's
going to send a detachment of troops to teach them a lesson. The scout looks
at the arrow that the colonel shows him, and says, "But colonel, them Indians
down by the Brazos (or Snake or Powder or whatever river it happened to be that
particular Saturday matinee) are Comanche; this here's a Kiowa arrow."  But the
bull-headed, ignorant colonel won't listen. As far as he's concerned "they're
all injuns," so he orders an attack, and soon the whole frontier is in flames
and before the movie comes to an end, settlers are hatcheted and the Kiowas are
decimated.

Now I'm sure that George Bush went to see the same movies as I did. But he
couldn't have grasped their point; it was far too subtle for his intelligence.
He must have thought that the stubborn colonel analyzed the situation correctly
when he said that "injuns is injuns," because nowadays  we have a foreign
policy that says, if we're attacked by Al-Quaeda, let's just turn around and
revenge ourselves on the Iraqis. After all, Arabs is Arabs. The result: the
entire frontier is in flames.

There was a recurring scene in the war movies as well. An American soldier, or
a French resistance fighter, has been captured by the Germans. He refuses to
talk; won't spill any secrets.  The German colonel says to him: "ve haf ways of
making you talk. I'll haf to turn you ofer to him." And then the camera would
focus on an obvious sadist in an SS uniform, licking his lips. Next there was a
brief but terrifying shot of the captive sweating and screaming.

In dozens of films, the villainous Germans routinely employed torture. Americans
and their allies, on the other hand, were brave and upright and honorable and
played by the rules.

I can guarantee that at this moment there are movies being made all over the
world in which the colonel is American and the sadist is CIA. And these films
are going to be watched on Saturday afternoons by generations of children.

What has George Bush done to us?  What have we allowed him to do?

Title: In Which the Author Confesses His Want of Imagination
Date: September 26, 2006

I was taught, and I have no reason not to believe, that there are three forms
of matter.  There are solids, there are liquids, and there are gases.  But
nowadays I'm expected to believe that there are at least two other forms of
matter.  No matter how I frazzle my brain trying to imagine what in the world
can exist that isn't a solid, a liquid or a gas, I make no headway.  But then
I think-- suppose I happened to live in a world in which there were only solids
and gases -- where all solids, when heated, immediately sublimed into gases? 
Suppose there was no ice made of water-- only substances such as dry ice which,
it will be remembered, turns directly into carbon dioxide when warmed.  In such
a world, it would have been beyond my conceptual ability to conceive of matter
other than the two forms with which I was familiar.  Liquids would have been
unimaginable.  I can only conclude that other forms of matter are definitely
possible;  it's just that I myself can't imagine them.

Similarly, there are the familiar colors of the visible spectrum:  red, orange
yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet.  These are the only colors (well, except
for brown, and black, and white).  But it's well known that birds see colors
that humans (who apparently lost some color-sensitive cells during the course
of evolution) cannot detect.  There are infra-red and ultra-violet colors to
which birds respond but that humans are not equipped to perceive.  What do
these colors look like?  I can't possibly imagine, although I dearly wish that
I could. An analogy:  let's say that we humans were constructed in such a way
that we could see only the colors of the spectrum that lie between yellow and
blue;  there would be no way that we could imagine red or orange, even if we
knew that other creatures detected those portions of the spectrum.  We would
live in a world that had been drained of color.  But, in fact, compared to the
birds, we do live in a color-attenuated universe.  Moreover, there's no way
that we can imagine what it is that we're missing.

I wonder also about bats.  Bats are blind but they navigate very precisely by
echolocation, which is nothing more than very sophisticated radar.  They emit
high-pitched squeals, and they process the echoes of these emissions in a manner
that is so precise that they can catch mosquitoes on the wing.  But what is
in their minds?  Does the radar create a picture -- perhaps something like a
three- dimensional black-and-white movie?  Or more likely, is something created
in the bat brain that only a bat will ever know and that humans will never, ever
be able to imagine.  And what about whales, who are not blind as bats but both
see and also gather information by sonar.  What's it's like being a whale?

We're limited by the evolved architecture of our brains.  We can't imagine
what we can't imagine.  We can, however, know that there are phenomena that we
can't imagine -- which is something, I guess, but all-in-all a rather paltry
compensation.

(Plasma and the Einstein-Bose condensate, sometimes termed alternative forms
of matter, are not so much alternatives to solid, liquid, and gas as they are
states of the atoms themselves:  plasma amounts to, if I understand what I've
read, atoms stripped of their electrons, while the EBC is a bunch of atoms that
don't form themselves into a lattice as they would in solids.  They just lie
there, a frigid clump, each unrelated to the other except by proximity.)

Title: States of My Mind
Date: September 29, 2006

I once read the last 200 pages of Hardy's Jude the Obscure in a single hour. 
This extraordinary feat occurred in, I think, 1959 or 1960.

As a general rule, I'm not a speedy reader -- just about average, in fact.  But
for one splendid hour, I was able to read at four or five times my usual pace. 
I can't explain why except to say that I was so focused on Jude and Sue and
Arabella that the whole world outside of that book just disappeared.  Moreover,
it wasn't only that I read rapidly --I read with insight and with imagination. 
I felt that I was in touch not only with the novel but with the author himself
and that I could grasp and appreciate all of Hardy's contrivances and triumphs.

Thirty or so years later, I re-read Jude and I was astonished to find that my
recollection of the novel was superb -- much more detailed and more accurate
than of novels that I had recently read or re-read.  What a difference from
my usual plodding self!  What a joy it must be to be truly intelligent about
books!

It's obvious that my mind, and everyone's mind, must have much greater
capabilities than it ordinarily exhibits.  If only we knew how to access that
ability.

Three or four times in my life, at a concert or listening to music at home
I've felt myself jump to a higher level of understanding.  All of a sudden,
the form of the music -- even of complex music-- becomes crystal clear and the
inevitability of the next note becomes plain.  I seem to know what the composer
thought he was doing.  And then, after a few moments, I become self-conscious
and self-aware, the flood of insights wanes, and I decline to my usual, rather
pedestrian level of appreciation.

I also had one unique experience when I was between sleep and awake and a
tune was repeating itself in my head, and just like! that I started to create
interesting variations on the theme.  Composers sometimes say that they
transcribe music that they hear in their brains, and for a brief moment, it was
as though I myself was a composer.  But alack, after a few short moments, I
came to conscious realization of what was happening and I was roused from my
reverie;  creativity screeched to a halt.  I've never been able to revive
within me that particular symphony and song.

It's also happened that while I'm writing something, I enter what could be
called a trance state and the world seems to drop away.  It's then that I
can write four or five good pages in the same amount of time in which I would
usually grind out a hundred or so words.  It almost seems as though I engage a
part of my brain that's not ordinarily available.  Rimbaud once remarked that
"literature is my unconscious talking to your unconscious."  Maybe geniuses
are those who can achieve a level of concentration that allows them to delve
into inaccessible areas of the brain.  There's a story about Charles Dickens: 
it's said that he wrote the death scene of Little Nell in the midst of a crowded
party and that while he was plying his quill, tears were running down his face
and that he was totally oblivious to the noise around him.  He was there, in
the room, but in another sense, he wasn't there.

It happened to me two or three times that I was speaking to a group when all of
a sudden I became aware that I was constructing elegant and artistic paragraph-
length sentences -- that my vocabulary had enlarged and that my metaphors
were apt and expressive.  I can even remember admiring my sudden burst of
eloquence-- as though I was simultaneously both performer and observer.  But
then, after a few moments, the synaptic connections that transformed me into an
accomplished orator short-circuited and my supernova sentences reverted to mere
competence.  Wouldn't in be wonderful to be effortlessly eloquent!  One can
only lament.  But to look on the bright side -- I'm fortunate to have had a few
grand moments.  Even Kekule only dreamed his benzene rings into existence one
single time.

During the 1950s, I spent four long years treading water at Erasmus Hall, a
jam- packed public high school at the bepigeoned corner of Flatbush and Church
avenues.  Among the required books in our overcrowded 11th grade English class
was Willa Cather's prairie novel My Antonia.

I've just returned to My Antonia after an interval of fifty years.  It's an
excellent novel, though I confess with shame that I remembered very little
of it.  I managed to retain a bit of the Nebraska atmosphere and emotion
-- the empty, roadless steppe, the harsh winters, the sod houses, and the
spirit of the indomitable settlers.  I had absolutely zero recollection of the
novel's details and not so much as a glimmer of the story.  But then, there
isn't much in the way of plot -- simply the history of narrator Jim Burden's
socially confused and sexually troubled response to the "Bohemian" immigrant
Antonia Shimerda, a vibrant girl (and later a woman) two or three years older
than he.  I remembered Antonia herself -- wild, willful, determined, and
ultimately triumphant -- but I hadn't even a trace memory of Jim.  Perhaps it's
because Antonia remains in Nebraska where she tames her prairie acres and also
births and nurtures uncountable children, while Jim, burdened with advantages
and a middle-class education, leaves Black Hawk to become a lawyer for the
railroad (in effect, an antagonist of the smallholding farmer) and, if I've read
correctly, remains unmarried and childless, a rueful observer rather than an
actor in the great pioneer epic.

I'm also astonished that I had no recollection of buxom, eager Lena Lingard,
who teaches Jim about sex.  Was I so virginal and naive that I was unable to
construe Cather's circumlocutions?

I didn't remember, and surely didn't appreciate, that My Antonia is a lovely,
evocatively written book, extremely economical and at the same time rich in
telling detail.

When I read My Antonia for the first time, I hadn't encountered a plot of grass
larger than the outfield at Ebbets Field (297 feet down the right field foul
line), so "prairie" was a concept I had to take on faith. Now that I've been to
Willa Cather country many times -- not yet to Red Cloud itself but to Hastings,
where the author spent her adolescence  -- My Antonia no longer seems quite
so extra-terrestrial.  Still, I wonder why the Italians and Irish and Jews
and 'Negroes' who populated Erasmus Hall were supplied with such books-- My
Antonia along with O. E. Rolvaag's no-longer-read Giants in the Earth, which is
a desperately grim story of Norwegian immigrants in the Dakotas. I felt, and
I think I was encouraged to feel, that they were the heroic, admirable, hard-
working truly American immigrants, while we (shopkeepers, telephone linesman,
garbage collectors, school-teachers) had somehow snuck in the easy, city way. 
Why weren't we asked to read books about us?  Weren't we just as genuine?

Midway through the novel, Jim takes a few seconds to meditate on the relations
between old families like his own (his grandparents came from Virginia) and
the Czechs and Scandinavians whom they looked down upon.  Conventional wisdom
was that "all foreigners were ignorant people who couldn't speak English." 
"But today," says Jim, speaking as a surrogate Willa Cather herself, "the
best that a harassed Black Hawk merchant can hope for is to sell provisions
and farm machinery and automobiles to the rich farms where that first crop of
stalwart Bohemian and Scandinavian girls are now the mistresses."   It's an
observation that applies not only to the economics of Nebraska in the 1880s,
but is perpetual to the American experience.  Immigrants work hard.  Is it
possible that today's anti-immigration frenzy is driven by the fear that the
present crop of brown-skinned newcomers will work so furiously that they'll
leave in the lurch the neo-nativists who seem to have contented themselves with
a lazy respectability?

Title: Radio Baseball
Date: October 08, 2006

Yesterday the Yankees were drubbed, absolutely demolished, by the Detroit
Tigers. Sent home packing. Their loss joyed my vindictive, Yankee-hating heart.

When I was a boy hanging out at the P. S. 217 schoolyard and learning about
life, there was no question but that the pin-striped Yankees were privileged
bland tea-sipping Republicans, while the Brooklyn Dodgers were a bunch of
upstart and underachieving heroes to whom we neighborhood kids could relate;
 they were colorful, they were multicultural (before the letter), they were
Democrats, and they were ours.

I watched this week's games on the TV and savored not only the outcome, but all
the pealing bells and slick technological whistles that modern TV can offer: the
multiple replays, the ball-tracking systems that allow the viewer to inspect
both the pitcher's grip and his release and also the spin he puts on the ball. 
I could count the number of rotations on Kenny Rogers' lovely curve.

Although TV is amazingly informative, in my heart I prefer baseball on the radio
-- the radio of my youth, that is. In those days, baseball was radio and radio
was baseball. It's no wonder that baseball was the nation's game -- and it's
only game -- when radio was the dominant medium.

I love the perennial rhythms of radio baseball: "Steps to the plate... digs
in... closed stance... takes a few practice swings.... steps up on the rubber...
round comes the right arm...  slider low and outside....  checks the runner
on first...  looks down for the sign...  the pitch... high fly to left... 
settles under it... two gone in the third...."  It's an enduring, comforting
sound.

Radio baseball as I remember it transformed the players into larger-than-life
figures. It romanticized them. Radio baseball was a never-ending oral epic,
Homeric in dimension. TV, with all its wealth of detail, turns the players
into ordinary mortals; it makes them too familiar, too common. It plucks out
the heart of the mystery. It's impossible to believe that these young men
with their stringy beards and their horrid tattoos and their acneed faces are
reincarnations of the bronze-age superheroes of my childhood. If an announcer
were honestly recording what the TV sees, it would be, "steps up to the plate...
digs in...  adjusts his nuts...  steps out of the box... spits a huge goober
into the dirt...  now he's really excavating his left nostril."

Radio was reverent; television is intrusive.

Radio baseball was noble, and radio listeners were the better for listening to
it. Radio baseball brought us together. On East 9 Street, where I grew up, there
was very little in common among the Petrantos, the Burkes, the Bernsteins, the
Constantinos, the Pynns, the Rhodins, and the Meinekes who populated the block 
-- except that we could all talk about Cox, Reese, Snider, Robinson, Campanella.
I have a strong memory of riding my Ivor Johnson (later my Raleigh three-speed)
on a hot summer evening when there were so many people sitting on their porches,
or on their stoops, or on the fire escapes listening to Red Barber and Connie
Desmond that I could bike for many a mile and not miss a single pitch. Radio
baseball turned us into a community. Which is why we'll never, ever, forgive
that foul black-hearted traitor Walter O'Malley.

But I'm cheerful. It's autumn and the Republican Yankees have lost. It's a
favorable omen. Is it too much to hope that, inasmuch as the Yankees have lost
in October, the Democrats could win in November?

Title: Another Variation on the "Replacement Child" Theme
Date: October 12, 2006

In Charles Dickens' Dombey and Son (1848), which I've just re-read, Dombey's
treasured son Paul dies when his older sister, Florence, is about six years
old. Dombey has never liked his daughter Florence (he seems to blame her for
being a girl) and likes her less after he loses Paul. Dombey could transfer his
affection from his dead son to a possible "replacement," his living daughter.
But he shuns that very legitimate psychological option. Instead, Florence is
neglected, ignored, exiled, and eventually even struck by her hard-hearted
father. In real life, it's inevitable that Florence would become alienated,
bitter, and distorted. In Dickens' fairy-tale world her love for her father
endures and she remains cheerful and optimistic. Although she experiences a
truly horrible childhood, she suffers no permanent psychological deficit.
Eventually, she reconciles with her father, forgives him (sic!) and produces
two children (named Paul and Florence, of course).  Dombey, now chastened,
grandfathers these true replacement children.

It's a big, good novel, and Dickens makes us laugh and cry but sometimes
against our will and always in defiance of our knowledge of real--as opposed to
idealized--children. Dickens' optimism and his faith in the power of forgiveness
are wonderful but utterly otherworldly. Replacements, even quasi-replacements
such as Florence, rarely fare so well.

Title: Hosseini's The Kite Runner
Date: October 13, 2006

Every American should read Khaled Hosseini's The Kite Runner (Riverhead, 2003)
-- but for its political relevance, not its literary achievement. The novel is
set in Afghanistan, which is one of the few countries where recent American
foreign policy hasn't been entirely incompetent and disgraceful, so to read it
feels reassuring and even patriotic. Inasmuch as we're engaged in a never ending
war in Afghanistan, every one of our fellow citizens should have an idea why
we're there and what we're doing. It's not at all obvious -- Afghanistan doesn't
have a single drop of oil.  Americans should know how bad the Taliban was and
might become again, and also why we should remain vigilant against any rabid
fundamentalist theology--even ones that are near and more domestic than Islam.

In The Kite Runner, the conflict between Afghanistan's dominant Pashtuns and the
exploited Hazaras reminds us that there are countries that are far more absurdly
tribal than our own.

Even though I learned a great deal from this novel, I feel that as a work of
art, The Kite Runner is profoundly disappointing. It came highly recommended to
me and I set out to fall in love, couldn't.  It's an overpraised work. It's
advertised as written in "hard, spare prose" (I'm quoting from the back-cover
blurb), but in fact it's written in prose without any style at all -- and worse
still, every paragraph or so there's a sentence that must make a discriminating
reader cringe. The novel is very weak in characterization: aside from the
autobiographical narrator, there's only one figure of any dimension --Baba--
and all the rest are flat as pancakes. The novelist is particularly bad with
women, who are never more than wallpaper. The child Sohrab, in whom so much is
invested, speaks an idiom that no living child has ever spoken. Has the author
ever had a conversation with a real boy  The plot is filled with obvious
contrivances, artificial cliff-hangers, and (goodness gracious!) a climactic
fist-fight. And while I appreciate the author's love of his native country, it
doesn't seem at all honest to attribute Afghani problems to "Arabs, Chechens,
and Pakistanis." In this novel, the Taliban is represented by a character who
is half-German, a sociopathic admirer of Hitler, and (we eventually discover)
a pervert who preys on little boys. He's a grotesque villain who seems to have
wandered into an ostensibly serious novel from a James Bond melodrama. Why can't
the author face the fact that the the Taliban are home-grown Afghani fascists?
He would have given us a stronger novel if he had done so.

Title: An East 9th Street Memory
Date: October 15, 2006

It was an entirely different world -- East 9th Street in the old days. Sometimes
it seems so long gone that I find it hard to believe it even though I was there:
the last horse-drawn vegetable trucks and milk-wagons in America, an "old-
clothes man" shouting his cry in the street, an itinerant knife-sharpener with
his pushcart. On the street, a few, very few, rusting 1930s automobiles (it was
the war, and all the factories were turning out tanks). And me, in first grade,
wearing hand-me-down knickerbockers with long socks as if I were some turn-of-
the-century waif.

Next door to us was a two-family house. On the first floor, the very ancient
Mr. and Mrs. Pynn, who tended their gladioluses in the tiny backyard. He was
a retired merchant marine. (How did an old Cornish sailor come to live in our
neighborhood?)  On the second floor were the Pynn's tenants the Rhodins, Thor
and Pearl, who were at least a generation or so older than my parents and who
had three adult children (Thor Jr, Yammie [actually Hjalmar] and Peggy) none of
whom I ever met and whose existence I was aware only because Mrs. Rhodin would
boast of their exploits -- Thor Jr. was a physicist who, she said, worked on The
Bomb. The Rhodins were very quiet people. He, a tall, thin, aloof man who never
spoke, was either unemployed or retired;  he emerged from the house twice a day
to walk his poodle. Mrs. Rhodin "went to business," as the saying was in the
neighborhood.

One hot summer day, I was reading in the back bedroom. Windows (ours and the
Rhodins) were wide open. Across the narrow driveway, I heard Mrs. Rhodin launch
into a furious tirade. All the promises Mr. Rhodin had made to her. How little
he had accomplished. The kind of place they lived in. Stuck in Brooklyn. She
supported him while he lazed around at home. And other complaints that I
couldn't understand or don't remember -- but there could be no doubt about her
fury. Her litany of objections was loud and it seemed to go on for hours. A one-
way street, though; I never heard Mr. Rhodin's voice.  Stunned, I shamelessly
eavesdropped.

Was it days, or weeks, or months later that Mr. Rhodin was run over by a bus on
18th Avenue and instantly killed?

Was there a connection between the tirade and the accident? And was it an
accident?  Even in my childish naivete, I thought suicide. And because I knew
Pearl and Thor's secrets, I felt as though I were a bit of an accomplice.

Title: Two Erotic Poems
Date: October 20, 2006

Here are two excellent poems, of different eras and origins, that are at heart
surprisingly similar. The first, "Politics," written in the pre-World War 30s,
is by W. B. Yeats.

How can I, that girl standing there,

My attention fix

On Roman or on Russian

Or on Spanish politics?

Yet here's a traveled man that knows

What he talks about,

And there's a politician

That has read and thought.

And maybe what they say is true

Of war and war's alarms,

But O that I were young again

And held her in my arms!

This lovely verse restates a perennial literary theme: the conflict between
public and personal, or, between the life of duty and the life of pleasure. The
speaker of the poem, whoever he is, withdraws from a troubling weary political
conversation into a succinctly limned but very concrete and nostalgic sexual
fantasy. The anxieties heaped up in the first ten lines are overpowered by the
buoyancy of the concluding two. The hinge of the poem is the daring "But O" --
"O" being the most dangerous syllable in poetry, which, when wrongly used, can
be a sentimental disaster, but when discreetly employed, as here, condenses
into one moan an outburst of genuine feeling that overwhelms a stultifying
social ritual. For a pleasing moment, the speaker, powered by that great "O,"
withdraws from politics to enjoy, at least in his imagination, the pleasures and
consolations of sex.  I

Here's another poem -- a song, actually -- quoted first in sixteenth-century
manuscript version and then modernized.

Westron wynde when wyll thow blow

The smalle rayne down can rain

Cryst if my love were in my Armys

And I in my bed Agayne.

(And now the modernized version.)

Western wind, when wilt thou blow

The small rain down can rain?

Christ, that my love were in my arms

And I in my bed again.

In this anonymous quatrain, it's not politics but the cruel world itself that
is so discomforting. It's winter, and the singer waits for the western wind
that is the harbinger of spring. "Small rain" is not an idiom that is still in
use;  nowadays we say "light rain" -- the meaning is something like "April
showers."  In the traditional world that we have lost, "small rain" might even
have had just a touch of biblical resonance: "as the small rain upon the tender
herb, and as the showers upon the grass." The "small rain," when it will at last
come, will bring an end to harsh sterile winter and signal the start of fertile
spring. To paraphrase the first two lines: "when will the western wind bring in
the showers that will cause the earth once more to bloom?"  And then the hinge
expletive "Christ" (paralleling Yeats's 'O' but shockingly blasphemous) which
precipitates a potent sexual fantasy: in his warm, no longer wet wintry bed, the
speaker can shower sex upon his beloved.

Four exquisite, unmatchable lines of erotic poetry that are, miraculously, even
more spare and resonant than Yeats's.

Title: A Recurring, Violent Nightmare
Date: October 22, 2006

I wish I had pleasant dreams but I only have nightmares. Here's one of them.
Beginning with early adolescence and continuing to this day, I've had a
recurring dream in which I've murdered someone--I don't know whom. The victim is
always an unidentifiable male, and his death is always violent. Ordinarily, I
beat him to a bloody pulp with a shovel. I have problems disposing of the gory
body, but usually I bury it next to the neglected garage that lay behind our
house on East 9 Street in Flatbush where I lived my first seventeen years. It's
an anguishing dream not because I've killed someone, but because I've failed to
conceal the body properly and because I'm going to be arrested and punished.
It's amoral  -- I don't feel guilty that I'm a murderer -- just embarrassed
because I'm incompetent. It's a very realistic nightmare. A couple of times it's
been so vivid to me that even after I was wide-awake, it took me ten or fifteen
seconds to realize that I was not being hunted by the police and that I could
proceed normally with my life.

I don't know why I should be so oppressed with this fantasy. In the daylight
hours, I'm your run-of-the-mill peaceful person. Never killed anyone.

Imagine my surprise when I read (and studied the illustrations of) J. M.
DeMatteis's 100% autobiographical "graphic novel" Brooklyn Dreams (Paradox,
2003) and discovered that my nightmare is not entirely my own. DeMatteis suffers
from exactly the same recurring dream. "I remember the body -- buried out behind
my apartment building... or maybe stuffed in a trash can across the street.... 
Some poor, innocent schmuck I've either hacked up with a machete... or machine-
gunned with Cagney-like ferocity... or maybe just kicked down a flight of
stairs."  DeMatteis labors under the guilt that's provoked by this dream, and,
like me, he can't explain it except to speculate that his life is a nightmare
from which he's trying to awake.  But here's what's so fascinating to me:
DeMatteis is a product of the exact same Brooklyn neighborhood as I (see map). 
He grew up at the corner of Ocean and Foster, and he hung out at Newkirk Plaza,
a commercial island that would nowadays be called a shopping center, where I
endured painful haircuts, carried my mother's dry cleaning back and forth, and
entered and exited the BMT subway.  Was there something about Flatbush, or,
more particularly, something about "the Plaza" that made us killers in our
dreams. Yes, I rather think there was.

Is it significant that DeMatteis is a kind of replacement child? He is the
survivor of a pair of fraternal twins. His potential sibling was spontaneously
aborted -- although DeMatties speculates, that, prescient about life's
forthcoming difficulties, he might have "jumped." DeMatties' mother was about to
be "scraped" when the doctor had second thoughts. In Brooklyn Dreams, DeMatteis
describes his mother's and father's hysterical, debilitating and inconsistent
protectiveness -- traits often discovered in parents who haven't properly
grieved the loss of a child.

Is it possible that the person whom DeMatteis thinks he murdered is, on some
level, the unborn twin?

And so we have still another variation of the replacement child syndrome.

Title: Death and Dying in Boulder, Colorado
Date: October 22, 2006

Our local newspaper, the Boulder Daily Camera, has announced a new policy. No
longer will obituaries be considered news. They've been turned over to the
classifieds and will be written by friends or relatives of the deceased and
placed by funeral homes. Bottom line: deaths are now an opportunity for revenue
enhancement.

I'd always taken it for granted that keeping track of who's born, who's married,
and especially who dies constitutes a considerable part of the mission of a
local paper. Such events are bread-and-butter matters -- part of the soul of the
community.

The Daily Camera is certainly not where we find out what's happening in the big
world -- it's woefully inadequate in that regard, although it does pick up and
truncate a few pieces off the wire. The Camera's sole reason for being is that
it covers local news, and by doing so allows Boulder's citizens to feel that
they have something in common.

But in fact the Camera only masquerades as a local paper. It's a holding of
the folksy-titled Prairie Mountain Publishing, which is a joint venture of E.
W. Scripps Co., the newspaper conglomerate, and the MediaNews Group (MediaNews
itself owns the Denver Post and four other Colorado papers;  Prairie Mountain
also owns the Colorado Daily). There's nothing local about the Camera and
there's no reason for its absentee owners to care two cents worth who lives
or dies in Newlands or South Boulder or Wonderland Hills. The Camera's job is
to extract as much money as possible from Boulder and to forward the cash to
Prairie Mountain Publishing.

The Prairie Mountain overlords have placed a new publisher, Al Manzi, at the
Camera; Manzi is a corporate lifer. I'm reliably informed that he came with
specific instructions to up the Camera's profits.

And so, obituaries are now on a pay-to-play basis.

How is it that there have been absolutely no complaints about the new policy? 
Boulder is a contentious, argumentative city.  It would be reasonable to expect
that the Camera's letters-to-the-editor columns would be saturated with protest,
but there's been nary a word. Why?  Because Manzi has instructed the editorial
staff not to publish any letters that protest the new policy. It's good to be
the publisher.

Here are some proposals for Al Manzi.  Why stop with obituaries?  Or with
wedding and anniversary announcements, which are obviously fair game. Letters
to the editor: why not?  Why should a newspaper give free space to community
opinion. Let those who can pay, pay. And editorials. Why should there be
editorials when there can be advertorials?

Here's a phrase to remember:  "revenue center."

In today's paper, there's an announcement that the Camera's editor, Sue Deans,
who has local roots, has resigned. Could it be that her departure is related to
Manzi's policy changes?  Would anyone be astonished to discover so?

Title: On Foley, Rascal Beadles, and "Hypocrisy"
Date: October 23, 2006

It's the scandal of the month that Republican Representative Mark Foley
solicited sex from adolescent male congressional pages in the same years that
he headed the House Caucus on Missing and Exploited Children and made his
reputation for his work on legislation targeting sexual predators.

Foley has been universally condemned for his "hypocrisy," as well he should be.
It's especially piquant that his castigation of a much-reviled-by-moralists
former president has resurfaced to embarrass him and to amuse the rest of
us: "It's vile. It's more sad than anything else, to see someone with such
potential throw it all down the drain because of a sexual addiction." What kind
of rationalizing maneuvers were going in the Foley mind when the Congressman
uttered these words about Bill Clinton?

Foley's "hypocrisy" is anything but unique.  Shakespeare nailed the phenomenon
centuries ago. In one of his great wisdom-in-madness moments, King Lear sees
beneath the surface: "Thou rascal beadle, hold thy bloody hand!/ Why dost thou
lash that whore? Strip thine own back;/ Thou hotly lust'st to use her in that
kind/ For which thou whipp'st her."

Every few weeks or so, it's discovered that one of our very own American beadles
is enthralled by the exact sin against which he inveighs. There's the anti-
pornography campaigner who has accumulated some unusual apparatus in his clammy
basement; the anti-vice TV preacher caught with a shady lady in a by-the-hour
motel on the Memphis strip;  the anti-gay state legislator photographed dancing
in a downtown bar that caters only to men; the radio talk-show host who wants
to send drug-users up the river for life but is himself addicted to hillbilly
heroin; the flabby propagandist for virtues who pulls all-nighters at Atlantic
City blackjack tables.  ll of them are hypocrites, I suppose, but in my view
"hypocrisy" is a label that has no explanatory value.

It's not as though people set out to become hypocrites. It's not an aspiration
or a chosen career path. There's no Hypocrisy 101.

I'm not an anti-vice campaigner or a psychologist and have no particular claim
to expertise in this area, but I don't believe that people like Foley are
cloven-footed sociopaths.

Nor do I hold to the theory that it's simply protective coloration: "if I scream
loud enough no one will suspect me." That shabby dodge has long since worn
through; who else do we suspect nowadays if not the loudest shouters?

I think the migration to hypocrisy must be very gradual. The Foleys of this
world are driven by the flesh. Their vice becomes their obsession. I believe
that they try to turn that obsession, that vice, in a positive direction. 
Let's say a person is fascinated by adolescent boys;  he can then take on the
cause of sexual exploitation and he can manage his compulsion in a socially
acceptable manner. He can study it, observe it, catalog it; he can stay in
close touch with the temptation but not succumb to it; he can in fact turn his
vice into virtue. It's an excellent game plan.  It's a healthy compensatory
reaction.

I'm sure that there are anti-vice campaigners who employ such tactics
successfully. But there are others who, in moments of weakness, do succumb.
Now they're in a tricky psychological pickle.  Who better to appreciate the
damage to adolescents than the person who has made a professional study of the
outcomes?  So now Foley and the others know in their hearts that they are
truly hateful. Perhaps they persuade themselves that their power makes them
invulnerable. Meanwhile, they redouble their efforts to help the exploited;
they pass legislation and start foundations.  And so the gulf between their
professed beliefs and their private practices becomes deeper and deeper. Good
deeds and evil deeds become inextricably entwined.

In the story, Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde (a child-molester) inhabited the same body.

I think that what must happen next is that self-loathing kicks in, big time.
And as we all know, self-loathing and self-betrayal are twinborn. So the Foleys
among us cooperate in their detection.  They engage in riskier and riskier
behavior until they are exposed. Because, in fact, they want to be exposed. As
Lear says, they "strip [their] own back[s]."  Because once they're exposed
and the punishment commences, they can then set out on the path of redemption,
which, I'm absolutely convinced, they crave as much or more than they crave the
pleasure of their vice.

When La Rochefoucauld said that "hypocrisy is the tribute that vice pays to
virtue," he acknowledged that the term "hypocrisy" did not explain anything--
that it's an incidental by-product of human frailty.

Title: Book Report:  Fiction by Michael Chabon
Date: October 24, 2006

I liked the film Wonder Boys (2000) so very much that I set out to read all
of Michael Chabon's writing. Here's my interim report. I couldn't finish The
Mysteries of Pittsburgh (William Morrow, 1988). The book is reported to have
sold well and it has been widely praised, but, I'm sorry, I thought it was
precious juvenilia and should never have been published. I do, however, love
the title. A Model World (1991) and Werewolves in Their Youth (Random House,
1999) are collections of short stories. I found them both mighty insubstantial,
and I confess to wearying of the little boy whose father left the family (a
far-too- frequently-repeated motif). Wonder Boys (1995) is a fine, complicated,
clever, satisfying novel.  Grady Tripp, Terry Crabtree, and James Leer are all
memorable creations. The Passover service (omitted in the film) is top-flight
-- comic and moving at the same time. The story is fast, funny, and original --
even richer than the fine, little-known movie.

I respected more than I loved the pullet-surprise winning Amazing Adventures of
Kavalier and Clay (Random House, 2000). It's engaging but overcrowded. While
reading it, I was too conscious of the artifice and too aware of the novel's
debts: Nabokov, a pinch of Pynchon, Doctorow, etc. Chabon's a great storyteller
with a bright future. So far, he's doesn't have the heft of Bellow or the
fluency of Roth, but he's up there in the big leagues. I'm hoping Summerland and
The Final Solution are as good as the novels I've read so far. It's going to be
fun to follow Chabon's career. He's a talented guy.

October 25. Today I read the novella The Final Solution (Harper Collins, 2004).
It's a snazzy mystery. Chabon returns to his infatuation with mythic figures;
he also re-creates the hero-sidekick relationship that is an obsession of AAKC
-- this time its S. Holmes and Linus Steinman.  A very entertaining story,
although sometimes I worried that I was reading a filmscript-in potentia. 
Perhaps I'm too suspicious: not many directors are jumping to cast a parrot in
the lead role.

October 30.  I read forty or so pages of Summerland (Miramax, 2002). Two words:
"teen" and "fantasy." Not at all my cup of tea.  I hope that Chabon doesn't
continue to indulge himself with such trivialities. He's too good for this
stuff.

Michael: get back to work!  Get serious!

Here are some career paths that it's just as well I didn't tread.

1.  Taxi driver in a large city (especially a city that's not on a grid, such as Boston or London. Even the DC-diagonals drive me nuts). I've earlier written about my incapacitating directional disability, but I neglected to mention that I tend to get into a bit of a panic when I'm lost --  I start driving much too fast and far too waywardly. So, dear friends, imagine me a befuddled cabbie, sweating super-profusely, while the fares in back scream bloody murder when I take the exact wrong turn for the fourth consecutive time. It would be a freakin' nightmare. Related occupations that won't work: tour guide, wilderness guide, tracker.

2.  Dog-groomer. I've hinted at my lack of affection for doggies before. I just don't think I'd do a good job blow-drying Fido or brushing Fifi's teeth. (Incidentally, I'm joined in my prejudice against curs by gentle Will himself, whose references to canines are uniformly unfriendly: the superbly wicked sisters in King Lear, for example, are "dog-hearted daughters.")

3.  Trapeze artist. I'm terrified of heights and I have absolutely no sense of rhythm. Imagine me launching myself at just the right moment to catch my partner by the ankles. Related opportunity for ignominious failure: dance instructor.

4.  Surgeon.  I'm far too squeamish to be poking around in someone's innards.  Even channel surfing has become a dangerous pastime since we accidentally acquired the live surgery channel.  Motto:  "all gore, all the time."  I have to keep clicking that remote lest I accidentally pause at an open-heart moment. The FCC should mandate a warning and a five-second delay:  "Caution:  palpitating inner organs on view shortly."

5.  Hostage.  Chained to a bed somewhere in the 'stans wouldn't work for me. I must have my oatmeal every morning at 7 a.m., and I need to move my bowels shortly afterward. Moreover, if I don't eat lunch right on time, I get wicked headaches. Not to mention that I don't function well in rooms that are either too hot or too cold or not well ventilated, and which are peopled with chain-smoking guards. On the whole, I'd be a mighty cranky hostage.

Title: Shakespeare and Dogs
Date: November 01, 2006

In a recent post, I casually mentioned that William Shakespeare was not fond
of dogs and I offered as evidence the fact that the two villainous sisters in
King Lear are called "dog-hearted daughters." Not convincing, says one of my
readers. Is that so? Well, let me offer further evidence of dog-heartedness.
Shakespeare's first true villain, Richard of Gloucester, is metaphorically
speaking, a dog. According to the legend, which the character himself embraces
and flaunts, Richard was born with a full set of teeth "which plainly signified/
That I should snarl and bite and play the dog." Not a tractable or ingratiating
dog either, but one who is both treacherous and poisonous: "when he fawns, he
bites; and when he bites,/ His venom tooth will rankle to the death." At the
end of Richard III, when Richard is killed at the climactic battle of Bosworth
Field, his heroic Tudor successor Henry Richmond proclaims victory in these
words: "God and your arms be praised, victorious friends,/ The day is ours, the
bloody dog is dead."  So here's a pretty pack of hounds: Goneril, Regan, and
Richard of Gloucester. And yet one more villain -- Iago in Othello: "O damn'd
Iago. O inhuman dog."

In the Shakespearian universe, villains are regularly described as dogs, but
dogs are never, ever, characterized as loyal, or affectionate, or helpful.
They're anything but our newspaper-fetching friends.  On the contrary,
dogs are "base," "unmanner'd," "thievish," "mangy," "hellish," "whoreson,"
"coward," "rascal," and "bloody." Shakespeare often uses the dysphemism
"cur" for dog. Curs are "mongrel," "cruel-hearted," "o'erweening," "whoreson
indistinguishable," and "venom-mouth'd." Hounds, highly regarded by some
for their hunting ability, are "false" or "fell and cruel." Both Richard of
Gloucester and Macbeth are "hell-hounds." Shakespeare's dogs are regularly
associated with disorder, violence and evil;  everyone knows Mark Anthony's
"Cry 'havoc,' and let slip the dogs of war."

Shakespeare draws upon dogs when he wants to describe an uncivilized and wild
world. Henry IV fears what England will become when his undisciplined son
succeeds him: "For the fifth Harry from curb'd license plucks/ The muzzle of
restraint, and the wild dog/ Shall flesh his tooth on every innocent." Dogs
are untrustworthy, because they are "easily won to fawn on any man." "They
turn... As dogs upon their masters." When the conspirators murdered Caesar, they
"fawn'd like hounds,/  And bowed like bondsmen, kissing Caesar's feet;/ Whilst
damned Casca, like a cur, behind/ Struck Caesar on the neck." Dogs are not only
disloyal, they're disgusting as well. In The Second Part of King Henry the
Fourth, Archbishop Scroop complains that the common people are no more loyal to
Henry than they were to his predecessor Richard II. "So, thou (i.e. the people)
common dog, did'st thou disgorge/ Thy glutton bosom of the royal Richard./ And
thou would'st eat thy dead vomit up,/ And howl'st to find it."

Shakespeare knew his dogs and had their names at his finger tips. Macbeth runs
through a catalog:  "hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs/ Shoughs,
water-rugs and demi-wolves, are clept/ All by the name of dogs." Mad Edgar, in
Lear, makes a similar list: "Be thy mouth or black or white,/ Tooth that poisons
if it bite;/ Mastiff, greyhound, mongrel grim./ Hound or spaniel, brach or lym,/
Bobtail tyke or trundle tail." Shakespeare had a particular and peculiar dislike
of fawning dogs, whom (as was first noticed by Walter Whiter in 1794) he lumps
together with (strange as it seems) candy or sweets, and images of melting.
When Hotspur thinks back to an early encounter with the future King Henry IV,
he remembers "Why, what a candy deal of courtesy, this fawning greyhound then
did proffer me." In Anthony and Cleopatra, Anthony realizes that his followers
are abandoning him; he laments that "the hearts/ That spaniel'd me at heels,
to whom I gave/ Their wishes, do discandy, Melt their sweets/ On blossoming
Caesar; and this pine is bark'd/ That overtopp'd them all." Flattering dogs and
sweets are bound so closely in Shakespeare's subconscious that sometimes the dog
is implicit rather than explicit. Hamlet to Horatio: "Why should the poor be
flattered./ No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,/ And crook the pregnant
hinges of the knee,/ Where thrift  [i.e. advantage] may follow fawning." A
reader who is familiar with Shakespeare's imagination can detect the ghost of a
fawning spaniel behind that "candied tongue." The ghost of a ghost is there also
in King Lear, where Lear, in his madness, imagines that he surrounded by a pack
of hounds: "The little dogs and all, Tray, Blanch, and Sweetheart, see, they
bark at me."

Did Shakespeare suffer some traumatic childhood event involving dogs and
candy? It has been so suspected?  Whether yea nor nay, it's more than clear
that Shakespeare's loathing of dogs was not of the surface; it was a deep and
elemental revulsion.

Title: What We Heard in the Fifties
Date: November 06, 2006

Regular readers (and even stray internet pilgrims) know that Dr. M. has composed
a series of entries called What We Read in the Fifties, in which he's revisited
books that were noteworthy or notorious during the days of his youth. It's been
a rewarding exercise, at least for him. Some of the books have been canonical
novels that were required reading in English class at Erasmus Hall High School,
some have been pop best-sellers which his more earnest teachers would have
scorned, and some have been cheap sensational paperbacks passed under the desk
from hand to grimy pubescent hand.

In the years that have passed since I first read these books, rivers have
changed course, glaciers have melted, and American society has altered almost
beyond recognition -- and yet the books have remained exactly the same. Reading
them has been an exercise in nostalgia and a test of memory, and also an
unwelcome insight into the incalculable callowness of adolescence. And yet, Dr.
Metablog has found readers -- or, at least, he thinks he has, for in May and
in December, when high school students all over America, yea, even across the
waters, write their assigned term papers on Lord of the Flies or The Catcher
in the Rye, blague-traffic spikes, and the dissenting views offered in these
essaylets are plagiarized and offered to a new generation of English teachers,
who reward them with grades of D or F.

I fear, however, that my readers might have gathered an erroneous impression of
1950s Flatbushian youth -- that they might have been literate or intellectual.
Let me clear my conscience and confess that for every hour that I spent reading
books that had actual bindings, I spent ten hours reading comic books and an
equal measure with my ear to the radio. It was the comics that taught me how to
read; I was well along in years before I came to realize that there were such
things as lower-case letters and that there could be sentences that didn't end
with exclamation points! In my neighborhood, super-heroes (Batman, the Flash,
Green Lantern, Wonder Woman) were as common as squirrels or starlings. But radio
-- radio serials-- affected us even more than the comics. Radio stimulated the
imagination, took us to worlds far way, presented us with alternative realities.
Members of my age-cohort will not forget the glories of radio:Jack Armstrong,
the All-American boy, who trotted the globe in support of native ideals and
Wheaties; Bobbie Benson, the youth who inherited the B-Bar-B ranch in the Big
Bend country, and who, along with Tex, Windy, and Harka, triumphed daily over
snakes, droughts, famines and outlaws; the Shadow, who had the power to "cloud
men's minds so they cannot see him," and who taught us, every day, that "the
weed of crime bears bitter fruit"; Sergeant Preston of the Northwest Mounted,
who fought crime and bad guys in the Yukon with horse and dog ("Well, King,
this case is closed"); and the Lone Ranger, who with the aid of Tonto and the
"thundering hoof beats of the great horse Silver" and with the marvelous voices
of exotic Detroit's Fred Foy and Brace Beemer, created an enduring mythology of
a spacious but vague and unlocatable west.

Radio gave scope to the listener's imagination. When television came along, and
these programs were translated into a visual form, they were all inevitably
diminished. It's no wonder that the great epics (Gilgamesh, the Odyssey and
Iliad, Beowulf, the Icelandic sagas) are oral creations. The spoken word can
cast spells that are beyond the capacity of visual forms. When it comes to
heroes, a single word is worth a thousand pictures.

Radio prepared me for Shakespeare. It's a fact that when Londoners crossed the
Thames to attend the Globe, they did not go to "see" a play; they went to "hear"
a play. There's a world of difference between seeing and hearing. When we "see"
a movie, 90% of the information comes to us through the eye. In a Shakespeare
play, it's exactly the opposite -- 90%, or more, of the information comes to
us by way of the ear -- which is why recordings of Shakespeare's plays can be
so entirely successful and so true to the original intent. And because the
plays are primarily oral, with their big speeches and complicated rhetorical
patterning and brilliant displays of verbal acuity, they can also be larger-
than-life -- and they can be heroic. Shakespeare's plays are closer to radio
than they are to any other modern literary form. Those of us who grew up with
radio bring to Shakespeare an intuitive understanding of oral forms that precede
television, film, and even precede the theater itself  -- especially decadent
modern theater with its compulsive and distracting visual distortions.

Title: Flying the Flag
Date: November 09, 2006

Yesterday, we dug out our grand old American flag and flew it from the holder
that I had improvised after 9/11. We flew it to celebrate two great changes: a)
the Democratic triumph in Tuesday's election, which restored a bit of our faith
in representative government, and b) the end of the arrogant reign of Donald
Rumsfeld, the principal mover (except for the cowboy-in-chief himself) of this
foolish, disastrous adventurism in the Middle East. We're hoping for a return to
common sense in America, but we're not entirely optimistic  -- the guy who's
in charge doesn't read, can't admit he's ever made a mistake, and takes his
marching orders from a) Rove, b) his gut, and c) his narrow, parochial version
of the great signifier in the sky  -- in what order of priority no one knows.

Rumsfeld should have been out on his ass years ago. He had lost the respect of
the soldiers, certainly of the generals, the congress, and, as we now know from
the election results, of ordinary Americans everywhere. However, until yesterday
he could still patronize and mystify the journalists, and he could still issue
instructions to those beneath him in the chain of command.  And generals obey
even when they despise the person issuing the orders.

In 1606, Shakespeare described the psychological relations between the generals
and their civilian commander. Of Macbeth, Angus says that "Those he commands
move only in command,/ Nothing in love." That is, they do what they're told, but
they hate doing it. Here's the full transcript of Angus's remarks: "Now does
[Macbeth] feel/ His secret murders sticking on his hands;/ Now minutely revolts
upbraid his faith-breach;/ Those he commands move only in command,/ Nothing in
love: Now does he feel his title/ Hang loose upon him, like a giant's robe/ Upon
a dwarfish thief."

It's hopeless to expect that Rumsfeld would recognize that the mantle of
Secretary of Defense hung upon him as Angus describes Macbeth's (or, as does, a
fortiori, the presidential mantle upon its own wearer) -- there's not sufficient
insight or perspective or self-knowledge around the White House these days. But
we know exactly what Angus meant, and we know that some of our so-called leaders
are nothing more than dwarfish thiefs.

("Minutely" means "every minute";  "Now minutely revolts upbraid his faith-
breach" means "every minute a revolt [by one of his former followers] pays
Macbeth back for his own breach of faith, i.e. assassinating Duncan.)

Title: What We Read in the Fifties:  All the King's Men
Date: November 13, 2006

I've now re-read Robert Penn Warren's All the King's Men (1946), a novel that I
hadn't looked at since the early 1950s. Once again memory has played its tricks.
My fifty-year-old afterimage does not correspond to reality. The book that I
thought I remembered focused on Willie Stark (Huey Long) -- his ascent to power,
his anti-establishment politics, his ruthlessness, and his assassination. 
Willie Stark does in fact appear in the book that I re-read, but he's not
the central figure -- not even close. It's a novel about Jack Burden, press-
secretary and chief blackmailer for Stark, and about the various spokes of
Burden's wheel: his semi-aristocratic mother, his lawyer-turned-religious-
fanatic father, the apparently upstanding judge who was his mother's lover,
his childhood sweetheart Anne Stanton and her doctor brother, and also Sadie
Burke, the Boss's secretary-girlfriend-political guru, and of course about Stark
himself.  Perhaps I misremembered because the Willie Stark parts of the novel
are so strong, or perhaps my memory was filtered through the 1949 Robert Rossen
film. Even half a century later, it's hard to read the book without seeing
Broderick Crawford and Mercedes McCambridge in the mind's eye. (The film is now
in the Netflix queue, so I'll revisit it shortly.)

It's a good book, well worth the prizes and the accolades. For my money, there
could have been more politics and more Louisiana and less young-man-searching-
for-his-identity. It's a big, as they say, "sprawling" novel; sometimes the
sprawl works, but at other times -- the long flashback in which adolescent Jack
woos adolescent Anne, for example -- an editor's scissors would have done the
novel a world of good. The prose is mannered and affected and derivative: hunks
of Thomas Wolfe, a dollop here and there of Faulkner, along with extra-large
helpings of Chandler or Hammett. But it's nevertheless strong writing.

Melodramatic?  Yes, indeed: murders and suicides, betrayals and reversals,
mysteries and exposures. But at the core, a genuine curiosity about America
and its southland. All the King's Men persuasively creates a culture in which
genuine goodness is mere namby-pamby and in which ruthlessness has become
reasonable. To succeed in such a world, Jack Burden and Willie Stark become as
corrupt as the world around them.

The Huey Long material is excellent groundwork for a novel. Warren dresses it
up with paragraph after paragraph of murky philosophizing. I confess that I
didn't make the effort to absorb the meditations -- they seemed to be the usual
southern stuff about religion and about the weight of history. I think that
readers are supposed to learn that "if you could not accept the past and its
burden there was no future, for without the one there cannot be the other, and
... if you could accept the past you might hope for the future, for only out of
the past can you make the future."  But if such a platitude is the best that
Warren can do, it's best to skip the tepid philosophy and stick with the rich
and abundant storytelling.

Title: Mosquito Sex
Date: November 15, 2006

Sexnews from the mosquitosphere: "if larvae of Aedes stimulans are raised at
75F, about half become males and half become females. But if they are raised at
84F, only 9F higher, they all become almost complete females."  Almost complete
females?  What's the meaning of "almost complete?"  Either they're male, or
they're female.  Doesn't the good book say that "male and female created he
them?"

Here's the surprising scoop. "Larvae that would have become males lack the big
bushy antennae of the normal male and have mouth parts and external genitalia
that are indistinguishable from those of a "real" female. Furthermore,
"feminized" males have no testicles or other internal male organs of
reproduction, but they do have ovaries and other internal female organs of
reproduction. Some feminized males have even mated with normal males and been
inseminated, but they laid no eggs."

All this mosquito sex science comes from entomologist Gilbert Waldbauer, author
of A Walk Around the Pond (Cambridge [Harvard], 2006).

Professor Waldbauer claims to love his insects but he is unmoved by the plight
of the 84F feminized males. Can there be sadder words in Aedes households all
over the warming earth than "they laid no eggs?"  It's poignant, perhaps even
tragic.

How do the mosquitoes themselves feel about attenuated antennae and awkward
genitalia?  If Waldbauer had looked with a more compassionate eye, he would
have noticed that "normal" males of the 75F variety wave their big bushy
antennae and point and laugh at the feeble mini-antennae of the wannabe females.
He would also have noticed that wannabe females are stigmatized and often
depressed because they are so frequently picked on by "normal" males, who
regularly direct loud, scornful, threatening whines at the antennae-impaired.

There's a crisis of values in mosquitoland. Many "normal" males are
fundamentally convinced that the wannabes have made a conscious choice to mimic
females and that water temperature has absolutely nothing to do with it. Some
among the "normal" males -- the more enlightened -- propose that with the right
kind of counseling and prayer, the mimics can be reclaimed. But other "normal"
males hate, simply hate, the males who consort with the feminized wannabes. They
condemn as unnatural all intercourse between the normal and the feminized, and
they proclaim the actual act of insemination to be the work of the devil.

I myself wonder why the "normal" males get themselves into such a twist.  I'm
tempted to think that they protest too much -- that they themselves secretly
lust after the feminized males.

I'll ask the expert, Professor Waldbauer. If he doesn't know, I'll get a second
opinion. Perhaps the Rev. Ted Haggard would like to share his insights.

Title: And Speaking of Mosquitoes...
Date: November 16, 2006

Once upon a time I had a foolproof system for clearing a bedroom of
mosquitoes.  Close the door, turn on a light, stick the left arm out of the
bedclothes, keep track of the mosquitoes by their whine, and then, as soon as
one lands on the exposed skin, smack it with the right hand.  After a few
minutes, turn out the light, sleep tight. Used to work wonders.

The system doesn't work any more?  Why?  Because my antiquated ears no longer
register high-pitched sounds. I can't hear mosquitoes until one of them pecks on
my eardrum.  I'm vulnerable to sneak attack.

It's bad: all mosquitoes are now stealth mosquitoes. It's good: I'll never again
be troubled by that nasty whine.

Title: "A Strange Slavery to Beauty"
Date: November 22, 2006

On September 6, 1664, Sam Pepys purchased for his young wife a pair of gloves
trimmed with yellow ribbon. At 20 shillings, he knew that he overpaid but
he was not at all sorry, because Doll, the 'Change woman from whom he made
the purchase was "so pretty, that, God forgive me! I could not think it too
much -- which is a strange slavery that I stand in to beauty, that I value
nothing near it."  Pepys, God forgive him, was not only enthralled by handsome
women, but was attentive to beauty in all its manifestations.  He loved plays
and performances, paintings and prints and architecture, as well as music,
especially songs and ballads.  Pepys's life was ruled by his "strange slavery
to beauty."

But why should he have described his fascination as "strange?"  If there is a
single trait that distinguishes not just Pepys but human beings as a species,
it is an irrepressible love of things beautiful.  For every one of their
senses, humans have created an appropriate form of art. Hearing?  Music and
song.  Sight? drawing and painting and sculpture and film. Taste? elaborate
cookery. Motion?  the dance.  Speech and language?  literature from lyric
to epic to novel.  Moreover, there's scarcely a substance that human beings
have encountered in their time on the planet that they haven't transformed
into something harmonious and elegant.  At first, bone and stone and fur; and
then wood and metal and cloth and clay.  Occasionally, some anthropologist
will emerge from his laboratory with a theory that the fundamental human trait
is  -- you name it -- aggressiveness, or territoriality, or the ability to
play games, or an interest in the future, or the capacity for bonding into
societies.  Such theories have a bit of truth, but they overlook the obvious. 
The essence of humanity, in my view, is the drive to create and to appreciate
beauty.  Pepys' "strange slavery" is not a bit strange;  it's universal.

As for myself, I believe that I can remember the exact day, hour and minute when
I was first struck by beauty.  My moment of ascension occurred in a garden.  I
must have been twelve or thirteen years old (and therefore not fully human). 
One spring day I tagged along with a gang of schoolyard savages to the Zoo
to see if we could get ourselves into a little trouble.  So there we were,
running about, screaming and hiding and throwing stones at each other and clods
of dirt at the respectable zoo patrons. Someone must have called the cops,
because the next thing I knew we had all scattered and I was running as fast
as I could.  In those days I was small and spry and any fence that I couldn't
squeeze through I could certainly clamber over.  And what's a little barbed
wire to a frightened urchin?  Separated from my cohort, I became completely
lost.  Eventually, I found myself in the Brooklyn Botanic Garden which was then
as now adjacent to the zoo.  I climbed over one or two more fences and entered
(not by a gate, but surreptitiously) the famous, mature, refined Japanese Garden
-- one of the great artistic achievements in all of America.  I was dazzled in
all my senses-- it was a true epiphany.  I particularly remember the red cut
leaf maples and the wisteria.  Of course I was too ignorant to know that it was
wisteria;  I only knew that I was surrounded by magnificent cascades of blue
flowers in abundant bloom.

Here are some pictures of the garden.  Just take a look, and then try to
imagine an uncivilized pre-adolescent, a scared, sweaty, ragtag child, a product
of concrete schoolyards and filthy subways stumbling upon such a amenable place.

What good fortune it was to have vaulted that one last fence!

I think that I've spent the rest of my life trying to get back to that
garden -- or, more accurately, I've spent it trying to recreate and to re-live
the aesthetic explosion that I experienced at that epiphanic moment.  When
I travel. I make it a point to visit the world-famous gardens, and when I'm
at home I work on my own landscape.  But it's not just gardens -- the most
ephemeral of art forms --to which I stand in strange slavery.  I've found
the aesthetic shiver in other places.  Poetry, Shakespeare in particular,
is always at hand.  Is there a civilized soul who can read "Do not laugh at
me;/ For (as I am a man) I think this lady/ To be my child, Cordelia" without
dropping a pleasurable tear.  The Winter's Tale, which is the finest play in
the history of this or any other universe, is a fountain of delights, especially
Perdita's "I was not much afeard; for once or twice/ I was about to speak and
tell him plainly,/ The selfsame sun that shines upon his court/ Hides not his
visage from our cottage but/ Looks on alike" -- a sentiment which may be the
most genuinely democratic in thirty-eight otherwise monarchist dramas.  Visual
arts also are a constant source of pure delight;  in a gallery of Rembrandts
at the Metropolitan Museum I was once so ecstatic that my heart began to beat
uncontrollably.  And in Helsinki, I had a moment of pure architectural joy at
the Church of the Rock -- the most beautiful and holy of buildings.

But of all art forms, it's music that is most reliably transcendent.  My tastes
have evolved over the years:  Dvorak and Mahler are in the past but Beethoven's
great fugue still sets my spine on edge and so does the long harpsichord solo in
Bach's Fifth Brandenburg.  Recordings usually (but not always) work better than
live performances.  When I'm in the right mood, I play the shivery passages
again and again.  Nowadays the single most lovely piece of music is the great
chaconne from Bach's second violin partita.  Hilary Hahn's performance is my
favorite, but the chaconne is almost as exciting in Celadonio Romero's guitar
transcription and in the Brahms piano version (for virtuoso left hand only). 
The chaconne does all that music can do, and it does it in fifteen unaccompanied
minutes.

It's not just classical music.  I'm also strangely enslaved to what is now
called "golden era gospel" -- the singing of the "Heavenly Gospel Singers" and
the "Harmonizing Four" and Clara Ward and Brother Joe May and Dorothy Love
Coates and the "Swan Silvertones" and the "Five Blind Boys of Alabama." A
small sample of some of my many, many favorites:  Mahalia Jackson's long live
version of "How I Got Over"; the "Roberta Martin Singers"' "Standing on the
Promises"; Sister Rosetta Tharpe and Marie Knight singing "Beams of Heaven"; the
"Sensational Nightingales" "Brightly Beams";  perhaps the best of the best: 
Professor J. Earle Hines, "God Be With You."  In such great music resides the
aesthetic ecstasy, that, when we open ourselves to it, makes us most completely
human.

On November 22, 1963, we were living in a small third-floor walkup on Irving
Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  It was in the afternoon.  Some high
schools students (Cambridge High and Latin was just around the corner) were
walking by.  One of them shouted to another, "Kennedy's been shot.  In
Dallas."   I immediately thought "this is bad.  That kid shouldn't know that
Kennedy's in Dallas."  So we turned on the radio.  And began to grieve.

I don't think that this country's ever regained its balance.  Jack, and then
Bobbie and Martin Luther King  -- the heroes of the left taken out, one by one,
by assassins.  Without the murders, we'd never have had Nixon and Reagan and
Cheney and Bush and Rumsfeld.

If we ever can get the United States on track again, then, only then, can we
cease to grieve.

Life has certainly changed since I was growing up in the 1940s and 1950s.  Here
are some of the key inventions that have made life better for me and for all
sentient Americans.

1)  the retractable vacuum cleaner cord. Truly one heck of an improvement. 
Just step on the little lever, and the cord comes flying back into the
machine.  It used to be, I'd waste minutes tying the thing up only to watch it
immediately unravel.

2)  fitted sheets.  Just snap them on and have done with it.  Perhaps the
greatest improvement in standard of living in my lifetime.  No more folding
under and then waking up in the middle of the night sleeping on the mattress
tufts.

3)  the bungee cord.  A stroke of true genius.  For packing the top of the
car, an unparalleled innovation.  And nowadays, I keep a pair of them strapped
to the lawn-tractor cart.  I use the bungee cords to double the load that I can
carry in one trip.

4)  luggage wheels.  Pull instead of carrying.  What a concept!!  Luggage,
marooned for centuries in the paleolithic, finally discovers the wheel (and just
in time to save my shoulders).

5) the mute button. Just a flick of the thumb and the commercial voice
disappears.  A godsend.

That's my top five.  Any other suggestions out there in the blogworld will be
sincerely appreciated.

November 30.  I'm so chagrined.  I've forgotten the most remarkable invention
of the last several decades:  duct tape.  In our household, duct tape holds
together more items than gravity.

Title: Violence in My Life
Date: November 28, 2006

A few weeks ago, I wrote about my violent nightmares.  And now I shall unclasp
a secret book and write about real-life violence in my life -- to be exact,
about a murder and an attempted murder.

In the middle-1970s, I exchanged jobs, homes and automobiles with a faculty
member of a university in England.  I will call this person by the fabricated
name of Maurice Shaper.  Although I certainly profited from teaching in a new
setting, and I loved the city in southeastern England in which we lived, Mr.
Shaper himself was a disaster.  He missed half of his classes and was cruel to
my students when he did present himself.  He fled town early, leaving behind
stacks of unread papers, distressed students who had not received grades or
credit for the work, and a mess that took me a full year to resolve.  Moreover,
Mr. Shaper, who had a friend on the west coast and was commuting 1200 miles
bi- weekly, put 60,000 miles on my Dodge station wagon before smashing it into
another vehicle on a rainy California road.  Within an hour of our arrival
home, we were greeted with a summons and a lawsuit -- as owners of the car we
were liable -- from the occupants of the maimed vehicle. It was a lawsuit that
took a number of years to run its expensive course.  In short, I must admit
that I nursed more than a little antagonism to Mr. Shaper.  Anger, I'd say, but
something less than murderous rage.

Some five years later I returned to England.  The morning after I arrived,
I was standing on the steps of the British Museum in Bloomsbury waiting for
the building to open when an acquaintance came up to me with a newspaper. 
"Have you seen this?" he asked, and showed me an item in The Times. "University
Lecturer Murdered."   And sure enough, Mr. Maurice Shaper had been killed
in his own home -- the home in which I had lived for a year.  Although it
didn't say so in the newspaper, I was later informed that he had been in the
habit of picking up young men on the Dover Road and bringing them home.  He
must have misjudged his quarry, because he had been slashed in the neck with a
broken liquor bottle and had bled to death in his bathroom.  His Peugeot and
his camera and a few other items had been stolen and the presumed murderer had
disappeared.  What was so odd was that he had been killed just a few hours
after I arrived at Heathrow.

That's the murder;  now the attempted murder.

In my second year at college, I had a roommate (let us call him Peter Dickerman)
with whom I was in perpetual conflict.  I'm not generally short-tempered, but
once, I was so angry at him that I actually picked up a carving knife and waved
it in his direction.  Eventually we came to a truce of sorts;  although we
inhabited the same rooms, we didn't speak to each other for the last months of
the semester.  Mr. Dickerman then went his way and I went mine.

Thirty years later, I was in Washington DC for a couple of weeks doing some
reading at a specialized library when I read in the Washington Post that someone
had attempted to murder a northern Virginia psychologist.  The victim, Peter
Dickerman, had received a letter-bomb in the mail.  He had opened it, there
was an explosion, and he was burned over 60% of his body.  The story was a
sensation for a few days but gradually faded from view.  It's my understanding
that Dickerman did not die.  (I've now googled him under his real name and I
see that he's still practicing psychiatry in Virginia.)

So two times in my life, a person with whom I've been in serious conflict has
been violently attacked.  And both times, I've been close at hand.  A little
creepy, isn't it?

The man who murdered Maurice Shaper was arrested and convicted.  The identity
of the person who mailed the letter bomb to Peter Dickerman is unknown to me.

Title: Among the Struldbrugs
Date: December 02, 2006

In the little read Book III of Swift's Gulliver's Travels, Lemuel Gulliver finds
himself on the island of Luggnagg, where there is a group of people called
Struldbrugs who are "blessed" with eternal life.  On hearing of Struldbrugs,
Gulliver waxes ecstatic:  "happiest, beyond all comparison, are those excellent
STRULDBRUGS, who, being born exempt from that universal calamity of human
nature, have their minds free and disengaged, without the weight and depression
of spirits caused by the continual apprehensions of death!"  Gulliver is soon
disabused of his enthusiasm.  He learns that after an allotted number of years
have passed, the Struldbrugs are declared legally dead, but that they continue
to grow older, feebler, and more wretched.  It's hard to know whether Swift
points his satire at human optimism or whether he is simply repulsed by extreme
old age.

In any case, we've been spending much time at the nursing home lately,
visiting the Aged P (I'm using the euphemism adopted by John Wemmick in Great
Expectations).  Friends, you don't have to voyage to Luggnagg to learn that
it's possible to live far too long;  the evidence is close at hand.  Let's try
to remember to get the heck out of here while the going's good -- before we too
are metamorphosized into a bunch of Struldbrugs.

Title: Some Stretchers
Date: December 06, 2006

We're in Washington visiting our four-year-old granddaughter (and her parents,
of course).  This morning I walked the little girl to her Montessori
pre-school. As we passed some dormant rhododendrons, the grand-daughter told
me that she saw a "very large antelope" resting under the bushes.  I like her
style -- not a dog, or even a deer -- an antelope!  And a very large one to
boot.  I love her sincerity, and I love it that she's still young enough to
live in the imagination.  What a gift!

Here are some other "stretchers"  -- Huck Finn's word  -- that she's told me
during this visit.  That she once ate thirteen bananas in a row.  That her
mother and her grandmother had just gone to the Antarctic.  That she had six
brothers and eleven sisters.  That the cheese that she was eating was made
entirely of "green slimy boogers."  That she had just pooped on her cat.  That
she built the neighbor's new picket fence.  "You did?  How did you do it?" 
 "With power tools."   That she had eaten a whole meal of eyeballs.

Well, she'll have to live in the world of hard facts soon enough.  Everyone
must, even those of our leaders who would prefer to reject the "reality-based" 
universe.  I say, let her enjoy the fantasy just as long as she is able.

Title: The P. S. 217 "Assembly"
Date: December 08, 2006

During the 1940s and early 1950s, when I was a pupil at P. S. 217, the school
auditorium was given over to formal weekly "assemblies." Boys were required
to wear white shirts and green ties (girls had a specified outfit as well, but
in those days I was so unconscious of a) girls and b) their costumes that I'm
darned if I can remember what was worn by the young ladies). Before entering
the auditorium, classes lined up in "size places." P. S. 217 was particularly
strong on "size places" -- a point of particular humiliation for me, because I
was, as WS says about R of G, "so long a-growing, and so leisurely" that I was
by far the smallest child in every class from first grade to eighth. After we
found our assigned seats (boys in one row, girls in the next), our principal
Miss Bildersee, a formidable and incredibly ancient woman with nostrils so huge
and distended that an agile boy could go spelunking in them, would perform
the mandatory reading from the Bible. Blessings on her fond old heart, Miss
Bildersee regularly choose melodious passages from the book of Psalms. I was
particularly struck by the eloquence of "Blessed is the man that walketh not in
the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in
the seat of the scornful," with its abrupt counterbalancing antistrophe: "the
ungodly are not so, but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away." After
the Bible reading and some announcements, there was usually a performance of
some sort. Choral readings, the oddest of art forms, were far too frequent.
I remember that I was once a member of a sextet of quavering sopranos who
memorized and recited the patriotic World War I poem "In Flanders Fields." What
in the world was a second-grader supposed to make of "We are the Dead. Short
days ago/ We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,/Loved and were loved, and now we
lie/In Flanders fields./Take up our quarrel with the foe:/To you from failing
hands we throw/The torch; be yours to hold it high./If ye break faith with us
who die/ We shall not sleep, though poppies grow/ In Flanders fields." (Such
poppycock was received as true literary greatness. It would have been beyond
utopian imagination that our teachers would have known or introduced us to
the distinguished WWI poetry of Wilfred Owen or Isaac Rosenberg or Siegfried
Sassoon or Edward Thomas.) Then our music specialist Mrs. Georgia Keiselbach
would sit down at the piano and teach us songs, some of them also left over from
the first World War:  "Keep the home-fires burning,/ While your hearts are
yearning,/ Though your lads are far away/ They dream of home;/ There's a silver
lining/Through the dark cloud shining,/Turn the dark cloud inside out,/Till the
boys come home." And also: "Give me some men who are stout-hearted men/ Who
will fight for the right they adore... Shoulder to shoulder, and bolder and
bolder."  And: "Tramp, tramp, tramp along the highway/Tramp, tramp, tramp, the
road is free...  We're planters and Canucks/ Virginians and Kentucks/Captain
Dick's own Infantry/ Captain Dick's own Infantry," which I now know to have
come from Victor Herbert's Naughty Marietta (1910) and which provoked a great
deal of surreptitious tittering because it had the word "dick" in it. In
those unenlightened days we sang very many overtly religious songs: "White
Christmas" and "Silent Night" and "Easter Parade." I much admired the tune
of "The First Noel" but I had no idea what was meant by "born is the king of
Israel" -- the only Israel I knew of was a recently-founded democracy. I
loved the Thanksgiving hymn "We gather together to ask the Lord's blessing;/
He chastens and hastens His will to make known;/ The wicked oppressing now
cease from distressing,/ Sing praises to His name; He forgets not his own" and
many more stanzas, none of which I could parse or understand (still can't, in
fact!). Another Thanksgiving song: "Over the river and through the woods/
To grandmother's house we go/The horse knows the way/To carry the sleigh...,"
which I found to be curiously disorienting because my particular grandmother
lived in a tiny third-floor walkup on noisy and sweaty Coney Island Avenue. We
sang the immensely mysterious Lord's Prayer (in the Schubert setting, I later
discovered). Why did we so?  Were the heathens and Jews among us expected to
convert on the spot? I much preferred the patriotic songs, although even they
too were permeated with inexplicable theology. We were fervent jingos.   Not
one, but two full stanzas of "The Battle Hymn of the Republic": "In the beauty
of the lilies, Christ was born across the sea,/With a glory in His bosom, that
transfigures you and me/ As he died to make men holy, let us die to make men
free,/ For God is marching on." And two stanzas also of "The Star-Spangled
Banner": "Oh! thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand/ Between their loved
home and the war's desolation!/ Blessed with victory and peace, may the heav'n
rescued land/ Praise the Power that hath made and preserv'd us a nation./Then
conquer we must, when our cause it is just,/ And this be our motto: 'In God
is our trust.'" I preferred the rousing "O Columbia! the gem of the ocean,/
The home of the brave and the free,/ The shrine of each patriot's devotion,/ A
world offers homage to thee" and "God Bless America" as well as the jingoist
exceptionalism and cluttered syntax of "Our father's God, to thee/ Author of
liberty/ To thee we sing./  Long may our land be bright/ With freedom's holy
light;/ Protect us by thy might/ Great God our King."

Here's a song we were distinctly not taught and did not sing: "This land is your
land, this land is my land/ From California, to the New York Island./ From
the redwood forest, to the Gulf Stream waters/ This land was made for you and
me." We especially did not sing: "In the squares of the city  -- in the
shadow of the steeple/  Near the relief office -- I see my people/ And some
are grumblin' and some are wonderin' /If this land's still made for you and me."

December 17.  I now remember that we sang musical settings to two familiar
poems. The first, Emma Lazarus's inscription on the Statue of Liberty: "Give
me your tired, your poor/ Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free/ The
wretched refuse of your teeming shore." Hey, that's my grandparents you're
calling "wretched refuse." The second, Joyce Kilmer's horrid "Trees": "I think
that I shall never see/  A poem lovely as a tree...  A tree who's hungry mouth
is pressed/ Against the earth's sweet-flowing breast" etc.  This song was only
palatable because it allowed us to say the word "breast" out loud.

(Thanks to Steve and to Barry, graduates of P. S. 217, for jogging my memory; 
thanks also to David [P. S. 102].

Title: Xmas Thoughts
Date: December 09, 2006

If the profoundly religious seventeenth-century founders of our country had a
single favorite Biblical moment, it might be where the Lord (speaking through
His prophet Amos) severely condemned the vanity of holidays. "I hate," said
the Lord, "I despise your feast days, and I will not smell in your solemn
assemblies."  The Lord of Hosts specifically enjoined against the attempt
to placate him by sacrificing animals (a matter of topical concern in Amos'
time).  "Though ye offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings, I will not
accept them; neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat beasts." 
Nor did He rest with these easy-to-follow injunctions, but He went on to condemn
all musical tributes as well.  Nor more chants, glees or carols: "Take thou
away from me the noise of thy songs; for I will not hear the melody of thy
viols."  Our Puritan forefathers interpreted these lines correctly; they
recognized that the Lord opposed not only ritual sacrifice and music but all
formal observance and rote piety. The Ancient of Days made it abundantly clear
that what moved him was not empty ceremony but genuine morality.  HIs solution:
"let justice run down as waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream."  Taking
these uncompromising sentences as their guide, our founders dug in their heels
against the ostentatious celebration of of all holidays, especially Christmas.

Would they not have been reduced to angry and impotent sobs by the grotesque
consumerism -- the burnt offerings and squeaking timbrels  -- that in 2006
substitute for justice and righteousness?  Could there be anything more
loathsome either to Amos or to our devout ancestors than "Silent Night" at a
shopping mall?

Ah for a twenty-first century Amos!

Further observations on the "holiday season" can be found here.

We're just back from a week in Greenwich Village. Here are some of the stores
that were within two or three blocks of our temporary residence: "Beasty Feast
Pet Food Supplies"; "Cherry Boxx" (sex toys and outfits); "Golden Rule Wine and
Liquor"; "Henrietta Hudson Bar and Girl"; "Badlands Entertainment" (xxx videos);
"Condomania" -- all kinds of condoms and related gear; "Suds Cafe" (a laundromat
and espresso bar); a shop that specializes in "eyebrow threading"; the "Sports
Cap and Hat Store"; "Man + Plus" (which I read as Man plus plus); "Yuki's
Chinese Restaurant" (bad corporate name); "Birthday Suit" (bachelorette-fetish,
the sign clarified); the "Why Not Men's Spa"; "Pet Portraits"; "Doodle-Doos"
(a children's hair salon); "Kid's RX" (children's prescription drugs); and
"Cowgirl" -- I couldn't recognize anything in the cowgirl stock, certainly
nothing that would home on the range; also, an admirable piece of commercial
hyperbole: "Splendid Dry Cleaners." In addition, a truck bearing the name "Dr.
Playground" -- mobile playground repairs, I would suppose. All in all, quite a
remarkable display of capitalist initiative.

Title: What We Read in the Fifties:  Ivanhoe
Date: December 19, 2006

For an entire lifetime I've had a ghastly relationship with Sir Walter Scott.
Ivanhoe was a mandatory book in the Erasmus Hall High School English curriculum
and I remember reading the novel with painful indifference. It's entirely
possible that I didn't persevere to the final pages but instead relied upon
the 1952 film. At various times I've made an effort to read novels by Sir
Walter, but time and again I've foundered. Twenty or so years ago, Old Mortality
and Redgauntlet were being trumpeted by academic critics, and I gave each
novel a fair trial, but, after a chapter or two, ran aground on the sandbar
of dullness. As part of my project of re-reading books that were popular or
required in the 1950s, I tackled Ivanhoe again, and I can report that this time
I read it to the very last drop -- but what a colossal effort! I never "got
into" it but read it in gobbets of five or six pages at a time before succumbing
to boredom or sleep. I deserve the 2006 Bulwer-Lytton Prize for Drudgery.

Why did our elders judge Ivanhoe to be suitable for 10th graders? The plot
plods, the characters are unidimensional cliches, and there's a total want of
suspense. The dialogue is ludicrous. It reminds me of what Jonson said about
Spenser--that "in affecting the ancients, he writ no language." But in point of
fact, Scott does write a language--he writes bad Blackadderese. "Fear not, my
lord. I must speak with you in private, before you mount your palfrey." "Have
patience, sir. I might retort your accusation, and blame the inconsiderate
levity which foiled my design."  "A truce with your raillery, sir knight." 
"If thou refusest my fair proffer, the provost of the lists shall cut thy bow-
string, break thy bow and arrows and expel thee from the presence as a faint-
hearted craven." And on and on for four hundred mucilaginous pages.

There's another roadblock to empathetic reading. Ivanhoe features a Jewish
money-lender named Isaac who's a walking inventory of stereotypes: he's
usurious, greedy, faint-hearted, fawning, and although he claims poverty, is
secretly rolling in shekels. He sums up all the worst aspects of both Shylock
and Fagin. But Scott thinks we should forgive Isaac even though he's such a
miserable human being, and by asking us to do so, he somehow manages to make
tolerance even more offensive than bigotry itself.In addition, Isaac has an
impossibly beauteous and virtuous daughter named Rebecca. Yes, it's a miracle,
says Scott, but there are Jews (or at least Jewesses) who are not money-grubbing
villains. Thanks a lot, Sir Walter.

Why was Ivanhoe high-school fare?  Beats the heck out of me. And it makes me
angry to think that this bad book was thrust down our throats. Let's put those
upstart immigrants in their place, is what they were saying. Was it malevolent
or merely unconscious? Difficult to ascertain, but after slogging through
Ivanhoe, I'm not in a forgiving mood.

January 7.  I've now watched the 1952 Ivanhoe with Elizabeth Taylor as Jessica,
an aging Robert Taylor as Ivanhoe, and an aging Joan Fontaine as Rowena. It's a
bit dated and it occasionally anticipates Monty Python and the Holy Grail, but
it's not half bad. The writer, who had the wonderful name of Aeneas McKenzie,
discarded the novel, started from scratch, and composed a screenplay that has
action and adventure and romance and every once in a while borrows an incident
from Sir Walter Scott. A good strategy, in my view.

Title: Frost
Date: December 22, 2006

When I lived in Cambridge in the first years of the 1960s, it was not unusual
to encounter, on a warm winter afternoon, the poet Robert Frost walking slowly
along Massachusetts Avenue. I'd watch him as he strolled over to Plympton Street
and to the Grolier -- which was then as now, I imagine, the only all-poetry
bookstore in America. One day I crept behind him to the shop and sat in a
secluded corner, studying him as he browsed the shelf of new arrivals. With his
leathery old skin and unruly iridescent white hair, he was an iconic figure --
famous not only among friends of poetry but among readers of Life and Collier's
and The Saturday Evening Post. When he "said" his poems at Sanders Theater
(in late 1961 or 1962), he filled every seat and every standpoint of a large
auditorium. He was an honest-to-goodness celebrity, a presence, a man who had
created a body of work and had earned a reputation that no poet or cultural
figure today can rival.

At JFK's inauguration in January of 1961, Frost commanded a national television
audience. He started to read the poem he had composed for the occasion, but his
87-year-old eyes were blinded by the bright sunlight and he couldn't continue.
There was a moment of embarrassment, and I remember cringing in sympathy with
his struggle. But then he gathered himself and recited from memory, in a
rejuvenated voice, "The Gift Outright." "She was our land more than a hundred
years/ Before we were her people." It's an almost mystical but grandly patriotic
poem about rude, unlettered colonials transforming themselves into a Nation.
"Such as we were we gave ourselves outright.../ To the land vaguely realizing
westward,/ But still unstoried, artless, unenhanced, / Such as she was, such as
she would become."

Frost died in January of 1963, just ten months before our young president
was shot. It's almost impossible now to reconstruct the effervescence of the
Kennedy years -- a brief exciting moment between the lukewarm bland Eisenhower
administration and the interminable nightmare of Vietnam. Frost's "Dedication,"
the poem that he couldn't read at the inaugural, is not his best work, but its
last lines catch the spirit of the time. The poet took his inspiration from the
Rome of Augustus and of Horace, Virgil, and Ovid. "It is no miracle the mood is
high," he wrote.  "It makes the prophet in us all presage/ The glory of the
next Augustan age/ Of a power leading from its strength and pride,/ Of young
ambition eager to be tried,/ Firm in our free beliefs without dismay,/ In any
game the nations want to play./ A golden age of poetry and power/ Of which this
noonday's the beginning hour." Frost proved to be a better poet than a prophet.
Instead of a golden age of poetry and power, we've had, after the three horrible
murders, a parade of fools: first the crook, then the senile puppet, then the
congressional fellatio hunters, and now the smirking, dangerous dunce.

Like the nation, I too am in steep decline. It used to be that I could memorize
short poems with ease. Nowadays, it's a titanic effort of will. To forestall
hardening of the mind, and in a desperate effort to keep my brain supple, I
decided to memorize Frost's "Birches." It's when you learn a poem by heart
that you truly appreciate it, and so I can now say with absolute confidence
and authority that "Birches" is a poem not just for the age, but for all time.
In point of fact, I've been bothering myself about how Frost will fare in
civilizations as far into the future as Virgil and Horace are in our past. Will
students of poetry be able to grasp the subtlety of "Birches?" The story, the
plot itself, will pose no problem. Frost knows that birches are bent to the
ground by ice-storms, but he would fancifully "prefer to have some boy bend
them/ As he went out and in to fetch the cows." For the "boy," tree-climbing is
a high art: "He always kept his poise/ To the top branches, climbing carefully/
With the same pains you use to fill a cup/ Up to the brim, and even above the
brim." Frost then shifts perspective, and the fantasy that birches are bent not
by ice-storms but by athletic youngsters transforms into a memory, a truth: "So
was I once myself a swinger of birches;/ And so I dream of going back to be." He
closes the poem with a vision in which he leaves the real world and starts life
anew: "I'd like to go by climbing a birch tree,/ And climb black branches up a
snow-white trunk/ Toward heaven, till the tree could bear no more,/ But dipped
its top and set me down again." Even though our descendants will read the poem
in an extinct language and in an edition encrusted with explanatory footnotes,
I'm sure that they'll understand its outline. (I imagine too that some future
scholar will make his career by explicating the line "A boy too far from town to
learn baseball.") But will anyone in 4006 A.D. be sufficiently conversant with
everyday twentieth-century American English to recognize the skill with which
Frost masks his deep insights into the relationship between the material and
the eternal with art-that-hides-art colloquialisms? Or appreciate to the full
the sly understatement of "one could do worse than be a swinger of birches?"
The beauty and the profundity of "Birches" tease us who share Frost's language.
What a challenge the poem will be eighty generations down the road! Moreover,
Is there even the remotest possibility that our successors will be equipped to
grasp how much of Roman poetry (Ovid especially) Frost distills into "I'd like
to get away from earth awhile/ And then come back to it and begin over./ May no
fate willfully misunderstand me/ And half grant what I wish and snatch me away/
Not to return." Frost possessed the genius to keep us in touch with our past and
to connect us to our future.

I wish that I had talked to Robert Frost that winter day when he was trudging
on. "How are you, Mr. Frost," I might have asked. Perhaps he would have smiled
or said "Nice day."

That would have been a good thing to recall.

Title: Haircuts:  A History
Date: December 26, 2006

When I was a child, haircuts were perpetrated at Joe's Barber Shop on Coney
Island Avenue. It was a pleasant place: there were wall-to-wall mirrors on
either side of Joe Montuori's shop, and a boy sitting in the chair could lose
himself in the infinitely-regressing images. Joe always had a friend or two in
the shop with whom he spoke incomprehensible rapid-fire Italian. The haircutting
itself was an ordeal. Joe charged 75 cents a head, but my mother had driven a
bargain: three haircuts (myself and my two brothers) for $1.80. Joe revenged
himself on me by a) working the electric buzzer as rapidly as possible, and b)
frequently re-arranging the angle of my head with a blow from the heel of his
hand. Back home, my mother would sigh and say, "Turn around.  Let's see what he
did to you this time."

I've not big on personal adornment, and, perhaps because of my early hair
experiences, I've never been comfortable in the barber's seat. As soon as the
cloth is fastened around my neck I feel hogtied and hopeless. "What are they
going to do to me today?" Once, on the west side of Manhattan, in the late
1960s, when my hair was rather long (it seems absurd that you could signal
your opposition to the war in Vietnam by letting your hair grow, but such was
the case), I walked into a shop and asked the barber to "leave it long." He
immediately transformed me into a rabid supporter of carpet-bombing. Also in New
York: when I naively wandered into a shop with a specialized clientele, a hair
technician employing a razor and a variety of gels and lotions turned me into
someone whose hair was giving off signals with which the rest of his body was
not in accord. In Hanover, New Hampshire, in an upstairs 'salon,' the barber
suddenly stopped work, drew back, studied me for fifteen or twenty seconds, and
asked, "Are you Jewish." I mumbled something about not really wanting to discuss
my ethnicity with him, whereupon he launched into a disquisition of which I
understood not much and remember less, except that that it involved prophecy,
the Book of Isaiah, and The Hatching of the Egg. He hauled out his heavily
annotated King James Version and pointed me to various passages underlined
in coded colors. As it happens, I'm more conversant than most people with
scripture, and so I can assert with moderate authority that his reading of the
Bible was -- how shall I say -- original. It took me an hour to extricate myself
from his insistent and wayward scholarship: fifteen minutes of hair-cutting and
forty-five minutes of exegetical enthusiasm.

For a decade or so, when our finances were perilous, my wife cut my hair. There
were some benefits (a guy could cop a feel while being ministered to) but I
must admit that although my good woman was earnest and effective, she never
fully mastered tonsorial technique. She had the habit of yanking upwards on the
strands with the scissors, with the result that each snip produced a stab of
pain -- although nothing more intense than might have been alleviated by the
injection of a dozen or score shots of novocaine directly into the scalp. And
then there were the ear nicks.

After a while, I returned hair responsibility to the world of commerce. I had
success for many years with Liz of Chicago Hair across town. Liz was good at
her work and respected my multiple cowlicks. But then she started to raise her
prices. When she reached $20, I would just hand her the Visa and ask her not
to tell me what she charged. When she went to $30, I retaliated by spacing the
haircuts further and further apart in order to keep my annual cost constant.
But when she broached the $40 barrier, the puritan in me rebelled. I started to
patronize the cheap ($14) barbershop across the street from the college. There's
a rotating staff and it's hit-and-miss: sometimes the results are acceptable,
sometimes disastrous.

When I come home from the expedition, my wife says, "Let's see what they've done
to you today."

And then she sighs.

Title: What We Read in the Fifties:  Arrowsmith
Date: December 27, 2006

Sinclair Lewis's Arrowsmith, published in 1924 and now hopelessly dated, was
a mere thirty years old when we read it in Erasmus Hall High School English
classes. I must confess, once again, that I recall almost nothing from my 1950s
reading -- just a vague sense that I'd been there before. Nevertheless, the
novel wasn't a bad book to present to young people. Dr. Martin Arrowsmith is
a dedicated, humorless, idealistic, workaholic scientist who eludes both the
snares of commerce and also of love and family in a single-minded pursuit of the
knowledge that will save lives. Sinclair Lewis's America is repressive, vulgar,
materialistic, and unredeemed. Why not let high schoolers read a book with such
a manic, satirical spirit?  It might have done them a world of good -- though I
can't vouch that it did anything for me.

Dr. Arrowsmith has no time anything so frivolous as aesthetics -- and it's just
as well, for neither does his creator. Arrowsmith is shapeless in form and
crude in style. It's a sledgehammer of a book, as unsubtle as America at its
worst.

Query: were we informed that Sinclair Lewis was famous for having said that
"when fascism comes to America, it will be wrapped in the flag and carrying a
cross?"

Title: O My Papa
Date: December 31, 2006

We've had two major snowfalls in the last week and the road crews haven't yet
found their way to our street. It's a knee-deep icy mess out there. Yesterday
one of my neighbors spun himself into quite a hole. He needed a push, so I
went outside to help. Even with my professional-grade ice-chopper, I had to
bang around for a while and the task took a lot longer than I had expected. 
Eventually, I had to resort to the old towel trick to gain enough traction to
release the vehicle. My neighbor said, "I'm embarrassed. You shouldn't be doing
this."  Which took me aback, of course. I replied, quite spontaneously, "It's
exactly what I should be doing."

And then I recalled one of my father's maxims: "Never omit an opportunity to do
a favor for a friend, and never be embarrassed to accept a favor."

The old guy did lots of favors. When someone on East 9 Street had a problem or
got into a little trouble, my father acted as consigliere; as far as I know, he
never took a nickel for his trouble--though occasionally someone would drop off
a compensatory lasagna. In his last years, when he lived alone and his arthritis
was very bad, someone mowed his lawn and someone took in his garbage cans and
someone raked his leaves.

My father was the least materialistic person that I've encountered in an entire
lifetime. He didn't seem to need possessions. No car, no clothes beyond the
absolute minimum, no items of personal adornment. He didn't "shop." I was with
him once when bought a new hat: "See this. I want another one just like it." We
were in and out of the store in two minutes.

Although he lived in a world of weasels (he was a real-estate lawyer), he was
uncontaminated by what went on around him. He'd often tell me stories about the
various chicaneries by which people cheated each other--and every time he would
express the same astonishment at the fallibility of human nature. He knew of
public officials who were on the take, but he preferred to talk about the state
legislator who had a large sign on his desk that said, "NO GIFTS."

In one of our very last conversations, I asked him if he himself had ever done
anything illegal. He thought for a long time. "I don't know if you'd call
this exactly illegal. Do you remember the B-----s?  Rose was a widow and she
was dying of cancer, but she didn't know it. She was a teacher with two young
children and she had a benefit coming to her from the city. She made a very
bad decision--a lump sum instead of an annuity for her children. I went to
her school and substituted a new form for the one that she had filed. It was
technically a violation and I could have gotten into a lot of trouble." And then
he surprised me by quoting some Wordsworth--the lines from Tintern Abbey about
the "best portion of a good man's life,/ His little, nameless, unremembered
acts/ Of kindness and of love."

It's hard to believe that he's been dead for twenty years now. But I remember
him when we come around to the winter solstice (he was born on December 22,
1904)--and he's especially real to me when a neighbor lets me help him extricate
his car from a snowbank.

Title: My Favorite Inventions - II
Date: January 01, 2007

A while ago, I reported on my very favorite innovations of the last half-
century  -- including such wonders as the retractable vacuum cleaner cord,
fitted sheets, duct tape, and the mute button.  I now realize that I was remiss
in not celebrating the most revolutionary invention of recent decades -- the
disposable diaper.

I was knuckle-deep in the diaper business from 1965 to about 1973. Cloth was
then the material of choice. In our family there were three infants and each
one had, roughly speaking, 900 days of diaperhood. Suppose that there were nine
changes of diaper a day (a conservative estimate) -- that's a total of 24,300
diaper-changes.  Let's say that I personally presided over one-third of those
off-with-the-foul-on-with-the-clean exchanges. We're talking more than 8000
excretory experiences. So, dear reader, I know whereof I speak.

Post-cloth diaper parents live in a world of decadent ease. Here's what they're
missing. A) cloth diapers had to be changed more frequently than the new ones --
they didn't wick away the liquid as the disposables do. Rashes and irritations
were all too common. b) gagworthy solid material had to be carefully flushed
away. c)  soiled diapers sat in a waste receptacle, where they generated an
ammonia-based chemical one whiff of which could revive a morgueful of corpses.
d) cloth diapers had to be washed, dried, and folded for next use. e) diapering
with cloth and safety pins was a fine art. Badly-applied diapers hung to the
ground to shame the diaperer; open pins and pin-sticks were a constant worry.

Nowadays, it's pop 'em off, throw it in the trash, pop on a new one. Piece of
cake. Perhaps disposable diapers are not ecologically sound  -- I don't know.
But frankly, I can't think of a better use for the vast Canadian forests.

But I shouldn't complain too much. We owned an automatic washer and dryer. My
mom had the same number of diapers, but she scrubbed them on a washboard in
the "laundry sink," put them through the wringer (first a hand-crank, later an
electric), and hung them outside to dry. She was a true heroine of diaper labor.
And I can't even bring myself to imagine the diaperworld of older generations.

Today's parents, wallowing in sybaritic luxury, cannot appreciate what it means
to be "put through the wringer." And just as well.

Title: More on Sinclair Lewis
Date: January 02, 2007

This blague's readers know that I've been revisiting books that I first read
in the 1950s. Last week I reported on Sinclair Lewis's Arrowsmith, which was
required reading in junior-year English in Erasmus Hall High School. I re-read
Arrowsmith in the very convenient Library of America series, which includes
Elmer Gantry and Dodsworth (along with Arrowsmith) in one thick volume.  I felt
that I owed it to Lewis (after all, he did win a Nobel prize) to read another of
his novels. Elmer Gantry won the toss.

While Arrowsmith has not worn very well, Elmer G. is uncannily pertinent. It's
about an amoral fundamentalist preacher. He's a nasty opportunistic bastard
who crusades against vice but maintains a series of mistresses; he's out for
notoriety and money no matter what the cost to his parishioners or to American
society. He even becomes --and here Lewis is truly prescient -- the first
radio evangelist. It's a heavy-handed, sloppy, brutally satirical book, but
it's also right on target.  I kept waiting for Elmer to be exposed, but the
novel ends when he dodges another mistress and sets out on a route to more
and more power.  It's a very dark view of the penetration of politics by
religion. No wonder it was banned in Boston; even eighty years later, it's much
too hot for high school -- although I can't imagine a single book that would
be more medicinal for pious youth. And now I understand why Arrowsmith was
given us to read:  honor the Nobel laureate, but stay as far away as possible
from controversy. Dodsworth is about adultery; Main Street attacks American
provincialism; Elmer Gantry pillories religion. Arrowsmith is a greatly inferior
novel, but it was safer.

Title: What We Read in the Fifties: King Solomon's Mines
Date: January 05, 2007

As an adolescent, I was a passionate enthusiast of novels by Sir Henry Rider
Haggard. I read everything that was in the collection of the McDonald Avenue
public library. Not only King Solomon's Mines and Allan Quatermain and She and
Allan's Wife and Ayesha, but also some of the non-"African" adventures as well.
I particularly recall Eric Brighteyes and Montezuma's Daughter.  Yesterday
I read King Solomon's Mines (1885) for the first time in fifty years and I
couldn't be more unhappy that I did so. It's a toxic mixture of imperialism,
brutality, racism, sexism, classism -- a compendium of ethnocentric Victoriana
gathered into a single atavistic novel.  I'm familiar with the academic
doctrine that to judge the past by contemporary liberal values is to commit the
fallacy of "presentism," but I'm sorry, friends, I'm mortified that I ever, even
as a youngster, could have fallen for this appalling mishmash.  How could I
have tolerated the paternalistic Englishmen and the child-like natives?

Here are two representative incidents from King Solomon's Mines. The first:
three Englishman are tramping through Africa. They come upon a herd of
elephants. They shoot and kill them. No explanation, no justification, no
reason. The second: one of the Englishmen takes a liking to a young woman named
Foulata. She dies, sacrificing herself, as is the custom in imperialist fiction,
to save English lives. Rider Haggard's  comment: "I consider her removal was a
fortunate occurrence, since, otherwise, complications would have been sure to
ensue. The poor creature was no ordinary native girl, but a person of great, I
had almost said stately, beauty, and of considerable refinement of mind.  But
no amount of beauty or refinement could have made an entanglement a desirable
occurrence; for, as she herself put it, 'Can the sun mate with the darkness, or
the white with the black?'"

I shouldn't have tampered with my fifty-year-old memories. But I've made a
resolution: I'm going to wait fifty more years before I read another novel by
Rider Haggard.

Title: The Lord and the Shopaholic
Date: January 07, 2007

Thoughts about Elmer Gantry, Sinclair Lewis's fraud of a preacher, were still
reverberating in my brain when I read in The New York Times the outrageous
stranger-than-fiction story about the "nationally renowned evangelical
preacher," Darlene Bishop. Reverend Bishop, who pastors the 4000-member Solid
Rock Church in Monroe, Indiana, and has a famous-in-certain-circles TV program,
apparently convinced her wealthy songwriter brother that she could miraculously
cure his throat cancer. She failed to do so, he died a painful death, and now
the dead brother's children are suing to reclaim a share of the estate which
Darlene somehow contrived to inherit. It's a Gantryesque tale -- though one
that's more sordid than even Sinclair Lewis, who hated demagogic religiosity
with a rare passion, could possibly have invented.

I was sufficiently intrigued by The Times' story to visit Darlene Bishop's
website, where she's posted a spiritual autobiography of sorts.  Here's the
crucial paragraph:

Being that Darlene was raised so poor she began to try to fill the void inside
of her with shopping. She bought 2 Cadillacs and 18 fur coats in one year.
Finally, one day she came in from a shopping excursion and as she pulled out
all the dresses to show her eldest daughter, Jana pointed to one and stated,
"Mom you already have that dress." Sure of herself, she replied, "Oh, no I
don't." So Jana led her upstairs to her closet and dug the dress out from the
collection of many only for Darlene to find that she did already have one of the
dresses hanging there with the tags still attached. At this, she realized it was
not working. The big house, the diamonds, fur coats, collections of designer
clothes, none of it was filling the emptiness residing in her inner most being.
She threw herself on the floor sobbing and declared, "Lord, I want more of you!
I just want you. And I'm going to seek you until I find my true place in the
kingdom."  From then on, instead of going shopping Darlene would delve into the
Word of God.

I read Darlene's conversion narrative with conflicting feelings. On the one
hand, it exudes authenticity. It's so unapologetic and downright and un-literary
that it can't possible be contrived. On the other hand, it's appallingly trite.
Darlene doesn't experience the "dark night of the soul"; instead, she shops. She
doesn't go through a spiritual crisis; she discovers that she's bought the same
dress twice. Nor is she overwhelmed with the beauty and majesty of the Lord.
"Instead of going shopping Darlene would delve into the Word of God"; that is to
say, and I don't mean to be snide, she started to shop at a bigger and better
mall. In a way, her very triteness serves as a guarantee of her authenticity.

Darlene's story also reminded me, once again, that I'm just not on the same
wavelength as many of my fellow Americans. I don't think that either shopping
or delving can give meaning to life. And yet Darlene Bishop is a celebrity of
American religion, who, people believe, can perform miracles.

And what about Darlene's wonder-working power? In her books and on her website,
she claims that she cured her own breast cancer. Did she?  I'm skeptical.
According to The Times, when Darlene was on the stand testifying under penalty
of perjury, she confessed that "no doctor ever diagnosed the breast cancer."
Instead, "she thought that she had cancer in 1986 and that it was cured." Here's
a pretty howdy-do. Darlene imagined she had cancer and then imagined that it
disappeared -- and on such a basis she proclaims a miracle. In my book, that's
setting a mighty low threshold for divine intervention.

On the website, there's nary a word about her brother's death or about the
lawsuit, but there's some fine, excruciating detail about the miracle. Unlike
the account of her rampant shopoholia, this story is not one bit credible: it's
either delusion or fabrication -- and I think the latter.

I had been preaching on faith for six weeks, when one night while laying in the
bed the devil said to me, "If you don't stop preaching like this, I'll kill you"
and without hesitation, I replied, "You're not big enough, devil". He said,
"Feel your right breast". When I felt my breast, I felt a lump the size of a
silver dollar....  Soon the whole bottom half of my breast became a solid mass.
The pain would be so bad some nights that I could only sleep a few minutes at a
time. It was as if someone had put hot coals of fire in my breast.

Let's get this straight. Darlene experienced hot coal pain in her breast, and
didn't take herself to the emergency room. She's not only a fake;  she's
dangerous. What sort of example does she set to the Solid Rock congregants
(and to her readers and her TV-watchers)?  "Let's pause here for a Solid Rock
public service announcement: if you experience excruciating pain, under no
circumstances consult your physician."

What should you do for that burning coal feeling?  For pain medicine, I would
write down scriptures on little pieces of paper and place them in my bra.

Are we to believe that the medieval remedies are still practiced in twentieth-
century Indiana?  Egad.

This went on for nearly four months until eventually my breast began to
hemorrhage. I had to put nursing pads in my bra to prevent the blood from coming
through my clothes. Some nights I would bleed all night and wake up with my
gown and bed sheets covered in blood. Until one day, as I was hunched over the
sink, my tears splashing into the bloody water, I heard Him speak my name in an
audible voice. He said, "Darlene!"  I rose up and cried, "Yes Lord". He said,
"Because you've continued in my Word and not leaned on the arm of the flesh, as
of this day you're healed.  Go! Proclaim it!

David Hume, whose "On Miracles" is still the definitive analysis, says that
when we evaluate a supposed miracle, we discount the testimony of a person
"who has an interest in what he affirms." Darlene has built a megachurch and a
flourishing business and has inherited her brother's estate on the basis of this
supposed cure. Enough said.

But what about the Solid Rockers?  Can't they see through such palpable
nonsense?  Are they mesmerized or stepfordwived?  Is there any hope that they
-- and other victims of similar hocus-pocus -- will some day get their brains in
gear again?  Not bloody likely.

Title: More on King Solomon's Mines
Date: January 09, 2007

I received the following note from Marion Morrison, who is an associate
professor of English at the University of Iowa. It was written in response to my
entry a few days ago concerning H. Rider Haggard's King Solomon's Mines. I'm
extremely grateful to Professor Morrison for taking the time to comment on my
observations.

"Dear Dr. Metablog:

I detect the subtextual presence of mutually imbricated and conterminous
forces in your multichronotopic problematizing of King Solomon's Minds. The
indigenous woman, Foulani, living in a no (wo)man's land where the colonialist
gaze dissects racialized gendering, foregrounds the elusive intersectionalities
present in the semiological narratology of deconstructive post-structuralism.
It is only by scrutinizing the poetics of diasporic displacement that we can
contest the epiphenomenological echo of (hetero)masculinist discourse from a
gendered perspective, which, if I understand your insufficiently theorized
analysis, you have vainly tried to do. Such (re)mapping of knowledge, even when
employing a single-axis feminist theory, unpacks syncretism and hybridity and
at the same time denaturalizes doxa rooted in phallocentric epistemologies.
But, you ask, what about the reproduction of alterity through a highly policed
matrix of conceptual checkpoints?  The answer is simple: any binarist
recontextualizing across multiple terrains adds a metadiscursive dimension
to the polysemic site and leads to aporias of nationalist cartographies of
knowledge, as is crystal clear in the case of Rider Haggard. Without otherizing
the conceptual spaces opened up by postcolonial hybridity, hermeneutical
nihilism would dismantle palimpsestic textuality -- and you know what that
might lead to. A meta-analysis of King Solomon's Wives -- a textual situation
in which there are multiple hegominid discourses as well as the potential for
co-implicatedness -- could rupture various subaltern geographic positionalities
(but only in a translinguistic sense).

As I'm sure you understand, these comments are written under the sign of the
plural."

January 10.  Today I received another communication from Professor Morrison. 
It's a bit angry, so I won't quote it all, but here are the relevant sentences.

"Dear Dr. Metablog, or Vivian, or whatever you call yourself:

When you typed my comments into your blog, you clumsily erred. I certainly did
not write "hermeneutical nihilism would dismantle palimpsestic textuality"; it's
obvious that I wrote "hermeneutical nihilism would not dismantle palimpsestic
textuality."  Leaving out the "not" makes a mockery of my argument and renders
it virtually unintelligible. You owe me and your readers an apology."

Yours,

Marion Morrison, Ph. D."

Gosh, Professor Morrison. My bad. I don't know what I could have been thinking.

Title: A Remedy for Unhappiness
Date: January 13, 2007

Intermittently throughout the decades, I've been afflicted with what has been
called, at various times in history, "the spleen," "vapors," "falling into a
brown study," "melancholy," "the blues," and currently, "depression." But now I
have devised a very effective remedy for this affliction.

With the help of the Ellis Island Foundation, I located the manifest of the
Rotterdam, the ship that arrived in New York on August 23, 1904 and which
brought my grandparents to the new world. I purchased and studied a copy of this
document. My grandfather, Joseph Uzilewsky, was 27 years old when he arrived
and is listed as a "chemist's (i.e. pharmacist's) assistant." My grandmother,
Sonia, was 20 and has no profession. Neither of them admitted to being either a
polygamist or an anarchist. There's a specific column on the manifest in which
each new arrival was required to say how much money he's bringing into the
country. Almost all of the immigrants have a few dollars, but Joseph and Sonia
have nothing at all. Nothing.

When I fall into periods of unhappiness, I think about my grandparents arriving
here without a nickel in their pockets and unable to speak the language. And
then I think of my own position in life. I had a job that allowed me -- no,
required me -- to read as much as possible, and occasionally to write something
about what I had read. My principal task was the pleasant and useful one of
learning the young 'uns how to read and write. Now I'm retired and someone puts
money in my bank account at the beginning of each month. It's not a lot of
money, but it's enough to allow me to do whatever I please.

I have no reason to think that I'm smarter or more talented than my
grandparents  -- in fact, everything that I know about genetics leads to the
conclusion that they were exactly as gifted as I. No question but that I've been
a heckuva lot luckier. I could have spent my entire lifetime rolling cigars in a
hot, airless back-room-behind-the-store, as my grandfather did.

I keep the Rotterdam manifest under the glass on my desk. When I start to feel
gloomy, I force myself to take another look. I don't dare allow myself to
succumb to depression. How justly would my grandparents have scorned the mopings
and the woe-is-mes of someone so privileged as I have been.

Title: Too Many Fouls, Too Many Timeouts
Date: January 14, 2007

Our local basketball team is in the Big 12. We're far from the best team in the
league, but the Big 12 is a major conference and as a consequence we have the
opportunity to see some well-played, exciting games and also a goodly number
of excellent young players. Great athletes appear regularly, mostly, I must
confess, on opposing teams, but we've sent a number of guys on to the NBA,
including Scott Wedman, Jay Humphries and Chauncey Billups. Last week the U of
Texas brought in a freshman named Kevin Durant. Remember the name -- he's going
to cut quite a swathe in the NBA. I'm a fan; I've gone to almost every home game
for twenty-five years or more. At its best, basketball is the most beautiful of
team sports. But I have some serious bones to pick about the way the colleges
play the game nowadays. Here are two of these many bones.

a) Time outs.  Every four minutes there's a "media timeout," so that the TV
stations, if there are any, can intrude their commercials. Media timeouts have
everything to do with money and nothing at all to do with the sport. Media
timeouts interrupt the flow. Team A is on a roll; the coach of Team B doesn't
have to use one of this allotted legal timeouts to change the dynamics of the
situation -- he just waits for the scheduled pause. Four extra timeouts in
a half, at a minimum of a minute and a half each, add twelve minutes to the
length of the game. And because each coach can hoard his legal timeouts, he has
them all available at crunch time, which means that the climax of the game is
far too frequently interrupted and the final moments become more the coaches'
responsibility than the players'.

b)  Fouls.  Too many ticky-tack fouls are called. The result -- teams are
regularly "in the bonus" nine or ten minutes into the half. And into the "double
bonus" four or five minutes later. All fouls -- offensive fouls, fouls away from
the ball, incidental contact -- become shooting fouls. The first ten minutes
of each half often have a pleasing rhythm, a bit of pace, but the second ten
minutes are always stop-and-go; rarely is there a full minute of uninterrupted
action. Boring?  You bet. Contests routinely turn into prolonged exhibitions of
foul-shooting. A gazelle of a game now hobbled and shackled.

Our own basketball stadium is at altitude -- a mile high, in fact. Our opponents
are almost always flatlanders. We should have an advantage because we're
better conditioned to play at 5280 feet. But because the games are so long and
punctuated by so many timeouts and fouls, our advantage is lost. No twenty-year-
old is going to run out of breath when a forty minute game takes two and a half
hours to complete.

Solution: a) no more "media timeouts." Oh yeah, I know, the teams need the
money. Well, maybe there would be some revenue from increased attendance if
the games were quicker and shorter and more exciting. b) better-trained and
better- instructed referees. No bonus shots. No free throws except for fouls in
the act of shooting. And teams should always be able to "decline the penalty,"
as they do in football, and take the ball out of bounds. Then there would be
no incentive to foul in order to stop the clock. Take back the game from the
coaches and from the referees. Let the young men play.

Common sense changes, in my carefully considered view, which, if adopted, would
make life richer and more satisfying and more aesthetic.

I've been staring into my crystal ball, sorting through chicken bones, tea
leaves and the Tarot cards, observing the flights of birds, inspecting the
entrails of sacrificed animals, and diddling with the Ouija board. Now I'm
ready. Here are my widely-anticipated predictions for the year 2007.

1)  there will be unusual weather patterns in North America;

2)  a famous Hollywood actress will sue for divorce; moreover, another (or
possibly the same) Hollywood star will become pregnant; another (or possibly the
same) actress will gain and lose a great deal of weight;

3)  a well-known athlete will be accused of taking drugs;

4)  a politician will be involved in a sex scandal;

5)  questions will be raised about America's food supply;

6)  there will be either a monsoon, an airplane crash, or a capsized ferry in
Asia--perhaps all three;

7)  there will be fluctuations in the stock market, and, finally,

8)  there will be turmoil in the Middle East.

There it is right on the page in black and white. No taking it back now. Eight
major predictions. I know that I'm going way out on the proverbial limb,
but I feel confident -- not vain or proud, mind you -- of my abilities as a
forecaster. Let's all remember to check back at the end of the year and see
how well I've performed.  If I come through, I'll rank up there with the
true greats of the prognosticating game: John the Revelator, Nostradamus, the
National Enquirer, and Pat Robertson.

Title: Marriage Advice
Date: January 21, 2007

High on the list of The New York Times' "most e-mailed articles" is one with the
catchy title "What Shamu Taught Me About a Happy Marriage," by a writer named
Amy Sutherland. Apparently it's a well-regarded, influential essay. I think
it's misleading and wrong-headed, and I think that couples who heed its advice
will soon find themselves not in a happy marriage but in one that's sterile and
empty.

Amy's column is at this address, and will be available unless and until the
greedy Times decides to put it behind a paid wall. A summary: poor Amy is
perpetually annoyed by Scott, her husband of twelve years. He loses his keys
and asks her help finding them; he keeps her waiting at restaurants; he "hovers
around her in the kitchen asking if she has read this or that piece in the
New Yorker." She's tried nagging, but it doesn't work. As it happens, Amy is
writing a book on animal training and she's watched people "do the seemingly
impossible," such as 'teaching baboons to skateboard" and "hyenas to pirouette
on command." She decides to adopt the animal model and "train" her husband. "If
he threw one dirty shirt into the hamper, I'd thank him. If he threw in two, I'd
kiss him." She rewards "approximations." She uses "least reinforcing syndrome"
in which the trainer doesn't respond in any way when an animal does something
wrong -- just stands and stares. When Scott loses his keys, she ignores his
pleas for help, and eventually he finds them by himself. By the end of the
article, Scott has changed. "After two years of exotic animal training, my
marriage is far smoother, my husband much easier to love."

What's so awful about this advice? Let's take the shirts-on-the-floor crisis.Amy
can imagine only two methods to deal with this problem. There's nagging, which
she now rejects, and there's re-training. But there are other responses. The
first is for Amy to gain a bit of perspective. Marriage isn't about whether the
dirty shirts are in the hamper or on the floor. People have had long and happy
marriages without resolving such issues. Amy seems to assume that getting her
way about the shirts is crucial. But when she and Scott married, they agreed
to love, honor, and respect each other; they didn't agree that every shirt
would immediately find its way into a hamper. Perhaps Amy should re-think her
priorities and try to keep the larger picture in view. Secondly, Amy can't seem
to imagine any ground between nagging and animal training. But there is --
there's an enormous territory. There's discussion, negotiation, and compromise.
Amy:  "It bothers me that you expect me to pick up your shirts." Scott: "I'll
try not to drop them. I'll pick them up myself." Amy: "And I'll try not to make
such a big deal out of it."

When Scott comes into the kitchen and wants to read to her from a New Yorker
article, Amy could say, if she had any imagination, "Oh, good. Scott wants to
involve me in his intellectual life. He wants to talk to me." But she doesn't
see it that way; she wants him out of the room so she can "concentrate on the
simmering pans." But what's important about marriage, or about life?  Is it
the pans, or is it the conversation?  Once again, Amy has it all wrong. She
cares about her cooking, and getting the soup exactly right, more than she cares
about the marriage. It shouldn't be beyond her ability to stir and to listen
at the same time; it's been known to happen. Amy is, let's face it, a bit of a
narcissist. She wants to make Scott into an extension of herself; she wants to
subordinate the marriage to her own convenience.

Readers and friends, here's my opinion. If your spouse comes to you and says,
"I've lost my keys, I'm distressed," you should stop whatever you're doing and
you should start searching. When you do so, you're treating your spouse with
respect and you're taking your marriage seriously. And if you happen to misplace
your own keys, it's perfectly fair to ask your spouse to help find them. Because
sometimes finding keys is a team activity. I'll go even further: sometimes it's
less important to find the lost keys than it is to search for them together.

But you should engage yourself with the problem of the keys, or the shirts, only
if you want a relationship of equals. If you think that it's so important to
train your spouse to stay out of your damn kitchen, then go ahead and follow
Amy's advice. But you might wind up with not with a husband or wife, but with a
pirouetting hyena or a skateboarding baboon.

Amy and Scott: here's some valuable advice. It comes to you courtesy of Mr.
Hart, who lived a couple of houses down from us. He died at age 90, in the same
month as his equally aged wife. The Harts had been married for 60 or so years.
"What's the secret of a long, happy marriage," he was asked. He said, "find out
what your wife wants and make sure that it happens." Which is, if you think
about it for a moment, only a variation of the traditional golden rule and of
its even more practical cousin: "do unto others as they want to be done unto."

January 23.  Today I received an e-mail from my old friend Spike Schapiro.
Spike says, "How come Amy and Scott have been married for twelve years and don't
have any children. I'll tell you why. Because Amy doesn't want kids who would
leave their toys in her kitchen or leave their clothes in the bathroom. She's
quite a piece of work, isn't she?"

Title: Notes on Interspecies Sexuality
Date: January 24, 2007

Readers might be tempted to disbelieve the outrageous silliness that follows,
but here it is, exactly as it appeared in the newspaper.  If you don't believe
me, check for yourself.

DEAR ABBY: Am I a "sicko" because I step out of the shower naked in front of
our dog? My wife, Amy, thinks so. The trouble started when we got a female dog,
"Taffy," from the local animal shelter. Taffy sleeps in our bedroom and is there
in the morning when I take my shower. Amy insists that I cover up in front of
the dog and that Taffy is no different from a child. This has created a lot of
stress between us because, to me, a dog is a dog. Is it wrong to be naked in
front of a dog? -- SCOTT IN NEW JERSEY

How even to begin?  My immediate thought was to take the opportunity afforded
by ABBY and Scott and Amy to make some jokes. E.g., is it wrong to be naked in
front of a dog?  Depends on the dog's attitude toward sexuality and gender.
Depends on whether it's the kind of dog who likes to worry a bone. Depends on
whether it's a hairy or a hairless dog. And also: would it matter if the dog is
gay?  Or male?  How does Amy feel about Taffy eyeballing her?  Would Tuffy be
granted the same privilege?  Does Taffy spend extra time licking her genitalia
after getting a full frontal view of Scott? Etc. Lots of opportunities for
bad humor. In addition to the jokes, I thought that I might also write a few
serious sentences about sentimentality toward animals. And also about flagrant
anthropomorphism -- I'm deeply troubled when someone proclaims that a dog is "no
different from a child."

I wrote an e-mail to confidants asking for help, thinking that they might
provide me with some one-liners. One of the answers that I received came from
my old friend Spike Schapiro, who, diligent readers will remember, wrote to me
a couple of days ago on the subject of marriage and animals (see the entry for
January 21 titled "Marriage Advice). Spike got himself a little bent out of
shape by DEAR ABBY, but I must admit that he took the plight of Scott and Amy
much more seriously than I did.  Here's a excerpt from Spike's response:

"The trouble began when we got a female dog, Taffy." No, Scott, the trouble
didn't begin when you brought home the little bitch.The trouble began long
before that. It all started when Amy was a child and her neo-Victorian God-
fearing parents, who more than likely had sex once and only once, and then only
to fulfill a legal requirement, found their daughter frolicking clothesless and
with a hand "down there" and patiently and sensitively explained to her that
the great Jehovah would wither her finger if her naked skin ever saw the sun
again. Amy's been in a psychological twist ever since. And Scott  -- why the
heck do you bother writing to ABBY?  You must know the score. Your wife is a
total nutball. She's nuts about animals, nuts about nakedness, nuts about sex 
-- which, I guarantee, you're not getting a lot of. Think seriously whether you
want to stay in this relationship. Amy -- get a hold of yourself before it's
too late. If you want to save your marriage, which is now staggering to a nasty
conclusion, don't worry about the intimacy of Scott and Taffy. Throw Taffy and
your dancing hyena and the fool baboon out of the window. Worry about Scott and
Amy.  Exercise your buccinatory muscles. Learn how to make winky-winky. Unlearn
everything that you learned from your parents. Take off your clothes and look at
yourself in the mirror.  Grow up."

I guess I see Spike's point.  I think, though, that he's confused this Amy and
Scott with the Amy who wrote about training her husband Scott in the well-known
NYT article. Although, come to think of it, they could be the same couple.

In any case, I think that Spike could have made the same point a little more
gently. I've edited out some of his harsher adjectives.

Title: The All-Johnson Team
Date: January 26, 2007

Here's the eagerly-awaited all-Johnson NBA team:  Magic, Marques, Kevin,
Dennis, Gus.  Everyone knows the first four, but only those with a few years
on their backs will recall Gus Johnson, who averaged 17 points a game and 13
rebounds in nine season with Baltimore.  Johnsons in reserve:  Vinnie ("the
Microwave"), Larry, Joe, Avery.  There's not a last name that can compete
(there are 49 NBA Johnsons to choose from, including the three Eddies and the
three Georges).

I would lay odds that the Johnsons would easily defeat the Williamses (though
not in depth -- 54 Williamses played in the league).  The all-Williams team: 
Gus, Aaron, Buck, Walt, Deron, Jason, Herb.  All of them role players -- no
real stars in the group.  What about the 53 Smiths?  Could they compete with
the Johnsons.  I don't think so:  Elmore, Adrian, Joe, Kenny, and all three
Charleses (subsumed into one mega-Charles) could play, but they'd be better if
the rules allowed them to use Rik Smits at center.  Who else?  The Millers --
not much there beyond Reggie. The Joneses:  Caldwell, Bobby, Sam, K.C., Eddie,
Popeye -- good but not in the same league as the Johnsons.  It's Magic and the
guys by a landslide.  Anyone out there with other suggestions?  Search here
for the data.

Title: Medical Waste
Date: January 30, 2007

The Aged Parent, who's ninety-four, received a curious letter from AARP
MedicalRX Plans. MedRX is the insurance company that we've chosen to use as
part of the Bush drug plan for the old folks. In point of fact, the benefit
hasn't been very significant, especially since we fell into the infamous "donut
hole."  We pay AARP MedRX monthly by means of deductions from the Aged P's
social security check.

The AARP letter to which I refer was neither cordial nor pleasant. It said this:
"Our records show that you owe $108.00 for your AARP MedicalRX Plan premium. 
This outstanding amount is for premiums due before you changed your payment
method to automatic deduction from your social security check."  The letter
also included a threat:  "Failure to pay this outstanding balance could result
in the cancellation of your coverage."

I immediately suspected that the AARP claim to a hundred bucks of the Aged P's
money was absolutely false.  We initiated payment the very first month that the
plan came into effect and we always paid by deduction. There was no possibility
that the Aged P was in arrears. So I called AARP MedicalRX Plans to find out
the real story. First there was the usual song-and-dance: "If you are calling
about... Press 1.  If you are calling about... Press 2."  I pressed all the
correct numbers and was put on hold for ten or so minutes. I listened to some
crappy elevator music.  At last, a cheery voice.  "This is Anastasia. How
can I help you this morning?"   I explained the problem. "May I put you on
hold?"  "Sure." More crappy music, interrupted by, "Please continue to hold.
Your call is very important to us."  My call was so important that I was
told it was important every twenty seconds for another ten minutes. At last,
Anastasia returned.  "Do you remember that last summer you received a letter
saying that Social Security had sent you $108.08 in error?  Me:  "Yes, I do.
I had several letters from Social Security to that effect."  Anastasia. 
"Well, the money that Social Security sent to you was supposed to have been
sent to us at AARP Rx.  It was accidentally mailed to you." "I remember.  But
then I wrote a check to Social Security. I returned the $108.08 to them as they
requested."  Anastasia:  "Well, what happened is that Social Security never
sent the money to us." Me:  "So then your quarrel isn't with me. It's with
Social Security." Anastasia:  "Exactly right. We're trying to get the money
from Social Security. It's been a major confusion. We've been working on it for
months."  Me:  "So then I don't owe you any money at all."  Anastasia: "No,
you don't.  Just ignore the letter."  Me:  "Ignore the letter?  Why would
you send a letter to me that you expect me to ignore?  Why am I wasting my
time trying to figure out what your threatening letter is supposed to mean?" 
Anastasia:  "Well, you're not alone. We've sent out over a million of these
letters."  Me (somewhat exasperated now):  "You've sent a million letters that
you know are erroneous and misleading.  You've threatened a million old people
with loss of insurance coverage. Why?"  Anastasia:  "It's because the computer
is programmed to automatically send out letters when there's a premium that
hasn't been paid."  Me: "Why can't you reprogram the computer. How hard can it
be?  I'm sure it would be a lot cheaper than sending out a million letters.
And then you wouldn't have to deal with hundreds of thousands of telephone
complaints." Anastasia (testily):  "Sir, I'm not in charge of the computers." 
Me:  "Tell me, what do you do about the old people who don't understand your
letter but figure they'd better pay you or they'll lose their coverage? 
Do you return their checks?"  Anastasia.  "I don't know.  That's not my
department."  Me:  "Thank you very much.  It's been a gigantic pleasure
talking with you."  Anastasia.  "Is there anything else we can help you with
today."  Me:  "Can't think of thing."  Anastasia:  "Have a nice day."

February 2. Later, I tried to decide whether AARP Medical RX is incompetent
or corrupt. It's a tough call. On the side of corruption: if they sent out
a million letters and received $100 from 10% of the recipients, they would
have $10,000,000 as, in effect, an interest free loan. But in theory they'd
have to return the money eventually.  While there would be administrative
costs, it would still be a profitable gamble. On the side of incompetence:  It
probably costs a dollar to print and mail a letter, so AARP has already wasted
one million dollars and will squander more on time spent trying to repair the
damage. That's a lot of misspent effort.  So I lean toward incompetence. 
However, if in the end AARP retains the money from the old folks and also keeps
the money from social security, then there would be no question but that it's
conscienceless malfeasance.

Title: Where a Day is Longer than a Year
Date: February 02, 2007

A Venusian day, strange to say, is longer than a Venusian year. How can such
an apparent paradox be allowed?  It's easy: Venus rotates on its axis once
every 243 earth-days, but it revolves around the sun in 225 earth-days. How
appallingly counter-intuitive!  If I had any gift at all for thinking in the
abstract, I'm sure that I wouldn't find the idea that a day can be longer than
a year so disorienting. But I do;  for me, the word "day" has a metaphorical
as well as a scientific dimension: "days" are short, "years" are long.  I'm
consoled by thinking that my counterpart, a philosophically-handicapped Venusian
visiting the earth, would find our speedy days and our disproportionately long
year quite incredible. On Venus, the lazy old sun takes 116 days to rise in the
west and set in the east (Venus, ever the contrarian, rotates, so to speak,
"backwards").  So much for Ovid's swift horses; on Venus, they're all glue and
molasses, their forward progress barely perceptible.  There's a mythological
corollary that might please the poets. Randy Jupiter would be happy on Venus:
the venereal night is truly a megala nux.

I suppose that the example of Venus teaches us that days and years are not
things but concepts. For me, this is a hard lesson. I recognize that it's
earthocentric to measure the long Venusian day in terms of earth-days, but I
can't seem to reason my way around doing so -- the only day that I've ever
experienced is 24 hours long and the only year with which I'm familiar has 365
and a bit days. It's alarming to realize how short-sighted it is to assume
that a day, a month, a year, tied in, as they are, to astronomical reality are
natural, when, in fact, they're only artifacts of our earthly orbit.

Other measurements of time are less "natural" and therefore even more
troublesome.  How entirely arbitrary to divide the day into 24 parts!  Since
everything else is going metric, why shouldn't we divide the day into ten or
a hundred parts -- decidays or centidays?  And minutes and seconds -- why
sixty of them, when decihours and centihours makes so much more sense?  (The
ancients, incidentally, struggled mightily with hours -- read all about it
here.)  And the week?  No natural reason at all for the week. The Romans, as
is well known, were weekless.

Venus, having no moons, has no months. Mars has two moons -- would a Martian
calendar, if there were such a thing, have had months, or demi-months, or
monthettes, or what?

When I was a boy, I was a diligent if uncritical reader of science fiction.  In
those days, it was not uncommon for entire fanciful Venusian civilizations to
rise, peak, and fall and the course of a novel. But in the 1950s, almost no data
was available to us about the mysterious planet. Now, I'm afraid, the glamour
is long gone. The surface temperature of Venus averages 869F, the atmospheric
pressure is 90 times that of the earth, the atmosphere is 97 per cent carbon
dioxide and contains no oxygen, and the pretty swirling clouds are entirely
composed of hot, concentrated sulfuric acid. It's hardly a place in which an
advanced culture would be likely to thrive nor a place from which we would
expect much in the way of sophisticated calendrical theory.

Title: What We Read in the Fifties:  "I, the Jury" and "The Kid from Tompkinsville"
Date: February 12, 2007

Mickey Spillane's I, the Jury (1947) is a loathsome novel. It makes me gag to
remember that it was wildly popular in the P.S. 217 schoolyard -- passed from
hand to hand in lurid 25-cent paperback editions. Spillane's hero, the crudely-
monikered private investigator Mike Hammer, lives in a world in which guns are
"rods," bullets are "slugs," cars are "heaps," a policeman is a "flatfoot,"
gays are "queers" and "pansies," and people of any color other than white are
"jigs," "bogies," or "darkies." His is a horrible, amoral universe of bigotry
and violence. Mike Hammer, nominally an officer of the law, makes no effort
to bring criminals to justice -- he prefers to kill them. "I'm going to enjoy
putting a bullet into that crazy son of a bitch more than I enjoy eating. I'd
sooner work him over with a knife first." He's a sadistic vigilante who beats up
suspects and bystanders indifferently: "my fist went in up to the wrist in his
stomach."

Charlotte Manning, the beautiful uptown "dame" whom he thinks he loves, tells
him what he wants to hear (and what the novel endorses) -- that he's a "a real
man -- no inhibitions." Of course, he doesn't go to bed with Charlotte Manning
-- he only traffics with women who are those he derides as "nymphos." At the
climax of the novel, Hammer discovers -- a surprise to no one but himself! --
that the killer for whom he's searching is Charlotte herself. As he fingers
his .45 caliber pistol, she slowly disrobes. When she's entirely naked, Hammer
shoots her in the stomach. "'H-how could you,' she gasps. Hammer: "It was easy."
Was it difficult, even in 1953, to understand such perverse, misogynistic
symbolism?

Mickey Spillane left his native Brooklyn to go to serve as a soldier; what a
shame that he returned as a fascist.

For all I know, I might have read I, the Jury during the same week that I read
John R. Tunis's The Kid from Tompkinsville. As degraded as is the one novel, so
the other is otherworldly and pure. The "kid" is Roy Tucker, a simple country
boy who tries out for the Brooklyn Dodgers, wins a place on the team, and is
pitching shutout after shutout when he trips in the shower and injures his
throwing arm.  A few weeks later, mirabile dictu, he returns as an outfielder
and leads his team to a pennant with his hitting. It's a heckuva lot of drama
for one short season, but Tunis makes it credible  -- well, at least, it seemed
credible to youthful me back in 1953.

Tunis takes his baseball seriously and he never patronizes his young readership.
Like most of Tunis's novels (The Kid Comes Back, Young Razzle, Iron Duke), all
of which I swallowed in single gulps, The Kid from Tompkinsville extols the
virtues of integrity, effort, and teamwork. Was I astute enough to notice that
there was no drinking, no staying out late, and not a hint of desire for women
in Roy Tucker's life? I don't believe I was.

While nasty old Mike Hammer asked us to wallow in a swinish world, upstanding
Roy Tucker lifted us from the mire. There could hardly be a better illustration
of Shakespeare's observation that "the web of our life is of a mingled yarn,
good and ill together." I'd like to believe that Tunis was a greater influence
on me (as he was certainly a greater source of pleasure) than Spillane -- even
though, as I recently discovered, Mickey Spillane (Frank Morrison Spillane) was
a fellow graduate of "good-and-ill-together" Erasmus Hall High School.

Title: Sub-Nadir Brainlessness
Date: February 15, 2007

It took three long weeks, but the four ministers who were appointed to counsel
the disgraced former New Life minister report that Haggard is now "completely
heterosexual."

How do they know? Did he pass a test? Did they make him look at pictures of a)
muscular male prostitutes, and b) fancy ladies -- and then check his arousal
rate?  Did the Reverend Ted buy a new gun rack for his truck? Has he started
watching NASCAR? Is Gayle pregnant again? What gives?

The Reverend Tim Ralph, one of the gang of four, produced the following
thoroughly incoherent analysis. "It was the acting-out situations where things
took place. It wasn't a constant thing." I construe "things took place" to refer
to whatever Ted did with the brawny masseur. I construe Reverend Tim's sentences
to mean: "Things took place when they took place. At other times, they didn't
take place." Very insightful, very reassuring. But since Reverend Tim and his
friends have succeeded so well and so rapidly with Haggard, don't they owe
something to all the other struggling-against-their-own-gayness evangelicals
(and Roman Catholic priests) out there. Shouldn't they franchise this cure?
There's a huge market.

Some questions. A) Do the four ministers truly believe that Haggard is
"completely heterosexual?" If they do, their knowledge of human life is shallow
beyond belief. If they don't, they're frauds of a high order of fraudulence. B)
Do the ministers think that we regular walking-round non-evangelicals swallow
their stories? Do they care?  C) Do they think that New Life congregants
believe them?  D) Are New Life congregants completely brainwashed?

A skeptical note. It's reported that the Reverend Ted settled with the New
Life Church for a sum of money. By the terms of the agreement, neither he nor
the church are allowed to say exactly how much treasure is involved. Moreover,
Reverend Ted has agreed to leave Colorado Springs. Cynical old me thinks that
it's nothing more than an old-fashioned payoff: you get out of town and never
darken our doorstep again, and here's a bunch of cash. Stick around and we can
do nothing for you. Dollars to donuts there's a no-litigation-on-either-side
agreement as well. It's all so very uplifting, so very spiritual.

February 17.  I received this jaundiced e-mail from my friend and correspondent
Spike S. "You're entirely too easy on these clowns. Ted's clearly bi-sexual,
and he'll always be. But here's the deal they made: the ministers said, we'll
declare that you're heterosexual, but only if you get out of Colorado. Their
only agenda is to make sure that the mega-million dollar New Life church stays
solvent, and they can't manage it if Ted's around. They'll pay for Reverend
Ted's master's in psychology -- no doubt from some off-brand bible college --
and he'll take up a new career re-programming and therefore screwing up young
gay fundamentalists. And what about the Reverend's drug problem?  Wasn't he a
member of, what do they call it, the First Methedrine Church, or is he a Crystal
Methodist? How long, anyone want to guess, before Ted falls off either or both
of these wagons? I'll give him a year and a half, max."

Title: Friend Indeed or Nosey Parker?
Date: February 20, 2007

At a community meeting a few days ago, the question of alcohol consumption
came up (as it frequently does in our adjacent-to-a-university neighborhood).
One young man complained that when local bars (where over-serving is -- in
theory -- proscribed) shut down, the students then take their drinking to
"house parties" where there is no adult present to oversee how much can be
consumed. "They just go and get themselves totally wasted," said the student.
Our local police sergeant challenged him. "What do you do," she asked, "when
your friends make plans to get drunk? Do you try to stop them?" Her question
took the student aback. I don't think that the idea that someone his age could
or should intervene had occurred to him until that moment.

I was surprised that the sergeant asked the young man to look after his friends.
It was as though she asked him to become that dreaded folk-figure, the busybody.

What are the rules in such cases? Isn't the notion that each person is
responsible for only his own welfare a contemporary American dogma? "You can't
help people; they have to help themselves."

Some score or so years ago, I had a friend (I'll call him Vincent) who was
a two-(or three) pack-a-day smoker. He was an intimate enough friend that I
crossed the invisible busybody barrier. I'd argue with him about the health
risks of using tobacco; I'd send him articles to read. He was not impressed or
persuaded, but he was often irritated. Once he said, scornfully, "you are trying
to be your brother's keeper." Vincent was angry when I asked him not to smoke
when he visited my house. His conviction was that when you have a friend, you
don't try to change him or to regulate his habits; you accept him with all his
foibles. Perhaps he was right, but nevertheless, for several years I didn't
invite him home, which was a great loss, because he was smart and informed and
charming and sociable.

Then came the lung cancer, the surgery, the chemo, the false remissions, the
swings between hope and despair, and eventually, the premature death. In an
interview in the local newspaper a few weeks before he died, Vincent said, "I
have simply lost twenty years of my life to smoking." To me he said, once, very
quietly, "you were right."  Did he mean, "you were right that smoking was
dangerous," or did he mean, "you were right to try to change me?" I don't know.

I may have been right, but what good did I do? I alienated a friend and I didn't
add a day to his life.

When I look back now after so many years have passed, my regret is not that I
intervened but that intervened so ineffectively. It haunts me that I didn't I do
a better job.

In our neighborhood, we lose a local student to alcohol poisoning each and every
year. Can there be a sadder or more useless death?  Mom and dad nurture a child
for eighteen years, send him or her off to college, and a week later receive a
phone call that their child has choked to death on his own vomit.

Who is the responsible party?  Friends, teachers, police, family, liquor-
purveyors? Or only the individual?

Title: The Damnation of Theron Ware
Date: February 25, 2007

A few of us were in a coffee shop talking about Ted Haggard, Darlene Bishop
and other right-wing Christianistas. One of the guys thought that I could gain
some perspective and also stoke my outrage by reading Harold Frederic's 1896
novel The Damnation of Theron Ware. I recognized the title -- it had appeared
on reading lists when I was a student in the 1950s and 1960s  -- but I'd never
turned a single page. Well, better late than never; Theron Ware is a truly
splendid book.

Here's a sample of its satirical spirit. Youthful, ignorant Theron Ware meets
the governing elders when he arrives to take up his ministry at the Octavius
Methodist Church:

"We are a plain sort o'folks up in these parts," said Brother Pierce....  We
walk here... in a meek and humble spirit, in the straight an' narrow way which
leadeth unto life. We ain't gone traipsin' after strange gods, like some people
that call themselves Methodists in other places. We stick by the Discipline an'
the ways of our fathers in Israel. No new-fangled notions can go down here. 
Your wife'd better take them flowers out of her bunnit afore next Sunday."

It's a wonderful speech, especially that last oppressive sentence, set without
pause or punctuation against flimsy pretenses to meekness. Harold Frederic
leaves us in no doubt that Brother Pierce and his Methodist co-religionists
worship only at the altars of joylessness and petty tyranny. Theron Ware would
like to rebel against these sour Puritanisms, but he's devoid of the necessary
intellectual resources. He's backwoods ignorant. He does after a while acquire
and read Renan's Life of Jesus and for a few chapters it seems as though he's
going to tread the familiar nineteenth-century path from narrow sectarianism
toward a less restrictive spirituality. But the author has many surprises in
store. Ware encounters Father Forbes, an intelligent, informed and (gasp!) Roman
Catholic priest and he also develops a painful crush on a dashing rich free-
spirited young and (horrors!) Irish-American beauty named Celia Madden. Ware is
unable to grasp that these two sophisticates treat him not as an equal, but as a
kind of mascot puppy. Wonderful and embarrassing complications ensue.

Frederic creates some full and rich and modern characters. Father Forbes is a
1890s decadent with roots in Pater and perhaps even in Huysmans, while Sister
Soulsby is a practical, energetic no-nonsense entrepreneur whose trade just
happens to be promoting Methodism. Most interesting of all is Celia Madden, who
plays Chopin and admires George Sand, and who is as up-to-the-moment as anyone
in The Woman Who Did (and who would have been perfectly at home discussing
aesthetics in Bloomsbury). Theron Ware's encounters with her are painfully
amusing. It's as if Frank Merriwell had somehow blundered into Madam Merle's
drawing-room.

The town of Octavius is modeled on Utica, New York, where Harold Frederic was
born and spent his young manhood. Utica is a place I know very well, but I don't
believe I've ever come across a Frederic monument or a "Harold Frederic lived
here" plaque. Perhaps the city fathers aren't eager to remind us that Utica is
portrayed as gossipy, narrow, ignorant, and exceedingly philistine.

Title: Seventy-two Virgins
Date: March 05, 2007

It appears to be the case that martyrs of a certain persuasion will be rewarded
in the afterlife with the ministrations of seventy-two virgins. It would take
a theologian of extraordinary skill to explain why acts of violence should be
rewarded with sexual indulgence. I raise a far less knotty question: if the
aim is bliss, then why virgins?  Why not women of experience and expertise?
Benjamin Franklin, the most practical of our Founding Fathers, was dogmatic on
this nice point: shun the callow in favor of women who've been around the block,
because "every Knack... by Practice [is] capable of improvement."  I think that
B-Frank would agree that there is something about the virgins-for-martyrs deal
that's kind of, how shall I say, impractical or counter-intuitive or even, dare
I say, kinky.

Here's a second theological conundrum. What is the reward when the martyr is
herself female? I must presume that she will be blessed with seventy-two male
virgins -- if not, there's a very serious afterlife asymmetry. Not to reward
females who give themselves to the cause would be a statement that the culture
of religious martyrdom does not support sexual equality, which I can hardly
bring myself to believe. But in the case of female martyrs, the matter of sexual
expertise is further exacerbated. Specifically, of what conceivable value are
seventy-two knackless male virgins? If we postulate that each male virgin is
good for between ten and fifteen seconds of actual intercourse, it follows that
they will be consumed at the rate of four to six every minute, which means that
on average a martyress, however patient, would enjoy a sum of only twelve or
so minutes of pleasure (setting aside time for re-mounting and repositioning),
which is surely insufficient exercise to produce a meaningful let alone heavenly
experience.

Nor will it be all that great for the male virgin at the end of the queue who
has to settle for sloppy seventy-seconds.

Title: What We Read in the Fifties:  The Amboy Dukes
Date: March 08, 2007

During my Erasmus Hall High School years, the hottest of all "hot" books was
Irving Shulman's The Amboy Dukes. It was official doctrine that a single oblique
glance at the inflammatory cover of this paperback could transform a well-
behaved kid into a murderous, reefer-crazed, oversexed hooligan. Simply to read
about the "juvenile delinquents" who populate The Amboy Dukes was to wander into
a criminal twilight. A guy definitely did not want his mommy to know that he had
heard of this book, let alone possessed a sticky contraband copy.

What was all the fuss about?  Why was the book condemned all over America and
even banned (for a while) in Canada?

Here's a paragraph that was much brooded upon in the local schoolyard. (I've
since learned that some 1950s moralists condemned it as pornographic -- and
perhaps they were right.)

They pushed onto the bus, and Frank watched Black Kenny and Mike get a nice-
looking broad between them and give her a rub. Mike and Kenny hemmed the girl
between them, skillfully pocketing her to prevent her escape. In her eyes
there was loathing and fear of the two hoodlums, who did not look at her but
nevertheless pressed against her lasciviously, pinioning her against their rigid
hot bodies. Mike pushed against the girl's buttocks, thighs, and legs, while
Kenny pressed against her stomach and breasts. The girl wanted to scream, to cry
out, but she was afraid....

Ugly to be sure, abusive, sexist, nasty, but still rather tame by later
standards. It's an effort of will to remember that during the Eisenhower years,
words such as "breasts" and "buttocks" were not uttered casually and that their
appearance on the printed page was rare and incendiary. But I don't think it
was the language alone, or even the stark portrayal of adolescents in heat that
rattled polite society. It was the intrusion of viciousness in the tame 1950s
father-knows-best twin-bed universe that provoked the reaction. That "nice-
looking broad" whom Mike and Black Kenny molest was, or was imagined to be, some
respectable family's sister or daughter. Just as the two hoods thrust themselves
against the young woman, so The Amboy Dukes flaunted itself in the face of
respectability. The proper middle class went to great lengths not to acknowledge
that brutes such as Black Kenny and Mike were their next-door neighbors. The
Eisenhower era lived in denial; there were some things that everyone knew but of
which no one spoke. In The Amboy Dukes, Shulman spilled the beans.

That's why The Amboy Dukes fascinated the guys who hung around the P. S. 217
schoolyard. Unlike our parents, we couldn't choose to deny the existence
of psychopaths such as Black Kenny and Crazy Shak (the novel's rapist and
murderer). Guys like that smoked and spit on every street corner and disrupted
many of our classrooms. We had to negotiate with violence or with the threat of
violence every day. To read The Amboy Dukes was oddly refreshing; it validated
the daily reality of teen-agers who weren't gang members.

Moreover, the novel had a strong vicarious appeal. While my friends were trying
to manage their hormones, keep up with their schoolwork and occasionally get
in a good game of basketball or stickball, the Dukes were cutting class,
punching out their teachers, smoking dope, and getting laid. Reading the
novel let us share in some of that other-side-of-the-track forbidden fruit.
But it allowed us to participate safely. The Amboy Dukes, like so many such
scandalous publications, is at heart a cautionary novel. Frank Abbot, the
central character, is a bad guy but he's appealing and not irredeemable; he goes
too far, gets in over his head, and winds up dead -- a warning to all of us. The
Amboy Dukes allowed "normal" kids to enjoy the novel's transgressive moments and
still return safely to the nest.

Although The Amboy Dukes sold millions of copies, I couldn't find it in any
of the libraries that I use. Through the miracle of the internet, I was able
to buy a tattered, yellowed-pages-unglued 35-cent 1949 Avon paperback. The
object itself is a piece of history. On the cover, a woman with flaming red hair
resists the embraces of a dark and handsome young man. Their facial expressions
(he: lustful; she: fearful) are highly melodramatic, but the pair are dressed
conservatively, as though they've just returned from a day of yachting. Also on
the cover are a couple of claims to literary merit: "The one book that tells the
inside story of juvenile delinquency no other novel has told before." And an
appeal to the moralists: "This book is emphatically a reading 'must'" --Edwin
J. Lukas, Executive Director, Society for the Prevention of Crime." Finally,
in almost unreadable tiny print, "This book is specially revised and edited
for Avon Books" -- an admission that leads me to guess that the paperback mass
edition expurgated some words or events that were deemed too strong for the kids
who bought the cheap edition and concealed it inside their official three-ring
binders.

Title: Writing: a Personal History
Date: March 13, 2007

My first writing instrument was the "straight pen," which was more durable but
not different in conception from the goose quill -- simply a metal nib set into
a wooden dowel. It was quite a trick for a six-year-old to carry a small drop of
ink from the inkwell and draw a line or circle without blotting -- especially
since there was a wartime shortage of quality paper and the the stuff that was
substituted was coarse and maximally absorbent. At P. S. 217, in the 1940s, each
classroom had an "ink monitor," whose job was to mix a dry powder with water in
a tall jug and fill all the inkwells. Every desk had an inch-in-diameter hole
in the upper right corner -- southpaws were expected to conform -- with a brass
fitting into which a small glass removable "well" was inserted. I got myself
into serious trouble for dunking the end of one of Josephine Casalino's long
black braids into my inkwell-- though I believe that I was neither the first nor
only boy who succumbed to so obvious a temptation. From the perspective of 2007,
it's hard to believe that dexterity with the straight pen was still part of the
curriculum -- it was as though we were being prepared to clerk in some gloomy
Dickensian counting-house.

I think that ballpoint pens arrived in the early 50s, but they were flighty
at first and regularly leaked onto the page or in the pocket. I remember that
my right thigh was dyed a perpetual blue. In 1956, setting off for college,
I invested $20 in a second-hand self-styled "portable" but nevertheless very
heavy Smith-Corona. I would not have plunked down so much cash if I hadn't
thought that I was making the purchase of a lifetime. After all, the typewriter
had represented the state of the writing art for eighty years -- ever since
Remington had taken Christopher Latham Scholes' invention into the mass market
-- and I had no suspicion that it would ever be superseded. Nevertheless, the
mechanical typewriter was obsolete by the 1960s, when I composed a document of
several hundred pages on a borrowed IBM Selectric. Not only did the electric
typewriter produce a more handsome page, but it made acceptable carbon copies.
(Carbon paper is unknown to younger generations and is now only found in
archaeological digs; it's shocking that internet-era folks have no clue that
"cc" abbreviated "carbon copy".) The heyday of the electric typewriter was brief
--twenty years or so. Sometime in the early 1980s, I was introduced to word
processing -- at first on an Apple 2+. Its dot-matrix printer was nasty (no
true extenders) and the hazardous program took perverse pleasure in displaying
ominous messages, such as "Fatal Error # 45."  After a while, I moved to
Wordstar, then to WordPerfect, and now, to whatever Typepad provides for this
essaylet. Could my straight-pen self have possibly imagined that I would someday
amuse myself with a self-published, self-edited internet blogazine?  Meanwhile,
my once-magnificent writer's bump has atrophied. It's gone the way of carbon
paper and white-out.

Information-gathering has been equally transformed. In the 1950s, data had to be
painfully copied by hand onto index cards, which were easy to misplace, misfile,
and misread. Sometime in the late 1960s I first started to make copies of book
and journal pages -- at first using a very smelly, expensive process, the name
of which I can't recall, which could only make crude and blurry negatives, but
was still far more efficient than copying by hand. It wasn't long before Xerox
rendered all previous copy systems obsolete.  Then came the internet which made
things easier still -- although for any depth of knowledge --let's not fool
ourselves -- books are still the only way.

At a library that I patronize, someone has taken fifty or so old wooden card
files and assembled them into a sculpture of sorts. It's titled Top Drawer
Society. For a donation -- I haven't inquired how large -- you can have your
name inscribed on a drawer's brass plate. I couldn't begin to estimate how
much time I spent searching through card catalogs in my lifetime: thousands of
hours, I'd guess. I never anticipated that so useful an item as a tray of cards
would be transformed into mere ornament and into a gesture to an antiquated
technology.

There's no question that innovations in writing and researching in my lifetime
are greater than anything that's happened since Gutenberg. I now know that
change will continue, but I have no more insight into the future than I did when
I plied my straight pen in first grade. What could possibly be out there beyond
the wordprocessing horizon?

Title: More on Nineteenth-Century Horsedrawn Conveyances
Date: March 17, 2007

A year or so ago, I confessed that when I read novels that take place in
pre- internal combustion days, I don't clearly distinguish among various
horsedrawn conveyances -- they're all coaches to me. I have no mental image of
"fly," "trap," "landau," "chaise," "phaeton," "cabriolet," "sulky," "surrey,"
"curricle," "gig," "hansom," "buggy," "four-wheeler," or "spring-van."  The
pictorial or social resonance of these colorful names is something to which I'm
pretty much tone-deaf.

I was therefore amused when just yesterday I happened upon the following
passage in Flaubert's Sentimental Education (completed in 1869 but set in the
1840s).  Frederic and Rosanette attend the horse races in a "berlin."  Stuck
in traffic, they find themselves surrounded by a crestomathy of carriages:
"barouches, britchkas, wurts, tandems, tilburies, dog-carts, covered wagonnettes
with leather curtains full of singing workmen out on the spree, and go-carts
carefully driven by fathers of families.  There were crowded victorias in which
some young man would be sitting on the feet of other passengers, with his legs
dangling over the side. Big broughams with cloth-covered seats carried dozing
dowagers; and occasionally a magnificent high-stepper went by, drawing a post-
chaise as simple and smart as a dandy's tail-coat."

I'm positive that Flaubert chose his words carefully and I'm equally sure that
he had no premonition that his vocabulary would be obsolescent in just fifty
years and incomprehensible in a hundred.

Every contemporary novelist knows that it matters whether his hero arrives in
a Jeep or a Jaguar or a jalopy. If his book will be read in a later century,
extinct and quaint words such as "pickup," "step-van," "SUV," "Buick,"
"station wagon," "jeep," "hummer," "flat-bed," and "Subaru" will be annotated
with copious scholarly footnotes. And the words to songs as well. How much
scholarship and how many sentences will it take to fully explicate "We'll have
fun, fun, fun/ Until Daddy takes the T-bird away?"

Title: An Imperfect Murder
Date: March 19, 2007

From the get-go, our internationally-renowned neighborhood scandal, the JonBenet
Ramsey murder, had TV movie written all over it.  It had upper-class sheen,
infant-beauty-pageant perversity, and tantalizing whodunnitness.  Our latest
local murder lacks all such glamor.  The characters are sad, dumb, and pathetic
and, to make matters worse, everyone already knows whodidit.  Fodder for what
sort of film?  The answer should be screamingly obvious to movie aficionados.

Here are the facts as they have been extensively reported locally.  Tess Damm
(note transparent symbolism of name), an in-and-out-of-trouble somewhat trashy
15-year-old, persuades her boyfriend, Bryan Grove, to kill her alcoholic and
abusive mother Linda.  Bryan obediently does the deed by stabbing Mom Damm in
the "throat and mouth."  The kids, however, don't have a clue how to dispose of
the body, so they stow it in the back seat of the Subaru.  While it festers,
the young 'uns cavort.  Neighbors tell reporters that that "the teens were
seen coming and going at all hours of the night, 'car-surfing' through the
neighborhood and blaring loud music."  After a raucous month of celebration
in which they spend the $4000 in Mom's bank account, the murderers come to
the realization that it might be good idea to dispose of the evidence.  They
solicit the aid of third young malefactor.  (Possible dialog:  Bryan:  "Hey
dude, want to, like, help us get rid of a, like, corpse." Jared:  "Cool.") They
head out to the Erie landfill, but the car gets stuck in the mud and so they
return home.  The next night, they try again: they drive to a local cemetery (a
stroke of pure cinematic genius!) but because the ground is frozen, they can dig
only one or two feet into the ground.  The bury the body, but, panicked that
the shallow grave will be noticed, they return the next night, exhume Mom and
return her to the Subaru.  At this point, just as the story is becoming weirder
than weird, an "anonymous tipster" notifies the police and thereby cries "cut"
to the youthful criminals.

It's probably too morbid and half-baked for a broadcast TV movie, but can anyone
deny that the story is made to order for Joel and Ethan Coen?  Some typical
Coen Brothers elements:  truly sleazy characters; rampant brainlessness; 
the inability of the participants to look even a few moments into the future;
gruesome details;  gratuitous blood and gore;  very, very, black humor; 
and, finally, the opportunity to satirize American mores.  What could be more
perfect?   It's a Coen Brothers world after all.  Can the argument be taken
a step further?  The adventures of Tess and Bryan and Linda couldn't possibly
have occurred until Joel and Ethan had made and exhibited Blood Simple and
Fargo.  The murder -- and the macabre and superbly noir series of actions that
follow -- would not have been possible without a literary precedent.  Once
gain, Life can do no better than slavishly tread in the Footsteps of Art.

Title: Recommended Reading
Date: March 22, 2007

The most glorious fictions that I've read in many years are late writings by two
nineteenth-century masters. The first is Leo Tolstoy's Hadji Murad; the second,
Gustave Flaubert's A Simple Heart. Hadji Murad (published posthumously in 1912)
is a novella on the subject of war and its follies. A Simple Heart (1877) is a
short story about an exploited servant woman who finds a bit of beauty in an
ugly world. They're both absolutely transcendent stories -- "beyond beyond," as
Shakespeare says.

April 2.  Additional recommendations. I've now read three "detective" novels
by Leonardo Sciascia. They are all superior creations, although their open-
endedness might be disappointing to people who expect that mysteries must be
resolved and that criminals should be brought to justice. They're not genre
fiction; they're writings that cleverly expand and question the crime genre.
The novels:  he Day of the Owl  (1961), To Each His Own (1966), Equal Danger
(1971), -- all reprinted in attractive, reader-friendly editions by New York
Review Books. I'll be looking for more Sciascia on the library shelves. Also,
You Know Me All, by Ring Lardner, an excellent baseball novel first published in
1916. It holds up well, although the humor leans heavily on "country bumpkin"
stereotypes.

Title: Another Folly: the "Shakespeare Authorship Question."
Date: March 26, 2007

This guest entry was contributed by Pauline Harlem, the internationally-
acclaimed author of The Wonderful World of Anagrams (New York, 2006).

"Just last week, the Washington Post published a pair of articles on "who wrote
Shakespeare's plays." The one claimed that Shakespeare's plays were written
by Edward de Vere, the seventeenth Earl of Oxford; the other re-asserted the
traditional view that William Shakespeare wrote William Shakespeare's plays. By
juxtaposing the two articles -- one for, one against -- the Post is guilty of
outrageous anti-intellectualism.The authorship of the Shakespeare plays is not
an open question. It's as if the Post were to offer its readers two articles,
one in support of evolution and the other in favor of new-earth creationism.
Just as the matter of evolution is a settled question, so the authorship of the
plays is not -- and never has been -- in any sort of doubt. The true believers
who keep stirring the pot are faith-based cranks, fanatics, and conspiracy
theorists who ignore the usual rules of evidence and reason.  Shame on the Post
for giving them a voice!

The nay-sayers discard the historical record and ask this question: is it
likely that Shakespeare, with his small-town background and (it's claimed)
limited education, could have written plays that demonstrate a sophisticated
knowledge of the law, the court, geography, seamanship, etc?  As to the matter
of likelihood, who could possibly disagree?  Of course it isn't likely that
these extraordinary plays would have been written by anyone -- but it happened
nevertheless. It's also unlikely that the theory of relativity would have been
developed by a civil servant in a Swiss Patent Office; it's extremely unlikely
that the most transcendent music ever written would have been composed by a
man who was totally deaf; it's beyond belief that an autodidact living in
intellectual isolation in Madras could single-handedly recreate a big hunk of
modern mathematics; it's more than incredible that a hermit-like lens-grinder
living in self-imposed intellectual exile would be one of the western world's
most innovative and progressive philosophers. What is "likely" and what actually
happens are two entirely different kettles of fish -- especially when genius
is concerned. Despite the unlikeliness, Shakespeare existed and he wrote
plays and poems.  His name is on thirty-six of the plays and his friends and
colleagues and contemporary admirers testify not only to his existence but
to his accomplishments. Among the thousands of books and the corridors of
unpublished manuscripts and records that survive from his time, there's not a
scrap of information to hint that the plays weren't his. Not a scrap, not a jot,
not an inkling, not a tittle.  Nothing.

The fallacious claims of the Oxfordians, Baconians, Elizabethians, Rutlandians,
et. al. have been refuted time and time again. Here's a representative sample of
the quality of the argument  -- it's from the recent Washington Post article.
"[It's unlikely that Shakespeare wrote the plays because he] never left England
-- but sixteen of the plays are set in Italy or the Mediterranean." Persuasive?
In what universe must authors travel the world in order to set their plays
outside of England?  Certainly not in the world of Shakespeare and his fellow
playwrights. Did Christopher Marlowe travel to Malta in order to compose The
Jew of Malta or to the Asian steppe to astonish the world with the Scythian
shepherd or to Wittenberg to trouble the orthodox with Doctor Faustus?  Thomas
Kyd never left England, but managed to startle theater-goers with The Spanish
Tragedy.  Ben Jonson never made his way to Italy, but he had no trouble putting
Volpone in Venice. John Ford, no traveler, set 'Tis Pity She's a Whore in Parma.
John Webster's two great plays The Duchess of Malfi and The White Devil are
set in Italy, a country on which Webster never set eyes. Thomas Middleton's
masterpiece, The Changeling takes place Alicante, in Spain -- but Middleton
was a Londoner who never went abroad.  And so on and on, endlessly. Like his
friends and competitors, Shakespeare wrote out of books. He, and they, pillaged
the literature for promising stories. If the story happened to have originated
in Italy, that's exactly where it remained. The playwrights were not geographers
or social historians and they created not real but literary places.  Marlowe's
Germany and Middleton's Spain and Webster's Italy are no more German or Spanish
or Italian than Shakespeare's Belmont is Belmontian or for that matter, W. S.
Gilbert's Mikado is Japanese.  Did Shakespeare need to travel to Denmark to
write Hamlet or to Vienna to write Measure for Measure?  It's nonsensical to
think so.  It's an argument without a scrap of merit. It's not honest.

But is it even a fact that that sixteen of Shakespeare's plays are set in
"Italy or the Mediterranean." Only by a stretch. Do the sixteen plays include
Othello, the Moor of Venice -- four acts of which occur in Cyprus?  And is the
argument that Shakespeare or some other author had to travel to off-the-beaten-
Elizabethan-track Cyprus in order to write it?  Do the sixteen include A
Midsummer Night's Dream, nominally set in Athens but in fact stuffed with
English tradesman and English fairies?  Or The Comedy of Errors, which takes
place, in part, in ancient Ephesus in Asia Minor. Or Pericles in Antioch? The
Tempest occurs on an enchanted island which is called Bermuda but seems to be
somewhere between Naples and Libya. Would a playwright need to traverse the
Mediterranean in order to bring Ariel and Caliban to life?  Is it any sort of
argument that plays set in the great age of Rome (Julius Caesar, Antony and
Cleopatra, Titus Andronicus, Coriolanus) required a playwright to abandon his
careful reading of North's Plutarch for a time-travel trip to ancient Italy? 
Shakespeare no more had to cross the Alps to write his sixteen plays than he
had to board a time machine to dark age Scotland to write Macbeth or teleport
himself to ancient Britain in order to write King Lear or Cymbeline.

The author of the Post article knows these facts. He knows that the travel
argument, and the other tissue-thin assertions that he advances, have been
refuted over and over again.  But like all faith-based controversialists, he
does not withdraw or concede or counter. He merely repeats and repeats and
repeats, because his personal conviction is prior to and more important than
either evidence or reason.  He's not conducting a legitimate search for truth;
instead, he is in thrall to an irrational and deeply-held conviction. Facts will
be bent to support his extra-logical hypothesis. His intellectual processes
mimic the creationists, the holocaust-deniers, the flat-earthers. Such minds
are not reachable -- but there's not the slightest reason for a respectable
newspaper to give them space."

Thanks, Pauline. I couldn't have said it any better myself.  V.

Title: Peony Survival
Date: March 27, 2007

Last October, I decided that one of my herbaceous peonies -- a Prairie Moon, to
be precise -- needed to be separated and re-planted. I did the deed, but a few
days ago, while cleaning the garden, I found a small, overlooked fragment of a
tuber -- six inches in length and no more than half the diameter of a finger --
lying on the ground entirely exposed to the elements. I missed it last autumn, I
guess.  But the good news: while there was no sign of rooting, there was a bud
-- and the bud was swelling with new life.  (It had been a wicked winter, with
temperatures down to 10F.)

Peony-growers know that it's important not to plant the roots too deep in the
soil. The experts say two inches at the most. My experience is that in our
Colorado clay, two inches can be too much, and that peonies so planted may come
up spindly and flowerless. But now I know that it's safe to err on the shallow
side.  Herbaceous peonies are tougher than I imagined -- pretty much impervious
to cold.  Or at least such is the case with this particular variety.

Friends, I can't tell you how much I admire that tenacious little cylinder of
life.  It's toughness is inspiring.  I've prepared a burrow for it -- the best
in the way of soil and situation that I can offer. Let's see what it makes of
its new opportunity. It's spring;  I'm optimistic.

Title: American Journalism Hits a New Low
Date: March 30, 2007

Just when it appears that our corporately-owned pseudo-local newspaper (the
Daily Camera) has hit rock-bottom-nadirhood, it plummets to still another new
low. It's a bottomless cistern.

We're suffering through a horrid local murder. The Camera is covering the story
with rare enthusiasm -- trying to elevate it to JonBenet Ramsey celebrity
status.  (It's the Linda Damm murder. You can look it up here.)

Some days there's no news.  But that doesn't stop Al Manzi and his troops.
Let's try to guess at the four-column headline on the front page of the edition
of March 28. Hint: It wasn't the Iranian capture of British sailors, which
might lead to a wider war in the Levant;  it wasn't AG Gonzalez kayaking the
disinformation rapids;  it wasn't the Senate repudiating the Smirker by setting
a deadline on Iraq. Nope. Here it is, folks. It's (drums and trumpets): FINDING
A NEW HOME:  LINDA DAMM'S DOG ADOPTED BY LONG-LOST FRIEND. Linda Damm's dog! 
Excuse me, but this "news" is not the truth that is going to set us free. This
is poverty-stricken intellectually vacant journalism.

The story itself is heart-rending. One human life has been lost and several
others are ruined. And our newspaper can do no better than run a report on
Linda Damm's dog!  Have the publisher and his reporters no dignity, no sense
of proportion, no shame?  No ethics. I'm embarrassed to be a reader of this
newspaper;  I'm embarrassed to be a fellow-citizen of its publisher.

Is it true that crude, yellow, lachrymose sensationalism still sells
newspapers?  I guess so.

March 31.  I received the following from Spike Schapiro, a friend of my
youth.  As usual, Spike is unhappy with what I've written.  "Viv, you've lost
your bearings.  You've been living in wussy Boulder so long that your brain
has turned to tofu. I'd heard that everyone out there was a fey vegan, but I
didn't believe it until I read the Damm dog story in your local rag. Let's get
this straight. Dogs are not placed in "foster homes" -- they're sent to kennels;
they're not "adopted", they're bought and sold; and they don't have "guardians"
-- they have owners.  Have you people lost the ability to make distinctions? Do
you treat all animals as if they were human infants?  The Camera reporter can't
tell the difference, that's for sure. I have ten bucks that says that she's
twenty-two years old, graduated with a degree in communication from some off-
brand college (probably Bible U.), and prides herself on her "spiritualism" --
by which she means "spirituality."  Plus she volunteers with Squirrel Rescue.

Viv, my friend, get back to your roots! The Camera's story isn't just egregious
journalism -- it's immoral trash. Try to recall the intersection of Newkirk
and Coney Island, where there wasn't the luxury for such foolish, fatuous
sentimentality."

Title: Some Parallels
Date: March 30, 2007

Leonardo Sciascia's laconic and precise "metaphysical mystery" The Day of the
Owl (Il Giorno della Civetta, 1961) is set in unwholesome, Mafia-dominated
Sicily.  Captain Bellodi and Sgt. Major Ferlisi, dedicated and intelligent
police officers, investigate a series of horrific crimes. Their trail leads to
the local boss, Don Mariano Arena, but further searching opens the possibility
that an "honorable deputy" and a cabinet minister also may be implicated.
We'll never know the whole story -- Bellodi is recalled to Bologna and Ferlisi
transferred to Ancona, and the investigation languishes.

In Bush's America, Congressman Duke Cunningham is convicted of accepting bribes;
further investigation appears to implicate "Dusty" Foggo, third in the hierarchy
at the CIA. It's also possible that senior White House officials might be
involved  -- but Carol Lam, the efficient U. S. attorney in charge of the case,
is suddenly relieved of her position. The investigation languishes.

And also: Jack Abramoff is sent to jail for perjury. The trail of corruption
once again appears to lead to the White House -- but the prosecutor, Noel
Hillman, is offered a federal judgeship and the investigation grinds to a halt.

At the end of The Day of the Owl, Captain Bellodi, though exhausted and
disillusioned, resolves to return to Sicily. He will, it seems, try again.
Sciascia's unhappy novel offers a small ray of hope. It seems to say that it is
wrong to succumb to hopelessness and despair in the face of political abuse. A
useful moral, I think.

Title: Cheney + Suicide
Date: April 06, 2007

Why doesn't Dick Cheney put a bullet in his brain?  It would do him (and his
reputation) a world of good. What could possibly stand in his way?  Once he
sprinkles the ratsbane on his porridge -- and, of course, leaves behind a
detailed and humble letter of apology --  he will begin to free his soul of sin
and to enjoy some piece of mind. When he has fallen on his sword, his lackeys
and toadies will be able to claim that while he was a black-hearted knave, at
least he wasn't a shameless black-hearted knave. They can try to persuade us
that although he was egregiously and dangerously wrong, he was, like another
suicide, Othello, "great of heart."  But if Cheney continues in his surly,
obstinate, unapologetic lip-curling silence -- why then, he'll go down in the
books as an unrepentant demi-devil like Iago ("From this time forth I never will
speak word").

Cheney has brought disgrace upon our beloved nation and upon himself.  Using
faked spy data, he suckered the ignorant, feckless Decider and almost the
entire Congress into invading Iraq. His war has been a monumental disaster.
"Full of scorpions [should be] his brain."  At this moment of writing, Cheney
is guilty of killing 3260 American soldiers and maiming (by official count
-- who can possibly guess at the truth?) 24,314 others. If Cheney has even
the most rudimentary of consciences, on it lays the heavy burden of 60,000 to
100,000 Iraqi souls. The Dickster has cost America $414 billion dollars, loss of
prestige and the squandering of oceans of good will. Like Anthony, he "has lived
in such dishonor/ That the gods detest [his] baseness."  But Antony took the
proper course. When Cheney dispatches himself -- "after the high Roman fashion,"
let's hope -- he'll have taken the first step toward rehabilitating himself and
the nation. For him not to do the deed would be ignoble.

Dick:  I know that you're hunkering in your bomb-proof shelter. I know that
you're up late at night, sleepless with guilt. You're cruising the internet,
perchance googling "Cheney + suicide," and you're wavering in your purpose. Dick
-- take my considered advice. I'm thinking of your place in history. At this
point, "you have no friend,/ But resolution and the briefest end."  You'll
immediately feel better.  It's a no-brainer.  Go for it.

April 10.  Spike Schapiro comments:  "Dr. M. -- I've read your exhortation to
suicide and also Otis Brown's Comment (see below).  You are, as usual, falsely
optimistic, but OJB is right on target.  Cheney can't off himself because a)
he's shameless and b) he's a total coward, and c) he has no self-knowledge and
d) he can't point a shotgun. You cite the precedents of Othello and Anthony but
they're both great spirits and therefore irrelevant.  Cheney is a slug."

Title: Headline:  Dr. M. Patronized by Five-Year-Old Grandson
Date: April 07, 2007

We take the small aluminum bat and the "safety" baseball to the concrete
schoolyard and I try to pitch the ball at the exact level where the grandson
swings.  Every time he makes contact, the ball rolls a hundred or so feet until
gravity and friction kick in (I have no fielders behind me). Grandpa retrieves
the ball. The grandson says, "Grandpa, why don't you run after the ball?"

Even without running, Grandpa manages to pull a muscle in his side and
experience some interesting numbness in his left leg.

We play a board-game called Narnia. It has three separate kinds of dice; it has
"sword cards" and "event cards," "wolves" and "white witches."  Grandpa doesn't
seem to grasp the game's subtleties.  The grandson says, "Grandpa, why don't we
play something less complicated."

We play chess. Grandpa manages to lose the first game, but despite his best
efforts, takes a lead in the second match (perhaps because he's fully mastered
the way the knight moves). Grandpa makes a gracious offer: "why don't we just
say it was a draw?" The grandson responds by flying his queen over the ranks and
files and knocking Grandpa's king off the board. The grandson says, "Why don't
we just say I won?"

Title: What We Read in the Fifties:  A Death in the Family
Date: April 10, 2007

I remember exactly when I first heard of James Agee's A Death in the Family. It
was in Ithaca in 1958. The late Edward Ruhe, who was then a young instructor in
English, stopped me on the street and asked if I had read it. He said I must,
and, obedient lad that I was, I immediately purchased a copy. I can't remember
much from my fifty-years-ago reading, except that I was put off by the novel's
long italicized flashbacks and by what I regarded as its excessively intimate
tone, which I then judged to be sentimental and false. But I've now re-read the
novel. It's authentic, it's emotional, and it's so very American. I'm very glad
to have had a chance to revise my earlier opinion. Perhaps I was too young. It's
curious that I didn't connect Agee to the autobiographical poets that I was then
reading, for the ground that Agee covers was then being explored by Lowell and
Snodgrass and Roethke and of course by Sylvia Plath.

It's a novel not only about death (it's told through the observing eyes of
Rufus Follet, the six-year-old whose father dies in an automobile accident) but
about the details of American life. There's very little in the way of plot, but
Knoxville in 1915 is wonderfully evoked, mostly through concrete images. It's
very much a novel of things. Perhaps I'm especially conscious of this technique
because I've been re-reading Flaubert. But in Flaubert's novels, almost every
object is laden with satirical significance (which is also the case -- to choose
an American parallel -- in the novels of Mark Twain). Agee, however, loves the
objects that he describes. Although there's puzzlement and mystery, there's not
an ounce of satire or cynicism anywhere in A Death in the Family. Rufus Follet
and Huck Finn -- it's not as unlikely a pairing as it might at first seem.

The facilitator of Agee's achievement is James Joyce. A Death in the Family
could not have been written without the precedent of A Portrait of the Artist
as a Young Man. But it's an American not an Irish portrait -- not as complex
or as original, but fully as real as Joyce's. If an extraterrestrial visiting
our lovely green planet wanted to understand the difference between Europe and
America, he couldn't do better than read Portrait and A Death in the Family side
by side.

Title: Book Report:  Tim O'Brien's In the Lake of the Woods
Date: April 13, 2007

In The Lake of the Woods sold well and was much adulated in 1994. It's been
on my reading list for a long time, and I've finally gotten around to it.
In plot, it's uncannily reminiscent of Sloan Wilson's The Man in the Grey
Flannel Suit (on which I reported some months ago). Wilson's novel is post-WWII;
O'Brien's is post-Vietnam. In each novel, the semi-autobiographical ex-soldier
protagonist has committed unspeakable acts that he conceals from his loving
wife; his silence embitters the marriage. In both books, the central figure
embarks an ambitious career, but he is haunted by his past. Eventually, by force
of circumstance, closeted history re-emerges and a crisis is precipitated.
Deliberate and willed amnesia is the common theme of both books -- in fact,
neither the characters nor their creators can bring themselves to confront the
past except obliquely.

I've come to In The Lake of the Woods thirteen years too late. I'm sure that it
had immediacy and power when it was fresh and new, but now it seems contrived
and obvious. The machinery of the novel  -- multiple interlocking flashbacks,
third-person commentary, authorial interjections, etc. -- may have worked in
1994, but is now marvelously self-conscious and ostentatiously "literary."
I know that Vietnam was a trauma for all concerned and I respect O'Brien's
sincerity and pain. I just wish In the Lake of the Woods weren't so thin and
pseudo-mysterious and evasive.

Is there a great novel of Americans in Vietnam or is it still waiting to be
written?  It was a particularly ugly war and it was the watershed experience
for people of my particular generation. Do we have a War and Peace?

Question:  How many masterpieces would it take to compensate for the
disaster?  Answer:  There isn't enough paper.

Title: Sex and the Nineteenth-Century Horsedrawn Conveyance
Date: April 18, 2007

Regular readers of this blague are well aware that I have repeatedly indulged
my bemusement at the names of extinct or obsolescent horsedrawn conveyances.
My point is that modern readers, who know precisely what is signified  --
in design, in metal, rubber and plastic, and especially in social value --
by such words as Jeep, Jaguar, Jetta, and jalopy, know just about zip about
"fly," "trap," "landau," "chaise," "phaeton," "cabriolet," "sulky," "surrey,"
"curricle," "gig," "hansom," "buggy," "four-wheeler," "spring-van," "berlin,"
"barouche," "britchka," "troika," "wurt," "tandem," "caleche," "tilbury," "dog-
cart," "wagonette," "go-cart," "victoria," "brougham," "diligence," "clarence"
or "post-chaise."  If we notice these words at all, we tend to savor them as
archaic Victorian music rather than to identify and evaluate them as specific
forms of transportation.

Return with us now to the unthrilling 1950s, before pre-marital cohabitation
became ordinary. In those days, automobiles reeked of sex. Indeed, I can
remember that one sociologist described them as "portable bedrooms" -- a
witticism that produced profound envy in those of us who came from automobile-
less families.  While I knew that Nashes and Studebakers and big ol' DeSotos
could serve as mobile boudoirs, I must confess that I had never suspected that
horsedrawn vehicles could perform the same function. The eye-opener came by
way of some sly and wicked goings-on in Flaubert's Madame Bovary.  Here's the
situation: Emma has been wooed for a hundred or so pages by her young admirer,
Leon. They are both eager to consummate their affair, but there's no convenient
venue. Taking fate into his hands, Leon "pushes" Emma into a cab. "'Where to,
Monsieur?' asked the cab driver. 'Wherever you'd like,' said Leon."  And then
Flaubert describes the route around Rouen taken by coachman, cab, and lovers.
He give us a page and a half of paragraphs like this one:  "The coach promptly
began to move again, passing through Saint-Sever, along the Quai des Corandiers
and the Quai aux Meules, over the bridge once more, through the Place du
Champ- de-Mars and behind the gardens of the Home for the Elderly, where, in
the sunshine, old men clad in black jackets stroll up and down a terrace green
with ivy. It climbed up the Boulevard Bouvreuil, traveled along the Boulevard
Cauchoise, then right over Mont-Riboudet as far as the hill at Deville." 
At discreet intervals, Flaubert interrupts the narrative: "'Keep going,"
cried a voice from inside...."  "'Keep going!' shouted the voice, even more
furiously...."  "The coachman could not understand what rage for locomotion
could be compelling this pair never to stop." Eventually, the cab "drew up in an
alley near the Beauvoisine district, and a woman stepped out, walking off with
her veil lowered, never looking back."

Nineteenth-century writers were not allowed to be explicit about sexual events,
so they had to adopt various circumlocutions and codes. They lacked the freedom
of both earlier (Fielding, said Thackeray, "was the last of our writers who
drew a man") and later (post-Joyce) novelists. To write frankly about the act
of intercourse was absolutely taboo.  Despite the obstacles, Flaubert does a
excellent job of suggesting both the duration, the energy and the jouissance
that Emma and Leon experience while their coach was "tossing about like a ship."

I suspect that Flaubert's readers had little trouble comprehending what is meant
by the passengers' sudden "rage for locomotion."

Title: An Informal Survey
Date: April 23, 2007

OK, it's time to get going. Could we put the house lights on, please. Here's
the first question. Raise your hand if you think that the loss of 5.000,000
e-mails by the White House was simply an accident. That it was unintended.
Anyone?  Yes, I see a couple of hands in the back, and there's someone here on
the left. I guess most of you think it was 'accidentally-on-purpose.' Fine. OK
now, here's another question. The White House claims that Karl Rove didn't use
the Republican National Committee e-mail address to bypass the records act, but
just simply to keep politics and government business separate. If you believe
that, please raise your hand. I'm not seeing any hands at all -- oh yes, there's
someone, and there's someone else near the center aisle. There's two hands --
no, I'm sorry, three.  Ready for another question?  The President is willing
to let his advisers talk to congressional investigators, but not under oath,
not publicly, and with no transcript. If you believe that he's not trying to
hide something, raise your hands, please. Did I make that question clear? Let
me say it again. If the president's argument is persuasive to you, raise your
hand. If you think he's just protecting himself and his advisers, keep your
hand down. Hands? I see two on the left, and one there in the back. Same person
as before, I think. OK now, -- next question. Karl Rove's lawyer admits that
Rove systematically erased his e-mails, but only because he thought that they
were preserved elsewhere. Anyone believe that one?  Please raise your hand.
Nobody?  OK, there's someone down here. Sorry, I almost missed you, ma'am. So
we have only one person who believes that story. Ready for another question? 
Attorney- General Gonzalez says that he would never fire anyone for political
reasons or to interfere with an investigation in progress. Do I have any hands
on that one? No, none at all?  Interesting?  I'll wait. Still nobody? Let
me try another question. Anyone here believe that Gonzalez is a tool of Rove
and that he does exactly what Rove tells him to do?  OK, now we're finally
getting some response. I thought no one was paying attention. Looks like about
two-thirds, maybe three- quarters of you. Maybe more. We only have time for
one last question.  Anyone here convinced that Karl Rove is a vicious liar
who deserves to hang by his thumbs in a Gitmo prison, please raise your hand.
Whoa, almost everyone. Please, I can't keep count if you raise both hands. Just
one hand, please. Look, shouting isn't necessary  -- I just need to count the
hands. What's that you say?  I can't hear you -- there's so much noise. Oh, you
think he should hang by his nuts. Very good. OK, thanks a lot, everybody. Thanks
for your cooperation. That was very helpful.

Title: What We Read in the Fifties:  Scaramouche
Date: April 25, 2007

For the life of me, I cannot remember whether I read Scaramouche because I
was entranced by the movie, or whether it was the other way around, and I
surrendered my 16 cents to the Leader Theater because I had already fallen
in love with Rafael Sabatini's historical romances. I know that I gorged
myself on huge helpings of Sabatini -- not only Scaramouche and Captain Blood,
but everything else in the rich collection of the McDonald Avenue library.
Scaramouche, first published in 1921, enjoyed a second burst of popularity
when the Mel Ferrer-Stewart Granger Technicolor swashbuckler hit the screens
in 1952. I've now re-read the novel, and while it lacks the magic that it had
for my 13-year-old self, and, moreover, is awkwardly plotted, and stilted, and
thin, and obvious, it's nevertheless an engaging adventure story. The central
figure is the dashing and resilient Andre-Louis Moreau, who survives crisis
after crisis with a witty, devil-may-care sprezzatura. The novel itself overlays
elements of picaresque (on-the-lam Moreau becomes an itinerant actor, then a
fencing master, and finally a politician) onto a traditional romance plot (in
the novel's final pages, our bastard hero discovers that he's an aristocrat by
birth). At heart it's yet another version of the secret-sharer, doppelganger,
Jekyll-Hyde plot so common a hundred or so years ago. Moreau is haunted by his
wicked double, the Marquis Gervais de la Tour D'Azyr, with whom he competes for
not one but two different women  -- one fallen and one pure, as was the custom
in those days. D'Azyr claims that Moreau has been "the evil genius of his life,"
but he's got it backwards: he's Moreau's evil twin. In the thrilling climax, so-
called, Moreau wins Aline de Kercadiou -- the upper-class paragon whom both he
and his double desire. The novel is set during the French Revolution, but the
historical context is dimly realized  -- a much paler embodiment than The Tale
of Two Cities, which, like Scaramouche, is also a novel of doubles (remember
Charles Darnay and his dissipated friend Sidney Carton!).  A dyspeptic reader
might assert that the novel is nothing but dilute Dumas; it would be hard to
challenge such an opinion.

The film, which I remembered fondly, was a bitter disappointment. It's
appallingly, embarrassingly bad. There's some good theatrical dueling, but
the plot is a mess, the dialog is ghastly, the humor infantile, and the
acting vaudevillian. Eleanor Parker is hopeless as a cliche "spitfire" who
alternately kisses and smacks around her admirers; however, a young and rondelet
Janet Leigh, swathed in whole hectares of taffeta, manages to redeem the
part of Aline. All the characters, even Aline, wear their hair in the oddest
configuration: highly artificial, upswept white wigs. They look like well-
groomed sheep. I suppose it's too late to shoot the hairdresser.

The Sesquipedalian Sibilance Society would like to extend its appreciation to
Mr. Sabatini for popularizing the word "spadassinicide," which is much-used in
the novel. It's from Fr. spadassin, "assassin," and from the Latin verb meaning,
"to kill."  Etymologically speaking, spadassinicide ought to denote a person
who murders murderers, but the author uses it to mean a person who kills by
taking advantage of the etiquette of the duel. It's a handsome old neologism,
although not easy to work into everyday conversation.

Title: A Bad Case of Irony Overload (IO)
Date: April 30, 2007

O m' god. I'm having a serious attack of Irony Overload. This is no joke. In the
last few days, the news has been saturated with extreme instances of Natural
Irony. It's dangerous stuff. Left unchecked, you know, IO can progress to Morbid
Cynicism (MC), which is terminal. The cases to which I refer are not your run-
of-the-mill family-values preacher caught pants-down with a male prostitute.
These are more colorful, more exotic performances.

Paul Wolfowitz, World Bank prexy and ferocious campaigner against corruption and
nepotism, "directed" that his very own girlfriend or house mate or whatever she
might be called, be hired at a handsome tax-free salary at a State Department
agency where she's to be guaranteed superior evaluations and inordinately large
salary increases. It's a variety of cronyism that we can call "nepotistical
irony."

Another: Robert E. Coughlin, deputy chief of the criminal division of our very
own US of A Department of Justice, which is overseeing the investigation of Jack
Abramoff, suddenly needs to spend more time with his family when investigators
scrutinize his financial relationship to Kevin Ring, an Abramoff stooge. What
are the odds? The investigator supervising his own investigation! There's
enough irony in this story to fill a barrel with monkeys or, alternatively, an
industrial size hen house with packs of famished foxes. And there's more to the
story. Last year, the very same Robert E. Coughlin received, at the hands of
Alberto Gonzalez himself, the highly coveted Attorney-General Award for Fraud
Prevention.

And just yesterday, when I thought that my IO index couldn't rise any higher,
Global AIDS Ambassador and Deputy Secretary of State Randy (actual name!!)
Tobias, a big abstinence guy and the overseer of a program designed to help
men in poor countries "develop healthy relationships with women" resigned "for
personal reasons" when it was revealed that he had been regularly dialing up an
"escort service" that sent shady ladies to his home.  Asked "if he knew any of
the alleged call girls," Randy replied that in "he didn’t remember them at
all. He said it was like ordering pizza." Women are like pizza?  To a man whose
mission is "to help men in poor countries develop... etc., etc."  In the face
of such a revelation, how's an ordinary guy supposed to keep Morbid Cynicism at
bay.

By the way, Randy T. has chosen to go with the Ted Haggard defense. Yes, he
frequented prostitutes, but not for sex, only for massage.

So here we go again, dear readers. Pop quiz, multiple choice. Your back is
hurting and you need a massage. Whom do you call?  Two choices:  a) massage
therapist, or b) a notorious madam.

If you answered A, you win a lifetime membership in the Committee to Stamp
out Morbid Cynicism.  If you answered B., you receive a lucrative patronage
appointment in the Department of Justice plus a secret e-mail account with the
Republican National Committee.

Title: Book Report:  Peter Pouncey, Rules for Old Men Waiting
Date: May 03, 2007

Rules for Old Men Waiting (Random House, 2005) is both a good and bad novel.
Some of the time it's rather wonderful, but there are long stretches that are
maximally pedestrian. It's distinctly odd that the story-within-a story -- a
WWI morality about good and evil in the face of combat-- is gritty and real and
exciting, while the frame is flaccid and unconvincing and also offers some of
the woodenest dialog I've read in the new millennium. Rules for Old Men Waiting
is a first novel by a sexagenarian that recounts the story of an old man who's
decided to devote his last days to writing fiction. It's less involuted than it
sounds but still a little too self-consciously theatrical. Pouncey must have had
tons of trouble bringing the novel to a close, because in the last few pages he
invents a new character to help him staple on an ending. Nevertheless, the novel
is an honest, respectable effort -- and extremely effective when Pouncey sticks
with his strengths.

My geezer group is going to read Rules for Old Men Waiting later this month, so
stay tuned for a fuller report.

Title: "The Answer" is not the Answer
Date: May 03, 2007

I never, ever, thought that the Denver Nuggets' acquisition of Allen Iverson
was a good idea. He has skill, he has speed, and he's the most resilient guy in
the world. He can do everything on a basketball court except win games. These
last four losses against San Antonio prove the point. It's not just that last
night he was 6 for 22;  it's that when the Nuggets come down the floor, whether
Iverson eventually shoots or not, he clings to the ball and dribbles around
while the rest of the team stands and watches. Iverson turns his teammates into
spectators. Last night, Carmelo had three points in the fourth quarter; he
barely touched the ball.  Nene, who can score off almost everyone down in the
post, might as well have sat for the last twelve minutes.

Of course it's clear that the Nuggets can't advance in the playoffs until they
find themselves a reliable three-point shooter.

It's just as obvious that Iverson isn't going to become a team player; he's
31 years old and he's averaged 23 shots a game with a .422 percentage for an
entire career. He's not going to alter his game, but he's definitely going to
deteriorate. I'm afraid that we're stuck with him. Meanwhile, Philadelphia
has done better with Andre Miller than with The Answer. In addition, we gave
Philly two first-round draft picks to help them fill in their gaps. I like
Philadelphia's chances;  I don't like ours.

Title: "Loyal Bushies":  Two Archetypes
Date: May 07, 2007

Here are two types of "civil" "servants" prominent in the Bush era.

A.  The Moronotron. Just under 30 years old, he/she (let's say she) comes from
a large family of home-schooled children, five of whom are still active in the
LifeForce Harvest Church of Milan, Ohio, pastored by the Reverend Mike. Family
trauma (one of her brothers committed suicide; another had to be disowned when
he moved to San Francisco with his friend Gabe; that her mother recently entered
alcohol rehab has only strengthened her faith. She graduated from Brethren
College, where students and faculty bask in an "authentic relationship with the
Lord," with an honors degree in Christian Communication. After Brethren, she
attended law school at Regent University, where she chaired the debate team and
counseled pregnant teens. She was making fundraising calls for the Santorum
campaign in 2004 when she was offered the position of assistant undersecretary
for policy in HHS -- her roommate's cousin was a fraternity brother of a 'prayer
partner' of Lynne Cheney's aunt Sylvia's husband. As White House liaison, she
"relayed" information from the President's "closest advisers" to the Secretary.
Now undersecretary of HHS, she oversees 160,000 employees and a budget of 800
gajillion dollars. She is unmarried and doesn't date, enjoys Fruit Loops, and
someday, when her life is less busy, hopes to travel to third-world countries to
bring good news to the unenlightened.

B. The Henchdoofus. He is now close to 60, a graduate of the Chadron State
College in Chadron, Nebraska, with a degree in marketing. At Chadron, he
captained the cheerleading squad and made a complete recovery from the illnesses
(depression, fatigue, etc.) that made it impossible to for him serve in the
military during the Vietnam era. He joined Exxon Mobil right out of college.
He had worked his way up to a moderate-sized cubicle when he left to head up
Patriotic Americans For Clean Energy (wholly funded by Exxon). PACE lobbied
for a "balanced approach to offshore oil drilling." In 2000, President Bush
appointed him chair of the Advisory Council of the Food Safety and Inspection
Service. In 2001, he founded a K Street lobbying firm called ACS Associates
which had as its principal client the American Melamine Council. ACS (from
which his wife Christine continues to draw a $30,000 monthly stipend) is often
credited with the resurgence of profits of both the melamine and the pet-food
industries. He was recently appointed Undersecretary for Nutrition Policy in
the Department of Agriculture. He's a dedicated environmentalist and hunter,
and enjoys the wilderness in his SUV, his ATV, and especially in his Arctic Cat
Panther 360 snowmobile equipped with an ATN 24x75LU peak performance titanium
night vision telescope mounted on a Remington X-40 high-powered assault rifle.

Title: Another "Loyal Bushie."
Date: May 10, 2007

In the previous post, I recorded two archetypes of "Loyal Bushies" -- the
Moronotron and the Henchdoofus. Here's another one.

The Spoiled Rich Prick. Typically, the SRP attended boarding school at
Phillips something-or-other or at St. Somebodies in New Hampshire. Although he
learned nary a thing, and his SATs were under 1000, he was admitted to Yale
(which his father, grandfather, and great-grandfather attended) and in his
senior year was tapped for membership by Numskull and Boners. The SRP went
on to study at the Harvard Business School, where he graduated dead last in
his class. Although eligible for the draft, through his father's influence
he was able to secure a place in the National Guard, from which he was
frequently absent-without-leave.  For a decade or so after Harvard, the SRP
was distinguished for booze, cocaine and drabbing. Friends of the family set
him up in a business, which failed, and then bought him out for many millions.
Then the SRP's father decided that he was too incompetent to enter the family
business, so he had him elected governor. He still holds high political office
and is famous for his laziness, rhetorical incompetence, anti-intellectualism,
partisanship, ignorance, truculent stubbornness, petulance and bonehead errors
in matters of national consequence.

Edgar the Outlaw, Louis the Pious, Eric the Priest-hater, William the Silent,
Olaf the Stout, Bayezid the Thunderbolt, Garcia the Tremulous, and Alfonso the

Title: What We Read in the Fifties:  The Bridge of San Luis Rey
Date: May 14, 2007

The Bridge of San Luis Rey, although published in 1927, was still widely read
in the 1950s both by the  general public and by students in classrooms all
over America. It's a fine novel but it's unfortunate that Thornton Wilder's
philosophical premise is so naive and lame. In 1714 a rope bridge over a gorge
in Peru breaks and five people perish. Brother Juniper investigates the lives
of the fallen, assuming that the good lord wouldn't have allowed them to die
without a reason. Eventually, the well-meaning priest learns that the five
victims were no worse and no better than any other quintet of ordinary mortals.
His conclusion is displeasing to officialdom and both he and his compilation of
facts are burnt by the Inquisition.

By the oddest of odd coincidences, I had recently read an essay on the rope
bridges of the Incas, in which I learned that, though brilliantly designed,
these bridges required annual renewal. My reading of The Bridge of San Luis
Rey was therefore colored by questions not of theology but of engineering.
Why didn't they repair the damn bridge?  Why did they think that a fiber
bridge wouldn't rot?  Why doesn't Brother Juniper investigate the bridge
maintenance department? The conclusions to which the novel seems to come --
that a) sometimes good people die for no good reason, b) that god is either
indifferent or not there at all, and c) the Spanish inquisition was unpleasant
-- don't seem particularly challenging. Is it possible that the novel's theses
were daring in the 50s classroom?  They seem mighty tame today.

Though the frame of The Bridge of San Luis Rey is bland, the accounts of
the five people who die are sharp and colorful and imaginative and rather
beautifully written. There are moments, in fact, when Wilder's storytelling
seemed almost post-modern. Here's part of a paragraph about the twins Manuel and
Estaban. To me, it sounds like an extract from The Hundred Years of Solitude.

Because they had no family, because they were twins, and because they were
brought up by women, they were silent. There was in them a curious shame in
regard to their resemblance. They had to live in a world where it was the
subject of continual comment and joking. It was never funny to them and they
suffered the eternal pleasantries with stolid patience. From the years when they
first learned to speak they invented a secret language for themselves, one that
was scarcely dependent on Spanish for its vocabulary, or even for its syntax.
They resorted to it only where they were alone, or at great intervals in moments
of stress whispered it in the presence of others. The Archbishop of Lima was
something of a philologist; he dabbled in dialects; he had even evolved quite
a brilliant table for the vowel and consonant changes from Latin into Spanish
and from Spanish into Indian-Spanish. He was storing up notebooks of quaint
lore against an amusing old age he planned to offer himself back on his estates
outside Segovia. So when he heard one day about the secret language of the twin
brothers, he trimmed some quills and sent for them. The boys stood humiliated
upon the rich carpets of his study while he tried to extract from them their
bread and tree and I see and I saw. They did not know why the experience was so
horrible to them. They bled....

I think if this extract were presented to ten literate readers, nine of them
would immediately guess "Marquez." Of course, its Marquezness would be even more
obvious if Manuel and Estaban would fly up to the ceiling or be transformed into
a thousand glorious butterflies. I don't know whether Marquez ever read The
Bridge of San Luis Rey, but I certainly wouldn't be surprised to discover that
he had done so.

Incidentally, Manuel dies and his twin Estaban wrestles with "the guilt of the
survivor." Is it relevant that Thornton Wilder's own twin died at birth? 
And does it follow that Wilder, despite the fact that he came from a large
and accomplished family, might well be thought of as some curious sort of
replacement child?

Title: A Violent Literary Dream
Date: May 16, 2007

Last night I dreamed that I was in conversation with two English professors
(both male and middle-aged) from a college in New Orleans (query -- why New
Orleans?). One of them said, "Rex is a very good baseball player. Thanks for
recommending him." I said, "Yes, he's good, even though he has two prosthetic
shoulders. But I didn't recommend him to you as a baseball player. I recommended
him as a novelist. He writes detective stories."  One of the professors
said, "I like his stories, but he doesn't transcend the genre"  ("transcend
the genre" is an actual verbatim quote from the dream. I don't invent the
dialogue; I only report the facts.)  And then I said, and I think I remember
this accurately, "if you want to read someone who 'transcends the genre,' you
should read novels by Leonardo Sciascia." Once those words were out of my
mouth, I started to feel foolish -- did I mention the name Sciascia because I
was genuinely trying to add to the conversation, or was I just showing off? 
(I often bother myself with such questions in 'real life'.)  While I was
cross-examining myself, a young woman appeared on the "set."  She was no one
I recognized, but I can report that she was wearing a white blouse and a long,
dark skirt. She held a gift-wrapped package and she opened it, pulling out a
book. She said, "here's something that will transcend the genre." And then she
shouted, "Transcend the Genre."  "Transcend the Genre."  Just at that moment
I heard shooting and realized that a sniper was firing at at her. She took a
bullet to the stomach and another to the head, and lay there at my feet, dead
and bloody. It seemed like a good time to wake up, and I did so.

May 18. Marion Morrison, associate professor of English at the University of
Iowa, who has contributed to this blague in the past, writes:  "Dr. Metablog,
or Vivian, or whatever you're calling yourself today, I'm embarrassed for you.
That's the most mysognynistic dream I could imagine. As soon as true creativity
arrives on the scene of your dream, in the form of a young, attractive and
obviously creative woman, your unconscious killed her with a shot to the heart.
Your dream admits no other interpretation."

May 19.  Spike Schapiro writes:  "Marion, that's a crock of you know what.
The dream is not a bit 'mysogynistic' -- I presume you mean 'misogynistic'.
It's about pretentiousness. The woman who shouts "transcend the genre" is an
pretentious intellectual bully. She deserves to be obliterated -- incidentally,
not with a bullet in the heart, as you claim, but in the head and stomach. You
can't even get the facts right. But what can you expect from someone who thinks
that Rider Haggard wrote a novel called King Solomon's Minds, which is what
you called it in your pretentious little slice of literary you know what. Hey
everyone, click on "in the past" in the preceding paragraph and check out what
I'm saying. Marion, go back to the classroom where you can poison the brains of
another generation of vulnerable children."

Title: An Overheard Anecdote
Date: May 20, 2007

We were flying Frontier from DC back to Colorado. Two old guys (old, but younger
than I) were swapping stories. Here's one. "Rosie and I were at a hotel in
Vegas, in bed.  About one in the morning, we hear a hooker knock on the door
across the hall.  'Anyone want a little action.' No answer. Then, sure enough,
she knocks on our door. 'Want some action?'  Rosie says, 'Move on, honey, I'm
working this room.'"

Good dialogue.

I assume that Rosie is the wife.  But the story, at least to my tired old ears,
has a slightly different valance if she's a date, a business associate, or a
mistress.

Title: My New Career
Date: May 21, 2007

Ever since I retired a few years ago, friends and relations have been asking
what I intend to do with the rest of my life. It's time to start on a new
career, and after much deliberation, I've decided to fulfill a lifelong dream.
I've always had the soul of a power forward;  now I'm going to make it happen.
With this blague entry, I declare my eligibility for the NBA draft.

Let me confess:  I don't expect to be a lottery pick. There's too much college
talent and too many 7-foot Lithuanian teenagers. High second round is what I
aspire too.  I might even have to play a year or two in a European league to
sharpen my game -- no problem.

I figure that to play in the NBA, a guy needs three things: the game, which I
have; the attitude, which I certainly have; and the body, which I am working on.

Let me point out that at 5' 10 1/4"  (formerly 5' 10 3/4") I am a full five
inches taller than Earl Boykins. Plus I can get into the air higher than Yao
Ming; I'm a better three point-shooter than Shaquille O'Neal; and I'm a more
consistent at the charity stripe than Ben Wallace. Those are some big names
there. Not only that, I'm a better interview than anyone in the league past or
present--even better than Sir Charles himself. I'm a team player. I don't need
to play 48 minutes;  I don't need to take the game-winning shot. On defense,
there's not a player in the league whose flopping will be more authentic.

Because I've lived a more-or-less bookish life, my body is still in tiptop
shape. No gimpy knees or repaired Achilles tendons or fused vertebrae. True,
the A-fib could be a problem down the road, but I don't imagine that the apical
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, of which I have the merest tad, will hold me back
in the slightest.

To the club owners and general managers who are reading this blague entry -- let
me point out that I appeal to an entirely different demographic than players
now in the league. Until now, there was no one to be a "spokesman" for Beltone
hearing aids or Avodart or AARP. Untold, untapped commercial opportunities
waiting to be seized!!

I've been running this idea by my friends and family for the last few weeks, and
I'm sorry to say that there's a lot of ageism and size-ism and negativity out
there.  Let's leave that skepticism behind us! I'm ready to roll! I just have
to decide on the appropriate tats.

Title: Boustrophedoniana
Date: May 23, 2007

I'm fond of a passage in Gulliver's Travels where Jonathan Swift describes
Lilliputian script. In a single sentence, Swift manages to attack and nail two
of his favorite targets: "ladies" and "England." The Lilliputians "manner of
writing is quite peculiar being neither from the left to the right, like the
Europeans;  nor from the right to the left, like the Arabians; nor from up to
down, like the Chinese, nor from down to up, like the Cascagians, but aslant
from one Corner of the Paper to another, like Ladies in England.

In good satirical fashion, Dr. S. supplements truth with fancy: the
"Cascagians," who write from bottom to top, may sound like the Carpathians or
Sarmatians or some other trans-Caucasus people, but they don't exist. It appears
that Swift invented them in order to complete his survey of the directions in
which writing might flow.

Yet even including the fantastical Cascagians, Swift's list is not
comprehensive. There are other possibilities for writing beside up and down,
right and left or aslant.

In boustrophedon (a lovely Greekish word that signifies "turn like an ox
plowing"), alternate lines move in opposite directions. Lines one, three, five
and seven and so on proceed from left to right; lines two, four, six, and
eight from right to left. Ancient languages such as Safaitic were written in
boustrophedon; some Etruscan inscriptions, still undeciphered, seem to follow
the same pattern. Boustrophedon is not unreasonable, but it's certainly awkward
for those who have made a fetish of left to right.

Here's how Shakespeare transforms boustrophedonically.

It is the cause, it is the cause, my soul,—

!srats etsahc uoy, uoy ot ti eman ton em teL

It is the cause. Yet I'll not shed her blood;

,wons naht sreh fo niks retihw taht racs roN

And smooth as monumental alabaster.

.nem erom yarteb ll'ehs esle, eid tsum ehs teY.

Survival of the fittest, applying even to scripts, no doubt led to the
extinction of boustrophedon.

Query: would our brains be more supple and more imaginative if we had retained
this style of writing? Or would we simply be more perplexed? Or dizzy? And would
we, as a civilization, prize as the peak of wit and award the laurel to the
palindrome?

Incidentally, Rongorongo, the indigenous language of Easter Island, was
apparently written in reverse boustrophedon, i.e. bottom to top -- a
compositional practice that any satirist, even Swift, would have been delighted
to invent.

May 26.  Marion Morrison, Ph.D., an associate professor of English at the
University of Iowa, writes: "I'm confused about 'reverse boustrophedon.' Is it
real, or is it another Dr. Metablog 'invention'?  Is Rongorongo a metablogian
Cascagian?  I'm skeptical. And how does it work?  Can you favor us with a few
lines in so-called 'reverse boustrophedon?'

Vivian replies:

Devoutly to be wish'd....

And by opposing end them. To die- to sleep-

Title: Fiction by Jhumpa Lahiri;  Anthroponomastics
Date: May 30, 2007

Last week I read and was much impressed by Jhumpa Lahiri's collection of short
fiction called Interpreter of Maladies (1999), especially the first story "A
Temporary Matter," which shouldn't leave a dry eye in the house. I've now read
Lahiri's only published novel, The Namesake(2003). It's a fine book. I didn't
know, although I should have, that a film of The Namesake, directed by the great
Mira Nair, is now in release. I'll try to see it.

Lahiri writes about Bengali immigrants in America. Acculturation is not a
new subject in our fiction. Like other groups, the Bengalis bring their own
flavor to the American gallimaufry. In The Namesake, the first generation keeps
the customs and the food and largely self-segregates; members of the second
generation go to good colleges and become engineers and doctors, understand
but don't write Bengali, eat pizza and Chinese takeout, and aren't keen about
arranged marriages.

In Bengali society, individuals apparently have two names: an official public
name, and what Lahiri calls a pet name, but which anthropologists call a
hypocoristic. The central character in The Namesake was supposed to be called
Nikhil, but through a bureaucratic error, his pet name, Gogol, became his school
name. So he goes through the first years of his life as Gogol Gangulia. The name
inhibits and embarrasses him. Before he matriculates at Yale, he changes his
name back to Nikhil, yet he's always caught between the two identities signified
by these rival appellations.

Jhumpa Lahiri is a pseudonym for Nilanjana Sudeshna. She's married to Alberto
Vourvoulias-Bush. I can't imagine what's on her passport or what's she's named
her two children, but it's a sure thing that she's thought more than a little
about nomenclature  -- as must anyone who feels that his name doesn't properly
fit his character. I myself am ambivalent about my own name.  Vivian de St.
Vrain isn't exactly "me," if the truth by told. It's French, and I don't always
feel French. My teachers couldn't always pronounce my given name properly, and I
had to correct them, which was embarrassing for a shy youth. And Vivian -- it's
so ambisexual. I would have preferred to have been named something decisive and
less ethnic. I should have had Gogol's courage. Or Nilanjana Sudeshna's.

Date: June 01, 2007

Regular readers of this blague will remember that Dr. M. has long ago confessed
that he suffers from a serious case of "directional disability," or as some call
it, "geographical dyslexia" -- which means that he regularly loses his way, is
subject to travel-based panic attacks, and is consequently abused by friends and
family who refuse to recognize that he's not stupid, just utterly lost.

Advanced technology rides to my rescue. I now own a mobile navigator. It
affixes to the windshield of the car, and, using signals bounced off three
or four satellites, instructs me how to get from point A to point B. I've
fallen profoundly in love with the disembodied female British voice who
doesn't criticize me when I make a wrong turn: she just says, very politely,
"recalculating."  Then she says, "drive point five miles and turn left." 
What a boon to the chronically lost! I now drive as accurately as a migrating
bird. My only reservation: I think that my friend should congratulate me when
I get to where I'm going. She should show a little enthusiasm. But all she
says is "arriving at destination, on left." What would it hurt her to offer
congratulations?  I'm not asking for a commitment or for flowers.

The navigator has now moved into first place among my prostheses, supplanting
the incisor.

Title: "Penultimate"
Date: June 04, 2007

At our local farmer's market last Saturday, an enthusiastic young man was
bragging to his out-of-town guests about the various vegetable and food stands.
"Here's where you buy the best bread in town," I heard him say. "It's the
penultimate bakery." "Penultimate?" There's no doubt in my mind that the young
feller meant to say that this particular bakery -- a very excellent one, in fact
-- was the best of the best. Not just the "ultimate," but more than ultimate.
In his mind, "ultimate" means best, and the prefix "pen" signifies "more than"
or "extremely."  I'd never heard "penultimate" used in such a way, but I
googled the word and found a number of such uses, including a Penultimate Wine
Bar in St. Louis and a quotation from the speaker of the Massachusetts House
of Delegates, who, arguing in support of a proposed constitutional amendment
banning gay marriage, specified that "voters must be given the chance to speak.
They have the penultimate constitutional authority, not four judges."

Of course, according to every dictionary on the planet, "penultimate" is not a
superlative of "ultimate." It means, as it has always meant, "next to last."
It's from the common Latin word "paene" -- nearly or almost, and from "ultima"
-- last. Penultimate is almost the last in the same way that penumbra is almost
a shadow.

One of the reasons that I'm taken aback by this novel use is that for me,
penultimate isn't at all an unfamiliar or exotic word. It entered my life in
high school Latin, in the early 1950s, and therefore dates back to my earliest
adventures in literacy. In Miss Beulah Withee's classes, we spent many hours
learning to scan Virgil and Ovid. (I don't really know why we did so; you don't
need to master metrics in order to appreciate the poetry. I imagine that the
practice dates back many centuries to a time when gentlemen were expected to
compose Latin verses.)  We students of first-year Latin were taught that the
last syllable of a line was the ultima, the next-to-last the penult, and third
from last the antepenult. Thanks to Miss Withee, "penultimate" has never posed
any mystery for me. But let me hazard a guess that neither the bread enthusiast,
nor the owner of the St. Louis watering hole, nor the Massachusetts speaker were
ever required to scan Latin hexameters.

Although penultimate in the sense of "the very best" is, so to speak, "wrong,"
I can feel it gaining fast.  It's breathing down my neck. And if it's used
often enough in the new signification, "very best" will soon supplant "next to
last."  Let me predict that in fifty years of so, "penultimate," which even as
I write these words yearns to mean "better than best," will be only used in its
original Latinate sense by a handful of old fogies who will cling to the antique
meaning with all the feeble strength in their ancient bony fingers. I can even
imagine a time when the prefix "pen" will become detached from "penultimate"
and will be used to create a whole series of imaginative new "cranwiches":
"penexcellent," for example, or "penpenurious."

I'm of two minds about such changes. I'm well aware that language is
inherently unstable and, intellectually speaking, I'm a descriptivist, not a
prescriptivist. I try to be tolerant of new words; in fact, I'm proud of the
handful that I've invented myself.   don't want to turn into some kind of
mossbackosaurus convinced that any innovation in usage signals the demise of
western civilization as we've known it. Nevertheless, I can't deny that the
phrase "penultimate bakery" grates very harshly on my sensitive ears.

Moreover, I'd feel mighty squishy if I had to suppress my instinctive desire to
rail against contemporary linguistic collapse.

Source: 2007/06/king_lear_vi

Title: King Lear, V.i
Date: June 06, 2007

Today's contribution is the work of resident Shakespearean Pauline Harlem, the
internationally-acclaimed author of Anagrams for Fun and Profit (2005) and The
Naked Anagrammatist (2007).

William Shakespeare, culture hero and playwright, is so often idolized for the
great iconic moments and the big megaphonic speeches that quieter but equally
luminous effects may go unnoticed. A good example of such an oversight is the
extremely brief scene that graces the end of the History of King Lear -- eleven
lines in total that have never been granted the praise they deserve.

As King Lear winds to a close, readers (or playgoers) are exhausted. Not only
are their emotions wrung, but their capacities have been taxed just trying to
track the crowded details of the plot. Even the author had trouble keeping
King Lear's entangled stories in mind -- perhaps because he revised the play
several times. Yet although Shakespeare may have slipped on a detail or two, he
never lost sight of the main lines of the parallel plots. In the one, Cordelia
marshals her army against that of Lear's enemies, which is led by her wicked
sisters Goneril and Regan; in the other plot, old Gloucester, cruelly blinded,
is carried to Dover by his faithful son Edgar. Gloucester intends to put an
end to his own life. Edgar has a different agenda; it's his plan to rescue his
father from suicidal despair and by doing so save the old Earl's soul.

In the third-from-last scene of the play, Cordelia tenderly and reverently
reveals herself to her father. The tragedy's very last scene is long and
complex, encompassing a formal duel between Edgar and his half-brother Edmund in
which Edmund is mortally wounded, plus the suicides of the wicked sisters and
the murder of the good one, and finally the deathbed speeches of Lear himself.
Between the weighty matters of the last and of the antepenultimate scenes,
Shakespeare tucks in a brief enactment that can easily be overlooked -- but
which shouldn't be. It's one of the pinnacles of playwriting, as splendid a
piece of art as the world will see between the last big bang and the next -- or
until all molecular motion ceases -- and even afterward.

Shakespeare carefully sets off the scene from its surroundings. It both begins
and ends with a child taking a father by the hand and attempting to draw him to
safety -- an image of care and concern with deep roots in both "real life" and
the western literary tradition. First Cordelia wordlessly leads her maddened
father across the stage. Just as the pair exit, Edgar stumbles on stage with
his own father in tow. The brief exchange between father and son pauses while
Edgar secludes Gloucester. Then comes the conflict between good and evil figured
in the offstage roar of battle. Edgar returns, exchanges another couple of
sentences with his father, and then takes his hand and leads him on. It's an
unobtrusive scene, brief and understated -- and for Shakespeare, relatively
languageless. But every single word tells.

Here is the scene exactly as it appeared in the quarto of 1605. For you internet
wanderers who have accidentally found your way to this blague and who've never
been offered the opportunity to look at Shakespeare in the raw, unedited and
unmodernized, this passage offers some good examples of the playwright's quirky
spelling and of his characteristically minimalist punctuation. (The medial u's
-- standard in Elizabethan printing -- should be read as v's; i.e. "thrive" for
"thriue.")

Alarum.  Enter the powers of France over the stage, Cordelia with her father in
her hand.  Enter Edgar and Gloster.

Edg.  Here father, take the shadow of this bush

For your good hoast, pray that the right may thriue

If euer I returne to you again ile bring you comfort.  Exit.

Glost. Grace goe with you sir.  Alarum and retreat.

Edg.  Away old man, giue me thy hand, away,

King Lear hath lost, he and his daughter taine,

Give me thy hand, come on.

Glost. No farther sir, a man may rot euen here.

Edg.  What in ill thoughts againe men must indure,

Their going hence, euen as their coming hither,

Ripeness is all come on.

Let me provide just a bit of historical context. Before Shakespeare tackled the
story of King Lear, it had been told many times on stage, in poetry, and in
mythic history. In every previous versions, the armies that are led by Cordelia
triumph in the battle that comes to pass in this scene. Because the story is
nowadays so familiar, it's hard for us to imagine exactly how surprised and
shocked early audiences would have been at the battle's outcome. Doubtless
they would be entirely confident that Lear will succeed. Even today, anyone
reading or hearing the scene's first lines would reasonably assume that the
armies of justice will conquer and that the long British nightmare will finally
end. Shakespeare deliberately raises such hopes only to dash them. Edgar's
first sentence lulls us into false security. "Pray that the right may thrive"
is plainly a signal to the audience that everything is going to come out just
fine. There's an even stronger "foreshadowing" of success in Edgar's definitive
announcement that "if ever I return to you again, I'll bring you comfort."
Sly old Will has set a grand trap. And it's not just the plain import of the
sentences; it's the warm and cozy vocabulary: "host," "pray," "right," "thrive,"
"comfort," "grace." It's all light and clarity and optimism. But King Lear is
a play, as the audience well knows, in which "the worst is not/ So long as we
can say 'This is the worst'"  There's no bottom to this play's misery. And so
Edgar, briefly absent, returns to the stage with the blunt, four-word message
that is an arrow to every sentient heart: "King Lear hath lost." And onto this
mountain of grief Shakespeare piles even worse news: that Lear and his innocent,
loving daughter have been "taine" -- ta'en, taken, or as we would say, captured.
In the first moments of the scene the audience might be comforted that Lear
is in the charge of his daughter and Gloucester in that of his son, and that
young and sensible people have finally come to the aid of the old fools. But
good things do not last -- not in this play. The forces of evil that King Lear
unleashes are far from exhausted. They will continue to ruin lives and blight
hopes right to the end.

It's Shakespeare's usual practice to lead his audience to anticipate one thing,
but to give them another; this scene, like many such, is carefully constructed
to overturn easy expectations. It seems impossible but it's true that in
these eleven lines Shakespeare has embedded a second reversal that is equally
momentous as the first.

Here we are at last, at the very end of the play; the audience has every reason
to believe that it will be gratified with a big, climactic, flashy battle. It's
always been the way. But once again, expectations are defeated and the audience
gets both less and more than it anticipated. Instead of lances and swords and
duels to the death -- he allows us simply some offstage clatter. Why?  Before
he wrote King Lear, Shakespeare had staged many such battles. But he wasn't
a film director with an unlimited budget and with all sorts of technological
resources at hand; all he had at his disposal was a sunlit stage thirty-four
feet wide and a handful of supernumeraries. Not nearly enough. Shakespeare
adepts will be well aware that the playwright had already expressed, some half
a dozen years before, his great frustration with the limitations of his martial
scenes. In Henry V, the Chorus, speaking for the author, had apologized for
inadequate representations of warfare: "our scene must to the battle fly,/ Where
- O for pity- we shall much disgrace/ With four or five most vile and ragged
foils/ Right ill-disposed in brawl ridiculous/ The name of Agincourt." In King
Lear, Shakespeare shocked his audience with the outcome of the battle, but he
shocked them even more, if possible, by not giving them the battle at all. King
Lear is too serious, too desperate, too sad for yet another ridiculous brawl.
Nor did Shakespeare take the other easy option -- the long narrative of the sort
with which messengers had been regaling audiences from the days of Aeschylus.
Instead, Shakespeare offers his audience a profoundly revolutionary experience:
noise, followed by four monosyllables. "King Lear hath lost."  Could any artist
be more economical -- or more devastating.

These eleven lines therefore constitute an entire tragedy in little. Hope,
followed by loss and despair -- succeeded by a moderately uplifting moral.
Hearing the horrid news, Gloucester once again falls into suicidal thoughts.
"No further, sir.  A man may rot even here." The defeated old man is weary
of the world and anxious to leave it behind. But Edgar will have none of his
despair. "What, in ill thoughts again?" he says.  (The word "ill" is stronger
in Elizabethan English than it is now; it's closer in meaning to our "evil.")
"Men must endure/ Their going hence, even as their coming hither."  Shakespeare
doesn't say, "You must endure." It's the more general, "men must endure"; not
the individual, but the species. We're on this planet and we're human and the
world may be, as Chaucer says, "a thoroughfare of woe" and we're born in pain
and we die in pain, but it's our burden and our obligation to endure, to hold
on. It's not exactly an optimistic statement, but it's realistic, and stoic,
and appropriate to the context, and it's wise. And then Edgar/Shakespeare adds
a further expression of condensed and gnomic wisdom: "ripeness is all." 
"Ripeness is all" -- to expand the metaphor -- signifies that we human beings
can't opt out, can't surrender until the cycle of life draws to its natural
close. We, or men, or humanity, must continue the struggle to the last breath.
Shakespeare doesn't say, if you commit suicide, you're going to go to hell. He
doesn't, at this point in the magnificent eleven lines, threaten Gloucester with
eternal damnation. Instead, he exhorts him to persist, to endure, to live life
to the bitter end. And when Edgar says to Gloucester, "Come on," and father and
son leave the stage hand-in-hand, we appreciate and admire, even in the midst of
all the horror, the perennial human virtues of endurance and loyalty and love.

Title: World's Largest Ball of Twine
Date: June 10, 2007

Today In Cawker City, Kansas, we made a pilgrimage to the world's largest ball
of twine. It's enormous: 40 feet in circumference and 14,000 pounds (when last
measured and weighed in 1986). And still growing. We were offered some twine to
add our bit, but declined. It would be desecration -- like adding a stone to the
great Pyramid at Giza or to Stonehenge. Instead, we paid silent homage.

We didn't stop to see the world's largest prairie dog in Oakley. Or the Russell
Stover birthplace in Alton. Nor even the Evel Knievel Museum in Topeka. Can't do
everything.

And yet there are these pseudo-sophisticates who say that there's no culture in
Kansas.

Title: Travels with Dorcas
Date: June 14, 2007

We've named our GPS navigatrix,  who gives instruction with a schoolmarmish
London accent, Dorcas (which is, along with Prunella, one of my very favorite
English given -- or as they call them,"Christian"-- names).  Dorcas has proved
to be, on the whole, a reliable friend. She had a little trouble in Cincinnati,
where, it turns out, there are two entirely distinct 225 Hill Terrace addresses.
She took us to the wrong one -- but I confess that in this case the error can
fairly be traced to information-inputter, Dr. M. himself.

Dorcas also had a royal hissy fit when we had to detour onto a single-lane-on-
the-other-side-of the-road somewhere in Ohio -- she "recalculated" twenty or
thirty times, until I had to temporarily stop her mouth.   It could only be my
imagination, but I thought I detected a trace of exasperation in her tone of
voice.

Despite these failings, the Dorcster is a dream at finding her way around
unfamiliar towns. No longer will I have to stop at gas stations for
incomprehensible advice about how to get back on the highway.  I just call on
Dorcas and I've got a friend, oh yeah, I've got a friend.

Title: Rodent Wars
Date: July 02, 2007

The house was unoccupied for a month and the mice moved in, bigtime. I peanut-
buttered some mouse traps and caught five or six adults. But I'm not finished
with the mice; there's some compelling evidence that an occasional mouse is
still attempting to share my food. Meanwhile, the lawn and garden are dotted
with mole-holes. The moles are harder to deal with than mice, but they stay
outside, so they're less offensive. In the compost pile, chipmunks are at work,
but I don't begrudge them their scraps of vegetables. I'm more worried about the
groundhogs, who can strip a flourishing garden in an evening. I've patrolled the
places in which they've installed themselves in the past, and, so far, there are
no signs that they've returned. One of these years, though -- the garden is a
tempting target. But the big news is the beavers. When we arrived, two weeks ago
Friday, the pond was up a good eighteen inches. It was also stagnant and there
was a huge heap of mud and sticks where the water should have been flowing out
rapidly. I tore out some of the material and produced a little Niagara  -- 
a couple of acre-feet of water leaving us in a hour. But by Saturday morning
the dam had been re-built and the water was up again. I got out the shovel and
hoe and totally dismantled the dam. I must have sent several hundred pounds of
mud and a big pile of twigs and branches downstream. Sunday morning I made my
inspection: no repairs. This meant one of two things: either the beavers had
moved on, or they don't work Sundays. But it's now two weeks, and they haven't
returned, so I'm declaring victory in the rodent wars.

This morning I found some suspicious stuff that looks like bat-droppings in one
of the shed rooms. Are bats rodents?

The north American beaver, Castor canadensis, is a formidable creature -- males
characteristically weigh 60 pounds and a big one can reach a hundred. But the
extinct local beaver was 5 to 6 times larger --bear size. It's a good thing I
didn't have to use shovel and hoe on the dam of one of those babies. I wouldn't
want to get on the bad side of a four hundred pound rodent --even if it were a
vegetarian.

July 5.  Sarah (see comments below) asks:  what's the problem with beavers.
Well, they render the pond unusable, for one. No more grandchildren peacefully
paddling. Because they create a new dike which water flows through, not over,
algae, twigs, and scum of all sorts accumulates, rots, and sinks to the
bottom.  The size of the pond expands very rapidly as the beavers move to
create a suitably large habitat -- so the fields become flooded.  The beavers
cut down all the trees that I've been carefully cultivating.  In a few months,
the land will be totally transformed.

I'm hoping that the beavers find a new home on someone else's land. I didn't
want to trap or kill them, but I'm certainly happy that I was able to discourage
them from taking up permanent residence.

Title: My Life in Periodicals
Date: July 02, 2007

When I was seven or eight years old, I was given a subscription (by whom?)
to a children's magazine (which one?) Was it my older brother who said,
"you still reading that magazine for babies?" Always susceptible to public
criticism, I soon lost interest in the publication. Since then, I've subscribed
and unsubscribed to dozens of periodicals. Here are some that I remember.
In my teens, Mad Magazine, of which I was a serious enthusiast, and had
been since Mad's Harvey Kurtzman comic book days. Also, Sport Magazine -- a
precursor of SI. And various pulp sci fi mags -- Astounding Science Fiction and
Galaxy Science Fiction and probably others that came and went. In the '60s,
political magazines: The Reporter, The Nation, and before it went totally wrong,
The New Republic. A decade later, Local Population Studies, The Journal of
Interdisciplinary History, The Psychohistorical Review, The History of Childhood
Quarterly. When I became serious about Shakespeare, I was an assiduous collector
of the Shakespeare Quarterly and the Shakespeare Newsletter and Shakespeare
Research and Opportunities and the Shakespeare on Film Newsletter. Closely
related: English Literary Renaissance and the George Herbert Journal (of which I
at one time owned every issue). In the '70s or '80s, Organic Gardening (sample
title -- "How We Grew Papayas on our Vermont Hillside Using Organic Methods and
Faith in God"); later, Fine Gardening (sample title: "How We Converted a Defunct
Brewery into an Extremely Expensive Bed-and-Breakfast Complete with a Replica
of an 18th-century Capability Brown Landscape"). At various times: Scientific
American, Science News, Bluebirds Across Vermont, the newsletter of the Southern
Vermont Dairy Goat Association, One Two Three Four (a magazine briefly in
existence that concerned itself with the early history of rock and roll), the
Atlantic, The Skeptical inquirer. Newspapers: The New York Times, United Opinion
(nowadays the Journal-Opinion), Behind the Times, the Daily Camera. Nowadays: 
Harvard Magazine, New Yorker, New York Review of Books, Northern Forests.

I'm sure there must be many others that I can no longer recall.

Title: Good News for the Directionally Impaired
Date: July 09, 2007

I've been indoctrinated by our uncomprehending society to regard my geographical
dyslexia, or my directional disability, or whatever it's to be called, as a
shameful condition. So it's good to know that DD can be otherwise valued.

I've been informed by one of my readers that the Pilipino word ligaw has two
meanings: a) courtship, and b) totally lost. As a result, the adjective ligawan
can refer either to a person who has no sense of direction, or to someone
who is especially attractive to suitors. It stands to reason that a person
who has absolutely no awareness of direction (right or left, east or west)
whatsoever and is constantly buffaloed and flabbergasted by the well-meaning
instructions of friends and would-be guides must be extremely radiant, perhaps
even charismatically magnetic.

I find this new information to be both highly probable and extremely consoling.

Moreover, my admiration for Pilipino language and culture and good sense has
skyrocketed.

I therefore propose that the term "geographical dyslexia" be replaced by
"ligawan."

From this moment on, there's a new order to the universe: to be hopelessly
dysgeographical, hopelessly lost is now, officially, sexy.

Title: Summers at Sears Rosebush
Date: July 19, 2007

I worked for Sears, Roebuck and Company at its warehouse on Utica Avenue during
the summers of 1957, 1958 and 1959. The job lasted for ten or twelve weeks
each year and I was paid $1.25 an hour for the first two summers and then was
catapulted to $1.30 for the third. At 40 hours a week, I could, in theory, earn
$50 a week and take home $40, but Sears managed to calculate it so that I had
worked 39 hours or 38.5 hours. Always less than forty. I was routinely baffled
and disappointed by my pay envelope. I'm utterly convinced that the time clock
was rigged, but there was no one to whom to protest, and if I had made a fuss, I
wouldn't have won my case anyway. No one did. (It might seem frivolous to worry
about a few cents, but cents mattered a lot more in the 50s than they do now.
Ten weeks at $40 amounts to $400. When I entered Cornell in 1956, tuition cost
$450 a semester and a half of a double room in the dorm for the year was $315.
At college, I survived on chocolate malts ($.25), hamburgers ($.25), and an
occasional celebratory cheeseburger ($.30).)

At the Sears warehouse, my job was to pinch hit for people who were absent for
their annual two-week vacations. I performed a variety of services of which I
have clear memories of just two. I was a substitute "receiver" on the loading
dock where I kept records of railroad cars and tried to minimize "dunnage." A
second job: I operated the manual telephone switchboard, inserting jacks into
receptacles in order to complete a connection; it's stunning to remember that
such equipment, now seen in old black-and-white movies and found only in museums
of early technology, was still in wide use. I can't remember my other jobs,
except that each one took about two hours to learn, was interesting for a day,
but stupefyingly boring for the remainder of the two-week stint. I developed
real sympathy for the people who were Sears lifers. What a test of will to
come to work every day, year in and year out, to the tedious rote dehumanizing
employment that the warehouse provided! Job satisfaction? I doubt that anyone,
employee or employer, had stumbled upon such a concept, let alone given it an
instant's thought.

The warehouse stocked "big-ticket" items: washing machines, dryers, and reefers
(refrigerators). Day one: sales orders were sorted and routed; day two: goods
were pulled and lined up on the dock in the reverse of the order in which they
would be delivered; day three: items were loaded onto trucks and sent out to
various Brooklyn neighborhoods. The system worked well but there were always
crises when a particular model in a particular color wasn't available. It might
be impossible for this generation of youth to believe, but in those pre-civil
rights years Sears didn't sell refrigerators at a fixed rate. Salesmen (at
the main store on Flatbush Avenue) received 11% of the negotiated price on an
item and therefore had an incentive to set the figure as high as possible.
It quickly became evident to me that there was a pattern: the poorer the
neighborhood, the higher the sale price. Moreover, 99% of big-ticket items
were purchased on time. The obvious corollary: the poorer the neighborhood,
the higher the negotiated rate of interest. Prices and interest were most
outrageous in Bedford- Stuyvesant, at that time -- and perhaps now -- Brooklyn's
Harlem. Occasionally I'd see a repossessed used model (no cardboard carton)
on the loading dock. It was to be delivered as if new to Bed-Stuy. When I
questioned the practice, I was told, very definitively, "Who's going to believe
them?" Working for Sears was, in a word that had not yet come into existence,
"radicalizing."

The warehouse was a Staszewski-Sullivan stronghold. No Italians, no Jews, no
"Negroes." Well, actually, there was one African-American, but he was assigned
to a broom rather than to a forklift. I didn't make any friends at the warehouse
(I was chronically, disablingly shy), and although I was fearful that I might
be ostracized as a "college kid," I was treated not unkindly. I suspect that my
paltry wage made me an object of pity.

An embarrassing moment: Sears held a sale on cheap, shiny suits. They sold so
many that I was called to the main store to help fold and pack. Even today I'm a
hopelessly inadequate folder and packer. It was a nightmare. After watching me
fumble for a few moments, the wives would snatch the suit impatiently from my
hands. "Here, sonny, let me do that."

A good moment: I was on the ROR desk for a week or so. ROR stood for "record
of return." When a refrigerator or washer came back, Sears didn't reimburse
the purchase price until the ROR had been cleared. One day, bored, trying
to kill some time, I was searching the desk to which I had been temporarily
assigned. Stuck behind a drawer I found a misplaced three-or-four-year-old ROR,
unprocessed. I called the telephone number on the ticket and asked the woman who
answered if she'd ever been reimbursed for the refrigerator she had returned --
$350 or so. There was a long silence. Then the woman broke into tears and into
fervent thanks. "I've been trying to get my money back from Sears for years.
I've tried everything. I can't get anyone to believe me." I arranged to have the
money sent to her and I felt that I had done a good deed. Not much satisfaction
for three summers of employment, but something.

The principal result of doing my time at Sears: a decision to give a wide
berth to the much revered "corporate sector." It's a decision that I've never
regretted, not for a moment.

Title: Equines and Ovines
Date: July 21, 2007

There are now five horses and about twenty-five sheep pastured on our fields.
The horses are Morgans; they're handsome and dignified. They have mucho gravitas
and very distinct personalities.  I'm proud to say that we're friends; the
horses make a point to trot over and say hello when I'm working nearby. They
have big brains (or, at least, room for big brains) and they seem to want to
communicate. I sweeten our intimacy with windfall apples. My relationship with
the sheep is less satisfactory. Frankly, we're not on the same wavelength. Today
I was cutting some brush (mostly beaked hazelnut and red maple) on the other
side of the pond right against the sheep fence. Because I know that sheep take
a gourmet interest in leaves of any sort (although we keep them away from lilac
and wilted cherry), I carried a stack of branches out into the field. The sheep
were interested but wary. Finally, one of the lambs (Braveheart, let's call him)
sidled up to the pile and pulled on a leaf -- at which point the whole stack
moved an inch or two. The entire flock started and immediately skedaddled back
home.

The sheep are Scottish Blackfaces. My neighbor Ed, who owns them, claims that
Scottish Blackfaces are the smartest of all ovines. Talk about damning-with-
extra-faint-praise. Here's how utterly brilliant sheep can be. There are two
gates right next to each other to a second pasture. One of the gates is for
the horses and one is for the sheep. The sheep gate is nothing more than a few
boards tacked together to make a space 4 feet high and 4 feet wide -- just large
enough so that the sheep can slip through but the horses can't. The gate for the
horses must be 12 or 14 feet across. It's metal and it rests on a hefty pair of
hinges. Sometimes it's left open to allow the horses access to the field. But
even when it's wide open, the sheep don't use it. Instead, they line up single
file at their own little gate and wait their turn. Not a one of them, even
Braveheart, has the sense to look around and notice that the main thoroughfare
is available to anyone who wants to show a little initiative.

The horses are organized. Gillian, who's a twenty-something-year old mare, is
the boss. Gabe, an ex-boy, is at the bottom. In between, the two young chestnut
mares and a newly gelded bay struggle for status. In social terms, the sheep
are a horse of another color. If there's a system to the society of sheep, I've
not been able to discern it. It's all random Brownian movement. I asked Ed,
who knows his sheep and has kept them for many years, if he'd ever been able
to discover the structure of ovine social life. "Near as I can figure out,"
he answered, "one of them gets it in his head to go somewhere, and the rest
follow."

Horses are noble; sheep are amusing but duller than Charles B., who was twice
left back in first grade in P. S. 217, and duller also than my long-time
colleague Joel S.

Whose idea was it, do you think, to placate the gods by sacrificing sheep? 
Were our ancestors trying to pull the wool over their deities' eyes?  Were they
being deliberately disrespectful?  What sort of offering is a sheep?

"Here, sir god, I'll kill you a sheep. It's enough. What would you want with a
horse?"

Title: Christopher Marlowe's Shoes
Date: August 11, 2007

At age seventeen, awash in hormones, I took a serious shine to the sensuous
words with which, in Marlowe's play, Faustus addresses Helen of Troy.

Oh, thou art fairer than the evening airClad in the beauty of a thousand
stars;Brighter art thou than flaming JupiterWhen he appeared to hapless
Semele;More lovely than the monarch of the skyIn wanton Arethusa's azured arms.

Just a bit more polished and glorious than what I myself could devise in the way
of compliment, the outer limit of which was "you're looking kinda nice."

No wonder I was impressed. Marlowe was, and still is, a young person's poet.
Ageless because he was murdered at age 29, he was flamboyant, unsubtle, and
hyperbolic beyond any ordinary hyperbole. And above all, musical. "Wanton
Arethusa's azured arms?" "Azured" only because the unusual adjective jauntily
reinforces the timbre of  "Arethusa."  In actual fact, even the most alluring
of female arms aren't blue --unless they are bruised, which Marlowe surely
did not mean to imply). "Wanton?"  In the story, Arethusa was chaste and
preserved herself from the approach not of the monarch of the skies, but of the
minor river-god Alpheus. Marlowe could trample on visual accuracy and learned
tradition. But who could grudge him when the outcome was sonic delight. Nor did
it seem to matter that Helen was compared not to a female goddess (many were
available) but to Jove himself. And so I toted Tucker Brooke's old-spelling
edition of Marlowe's works to my 1950s summer job, hoping and pretending that
the poet's escapist rhythms could put a little shine into the grim warehouse
where I earned my pittance.

I've just read a new biography of Christopher Marlowe. It's Park Honan's
Christopher Marlowe, Poet and Spy (Oxford, 2005). It's a good but not great
book. It's a revelation how much new information has come to light in the last
fifty years  -- not so much about Marlowe himself as about his co-workers in
the espionage business. Honan attends to Marlowe's plays, but he's clearly more
interested in spying and in the Elizabethan political milieu. He repeatedly
employs such formulas as "Marlowe could not help think... or "Marlowe must have
felt..." in order to lace public events to the poet's putative consciousness.
It's a doubtful procedure, but I suppose justified by the paucity of direct
biographical evidence. Honan is diligent in accumulating information but his
writing is careless and his interpretation of the plays hardly more than
slapdash.

It's no secret that Christopher Marlowe, son of a mere shoemaker, wrote
obsessively about men of lowly origin who achieve greatness. Faustus was (in
Marlowe's version only) "base of stock," Gaveston a commoner who attends a
king, and most notably Tamburlaine a simple shepherd who sets his foot on a
large slice of the Asian steppe. Honan thinks that Marlowe was ashamed of his
father's trade, and adduces as evidence the fact that the playwright "never
uses words such as shoe, shoemaker, or sole but distances himself from his
father's concerns. At the various times when he refers to leather, or boots,
the allusions are oddly repulsive: 'Covetousness: begotten of an old churl in a
leather bag,' 'a worm eaten leathern targets,' 'As if he had meant to clean my
boots with his lips,' 'our boots which lie foul upon our hands.'"  Such lines,
according to Honan, "suggest hatred" of the cobbler's work.

Perhaps, but not the whole story. In Tamburlaine, when the Scythian shepherd
woos Zenocrate, his seduction technique is to pile gifts at her feet. "A hundred
Tartars shall attend on thee/ Mounted on steeds, swifter than Pegasus./  Thy
garments shall be made of Medean silk,/ Enchast with precious jewels of mine
own./ With milk-white harts upon an ivory sled,/ Thou shalt be drawn amidst
the frozen pools,/ And scale the icy mountains lofty tops." And on, and on --
Marlowe, bless his enthusiastic heart, was never embarrassed by excess. No shoes
in the royal dowry?  But wait. There's also Marlowe's best known poem, the
"passionate shepherd to his love." The Arcadian shepherd, following at the heels
of the Scythian, also offers a long list of gifts to his beloved.

I will make thee beds of roses

And a thousand fragrant posies,

A cap of flowers, and a kirtle

Embroidered all with leaves of myrtle.

A gown made of the finest wool

Which from our pretty lambs we pull,

Fair linèd slippers for the cold,

With buckles of the purest gold.

"Fair-lined slippers for the cold,/ With buckles of the purest gold!!"   Not
your ordinary, trudging-around-Canterbury-in-the-mud shoes, but footwear
nevertheless. When he wrote these lines, "Marlowe could not help think" --
to use the formula of biographers -- that he had celebrated and ennobled his
father's profession.

Or so I like to think. Although John Marlowe probably did very little business
in the gold-buckle line.

It's public knowledge that Bush recently underwent a colonoscopy, but the

the entire head of Attorney-General Alberto Gonzales. Until this discovery, it

Title: The Absence of the Elms
Date: August 16, 2007

When we arrived here, in the summer of 1968, there were so many huge old dying
elms that we jokingly referred to the place as "Dead Elm Farm." One by one
every single elm succumbed to the virus. Bare and leafless, they dropped their
branches and then stood as barkless pillars until rot or a windstorm toppled
them. For many years there were young elms around, but as soon as they grew to
twenty or so feet, the disease would take hold. There are still a few adolescent
elm skeletons, but they're harder and harder to find.

We have some slippery elms and an occasional water elm, but the good old
American elm, a prominent feature of our landscape for several hundred million
years down to this present moment, is virtually extinct.

Am I a member of the last generation on earth to marvel at the majesty of these
great trees?  Sure the landscape is still rich -- maples, oaks, birches both
white and yellow, beeches, spruce, pine, fir, hemlock, the big-toothed aspen,
a cottonwood or two, cedars and our most plentiful wetlands inhabitant, the
deciduous conifer variously called the hackmatack or tamarack or larch (in
taxonomists' parlance, the larchy larch, larix laricina).  But I grieve for the
elms. Their absence makes a space in my mental landscape.

I don't, of course, long for the American chestnut, which was gone for fifty
years when I came on the stage. Just as my descendants won't notice the absence
of the elms.

Not far from the house an old elm has coppiced in an awkward place, and it needs
to be removed. It's ugly -- twenty or so stems ten or twelve feet high racing
for the sun. It should go. But I imagine that I'll leave the best of the shoots
and hope that it will thrive. It would be almost criminal to saw down the last
lonely elm. There's always the one-in-a-million chance that this unhandsome
specimen will prove to be virus-immune. Wouldn't that be something?

Title: A Exceedingly Weird Dream
Date: August 22, 2007

Aficionados of this blague know that I'm directionally disabled. I don't think
that I've admitted that I suffer from frequent nightmares in which I'm totally
lost in a strange city or building.

Last night I experienced another such dysgeographical dream. I was trying to
walk north in some unidentifiable but mysterious city. A large building, which
seemed to me to be a junior high school, blocked my path. I decided to cut
through the building and continue on my way. I traversed various confusing
corridors and staircases until I was satisfied that I was about to exit the
correct door (one of many). But I couldn't get out because there were wires
(which looked like electric fencing for animals) strung across the doorway. I
attempted door after door and each one was wired -- chicken wire, barbed wire,
all sorts of stuff. I started to panic, as I often do in such dreams.

At last I decided to force my way through one of the doors. I tangled myself
in various wires which had somehow metamorphosed into thick chains. The chains
rattled loudly and I said to myself that someone would hear them  --  it was
as though I was back in school and had gotten myself into deep trouble with the
principal. And sure enough, along came a guy who seemed to be either a janitor
or a detective. He was speaking rapid Spanish and I couldn't understand him.
Although I begged him, he would not untangle me. I cried out, "I'm  tired of
this basura (basura is the word for garbage in Spanish, which happens to be
a language I've never studied and don't know). I shouted, "With basura, with
basura."  And then I thought, wow, the phrase "with basura" could be used as
the basis of a parody of Ezra Pound's Canto XLV, "With Usura:" ("With usura
hath no man a house of good stone/ each block cut smooth and well fitting/ that
delight might cover their face" etc. etc.)   A person could substitute the
word "basura" for the similar sounding "usura" and make good fun of Uncle Ez's
economic theories -- theories which are in fact nothing more than a great big
load of reactionary pseudo-medieval poppy-and-lily trash. Inspired, I decided to
wake up and get to work on the poem, but I wasn't alert more than a few seconds
before I came to the realization that the great world is probably not exactly
aching for a parody of Pound's Canto XLV.  Even an exceedinglyl clever parody.

destroying the phlox. Also the roses, the blueberries, the plums, the hollyhocks
(tender new leaves only), the day lilies, and most particularly, the precious
new apple trees. They've weakened the Wealthy, noshed the Norland and bonsaied
the Baldwin. My friends and neighbors suggest various remedies. Eight-foot high
fences is the consensus -- although occasionally, allowed a running start, the
deer are able to leap even these. But do I want an unsightly eight-foot fence
around my garden and orchard? Let's consider some other wisdome of the ffolke.

Should I buy human hair from the local barber and hang bags of it around the
orchard? I don't think so -- far too voodooish for a post-Enlightenment gardener
such as myself. I could douse the grounds in coyote urine, though I'm not sure
that I want to milk a coyote -- or, a fortiori, a mountain lion. I know one
kind of urine that doesn't repel deer  -- at least when anecdotally applied.
Some folk, more determined than I could ever be, soak rags in human urine and
ring the garden with them, but I suspect that I would not savor either the
administration or the aesthetic repercussions of this method. A strong solution
of garlic might work, but it's deer I want to repel, not vampires. A spray of
peppermint seems like a more pleasant choice, but apparently it must be renewed
after every rainfall, which is highly impractical in our moisture-abundant
climate. A recipe of a slightly beaten egg mixed with a gallon of water is
claimed to be effective, but must be applied nightly -- too much cookery for me.
Some people claim that moth balls repel deer, but the same people claimed that
moth balls would repel raccoons. My raccoons took the moth balls for marbles and
made a game of them and of me. Decaying fish heads would no doubt repel deer,
but they'd also repel bees, birds, friends, and family. Even if I could procure
them ("I'll have a couple of pounds of decaying fish heads, please"), do I
really want to sit, contemplative, in a garden of such stinkiness?

Besides, I don't believe in these superstitions. I want data. I want double-
blind experiments. I want science.

My sister, who lives in prime white-tail country, hangs bars of Ivory soap in
her apple trees. It works, she says. Not credible, not scientific, say I. But
last week we visited her, and there they were, a half-dozen or so thriving young
apple trees. Not a nibble on a one of them. New growth allowed to be new growth.

Hers are New Hampshire deer. I bet that our Vermont deer will sniff the soap,
chortle, and proceed to bathe face and hoofs. We'll soon have the cleanest deer
in all creation.

In desperation, I've joined the ranks of the credulous. I've threaded Ivory soap
with baling twin and hung a cake on each of the young apples. White rectangular
scarecrows. But for the first time all summer, I'm seeing new growth. This could
work.

One of my neighbors says, "No, no, don't use Ivory soap -- use Irish Spring."

Title: Why I Hate Machines
Date: September 05, 2007

So I've been trying, by god, to figure out why the riding mower has been cutting
on an angle, the right side leaving the grass higher than the left, and I've
been crawling under the machine looking at the cutting deck from all angles
and not able to understand the mechanism except it's obvious that it's not
parallel to the ground, and my neighbor Ed was by and he's kind of a genius with
machinery which I most definitely am not, and I said to him, Ed would you take
look and see why the mower is cutting at an angle and he said, Well, here's one
problem your left rear tire is flat which made me feel really dumb because I
was so busy trying to understand the suspension system on the deck that I never
even looked at the tire and I said, Flat, how can it be flat, I never run it
anywhere but over the grass and he said, Well, look right there it's got a thorn
in it, A thorn, I said, how can a thorn penetrate a Carlyle Super Tuff tire, and
he said, Oh yeah they do that, but I can fix it, I'm busy today but I'll do it
tomorrow I have a system you just push through what looks like knitting needle
with sticky stuff on the end and pull it out, it will seal it right up, it's a
tubeless tire isn't it? and I said Yes it is, and if you could fix it tomorrow
that would be great, well next day he took the tire and tried it his way but he
couldn't get it to hold air so he says Take it down to PTOs and they'll patch
it from the inside, so I put it in the trunk of the car and drove to town and
they fixed it and then I put it back on the axle, it has three small washers
and one large washer and one of those spring nuts and I started the engine but
by god the mower wouldn't move and I thought what the heck is going on here, I
put everything back exactly as it came off and it was running just fine when
I took it off so what could I possibly be doing wrong, I took the wheel off
and put it on again and I still couldn't figure it out so I got in the car and
drove over to Ed's, he was cutting wood but he stopped and I said, Ed, what's
wrong with that lamb, why do you have him penned up all by himself and he said,
you know how the lambs are always butting heads and pushing each other around,
well I went out in the field and he was down, couldn't move a bit, so I took
him home and I don't know whether his brains are addled or he's really hurt,
I thought we'd better have him slaughtered but you can see he's doing better,
getting up and eating so we'll hold off a day, and I said maybe he has a bad
back like me, and he said, No, he's too young for a bad back, so I said, Well,
maybe he has vertigo like you, which is not all that funny because Ed lost a
week to vertigo last June, and he kind of laughed and said, Well, is your mower
working now, and I said, Not exactly, the engine's fine and the belt turns but
it's not moving frontwards or backwards and he said, How can that be, I'll come
over and take a look so later that day he came by and sure enough it wouldn't
move, so we took off the wheel again and studied it but I certainly couldn't
figure it out and he couldn't either, everything looked good and perfect, we
puzzled over it for a while and then he called the John Deere dealer in North
Haverhill and the technician said maybe you lost the key when you took off the
wheel and Ed said, O yes of course, we must have lost the key, I didn't think of
that, and I said What the heck is the key and he said Well, in a lot of these
machines the axle is broached which means there's a slot in it and a slot in the
wheel and you have to have a key which is just a small piece of metal otherwise
the axle will spin but the wheel won't rotate, so we looked all around for the
lost key but couldn't find it and then Ed said, Look at your tire they didn't
even mount it right, it's out of round, you'd better bring it back in and while
you're there check if the key is in the shop somewhere, it might have stuck in
the wheel because of the grease, so I took the wheel and put it in the trunk and
drove back to PTOs and showed him that the tire was out of round, the owner was
embarrassed about the bad job he had done and wouldn't even look me in the eye
but he re-mounted the tire and when he finished I said, By the way, you didn't
happen to find the key I lost it, and he said I'll look inside but he couldn't
find it, so he said I'll make you another one which was nice of him though the
key is only at most a 50 cent piece but it saved me from having to go to Napa
Auto Parts or drive 30 minutes to North Haverhill to the John Deere dealer,
so he made the part it took him only a couple of minutes, he had the stock he
just had to cut and file a two inch piece, I brought it home and I put the key
in the slot and put the wheel on, I had to use a board for a lever to get the
rear of the mower up in the air and it was tricky because I held the board with
my right hand and the wheel in the left but I managed alright and then I got
on the tractor and started the engine and everything worked perfectly except
that the tractor still wouldn't go either forward or backward, I took the wheel
off and put it on again, but it still wouldn't work, so I walked over to Ed's
and I said, Ed, I can't for the life of me figure it out, I got the key and it
fit just perfectly but the machine still doesn't move, and he said It's got to
work, it makes perfect sense, I said, Hey look, your lamb looks a lot better
but why did you put a hog panel across your driveway, he said It's because of
the dog, he's been getting out, tomorrow he's going to be snipped and that will
quiet him down a bit, which is a good idea because the dog is far too friendly
even to me and I don't particularly like the dog, he's a beagle mix, not as bad
as their other dog which was a rescue dog a bulldog, very ugly in my opinion,
which also got out and trotted over to the pottery down the road where he was 
seen running off with the Murrays' Silkie in his mouth, a Silkie is a fancy
chicken, they charged Ed a hundred and sixty dollars for vet bills and mental
anguish, the chicken died anyway, so Ed got out his rifle and shot the bulldog
and then dug a hole four feet deep, he said that all the way down it was nothing
but powder, it's been that dry the last few weeks, anyway Ed came by again and
we tried the machine and it wouldn't go forward or backward and I was about to
surrender and load up the damn thing and take it back to the dealer when we
lifted both back wheels off the ground and suddenly the axle which hadn't been
turning even though the belt had been turning started to spin, it must have been
something about the gears that didn't mesh properly anyway we put the wheel back
on again and I started it up and by god it ran as good as ever but I had wasted
a whole day fussing with the mower just because it had picked up a goddamn thorn
probably blackberry which is in brief why I hate machines

Title: Cuisine de Minnesota
Date: September 14, 2007

The Ranch Restaurant (family-owned, not a chain) in Rochester, Minnesota offered
a splendid salad bar. In addition to the conventional fare (greens, onions,
tomatoes, peppers, etc.), there were some items that were distinctly regional:
herring in wine sauce, baked beans, cherry jello topped with whipped cream,
chocolate pudding and also Watergate Salad.

Watergate Salad, new to me I must confess, is a melange of pistachio pie
filling, mini-marshmallows, canned pineapple chunks (with syrup), pecans, and
Cool-Whip. Here's a question for those who are expert in Minnesotan fine dining:
is your Watergate Salad best eaten with or without herring?

Our waiter at The Ranch, asked whether the tomato soup was prepared with cream,
replied, "It's a tomato biscuit with peas and stuff in it." He was slightly off
the mark: lots of stuff in the bisque but alas no peas.

Title: Wild Turkeys in My  Garden
Date: September 16, 2007

Even a decade ago, wild turkeys were an utmost rarity, and the sight of one in
the distance caused everyone to stop and peer. But each succeeding year, there
are more and more of them. They're everywhere -- on the roads, in the fields,
even under the apple trees, gorging themselves. Last week, a hen and a dozen
poults walked bold as brass right up onto our front lawn, ten feet from the
deck.  Didn't even bother to hasten away -- took their own sweet time wandering
off.

I don't believe that turkeys were native to Vermont, but it's well known
that since the reintroduction, they've expanded well beyond their former
range. They're adaptable and wily creatures.

The domestic turkey is legendarily stupid. Its brains have waned as its breasts
have waxed. The wild turkey, on the other hand, is smart, though given to
occasional lapses. Sometimes the hen leads her brood through the woven wire
fences. She knows the route, but one or two of the poults will find themselves
barricaded from the flock. They set up a wail. The flock comes to a nervous
halt. After a while, the spectator -- me -- can't endure the tension. I slowly
head over to see what I can do, trying not to alarm the lost fowl -- whereupon
the poults suddenly remember that they know how to fly. Unlike their domestic
cousins, they're strong fliers. They clear the fences with ease.

I now understand a few words of Turkeyish. The male gobble: "I am very large and
handsome; come mate with me."  The poult peep: "I'm lost.  Where is everyone."
The hen cluck: "Come along with me." The double cluck: "Everyone fly into the
trees."

Here's what worries me. Every year there are more and more turkeys. Even the
hunters can't keep up with the population explosion. Will the turkeys turn into
a rural version of pigeon? Overrun our gardens and fields?

Where are the fisher-cats, the foxes, the coyotes, the hawks?  Get to work,
guys. While turkeys are not exactly sitting ducks, they're still very tasty.

Title: Tolstoi's Moth
Date: September 24, 2007

A third of the way through Anna Karenina -- the finest novel in this or any
other universe -- Anna's deceived husband Karenin reluctantly brings himself to
consult with a famous divorce lawyer.

The lawyer was short, stocky, and bald, with a dark, reddish beard, long light
eyebrows, and a bulging forehead.  He was dressed like a bridegroom, from his
cravat and double watch chain to his patent leather boots.  He had a clever,
rustic face, but his clothes were dandified and in poor taste....  Won't you
sit down?"  He indicated an armchair beside a writing desk covered with papers,
and sat down himself behind the desk, rubbing together his little hands with
their short fingers overgrown with fair hairs, and leaning his head over to one
side.

The lawyer's "clever rustic face" is the tipoff that he's of peasant origin
and probably only a generation or two away from scythe and flail. With his
pretentious get-up and his bulging forehead and his stubby hirsute fingers, he
is repulsive, even brutish. O, the indignity of it all -- an aristocrat like
Karenin having to seek help from such a pretentious upstart!

And there's worse. The lawyer is not only a social-climber; he's also a ruthless
opportunist.

He had just settled into this pose when a moth flew over the table:  with a
rapidity it would have been impossible to expect, the lawyer unlocked his hands,
caught the moth, and again assumed his previous posture.

I would not want to assert that Karenin is precisely a moth. Nevertheless,
Tolstoi certainly suggests that, given half a chance, the lawyer would not
hesitate to strip his client's wings. It's clear that the awkward relations
between the lawyer (whom Tolstoi never even bothers to name) and Karenin are
governed by centuries of master-serf antagonism and by the prospect of revenge.

Tolstoi quickly brings this episode to a close and never brings the lawyer back
on stage. But he lets him exit exultantly.

He bowed deferentially, showing his client out the door. But once he was alone,
he abandoned himself to his glee.

Our lawyer now decides that it is time to give up moth-catching.  Instead,

he had definitely made up his mind to have his furniture reupholstered in plush
the following winter, like Sigonin's.

The dog-eat-dog lawyer is convinced that he can transform Karenin's distress
into hard cash. The fees, which he savors prematurely, will allow him to catch
up with his rival.

The world of Anna Karenina is both tough and unsentimental -- and revealed with
great economy by its accomplished creator. It's a long novel, but packed with
significance, every rift loaded with rich shining ore.  olstoi takes on all the
great perennial and nineteenth-century issues -- class, wealth, family, labor,
spirituality, city and country, science, women's rights, royalty and democracy,
agricultural reform, bureaucracy, sexuality, etc. -- but he still manages to
extract significance even from the lowly, Czarist moth.

It had been thirty years since I re-read Anna Karenina. Now I've resolved to
make it at least a biennial event. It's too astonishing a novel to let lie
fallow.

Title: No Words, No Words?  Hush.
Date: September 27, 2007

A few nights ago, I attended a performance by our local treasure, the ever-
glorious Takacs Quartet. Without asking my leave, they chose to play works
by Aarvo Part and Philip Glass. I suppose that there must be virtues to
"minimalist" music, but a single motif played over and over again in the same
tempo, with the same unvarying dynamics, and in the same non-key -- what's the
point? Music without melody, harmony, or rhythm is like a novel without a plot
or like a severely abstract painting. Sorry folks, I'm antediluvian. A relic. I
want a story and I want it dressed in rhyme and meter. It's exhilaration that I
crave, not forty-five long minutes of total ripvanwinkleization.

I was already in a sulky mood at the intermission when Mr. and Mrs. Talkative
behind me, after gushing over the minimalists, directed their intellects toward
Shakespeare. Mrs T. announced, "You don't need to read a Shakespeare play before
seeing it. Just read a plot summary so that you know what's happening." Mr. T.
agreed:  "Absolutely. Going to the theater is all about the costumes and the
set and the business. As long as you have a general idea of the story, you don't
need to understand the words."

No need to understand Shakespeare's words?  Go to the theater and ignore the
words of the finest poet in human history?  What are the Talkatives thinking? 
The costumes are the work of the costumer; the business is the work of the
director and the stage designer. The only part of the performance that is
Shakespeare's is the language.

One of the teachers of my youth, the late and much lamented Alfred Harbage  --
the finest Shakespeare scholar of his generation -- used to say that he didn't
care what the actors did on stage as long as he could hear the words.  I'm not
nearly so tolerant. I don't want Rosiland and Orlando to send email messages to
each other -- I want them to articulate. I don't want Cinna and Metullus Cimber
to be dressed as blackshirt fascist thugs. And I certainly don't want Snug and
Bottom to ride to the Duke's Oak on motorcycles. Such antics are stupid and
distracting.

The performance for which I'd pay a premium price is one at the Theatre, or
at the old Globe, or at the Blackfriars during the years when Shakespeare was
teaching the parts to Burbage and Hemmings and Kemp. Dollars to doughnuts he
insisted that the actors pronounce the words distinctly.

After the grating intermission, the Talkatives ran out of insights and my
indignation began to wane. Eventually Ed, Andras, Karoly and Gerry returned to
the stage and played one of Haydn's great Opus 76 quartets. It was transcendent
-- melodic, intelligent and intelligible, warm, robust and sensuous. It was
music.

Title: A Scene from my Youth
Date: September 30, 2007

This Here is a photograph of Coney Island Avenue, the grim commercial
thoroughfare along which I crept to school unwillingly like snail between the
years 1944 and 1952. The unknown photographer who left us this record stood at
the corner of Newkirk Avenue, just in front of the P. S. 217 schoolyard, and
pointed his camera north toward Ditmas Avenue. It's the east side of the street;
on the west side stood a used-car lot and a gas station, where, if the view were
more panoramic, signs reading "Veedol" and "Mechanic on Duty" would have been
visible.

It takes only a few seconds of detective work to date the photograph. In the
center is the marquee of the Leader Theater, which advertises the 1947 release
It Happened in Brooklyn, a soldier-returns-home musical with Frank Sinatra,
Kathryn Grayson, Peter Lawford, and especially Jimmy Durante, who was clearly
the neighborhood favorite.  The second feature, Undercover Maisie, a policier
with Ann Sothern and Barry Nelson, was released in the same year. (The double
bill was standard -- and at 14 cents for kids and a quarter for adults, a darn
good value). It's early autumn not only because the ivy and, in the distance,
a Norway maple are still in full leaf, but because the Casa del Rey advertises
High Holy Day services (the orthodox congregation's synagogue on 18th Avenue
had not yet been constructed). I would guess that the large traffic sign that
dominates the frame has something to do with the fact that the old trolley
tracks had recently been removed. The shops near the Leader are too small to
identify, but I remember Singer's drug store, Safier's candy store, a shoe
repair place, a small liquor store owned by P. V. Melia, and Joe Montuori's
barber shop.  At the moment the camera snapped, I was eight years old, in Mrs.
Sherwood's third grade class at P. S. 217.

The architecture is hodge-podge -- the featureless apartment house and shops,
the vaguely deco Leader, and then, closer to the camera, the what-the-heck-is-
it-doing-there Moorish Casa del Rey (for weddings and other gatherings;  I
passed it thousands of times but never once entered).

The man at the right of the frame, jingling his car keys in the pocket of his
voluminous slacks, stares at the camera unenthusiastically.

It's a dreary picture, I'm afraid. Gray. A nondescript street in a nondescript
neighborhood.

I'm trying, but I just can't seem to work up the requisite nostalgia for the old
country.

Title: Jane Austen Nude
Date: October 10, 2007

Today's posting is contributed by the art historian, Alan Saxe-Popette.

Jane Austen's quiet private life has been thoroughly explored for events of
emotional import. It is therefore a wonder that there has been such inattention
to the portrait, identified some forty years ago,in which the novelist,
nude, reclines on a green baize fainting couch. One would have supposed
that writers of fiction and especially film directors would have seized on
the opportunities that the portrait presents, especially since the only other
surviving representation of Jane Austen is her sister Cassandra's amateurish,
unflattering, and essentially asexual sketch. The Austen nude has faded
inexplicably from view. Older readers of this blague will surely remember the
mid-1960s flurry of journalistic interest, some of it nasty and anti-feminist
-- a cover story in Time ("Did Jane Disrobe") as well as the scandalmongering
reportage of Huntley and Brinkley.  But just like the revelations concerning
Wordsworth's French mistress and like the notoriety that greeted Edith Wharton's
pornographic short story Beatrice Palmato, the brouhaha over the Austen nude
quickly evaporated.

The portrait itself, a full-length study in chalk and colored pencils, resides
in the Carl H. Pforzheimer Collection of Shelley and his Circle, which is
housed in Room 319 of the New York Public Library, and  may be viewed upon
request. Perhaps it is unfortunate that the first account of the Austen nude
appeared in the pages of the Keats-Shelley Journal, a publication sponsored
by the Pforzheimer.  More scholarly attention might have been paid if the
identification of the portrait had been announced in a journal of larger
circulation, such as Nineteenth-Century Fiction or Romantic Studies.

The late R. W. Chapman, who knew more about Jane Austen than any scholar of his
generation, resisted the idea that the portrait was genuine. His attack on its
authenticity, published as an appendix to the revised edition of the Complete
Works of Jane Austen, is scathing, but is rather a reflection of Chapman's
Victorian prejudices than of the facts. Chapman was a traditionalist who
believed that young females, even brilliant female novelists, should be, above
all, decorous. His Jane Austen was a bulwark of conservative and hierarchical
values and he would certainly not have recognized the modern revisionist
conception that situates the novelist in an uneasy alliance with transgression
and subversion. In private, moreover, Chapman was notoriously prudish. He is
reported to have confessed to his great friend Kathleen Tillotson (herself a
well-known scholar of English fiction) that "I just don't want to go to my grave
thinking that I've looked upon dear Miss Austen's pubic hair."

In the 1960s, there was considerable resistance to the authenticity of the
portrait, perhaps because, compared to Cassandra's prim drawing, the new
rendering revealed a young woman in full beauty and bloom. Jane retains the
familiar apple cheeks and the dark hair, but her eyes are knowing and forthright
rather than subdued, and her long, glossy and loose black locks, secured only by
a single cherry-colored ribbon, appear as they were described by Jane Austen's
grand-niece, who recalled her aunt having "large dark eyes and a brilliant
complexion, and long long black hair down to her knees." Opinions will of course
vary, but many will find that in this portrait, Jane looks somewhat Italian
or Gypsy or perhaps even Levantine. Her expression is eager, her waist slim,
her legs short but shapely, and her breasts, despite their surprisingly large
aureoles, magnificent.

Misgivings about the portrait's authenticity survived even until the 1970s. But
then it was established that the chamber in which Austen posed was the drawing
room at Steventon that she shared with Cassandra. There's a useful description
in Constance Hill's Jane Austen, Her Homes and Friends (1902). Hill, it is well
known, had access to the Lefroy family papers. The Lefroys were important
connections of the Austens. It was James Lefroy who wooed Jane and then
inexplicably broke off his relationship with her and retired to Ireland. Jane's
brother James Austen's daughter married a Lefroy; Jane's grand-niece Anna
Lefroy, the child of this union, left a remembrance of her great-aunt's sitting
room. "I remember," wrote Anna, "the common looking carpet with its chocolate
ground that covered the floor, and some portions of furniture. A pointed press,
with shelves above for books, that stood with its back on the wall next the
Bedroom, & opposite the fireplace; my Aunt Jane's Pianoforte -- & above all, on
a table between the windows, above which hung a looking glass, 2 tonbridge-ware
work boxes of oval shape, fitted up with ivory barrels containing reels for
silk, yard measures, etc." In the portrait, these two same oval Tunbridge work-
boxes appear just to the left and behind Jane Austen's head; the keyboard of
"Aunt Jane's Pianoforte" is in part visible to the right; the oval cheval-glass
is exactly as Anna described it. Moreover, the ingenious young art historian
Oksana Sartry, who, using powerful magnifiers, was able to identify the books
in the press, discovered not only Richardson's Sir Charles Grandison and Robert
Bage's Hermsprong, both novels known to have been much studied by Austen, but
also a folio with the words "Volume the Second" inscribed on its spine. "Volume
the Second" was the name that the novelist gave her manuscript collection of
early works (which included the unfinished novel, The Watsons). With this
confirmatory evidence, skepticism was at last dispelled. Austen's remark to
her sister Cassandra (reporting on a day spent with James Lefroy), "imagine to
yourself everything most profligate and shocking" took on new meaning.  And
what did Jane mean when she wrote to her sister, "here I am once more in this
Scene of Dissipation & vice, and I begin already to find my Morals corrupted."

What was the exact occasion for the portrait and why was it found among the
Lefroy papers? There are two views. The first is that Jane sent it to James
Lefroy as part of the courtship process: "here's what you get if you marry
me." This explanation is certainly possible, but the greater likelihood is that
it was a "revenge" portrait: "here's what you have scorned."

That the drawing has sexual content is undeniable, but it is absurd to think,
as some have suggested, that Jane Austen would allow herself to be depicted in
a post-orgasmic state. It is true that Jane's skin is rosy and flushed and
that her plump nipples are erect, but the placement of her hand just above
the tendrils of abundant black hair is traditional and would not seem to
indicate that she had pleasured herself. Those who argue that Jane had recently
masturbated seem, frankly, to have surrendered to prurience. I myself, after the
very closest scrutiny, can discover no evidence whatsoever of what one writer
has called "a clitoral cleft in arousal." Jane Austen was bold, but she would
never, ever, have exceeded the bounds of modesty.

Title: Robert Bage's Hermsprong (1796)
Date: October 13, 2007

Back in the early '60s, when I was just beginning to learn about literature,
I enrolled in a course on the eighteenth-century English novel. I diligently
worked my way through an ambitious syllabus. There were more than twenty novels,
some of them monumental in size, like Clarissa and Tristram Shandy;  and others
blessedly brief, like Goldsmith's Vicar of Wakefield and Mackenzie's Man of
Feeling. Diligent lad that I was, I read every single word, every syllable.
In addition to the required reading, there was also an extensive register of
recommended works. On this intimidating list was Robert Bage's Hermsprong,
which, forty-five years after the fact, I've at last read. Better very very late
than never at all.

It's a good book -- not a masterpiece, but very fine, very enjoyable. The plot
is  unoriginal. An heiress falls for a fortune-hunter, elopes to the continent,
but is rescued just before the threatened deflowering; a domineering wicked
old guy forces his unwilling daughter into marriage with an idiot aristocrat;
a man of mysterious origin turns out to be the estate's true heir -- that sort
of thing. But other elements are less cliched. Charles Hermsprong, raised among
Indians on the banks of the "Powtomack," is a plain-spoken 'merican radical;
Maria Fluart is as witty and defiant and independent as Benedick's Beatrice --
sometimes it seems as though her lines could have been composed by Oscar Wilde
himself. Maria is by far the most vibrant character in the novel. If Bage were
as advanced a thinker as he sometimes pretends to be, he would have let his hero
marry her.It's disappointing that Hermsprong falls for a conventional dutiful
young simperer, while Maria, too strong for any man in the novel, is left on the
putative shelf.

Here's a passage that jumps out at the reader. It's from a description of two of
the novel's minor characters:

"But the tender interest they had in each other was torn asunder by pride and
prejudice, and this pride and prejudice, she feared...."

Whoa, daddy!  Jane Austen's novel was originally named "First Impressions" and
only borrowed its familiar title from Bage late in the game. It is obvious that
right there on Jane's bookshelf, next to Sir Charles Grandison and Tom Jones and
the novels of Frances Burney, was a copy of Hermsprong, which Ms. Austen (unlike
your dilatory '60s student) was smart enough to read in a timely manner.

Title: More on Religion and the Rockies
Date: October 18, 2007

I'm trying to remember the name of the superstitious 1940s Dodger pitcher, who,
when the inning ended, would flip his mitt into the first base coaching box,
then walk over and reposition it so that the fingers pointed directly toward the
mound.  (I'd better stop here and remind the young folks that in days of yore,
players left their gloves out on the field when they came in for their turn at
bat. I can't remember exactly when the Commissioner prohibited this harmless,
colorful custom -- was it in the late 50s?)

Baseball players have always been notably superstitious. They don't step on foul
lines or talk about no-hitters in progress.  They wear the same underwear or
socks for the length of a winning streak.  Turk Wendell had to brush his teeth
and chew licorice between innings.  Wade "Chicken Man" Boggs, a good enough
hitter not to solicit divine intercession, had to eat a meal of chicken before
every game.  Craig Biggio refused to wipe the dirt or the pine tar off his
helmet for an entire season.  Baseball is where the Curse of the Bambino and
the Curse of the Billy-Goat are items of faith. It's also where players wear
gold crosses in their ears and ostentatious floppy crucifixes around their necks
and point triumphantly to the sky when they bloop a single to center.

Chewing licorice and making the sign of the cross are equally effective
procedures, as far as I can tell.  The only difference is that one is a private
superstition while the other has the sanction of religion.  It's individual
delusion versus mass delusion.

At this writing, the biblethumpatudinous Colorado Rockies, baseball's most
Christian-y organization -- the only team with a chaplain on its payroll -- have
won twenty-one of twenty-two games and will (after an eight-day timeout) head
for their first-ever Series.  It's astounding and wonderful, and I'm rooting
for the home town boys.  But my enthusiasm is tempered because fanatics are
already calling it "a miracle," or "destiny," or claiming that "it's meant to
be."  Baseball's a gritty, subtle game, and the Rocks are winning because
they're playing excellent defense, getting timely hits, making great pitches
at the crucial moments, and committing very few mental errors -- not because
of their prayer circle or their morning bible study or because the Great
Signifier in the Sky has decided that this year, the Rockies are kosher and the
Diamondbacks are treyf.

But, say the superstitious, it's unlikely that any team could take twenty-one of
twenty-two.  Of course it's unlikely.  But if statistics tells us anything,
they tell us that even unlikely events will occur some of the time.

Here's what's genuinely unlikely:  that the Rockies' shortstop, Troy
Tulowitski, who (if there's any justice under the heavens) will be soon named
rookie of the year, has a "Christian" name that is an acronym for The Rookie
Of Year. What, pray tell, are the odds?  And also, that the Rockies' have a
catcher, Yorvit Torrealba, whose name is an anagram for "real toy vibrator." 
Such an extraordinary unlikelihood has never happened before and it's never
going to happen again, and it's entirely more remarkable than any winning
streak, however extended.  Yorvit Torrealba is one of those gosh-darned
superstitious sky- pointers.  It would suit my Manichean view of the world
if Yorvit would also point downward, toward Sheol or Gehenna or whatever is
supposed to be down there, every time he futilely chases a high fast ball, which
he does far too frequently.

I would also like to point out that the Rockies have a reliever named LaTroy
Hawkins, whose name would also anagrammatize into "real toy vibrator" if he
would simply rechristen himself LaTroy Riverboat.  Coincidence?  Or destiny.

Go Rockies!

Title: Real Live Dialogue
Date: October 28, 2007

First the exchange, exacty as it occured in real life, and then the gloss.

The cashier: "Breakfast of Champions?"

Me: "Well, I'm a vegetarian."

The cashier: "Yeah, I know, all organic."

So here's the story. We were driving across the western, uninhabited part
of South Dakota, heading toward the glorious Black Hills and the Badlands.
Somewhere out there, I stopped for gas. It was about 9:00 or 9:30 in the
morning.

As a general rule, I don't drink coffee or other caffeinated liquids, but when
I'm driving long distances, I keep a Coca-Cola by my side on the conservative
principle that whatever damage the caffeine might do to my eccentric heart,
it will be probably be a lot less dangerous than falling asleep, crashing the
car, and mangling myself and my passengers. Moreover, I'm not a consumer of
candy bars, but the day before, somewhere in Minnesota, A. had treated herself
to a package of M &Ms.  I had wheedled a handful or so from her and I had
decided to make good her loss.  So when we stopped to refill the gas tank in
Somewhere, South Dakota, I purchased, at one of those roadside convenience
stores, a 12 oz bottle of Coke and a small plastic bag of multicolored chocolate
candies, and the friendly, tough, old lady who kept the register looked at
me aslant and said, affectionately, questioningly but also with a touch of
scorn, "Breakfast of Champions." I was feeling defensive and while I could
have responded by explaining that I don't usually eat junky stuff, and that it
wasn't even my breakfast, I didn't feel that I needed to apologize, so I went
the other route and capitulated: "Well, I'm a vegetarian." Which made the lady
smile a bit, as I had hoped, and made me feel as though we were on the same
mock-serious wavelength.  It was a moment of deep communication, far superior
to the commonplace vacant salesperson/customer/middle-of-nowhere encounter.
Feeling a kindred spirit, the lady went along with the game and both assimilated
and expanded on my gambit, saying, "Yeah, I know, all organic' --an expression
that was in part friendly but which also carried a little bite, as if she
detected that I was from some tofu/granola city (which, in fact, is true, even
though I myself am an old-fashioned cheeseburger --as opposed to veggieburger --
kind of guy). Altogether, it was one of the more satisfying conversations I've
had in the last while. A moment of deep and profound understanding, the kind of
intimate communication that we all strive for all day, every day, even out there
on a two-lane in one of the "flyover" states.

Title: My First Earthquake
Date: October 31, 2007

Here we are again in Alameda, California.  Last night, just after 8 pm, we were
lying in bed reading (me: Conrad's The Secret Agent;  she, Roth's Exit, Ghost)
and recuperating from the grandchildren's pre-Hallowe'en hysteria, when I said
to A., "Would you please stop shaking the bed."  She, of course, replied, "I'm
not moving," and I joked, "Then it must be an earthquake."  And, much to my
surprise, so it was.  Five point six on the Richter scale, just twenty miles
south of here, five miles underground, along the Calaveras fault.  There's
the possibility of another one, but so far, nothing that we've been able to
discern.  Astonishing to say, but just a few hours ago, the sure and firm-set
earth was feverous and did shake -- which put me in mind of the fragility of our
earthly being and also made me recall some other natural phenomena that I've
witnessed.

All that I can remember of the famous 1945 hurricane was watching at the window
while my father, out in the storm, tried vainly to secure his precious peach
tree, which was being shredded to oblivion by the fierce winds.  I have a vivid
recollection of the great blizzard of 1947, because after the storm subsided,
snow was piled so high on both sides of the sidewalks that, for a small boy, it
was like walking though a canyon -- and great fun to clamber up the mountainous
heaps.  I was a young witness to a sudden squall on Long Island Sound that
sank, if I remember correctly, hundreds of pleasure boats.  Even more serious
was the Connecticut River flood of 1972, which washed out the culverts on our
road, tumbled downstream some hefty boulders, and isolated us for a couple of
days.  Throughout the summer, there were memorable mud stains thirty feet in
the air on the trees that grew in the river valley.  Once in the 1980s, driving
across the country just after the Mississippi had overflowed its banks, we
observed standing water many miles from where water had any business to be. 
We were at Mt. St. Helen's a year after the mountain blew its top, but signs of
the devastation -- bald patches, toppled trees -- were still writ large on the
landscape.  Same with the Black Tiger fire;  we missed the fire but couldn't
ignore the extensive blackening.  In Hawaii once, we walked along hardened lava
flows for a couple of miles to find a standpoint to observe magma, fresh from
the earth's interior, fall steaming into the ocean to create new land.  In
Costa Rica, we visited a dormant volcano -- monumental even in its sleepiness.

Not many such events, but a sufficient number to produce respect for the natural
processes.  No tsunamis or crackings of the ice shelf.  And nothing, thank
goodness, comparable to the explosion of Tambura on the island of Sumbawa that
caused the summer without sun and a crisis of subsistence in parts of Europe
and North America. And certainly nothing whatsoever like the meteor that landed
70 million years ago in the Yucatan, after which the fossil record becomes
a blank for a thousand years and every creature larger than a pussycat went
extinct.  Yesterday's trembling was a good reminder that our mother earth
is a lot more fragile than she appears to be on your average warm, pleasant,
quakeless evening.

Title: Joseph Conrad's The Secret Agent (1907)
Date: November 02, 2007

It sometimes happens that you meet a perfectly decent, intelligent person with
whom you cannot conduct a satisfactory conversation.  He doesn't know when
you're serious or when you're being ironic, doesn't get your jokes, misses your
allusions and references, challenges your assumptions, and repeatedly asks,
"What exactly do you mean?"  You and he are just not on the same wavelength. 
There's no empathy, no meeting of minds.

Joseph Conrad and I have been locked into such an unprofitable relationship
for these last fifty years (although, to be fair, the novelist himself is less
engaged in the standoff than I).  In the 1960s, I embarked on a Conrad tour
and, as is my custom, began at the beginning, reading the first six or so
novels, from Almayer's Folly through Typhoon.  It was hard labor, not love. 
The much- celebrated romantic ornamented prose style settled like thick mist
over my hebetudinous faculties, so much so that I frequently lost track of
the plot, failed to differentiate the characters, felt myself strangled by
the metaphors and boggled by the syntax.  Befogged, miasmafied.  Even the
stories that I dutifully re-read, such as Heart of Darkness, required effort and
discipline.

Hungry for books, last summer, I was browsing the second-hand book shelves.
There aren't many respectable options at the bodice-ripper-rich Bookshelf in
Bradford, Vermont.  Conrad's The Secret Agent seemed like a good choice,
especially since I could dimly recall that in the 1950s, the great mid-century
Khan of English Literature, F. R. Leavis, had placed this particular novel way
up high in the literary firmament.  For $3.50, I decided, what the heck, I'll
try Conrad again.

I felt my way through the Conradian fog for a few chapters, set the book aside
for a couple of weeks, then started once again.  On the second or third try I
finally succeeded and, for the first time in my life, connected to Conrad with
ease and full comprehension.  Here's the key:  The Secret Agent is written in
that familiar grave portentous style, but it's a funny, satirical leg-puller. 
A bunch of incompetents, playing at being anarchists and communists, screw
up their lives and the lives of everyone around them.  The Secret Agent is
a spy novel, a police procedural, a political novel, and a comedy all rolled
into one.  While was stuck thinking, late Dostoevsky, I made no progress,
but when I came to the realization, not Dostoevsky but Coen brothers, the
elements immediately fell into place.  Moreover, The Secret Agent is a novel
not just for the pre-World War I moment, but for this present decade.  It's
extraordinarily keen and insightful about the banality of terrorism.

Now I feel that I can tackle those other Conrad novels that have lain in
wait for me all these years.  Stay tuned, fit audience but few, for further
reports.  Joe C. and I may yet become great friends.

Title: John Galt's Annals of the Parish (1821)
Date: November 08, 2007

Annals of the Parish is another book that I've waited far too long to read. 
Purporting to be the reminiscences of Mr Micah Balwhidder, minister of
Dalmailing in Ayreshire, Scotland between the years 1760 and 1810, it's the
most charming and friendly novel that I've encountered in many a day.  The
industrial revolution, with all its good and evil, has found its way to rural
Scotland. In Balwhidder's succinct retrospective summation:  "there was at home
a great augmentation of prosperity and everything had thriven in a surprising
manner;  somewhat, however, to the detriment of our country simplicity." 
 The "country simplicity" seems more than half medieval;  the "augmentation
of prosperity" brings with it such benefits as literacy, London newspapers,
commerce, regular transportation to Glasgow, a cotton mill (not a dark Satanic
one, but a place where a decent livelihood may be earned) but also such debits
as bankruptcies, American and continental wars, and social fissuring.  Annals
of the Parish traces the end of world we have lost and the inception of the
world in which we now dwell.  Galt is good solid Age of Reason optimist, but he
knows enough to mourn the very changes that he appreciates.

The novel is written in Scots;  it's not particularly difficult to understand,
but sometimes Galt lays it on with a trowel.  Mr. Balwhidder tries to persuade
the church elders to repair his "manse":  "I made a report of the infirmities
both of doors and windows, as well as of the rotten state of the floors, which
were constantly in want of cobbling.  Over and above all, I told them of
the sarking of the roof, which was a frush as a puddock stool."  "Frush"
means scratched or crushed;  a "puddock stool" is a toadstool or mushroom. 
My unabridged dictionary does not have an entry for "sarking," but it's not
difficult to guess that a sarking roof is not in perfect repair. The rich
dialect, reported with affection and without condescension, intensifies the
regional flavor.

Galt's Dalmailing was in state of constant flux, while the various villages
of Galt's great contemporary, Jane Austen, are, in social terms, static and
immobile.  Who was more the observant novelist?

Title: Words of Wisdom
Date: November 19, 2007

"Skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it is," said the Great One,
famously.  There you have it: perfect advice for hockey players.  It goes
without saying that Gretsky's sentence applies equally well to entrepreneurs,
intellectuals, artists, and in fact, to anyone who has to cope with a world
in continual flux. Ah, but how can anyone know where the puck is going to be
next second, or next week, or a decade hence?  Gretzky was one of those rare
intuitive geniuses who did it all by instinct.  Ordinary mortals must wrack
their tiny brains until their heads hurt to guess at the trajectory of their own
particular puck.  Most of us, no matter how hard we try, are doomed to skate
counter.  There are other people (alas, I'm one of them) who skate aimlessly,
only dimly aware that somewhere out there on the field of play is a target
puck.  Gretzky's wisdom deserves a prominent spot on the refrigerator of every
moderately forward-looking, ambitious human being, where it can hang as both
goad and frustration.

Here's another brilliant bit of Gretskyiana:  "You miss 100% of the shots you
don't take."

Let us now turn to wisdom from Alan Sillitoe (young 'uns might not remember
Sillitoe, but he was one of the important 'angry' English writers of the
1950s).  Sillitoe blessed us with the forceful and epigrammatic truth that
"all writing is fiction, especially non-fiction."  I particularly savor that
uncompromising, zingy "especially."  If I understand rightly, Sillitoe meant
that a) no matter how faithful to experience a writer wishes to be, the act of
writing inevitably emphasizes or omits or compresses or expands and therefore
transforms experience into a story, a fiction.  And he also implied that b)
no matter how factual the information, if it doesn't tell a story and act as
a fiction it's not going to make its point.   Moreover, and more subtly, he
meant that c) any story is ineluctably influenced and shaped by common modes of
storytelling, and even against a writer's will assimilates itself to existing
genres.  Bloggers, for example, are willy-nilly fictioneers who can't help
writing bloglike posts.  But beware:  Alan Sillitoe most definitely did not
mean to imply that because all narratives are culturally and artistically
determined that they are therefore equivalent in value or truth;  he was a
practiced, practical writer, not some post-modern theory-soaked obscurantist.

Here's wisdom from the great Anatole Broyard.   Of his adolescence, he wrote,
memorably, "if it hadn't been for books, we'd have been entirely at the mercy of
sex."  "Mercy" is the well-chosen word that makes the sentence so piquant. 
Books, says Broyard, have the power to civilize all of us, even pubescents. 
Books can, and did, rescue him.  As for myself, if I remember accurately,
adolescence was, in spite of extra-large doses of books, merciless.

I don't know who first said that "you can't coach seven feet," but it's a common
enough saying.  It doesn't mean that that you can't coach a seven-footer,
but that no matter how much instruction you offer a guy who's five-ten, he's
never going to be seven feet tall or fill the space on the floor that requires
a seven-footer.  As I once heard a track coach remark, "I can teach them
everything but speed."  A similar sentence, of baseball pitchers: "you have
to be born with the whip."  For those of us who tried to teach less exotic
subjects, I can offer some parallels from my own experience.  "You can't coach
brains";  "you can't coach talent."

But you can do something.  You can, in words of great uncommon wisdom, "play
the hand you're dealt."

Title: Foolish Prudery;  Empson
Date: November 26, 2007

It's easy to forget that our immediate forebears were absurdly prudish. Consider
the case of William Empson, who ran afoul of the sex police in the late 1920s.

Empson may be the most influential literary critic of the previous century.
All "close reading" was pioneered by him. Seven Types of Ambiguity, written
when Empson was twenty-one years old and published in 1930, was the book
with which my teachers were still wrestling well into the 1950s. Prompted
by their puzzlement and by their enthusiasm, I dutifully read all about
"ambiguity" and I also tried my best with the equally influential Some Versions
of Pastoral (1935). In all frankness, both books were far too subtle for my
blunt, unphilosophical brain. In 1961, when I was a graduate student, the
pious and reactionary Douglas Bush, whose course in Milton was thrice-weekly
transporting me to the caves of Morpheus, dismissed Empson's ground-breaking
Milton's God (1961) as the work of the "village atheist."  (Empson thought
that Christianity was a cruel and savage religion because it was grounded
in scapegoating; he demonstrated that Paradise Lost became muddy and opaque
when Milton struggled with the ethical basis of core Christian doctrines. In
later years, the literary leviathanette Stanley Fish made his reputation by
domesticating, diluting, and popularizing Empson's challenging ideas.)

Although I had lived with Empson's work since mid-century, I had absolutely no
knowledge of the author's troubled private life until I read John Haffenden's
William Empson, Among the Mandarins (Oxford, 2005) which at 695 pages is the
first of a projected two-volume biography. (It's far too detailed; let me
confess to skipping and skimming.)

As a student at Magdalen College, Cambridge, Empson was mostly homosexual. 
Haffenden says that he was interested in "male bliss and buggery." The upper-
class students with whom Empson interacted were gay-tolerant and the authorities
practiced a de facto "don't ask-don't tell" policy.  In 1929, Empson was
elected to the prestigious Charles Kingsley Bye-Fellowship, which paid the
then-splendid sum of 150 pounds annually. By that time, Empson had turned
his attention to the other gender and was conducting an affair with a woman
named Elizabeth Wiskemann who was seven years his senior. Somehow or other, a
porter, an employee of the College, "found that Empson had some contraceptives
in his possession." It was a scandal and Empson was arraigned by the college
authorities for "sexual misconduct." He was stripped of his fellowship,
expelled, his name expunged from the college records, and he was even banished
from the city of Cambridge (by what authority Haffenden doesn't make clear).

For using contraceptives! For sexual relations with a woman! For preventing
pregnancy! Clearly, Empson should have stuck to boys or kept clear of condoms.

Let us remember the situation of William Empson whenever conservative
commentators trumpet "family values" and call for a return to the stricter
sexual codes of previous generations. Or when we might be tempted to admire the
wisdom of our ancestors.

Title: Roth's Portnoy's Complaint (1969)
Date: November 29, 2007

Philip Roth has written some wonderful books but this particular job isn't one
of them. Portnoy's Complaint is nothing more than a comedian's shtick -- the
undisciplined efforts of a borscht circuit comic "working blue." Poor Philip
Roth. He set to be the heir of Lenny Bruce but accidentally fathered that
unfortunate by-blow, the egregious Howard Stern, who is Portnoy raised to a
power.

Like many nightclub monologists, Roth doesn't bother to develop rounded
characters but relies entirely on stereotypes. The women in Portnoy are types
reduced to their crudest manifestations: the ignorant Appalachian, the upper-
class twit-ess, the sabra soldier. The worst instance of stereotyping: the
narrator himself, Alexander Portnoy, who embodies every single characteristic of
the stage Jew except avarice and accent. Portnoy -- or parts of it -- would make
a great Catskill routine. But a novel it's not.

Is it possible that Philip Roth and Woody Allen are one and the same person? Or
aspects of the same person. Both start out doing sex-obsessed comic monologues
and both develop into great artists. They employ similar plots and characters
(compare Portnoy's gentile girlfriend Mary Jane Reed of West Virginia, whom the
monologist half-heartedly tries to educate, with Annie Hall of Chippewa Falls,
Wisconsin, advised to attend adult education classes at NYU by Alvy Singer).

In the coming weeks, class, we will look at other Roth/Allen identities and
parallels. They're both satirists and we'll explore the theory that Roth is an
acerbic Juvenal while Allen is a genial Horace.

No doubt that Philip Roth is envious of Woody Allen's more distinct features
and more compact body, but has anyone actually seen the two together?  Or even
a picture of them in the same undoctored frame?  Until they're sighted in the
same room, I'll reserve judgment on whether Roth/Allen is one or two persons.

Title: Interim Report on P. Roth
Date: December 07, 2007

I've now penetrated halfway into the Philip Roth corpus, reading not
chronologically but as the novels become available in our local public library.
At this moment I’ve interrupted my progress to enjoy DBC Pierre’s Booker
Prize novel Vernon God Little, a virgin copy of which I uncovered in a basement
storage box.

Here's my interim report on the works of Philip Milton Roth. No doubt but
that Roth has created a stunningly original and accomplished body of work:
it's witty, inventive, imaginative and unpredictable. So far The Human Stain,
which I read a couple of years ago and plan to re-read soon, is my choice for
masterpiece, but among the Rothgroup are a number of real dazzlers. Not a
single book has been uninteresting (well, of the very early works, Letting Go
was ordinary and Portnoy's Complaint, though notorious, was not serious). But
everything has been engaging, even if only for the coruscating surface. I'm
genuinely impressed. The Roth guy is good.

But, you ask, Is Roth a writer for all time, or is he a writer for this present
moment?  No one can make a fair estimate until the requisite hundred years have
elapsed. Nevertheless, my great pleasure and admiration for his achievement
notwithstanding, I very much doubt the permanent value of Roth's work. My
provisional opinion is that Roth confines himself to too small a slice of
human experience to sit at the table of the greats. The more I read, the
more conscious I become that his engagement with the world is incomplete and
deficient.

At bottom, Roth's subject is domesticity. His major characters, on the whole,
do not track whales or go to war or cure diseases or wrestle with new ideas or
sojourn in the wilderness; instead, they manage relationships with their parents
and with their colleagues and with their mistresses and ladyfriends. It's no
vice for a writer to choose the domestic arena: it's the domain of Jane Austen
and Henry James, among many others. Roth, however, presents us with a severely
circumscribed domesticity -- a partial and skewed view even of his own area of
interest.

Human social life begins with the family from which we derive, but it culminates
in the family that we create. It's a cycle; we’re born, we mature, we marry,
we bring forth children who themselves mature, and then we shuffle off the
stage. Roth understands and engages the first part of life -- the growing out
of childhood into adulthood. In traditional literature, it's the part of life
that, recorded in the novels of a writer less satiric and more comic than Roth,
might end with a wedding feast and the promise of future fertility. But Roth
does not write traditional comedy, and he's inordinately hostile to marriage and
especially to children. He's an acute observer of both the nuclear and extended
families of his west-of-Manhattan Newark-Jewish roots. But when it comes to the
progenitive phase of life, he has little to offer: incomprehension, or less than
incomprehension -- merely vacancy, a hole, a void. There's no sign that Roth
appreciates that to nurture a family of one's own is for most people a profound
part of the human voyage. His characters don't willingly marry, and if they do,
they don't stay married and they certainly don't reproduce. There are no babies,
no boys or girls, no teen-agers in the homes and streets and schools of New
Rothville.

When we (that is, the plurality of human beings) grapple with parenthood, we
inevitably come to some sort of detente with the generation that begot us.
Not only do we learn about life from our sons and daughters, but we find it
immensely satisfying to do so. But in the fifteen or so of Roth’s novels that
I've so far read, I've yet to find the father who loves his own children. It's
as though Roth were deaf and blind to the profounder half of human existence.
Children are not a fulfillment; they are only a burden and an annoyance -- clogs
to Zuckerman's or Kepesh's or Tarnopol's or Roth's freedom. (Readers of Claire
Bloom's memoir of her life with Philip -- Leaving a Doll's House --will clearly
remember Roth's implacable and inexplicable antagonism to Bloom's daughter.) For
many novelists, the non-existence of paternal affection would not be a handicap
to artistic achievement. But Roth writes entirely out of his own experience;
he’s anything but empathic. Roth cannot conceive of the full adulthood that
comes with mature parenthood. So he doesn't know what he can't know -- that his
various alter egos, even as they age, linger in perpetual frozen adolescence.

Unable to imagine the love of children, Roth also lacks the ability to
appreciate or describe a functioning marriage. For Roth and his multiple
avatars, marriages are similar to children in that they are restrictions on
individual freedom.  And therefore Roth's hostility to husbands is corrosive
and aggressive. Husbands are unmanly, emasculated. Real men have lots of women;
those who pretend to enjoy a permanent partnership with one person are either
slaves or eunuchs.

Roth writes obsessively about Jews and Jewishness and Jewish culture but there's
a core Jewish value that he never acknowledges. It's "being a mensch." A mensch
is a mature man who does right by his friends, his associates, and especially
by his family. He meets, and more than meets, his obligations, especially when
it's rough going. He can be relied upon. He enjoys his life, but he would never
put his own satisfactions ahead of his obligations to either his closest kin
or humankind in general. Of such a traditional virtue, Roth's characters know
nothing. In his novels, Roth's various alter egos not only shirk responsibility
and run from trouble, but they judge it virtuous to do so.  In the world
according to Roth, only a schmuck would be a mensch. But perhaps the satirist is
always doomed to be the malcontent outsider. A happy Rothmensch would be no Roth
at all.

Philip Roth is by all odds the greatest novelist of arrested development ever
produced by the state of New Jersey.

Title: More on Contraceptives and Prudery
Date: December 10, 2007

Last week I reported that in 1929 William Empson was expelled and expunged
from Cambridge University for owning a condom, a circumstance that I judged to
be an scandalous instance of ancient prudery. But in thanks to one of those
fascinating moments of cultural convergence, I've just re-read, after almost
fifty years, Philip Roth's Goodbye, Columbus, which also turns on a discovered
contraceptive -- in the latter case, a diaphragm. Readers of the novella will
remember that Roth's Newark alter ago, Neil Klugman, enjoys a summer romance
with rich 'Cliffie Brenda Patimkin and pressures her to obtain a pessary. In due
time the incriminating object is discovered by Brenda's protective, overbearing
mother. Shock and outrage ensues, and the romance founders.

When I read about the Empson-Cambridge contraceptive scandal, I felt as though I
was entering an alien, distant and incomprehensible past. But Goodbye Columbus
appeared in 1959, when I was an undergraduate at Cornell -- and is therefore
very much a part of my conscious lifetime. Nor is Roth inaccurate about 50s
sexual prudery. Contraceptives were difficult to obtain (even for married folk)
and pre-marital sex was still taboo -- though, I must say, a taboo honored
more in the breach than the observance. The old ways were slowly changing. In
1958, I participated in my first political demonstration -- or riot -- when
Cornell authorities tried to prohibit women from visiting men's off-campus
apartments. We staged a late-night moderately out-of-control protest march to
the president's office. It was an all-male event because after 11 pm, women were
confined to their all-female dormitories.(The action is recorded in Richard
Farina's Been Down So Long It Seems Like Up to Me [1966]). It all seems so
positively quaint now -- the university trying to police our sexual life and all
that. Parents nowadays, at least the parents that I know, would be delighted to
learn that their college-age daughters are using contraceptives.

In Goodbye, Columbus, Neil Klugman accuses Brenda of allowing her diaphragm
to be discovered so that she can end the uneasy romance. Neil's argument
seemed rational in 1959, but it no longer does so. From the vantage of 2007,
it's clear that the many Roth alter egos have consistently been able to find
justifications and excuses to end both their affairs and their marriages.
Klugman, and Kepesh, and Zuckerman are never, ever, going to be more than
momentarily and intermittently loyal or satisfied, but on the whole it's going
to be circumstances, not their own volition, which causes them to flee. We
didn't know that then. In 1959, Goodbye, Columbus seemed like a disinterested
clearing of the Victorian air; now it has been transformed into a overture  to
Roth's long and tormented psychosexual opera.

Title: Book Report:  Vernon God Little
Date: December 10, 2007

At  first I found Vernon God Little to be rough going.  The narrative voice
-- a popcultch-saturated south Texas adolescent idiom -- took some getting
used to. The novel is a post-mass-murder burlesque, hilarious in spots, but
not even remotely credible.  Vernon God Little won the Man Booker Prize in
2003, but I wonder whether the novel would be so highly regarded by English
literati if it had portrayed England the way it portrays the U.S -- as a
country where everyone, every single person, is either a pederast, an idiot,
a con-man, a traitor, an opportunist, an incompetent, or just fat, lovelorn,
vicious and vacant. The pseudonymous DBC Pierre, an Australian, seems to have
acquired all his information about the United States from watching trash TV. 
He's written a funny book, because caricature can be very amusing, but I hope
that unwary Europeans and Asians who read Vernon God Little don't think that
they've entered the heart of America, because they sure as hell haven't.
Caveant lectores. I wonder also about the novel's thick impasto of Christian
symbolism.  Vernon lives on Beulah Lane in a town called Martirio; he calls
himself a "skategoat."  Will he die for America's vulgarities?  And are
we supposed to take seriously Vernon's last-minute conversion to faith?  I
couldn't -- in fact, the last- chapter Hollywood ending seemed to me mighty
meretricious.

Title: Some Rituals
Date: December 16, 2007

Shakespeare's audiences were notoriously raucous.  Folks entered and left
during performances, commented loudly on the action and the actors, and ate
oranges and hazelnuts during performances.  (When the Rose Theater was
excavated in 1994, its floor was found to be paved with crushed hazelnut
litter.)  The Rose, the Globe, and the Fortune were noisy, busy, vital places,
far different from today's excessively reverent theaters.  I wish it were
otherwise.  I would be much more interested in live theater if I didn't feel
that I was stepping into a museum or mausoleum.  Why shouldn't we voice our
approval or disapproval?  A vigorous environment did not inhibit gentle Will. 
Nowadays we have more Awe but less Art.

I feel the same about visits to the symphony (but I'm more tolerant, especially
on a Brahms or Beethoven evening).  The ritual of concert-going amuses me: the
various instrumentalists wandering to their places, then the concertmaster, then
at last the maestro, the polite applause, the bowing, etc.  There's an old
story about "the man from Borneo"  -- when Borneo was synonymous with the end
of the earth -- who was taken to the Boston Philharmonic.  After the concert,
the M from B was asked, "Which part of the concert did you like best."  "Before
the man with the stick came on."

Yesterday I went to see our local university basketball team. It wasn't a very
good game and my mind wandered to the elements of the ritual:  first the
warming up, then the teams leave the court, then the Star-Spangled Banner, then
the overexcited introduction of the starters, ("at six five from San Bernadino
California") and of course the blond perky cheerleaders with their theatrical
enthusiasm and familiar tumbling routines.  And the band, playing their hearts
out during the TV timeouts.  It's all so very schematized and overdetermined. 
But exciting nevertheless.

Both the symphony and the basketball game are highly ritualized, but I have to
admit that on the whole, I'm more comfortable at the arena than at the concert
hall.  Especially when I have to cough; nothing more awkward than trying to
suppress a cough during a pianissimo passage -- especially for those of us who
are inordinately sensitive to social censure.

I wish the symphonies could incorporate some of the vitality of basketball.  At
the arena, the members of the band swing their trombones to left and right. 
Why couldn't the violins and violas give us a little of that?  And then we have
the tuba cheer, where the tubists come on court and whirl in rapid circles. 
What an opportunity for cellos and double-basses to show off their skill and add
some visual excitement to the performance.  The cheerleaders regularly climb
each others' shoulders.  Why not the woodwinds?

And the audiences?  They can participate by eating oranges and hazelnuts.  And
shouting approval.  "Go woodwinds!"

Title: Flirting with Incest, Part II
Date: December 20, 2007

Yesterday I considered the near-incest situations of Philip Roth and Woody
Allen.  In Roth's My Life as a Man, Roth's shadow Nathan Zuckerman marries
Lydia Kettering and when she commits suicide he takes up with Monica, who is
Lydia's sixteen-year-old daughter by a previous marriage.  When Lydia turns
twenty-one, Zucerkman proposes marriage but she, wiser than her step-father,
declines.  I do not know whether Zuckerman's borderline incest had a precedent
in Roth's real life.  I do know that Roth's doppelganger Woody Allen eventually
married Soon-yi Farrow Previn and that he has adopted two children with her. 
(The woodman now has five offspring in his complex family, including two adopted
and one created in the downright way with Mia Farrow.  Child-averse Roth seems
to have avoided paternity.)

While reading My Life as a Man I've also been watching movies by Nicholas Ray. 
Last night I saw In a Lonely Place (1950) with Humphrey Bogart and Gloria
Grahame.  I recommend it to all who love film.  It's tough and intelligent,
filled with great dialog, brilliant lighting, excellent music and stylish
direction.  Trust me, It will hold your interest and give you something to
admire.  Gloria Grahame steals the show;  she's just as good and much more
subtle than Humph.

I didn't know anything about Grahame's career and life, so I looked her up on
the standard databases.  Her life was so unusual that I might even try to track
down a biography.

With the Roth/Allen/incest theme on my mind, I discovered these facts about
Gloria Grahame.  In 1948, Grahame married director Nicholas Ray and gave birth
to a son who was named Timothy.  She and Ray were divorced;  in 1960, Gloria
married Anthony Ray, Nicholas Ray's son, and subsequently gave birth to two more
boys, Anthony Jr. and James.   She had biological children by both father and
son and has therefore left incest-flirters Roth and Allen in her dust.  What an
achievement!

Query:  Tim, Anthony Jr, and James are half-brothers -- but are they also uncle
and nephew?   Half-cousins?  Cousins?    I never fully grasped the theory
of relativity.

Title: Roth/Allen Doppelgangerism
Date: December 20, 2007

A few days ago, noting that their careers and obsessions converge in ways
that seem uncanny, I suggested that Philip Roth and Woody Allen were not just
doppelgangers, but might in fact be one and the same person.

I've just now read Roth's 1970 novel My Life as a Man, which must be the most
self-consciously narcissistic "fiction" ever written -- at least since Ben
Jonson’s Fountain of Self-Love four hundred and seven years ago. The novel
is a large helping of Philip Roth, followed by more Philip Roth and with a
dollop of Philip Roth to the side. My Life as a Man purports to be drawn from
the writings of Peter Tarnopol, who is one of the Roth’s many alter egos. The
first part of the novel comprises two short stories by Tarnopol, so-called,
about a character named Nathan Zuckerman (the very Zuckerman destined to evolve
into the most highly developed of Roth’s self-projections -- Roth’s very own
alter-ego- issimus). So here's the design of My Life as a Man: Roth, writing as
Tarnopol, writes about Zuckerman, who is Roth himself. It’s a closed loop, a
totalizing tautology, a pleonasm brought to perfection -- a literary eruv with
nothing inside but Roth hisself.

In the latter part of the novel, the psychoanalyst Abraham Spielvogel amusingly
diagnoses Tarnopol as "one of the top young narcissists in the arts." But
gosh, just because R/T/Z can poke fun at his self-love (sometimes called
autoeroticism) doesn’t mean that the novel becomes less oppressively
claustrophobic.

While reading My Life as a Man, I couldn't help thinking, “does Roth do
anything other than act like Belmondo looking at himself in the mirror? does he
have interests other than Roth?”

Like Roth, Woody Allen appears in his own works as a familiar continuing persona
–- he's always more or less the same guy: bespectacled, nervous, death and sex
obsessed, self-mocking, a deliverer of one-liners -- who may not be Allen but is
certainly constructed of woodyallenian raw materials. Allen’s collected works,
like Roth’s, approximate an autobiography.

It's clear that one element of their doppelgangerism is their almost equivalent
obssession with self.  But there are also more precise parallels.

In "Useful Fictions," which is one of the short stories that comprise the first
part of My Life as a Man, Peter Tarnopol tells the story of Nathan Zuckerman's
disastrous marriage to a woman named Lydia Kettering. (It's a most puzzling
liaison, because Zuckerman dislikes -- actually hates -- Lydia right from
the start. Roth/Tarnopol claims that  exogamous Zuckerman is enthralled or
perhaps even hypnotized by Lydia's difference -– by her distinctly unJewish,
unbourgeois, uneducated, undisciplined personality.  But Zuckerman’s
attraction to her is inadequately explicated; it makes him seem not enigmatic
but dull, dense, pathetic and ultimately incomprehensible. It's not the
character who's flawed; it's the artistry of the writer. After some lunatic
adventures, the Zuckerman/Kettering marriage begins to collapse. And then
Zuckerman takes a shine to Lydia's daughter Monica, whom he met when she was
just ten years old. (Cf. V. Nabokov, Lolita, 1959). After Lydia’s suicide,
Zuckerman takes sixteen- year-old Monica to his bed and to Italy. When she turns
twenty-one and is technically no longer his ward, he proposes marriage. She
refuses him. Smart girl.

Here’s the question, class. Can anyone recall the name of a prominent film
writer and director who formed a relationship with the daughter of his longtime
companion?  Let me give you a hint: Roth grew up just west of Manhattan
in Newark; the director in question hails from just east of Manhattan in
Brooklyn. No hands?  No takers? Let me offer another hint: the young lady in
question is named Soon-yi Farrow Previn. Anyone want to take a guess?  Yes,
that’s right, it’s Woody Allen, whose romance with Mia Farrow’s daughter
scandalized the nation in 1992.

Omigod!  Woody did in the '90s what Phil fictionalized in the '70s: he married
his wife’s daughter.

Did Woody read and study My Life as a Man?  Did both men imagine that Lolita
was designed as a how-to guide to sexual manners? Or was there something in
the seltzer that provoked both of these guys to dabble with the incest taboo?
What, in other words, gives? Are Roth and Allen joined at the hip or at the area
adjacent to the hip or are they in fact the same person?  Stay tuned as we
explore this continuing mystery.

Title: Another Violent Dream
Date: December 22, 2007

Our own dreams are fascinating to ourselves but not particularly interesting to
others (exceptions to the general rule are the dreams recounted and expounded in
Freud's Interpretation).  I know that I presume upon my readers to record the
following nightmare.  I do so only because it's such a shocking fantasia.

I was in a jewelry store with my wife somewhere on the Continent and we were
about to purchase a small gold medallion.  It was tarnished;  I called the
hint of greenness to the attention of the middle-aged, bald salesman.  At his
instruction, I rubbed the medallion with my thumb until it began to shine. 
Just as I did so, I noticed that the salesman's flaccid pecker was hanging out
of the fly of his pants;  I said, "OK, that's too weird, we're out of here." 
We hurried to leave but the door to the shop was locked.  The salesman, who now
looked menacing (the dream began to take on the ambience of a horror movie),
reached into his pocket and pulled out a key --strangely enough, a large,
castle-size key.  He flourished it and opened the door for us to leave, but
there was another locked door behind the first.  He took another key, equally
large, out of his pocket and opened the second door.  There was still another
door and I began to think that we'd never get out of the shop.  Then the
salesman reached deep into his pocket, pulled out a large hunting knife and cut
off his own dingus right at the root.  At this point I decided that I'd had
enough and woke up.

Hey, don't tell me that I suffer from castration anxiety.  I don't, despite
what the dream seems to say.  I hate to give such fodder to Freudians, but I
don't invent these dreams, I just report them.  And yes, I'm well aware that a
key is reputed to be a phallic symbol.

I'd welcome interpretations that don't make the dreamer out to be infantile,
maniacal, or excessively StephenKIngish.

Title: Antimylarmonofilamentarianism
Date: December 28, 2007

In 1895, my grandparents wisely left the abysmal, backward Ukraine and struck
out for the new world. Nine years later, my father was born in a cold-water flat
in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn. The date of his birth: December 22,
1904, exactly at the winter solstice. "And they called his name, Emanuel, God
with us." If he had been born in the old country, before the Russian authorities
imposed legal cognomina upon us, he would have been named Emanuel ben Isaiah--
his father's name appended to his own as a patronymic.

Despite his traditional moniker and his commitment to the essence of Judaism,
my father was fiercely hostile to the irrationalities of religion. His view --
and my grandfather Isaiah's even more strongly--was that for a thousand years
our lineage had been kept in poverty and darkness not just by the czars but
also by the rabbis. In politics, my father and grandfather began as socialists
and became New Dealers; in philosophy, they rejected theological doctrine and
were among the children of the enlightenment whom Moses Mendelssohn had led
to the promised land of evidence and reason. I doubt that any of my ancestors
knew Karl Marx's sentence that "the criticism of religion is the beginning of
all criticism," but they acted as if they had absorbed it from the cradle. My
brothers and I were taught to resist religious exclusivity, superstition, and
ceremony.

We now have a religious controversy in our peaceful, progressive, and largely
secular western town. A group of orthodox Jews have petitioned the city council
for permission to construct an eruv. What is an eruv?  It’s a “symbolic
boundary that allows orthodox Jews to carry things, including their own
children, outside their home during the Sabbath." (Carrying is considered work,
and orthodoxy's strict interpretation of religious law prohibits any sort of
sabbatical labor.) A latter-day eruv is constructed out of fishing line that is
strung on utility poles; curiously, it may incorporate functioning electric and
telephone wires.

I know that my forbears detested eruvim and similar expressions of irrational
piety. I myself am not enraged by these useless but harmless superstitions. 
Constructing an eruv does not endanger our species; it's not like opposing
contraception or prohibiting stem-cell research. An eruv consoles the believers
and doesn't much bother the rest of us. Yet if there is a spirit in the sky,
which I very much doubt, I would hope that he would not be so small-minded as
to issue ukases about carrying infants on Saturdays; infants should be carried
as much as they want, which is just about everywhere and always. And if any god
were so narrow as to promulgate an inside/outside-the-home rule, I would hope
that he would be intelligent enough not to be flummoxed by such transparent
trickery as hanging mylar filament on poles.

I have no intuitive conception of god, but I think that the orthodox trivialize
our shared longing for transcendence when they sanctify such petty practices. It
would be far more pious for the orthodox to take every nickel spent to appease
the Ancient of Days and bestow it on a poor Jewish family from Tashkent. 
If these folks can't locate eligible Jews, there are Hondurans and Sudanese
a-plenty who deserve their attention. When the orthodox re-direct their
enthusiasm and their resources toward truly charitable enterprises, they will
honor the universal immigrant experience and they will also practice the very
worthy Jewish virtue of compassion. Constructing an eruv is a foolish waste of
time and fishing line.

Here's my father's view:  "It took us hundreds of years to fight our way out of
the ghetto and they want to put themselves back in jail. If the rabbis had their
way," he would say, "Mahler and Bernstein and Gershwin would play accordion in a
klezmer band in Bialystok, Einstein would balance the books for a caftan maker
in Kiev, and a hundred and fifty Jewish Nobel Prize winners would spend their
days davening in some dirty dim synagogue in Vilna."

I think it’s in a Wallace Markfield novel that an old Jewish guy confronts a
group of twenty-something Jewish hippies/slackers in Miami Beach. After a heated
discussion, he admonishes them:  "And don't ever be ashamed that you’re
Jewish. It’s enough that I’m ashamed that you’re Jewish."

Which is pretty much how I feel about the eruvistas. Well, not exactly ashamed.
Embarrassed, perhaps, by their superstitious infatuation with the "dark backward
and abysm of time."

We were in the car heading toward Palo Alto when I brought up the old bromide
that in the English language, a person drives on a parkway and parks on a
driveway.  Immediately, my fellow-passengers began to list other roadways
that contained the element ”way.”   Highway, superhighway, freeway (and
its opposite, tollway) came immediately to mind.  Then came throughway,
expressway (called in England ‘dual carriageway’), broadway, runway, 
pathway, footway, byway, subway, tramway, and skyway.  After a while, some less
common words arrived:  gangway, passageway, arborway (Boston only, as far as I
know;  Boston has also given us fenway), fairway, alleyway and causeway.  To
what cause does a causeway subscribe?  None; the word ultimately derives from
Latin calx, limestone.  As we came closer to home: doorway, hallway, archway,
entranceway, stairway, breezeway.

Ah, wellaway, there must be many others.

Well, why do we drive on a parkway and park on a driveway?  Hey, why does your
nose run and your feet smell?   Why is catnapping pleasurable but kidnapping
reprehensible?   It’s the way of language; it’s wordway.

Title: Predictions for 2008
Date: December 30, 2007

Diligent readers of this blague will recall that last January, I made a
series of daring forecasts about the year 2007.  It's now time to review
my projections and evaluate my record.  I'm proud to say that a panel of
independent experts has confirmed that I hit the jackpot.  I scored an 8 out of
8, 100%, A+.  I'm now a fully accredited prophet.

These were my 2007 predictions:

"1)  there will be unusual weather patterns in North America;

2)  a famous Hollywood actress will sue for divorce;  moreover, another (or
possibly the same) Hollywood star will become pregnant; another (or possibly the
same) actress will gain and lose a great deal of weight;

3)  a well-known athlete will be accused of taking drugs;

4)  a politician will be involved in a sex scandal;

5)  questions will be raised about America's food supply;

6)  there will be either a monsoon, an airplane crash, or a capsized ferry in
Asia--perhaps all three;

7)  there will be fluctuations in the stock market, and, finally,

8)  there will be turmoil in the Middle East."

Did I score big-time,or what?  Note especially #4.  How did I know that
"wide- stance" would become a household phrase?   Boggles the imagination. 
Moreover, stock market fluctuations have been greater than even I could have
hoped for (same with Mideast turmoil).  Concerning athletes and drugs, just
think "Barry Bonds" and "Mitchell Report."  I knocked that one out of the park.

Is everyone ready for my 2008 predictions?

I'm staying with 1-8.  But I'm going out on a limb with #9:  "A religious
leader will be involved in either a financial or a sexual scandal (perhaps
both)."   And #10:  "Questions will be raised about the accuracy of the vote
count."

You read it here first.  Loyal readers: check back at the end of 2008.  Let's
see if Dr. M. can top his scintillating successes of 2007.

We're in Manhattan (New York, not Kansas) where I'm suffering from two kinds of
sticker shock:  regular and newyorkish.  Regular:  at DIA, I treated myself
to a cylinder of Life Savers:  $1.35.  Life Savers, as everyone knows, were
invented by Hart Crane's father and are still manufactured to the formula that
has made them a gourmet delight for a hundred years:  "sugar, corn syrup,
high fructose corn syrup, artificial flavors (Red 40, Yellow 5, Blue 1)." 
But Life Savers cost, in my childhood, exactly a nickel.  Now it's $1.35
for a small package!!  Beyond belief!!  But if regular sticker shock is
bad, what about high-voltage newyorkish shock?  In my own lifetime, it was
possible to ride the NYC subway for 5 cents.  Now it's two count 'em two
bucks, making the lifesaverish increase seem like peanuts.  And what about
this morning's breakfast?  An omelet and a cup of coffee:  $17.23 plus tip. 
And the earmuffs at a boutique for brazillionaires on Madison Avenue:  $650. 
After an efficient deliberation, we decided against purchasing the designer
earmuffs. At a nearby shop, knockoffs just as effective were available at
$32.00, which, in context, seemed like a bargain. Only $16 per ear.  But
shouldn't a pair of earmuffs retail for $1.59?

Title: More on Roth/Allen Doppelgangerism
Date: January 06, 2008

Michael Hollingsworth, associate professor of American Literature at Texas A & M
University, writes this:  "Dr Metablog:  you claim that Woody Allen and Philip
Roth are doppelgangers. I've got to tell you something you might not want to
hear: you're way behind the curve on this one. It's been well known in literary
circles for many years that Roth and Allen are two different presentations of
the same person. But there's lively disagreement about who's who. One group,
the Rothites, think that Woody is an invention of Philip. The Allenites, on the
other hand, are convinced that the Roth who very occasionally appears in public
is an actor hired by Woody and that Woody has written all the so-called Roth
novels. And then there's a more radical group (gaga conspiracy-theorists in
my view) who claim that both Roth and Allen are the invention of some as-yet-
unidentified third person, a prominent New York intellectual. This last theory
is just nuts"

Wow, this is exciting news. And here I thought that I had discovered something
original when I identified Roth and Allen as one and the same. Isn't it always
the case; you think you have an original idea but it turns out that someone has
anticipated your insight?  Stay tuned, loyal readers, as I bring myself up to
date on Roth/Allen doppelgangeritudinousness.

For a while there I was beginning to think that I was some sort of crank; now
I see that I'm part of the mainstream. How reassuring. And moreover, readers,
I think that I've already chosen my side in this battle. I'm inclined to be an
Allenite.

Title: The Art That Hides Art
Date: January 06, 2008

Today we paid a call on the New Museum of Contemporary Art.  It's an
uncompromising, vibrant building, all the more grand for being plunked down in
the rusty old Bowery.  The space is wonderful.  But the stuff on exhibition
is, in my less than humble opinion, ludicrous.  A mattress covered with
buttons.  A cage made of chain link fencing.  Fluorescent light bulbs 
arranged in a series of "Y" shapes.  Aluminum foil hanging from sticks. Broken
glass on a bench.  Cardboard boxes, some open, some closed.  Plastic pipe
threaded through a deck chair.

Three substantial floors littered with such artlessness.  What a dreadful,
terrible squandering of space and opportunity.

The unifying principle:  a conspicuous antagonism to craftsmanship.  Every
single piece of work left with rough edges and bad joins and unpainted surfaces,
as though not to complete the task is fundamental to the aesthetic.  If there
is an aesthetic other than fakery.

I don't get it.  I don't want to get it.  To me, it looked like the detritus
of a civilization in utter, hopeless implosive decline.  A decadence beyond
ordinary decadence.  In-your-face ugliness.

What is attractive or interesting or even repulsive about old clothes tied into
a tight bundle with an orange electrical extension cord?   It's still a bundle
of old clothes.  It's not art because it's in a museum, and if it's supposed to
be a critique of art, it's not not even remotely clever.  It's stupid.

There were lots of museum-goers who milled unexpressively around the various
objects.  Were we all pretending that we were looking at Vermeers?

One of the sculptures, so-called, consisted of a pile of chairs, randomly
arranged.  A four-year-old boy looked at the "sculpture" and announced, in
a very loud and clear voice, "It's a pile of chairs.  Very funny."  And he
laughed.  It was a great clothesless emperor moment.

Title: Twenty Thousand Something-or-Others
Date: January 12, 2008

Today, or tomorrow at the latest, the blague Dr. Metablog will have been visited
for the twenty-thousandth time.  A milestone -- twenty thousand readers.

Well, perhaps not exactly readers.  It would be more accurate to say twenty-
thousand page viewers.  Twenty-thousand page views is considerably fewer than
twenty-thousand readers.  Actually, many of those page-viewers aren't readers
at all and only viewers by accident;  they don't stop long enough to read or
to view; page glancers, perhaps.  They just touch down to find out whether
whatever they've googled is what they want and then, disappointed, off they go
in a microsecond.  For example, Dr. M. once wrote an entry in which he made fun
of the overuse, in book titles, of the word "naked." Consequently, the blague
Dr. Metablog googles to the surface when someone types in "naked weightlifting"
or "naked skiiing" -- a search that is attempted oodles more often than in his
innocence Dr. Metablog might ever have imagined.  Internet pilgrims hoping to
find salacious portraits of naked hairy weightlifters are mighty crushed and
are off like a shot -- but they still leave their electronic trace.  Another
example:  Dr. M once wrote a tribute to Vladimir Nabokov's excellent novel,
Lolita.  Did Dr M. know that the word "lolita" is a term of art in the world of
sexual exploitation?  Pity the internet hairypalms and chicken-chokers, who,
searching for secret pleasure, encounter (gasp) literary criticism.

We here at Dr. M. could increase "traffic" simply by using such code words or by
listing body parts of a groinal or perigroinal nature, but we're too proud to do
so just to increase readership  --or viewership -- or glancemanship.

Nevertheless, all of us here at Dr. Metablog are overjoyed to reach the twenty-
thousand mark, whatever that number signifies.  So best regards to our
readers from regular staff members Vivian de St. Vrain, Otto Onions, and Amber
Feldhammer, as well as  occasional contributors Alan Saxe-Poppette, Michael
Hollingsworth, Professor Marion Morrison Ph. D., Spike Schapiro, and Otis
Jefferson Brown.

Title: Roth/Allen's Breasts
Date: January 13, 2008

Michael Hollingsworth writes:

"Dear Dr. M.:  you're directly on target when you claim that Woody Allen and
Philip Roth are the same person, but you've unaccountably omitted to mention
the most pressing evidence.The year: 1972. Philip Roth published The Breast, a
fantasy about a writer transformed into one. Woody Allen released Everything You
Always Wanted to Know About Sex, in which a giant female breast wreaks havoc
upon the countryside.  Obviously, both "Roth" and "Allen" had recently read
Gogol's The Nose and Kafka's Metamorphosis. Just as obviously, "both" of "them"
were struggling with some seriously unresolved maternal issues. How fascinating
that both of their boundless cups of creativity "runneth over" so to speak, in
such similar ways. A coincidence? Hardly.

By the way, both "Roth's" and "Allen's" contributions are embarrassingly false
and flat."

Dr. M. responds:  "You know, Professor Hollingsworth, I think I support your
breast remarks. I'd been aware of both of these upwellings of mammariness but
I never put two and two together. If Roth/Allen aren't doppelgangers, they're
certainly developing along twin tracks.

And let me add my own reservations:  the short stories by Gogol and Kafka are
untouchable contributions to world literature.  Both writers create astonishing
fantasies; they also manage to skewer the particularities of, in the one case,
czarist Russia and in the other, early twentieth-century Prague. Frankly,
neither Roth's nor Allen's breasts are anywhere nearly as full or pointed."

Title: The Tarantass
Date: January 13, 2008

Here the all but preternatural patience of metablogian aficionados is solicited
as Dr Metablog quotes directly from an ancient (April, '07) posting on sex and
the horsedrawn vehicle -- the R-rated entirety of which can be found here:

"Regular readers of this blague are well aware that I have repeatedly indulged
my bemusement with the names of extinct or obsolescent horsedrawn conveyances. 
My point is that modern readers, who know precisely what is signified  -- in
design, in metal, rubber and plastic and other constituents, and especially in
social value -- by such words as Jeep, Jaguar, Jetta, and jalopy, know zero
zilch zip about "fly," "trap," "landau," "chaise," "phaeton," "cabriolet,"
"sulky," "surrey," "curricle," "gig," "hansom," "buggy," "four-wheeler,"
"spring-van," "berlin," "barouche," "britchka," "troika," "wurt," "tandem,"
"caleche," "tilbury," "dog-cart," "wagonette," "go-cart," "victoria,"
"brougham," "diligence," "clarence" and "post-chaise."  If we notice these
words at all, we tend to savor them as archaic Victorian music rather than to
identify and evaluate them as specific forms of transportation."

My point is that we read Victorian novels with one hand tied behind our backs,
so to speak, when we don't know whether a dog-cart or a clarence or a wurt
delineates rich or poor, stylish or provincial, pretentious or aggressive or
modest.

Perpetually naive, I thought that I had pretty much exhausted the list of
nineteenth-century horsedrawn conveyances.  However, by a curious coincidence,
I just yesterday happened upon two more such vehicles.  The first is a "basket-
carriage," an example of which I observed with my very own eyes at the New York
Historical Society at Central Park West and 77th Street.  A basket-carriage
is a coach constructed of wicker.  The carriage on exhibit looked mighty
comfortable for summer travel but would be frigid and leaky when winter winds
are raging.   A second new conveyance materialized in Nikolai Gogol's story,
The Carriage.  It's the very versatile "tarantass" -- a horsedrawn coach fitted
with removable wheels so that it could be converted into a sled come winter. 
Are there still more to be discovered?  I wouldn't be surprised if there are.
Stay tuned.

Title: A Walk With Ella
Date: January 22, 2008

Today it was my assignment to pick up the five-year-old granddaughter at the
local Montessori school. We walked home together.  It's a ten minute walk but
it took us more than forty minutes.  Here's why.

There was a patch of frozen snow on the ground. Ella pretended to skate back
and forth on it for a few minutes.  After a while she happened to push some
lumps of ice onto the sidewalk and decided to see how far she could kick them.
When the ice disintegrated, she went back for more clumps to practice her kick
upon.  She repeated this four or five times. But finally, searching for more
ice, she found a black and white feather (she collects feathers), which she
closely inspected and gave to me to carry.  After that she looked at a number
of leaves both on the ground and hanging upon the low branches; she gathered
a few of last year's brittle brown oak leaves.  Next she came upon a small
flock of English sparrows who were pecking at some seed; she chased them off
but waited to see how long it would take them to return. She decided to add
to her rock collection: she found a beautiful, potato-size rock that I was
allowed to carry home.  "Could I open it with a knife?  I'd like to see inside
it?"  Then it was time to dance on a brick retaining wall.  Finished with that
activity, she found two hunks of packed snow and scraped them together.  "It's
beautiful music," she said.  She stopped to practice her whistling, a newly
acquired skill. Then came an experiment:  what happens when clumps of snow are
rubbed on the trunk of a pear tree.  And so on.

Ella's world:  so various, so beautiful, and so new!

Title: The "Chinese Bus"
Date: January 24, 2008

As is our custom, we journeyed from New York to Washington (and back) on the
so- called "Chinese bus." It's a bargain: round-trip between Chinatown here
and Chinatown there for just $35. It's a non-standard, non-greyhoundish, no
frills experience. It's also shoestring capitalism in the raw. When a potential
passenger arrives at the East Broadway departure site, he/she will be accosted
by young female representatives of several different companies, each touting
her own organization. The ladies are aggressive but hard to decipher inasmuch
as they shout in Chinese and possess only the most rudimentary English. A
traveler must be careful to board the right bus at the right hour (the first
time I used this service, I was almost shanghaied to Boston). The buses are
not well marked and misrepresentation is rife. Leaving New York last time, we
talked with a number of travelers who were frustrated and angry. Some had been
told that the bus would set out for Washington at noon, some at 12:30, some at
12:45 -- whatever time would sell the ticket and get the luggage on board and
the passenger into a seat. Because there's no terminal and the streets are so
crowded, the bus had to run a loop around lower Manhattan. Each time it set out,
there was optimism, but then fifteen minutes later it would return to square
one to board more passengers. We circulated three or four times. At 1:30, which
was in fact the scheduled departure time, we were on the road, but with quite a
number of unhappy passengers in tow.

A few years ago, almost all the passengers were Asian. Nowadays, the news is out
and it's all complexions from ebony to ivory. Still, the dominant language and
the dominant food odors are Chinese.

Sometimes the driver bypasses a scheduled stop. Sometimes it's necessary for one
passenger to discipline a fellow passenger for surreptitious smoking. Amenities
are minimal. The waiting rooms are small, dank, and squalid. On the bus, the
john is unspeakably foul. BYOTP.

But it's inexpensive, it's fun, and it gets you there.

Title: "Cesspool of Talent"
Date: February 02, 2008

Colorado's "flagship" football team has had unprecedented success signing up in-
state recruits.  In the paper this morning:  "If you look around we've just
got a cesspool of talent around here."

A "cesspool of talent?"  Here are two things that we know about the up-and-
coming young linebacker who is credited with that sentence:  a) he's never
come face-to-face with a actual cesspool, and b) he's under the impression that
"cess" means "large" or "deep."   Is he alone?  I'm afraid not.  A quick
googling retrieves sixty cesspools of talent, perhaps a third of which are
ironic.

Shakespeare uses "cess" to mean "measure."  A diseased horse, "Poor jade, is
wrung in the withers out of all cess."  Is it possible that our linebacker is
familiar with The First Part of King Henry the Fourth?  Does he believe that
"cesspool" mean "immeasurable pool?

In a related matter, one of my correspondents sends me this yahoo headline: 
"U.S. woman abducted in Afghanistan. A Taliban snatch."  Clearly, the writer
is ignorant of the demotic use of the word "snatch."  He should have consulted
Shakespeare, one of whose nastiest characters (Aaron in Titus Andronicus) uses
the word correctly:  "Why, then, it seems, some certain snatch or so/ Would
serve your turns."

Title: Upper West Side Then and Now
Date: February 03, 2008

From 1965 to 1969 we lived on Manhattan's Upper West Side. Now we've returned
for a month-long visit. In days of yore, we were the busy young parents pushing
our baby carriage down Broadway. Now forty years more 'mature, we step aside as
nannies maneuver the twins (without question there are both more nannies and
more twins) around and past us.

And the eternal West Side -- has it also matured? Certainly it's a more
prosperous neighborhood and a more crowded one. With scores of giant high-rise
apartment houses added in the intervening years, it's become even more densely
populated. Paradoxically, it's also safer. In the 1960s, received wisdom stated
that to wander onto 85th Street or onto Columbus Avenue after dark was to risk
death or at least a good mugging. Now the area is peaceful morning, noon and
night, and newly-fashionable Columbus Avenue houses dozens of trendy ethnic
restaurants. Forty years ago, it was foolish to venture across Central Park to
the aristocratic East Side, where, it was rumored, there lived people who were
fair-skinned and blond. Some areas of the Park, like The Ramble, were famously
dangerous and were visited only by those who were itching for action. Now,
single women jog without the least concern. We took advantage of the new freedom
by taking frequent jaunts to the row of fabulous museums along Fifth Avenue.
(In the 1960s, museums were difficult for West Siders to access but admission
was free; today, they're easy to reach but the ticket prices are staggering.)
In the good old days, West Side street-corners were gathering points for
enterprising drug-dealers. On this visit, I didn't spot a single dealer or a
single transaction. Moreover, the neighborhood used to be thick with policemen
on patrol; this time, police are scarce and apparently unnecessary. Why the
improvement in public safety? In a word, money. Only the rich can now afford to
live on the Upper West Side, and rich people don't need to knock you down and
empty your wallet. They have other fish to fry.

There's a new feature of transportation: droves of briefcase-bearing suit-
wearers are shuttled Wallstreetway in luxurious "private cars." Meanwhile, the
subway is as efficient and as filthy as ever, but nowadays we pay not with
tokens but with "metro cards." The New York Times, then 10 cents, is now $1.25;
it has fewer columns, a larger font, and poorer writing. More changes: in
yesteryear, a man shouting in public was very likely a paranoid schizophrenic;
now a noisy talker has a gimmick in his ear and a cell phone and he's doing
nothing more lunatic than snapping up undercapitalized mortgages.

Dogs, here as elsewhere, are horribly indulged. One day we peeked into a "pet
exercise" gymnasium and later were amused by a well-appointed van labeled "Pet
Limousine." Although there are many more curs, there are fewer piles of canine
poopery on the sidewalks; most dog-walkers make use of plastic bags. Thank you,
dog-walkers.

Affordable supermarkets have disappeared and there are only specialty food shops
where the prices are beyond astronomical. But where do the waitresses, cooks,
cleaning ladies, nannies, cashiers, shop girls, bank tellers, kioskers, subway
maintenance men, bus drivers, janitors, and policemen shop?  Where, in fact, do
they live? Not in the neighborhood; not since the entire West Side went condo.

It's still a polyglot world, but there's much less Spanish and a lot more
Russian, Chinese, Hindi and Arabic.

More novelties: there's a Duane Reade (sometimes two) on every street and
there's a second crowded Starbucks visible from the Starbucks where you sit
poring over your wireless laptop and nursing your gigantico skinny dry vanilla
latte. In the 1960s, there were seven movie theaters within walking distance --
including the New Yorker and the Thalia, the mother churches of cinema worship.
Now, there are none -- nor even a single dvd rental store. It's all Netflix and
downloads.

There's been a phenomenal growth of personal services: not just the barbershops
and hairdressers of old, but also whole galaxies of nail care shops. Who
could have imagined that in the new millennium, fingernails would become the
cornerstone of the economy? An economy of which I'm not a part; my nail care
consists of occasionally biting off a sliver of stray keratin and taking
a cosmetic nibble or two at the paronychium. I don't believe I've spent a
nickel, lifetime, on my nails, nor do I intend to do so. Nope, no manicures,
nor pedicures, nor medicures (what the heck is a medicure?) nor massages nor
aromatherapy for me. Nor will I have my ears candled (a process that one medical
website calls 'useless and dangerous") or my eyebrows threaded or any part of my
body, public or private, waxed. It appears that every facial feature and every
organ has an entire industry dedicated to its hygiene and its remediation. Is
the upper West Side experiencing an outbreak of good health? Or a triumph of
narcissism?

One final observation: since we lived here, many expensively-architected fancy-
shmancy private schools have appeared. Meanwhile, public schools have been
allowed to slide further into poverty. Ugly, concrete block buildings surrounded
by chainlink fence and razor wire -- not temples of learning, but prisons.The
gap between rich and poor, evident then, has become a chasm. Manhattan is safer
and more livable than it was (at least for the prosperous), but it will not
be truly healed until its citizenry moves beyond "private wealth and public
squalor."

Title: Confessions of a Dysgeographicoid
Date: February 04, 2008

This post is written for members of the directionally dyslexic community.  Non-
members are welcome to read but they probably won't get it.

Some cities are easy to navigate;  others are nightmares.  In the small
western city where I live, the mountains are always visible, and they're always,
blessedly, to the west.   In addition, the streets that run north-to-south
are consecutively numbered.  I'm thankful that I live in a city where it is
difficult to lose your way.  Manhattan, where I spent last month, is pretty
good too, except for the confusing lower downtown.  Manhattan is on a grid. 
Ninety- fourth Street Street is always north of 93rd and 2nd Avenue is always
east of 3rd Avenue. The worst that can happen is that you walk one short
block in the wrong direction and then right yourself. But other cities are
impossible.  Take Washington D.C., for example.  Washington could only have
been laid out by a sadist whose aim was to drive the directionally-disabled off
their collective rockers.  It's those damn diagonals, which cut through the
grid at every conceivable angle.  A few steps along one of those diagonals and
the points of the compass become hopelessly shuffled.  And then Washington
throws in a few wayward, wandering streets that were added just to cause pain.

When we visit Washington, we stay at a home on Nevada Avenue that's a half-hour
walk from the Friendship Heights Metro.  I've memorized the route (I'm good
at rote learning).  But last month, we (that is myself and my spouse --
actually "guide" is the better term) -- set out on a different path from station
to home.  Why did we do so?  I don't know;  it wasn't my decision.  A
minute hadn't elapsed before I had lost my bearings and had no idea whether
we were heading north south east or west or how our improvised path stood in
relation to the route that I had mechanically mastered.  My guide, who is not
directionally- disabled, sometimes forgets, even after all these years, that a
few steps on the oblique and I'm completely buffaloed.

This time, I decided that instead of whining "where are we?" at every street
corner, I would just keep my mouth shut.  I pretended confidence, though I hung
back at every corner so as not to commit to a ludicrously wrong direction.  I
played follow the leader.  Sometimes we were on the grid, sometimes we took
diagonals, sometimes we took one of those eccentric curving streets.  My DD
compeers understand that at each of the thirty or so corners that we approached,
I had not an inkling whether my guide would choose left, or right, or straight
ahead.  But I was, let me tell you, oh so cool.  After a while, the terrain
began to grow familiar, but just between us, let me confess that it wasn't until
we were thirty feet from our target that I knew where I was.

So, friends, here's my new formula:  keep quiet, hang back, avoid humiliation.

Title: What Happened in Our Precinct
Date: February 05, 2008

The big news is that our caucus drew unprecedented hordes of voters.  Our site
is the local elementary school.  We're a "super-site" -- seven precincts in
one building.  In the past, we'd have ten or a dozen or at an absolute maximum
thirty attendees per precinct.  Tonight, at 7pm, when we were supposed to come
to order, there were still long lines of folks of all ages waiting patiently
to register. Eventually, the super-site drew 707 people! When our precinct was
finally able to get organized, there were an astonishing 129 people in the room
-- breaking all records by a multiple of four or five.  We voted 92 for Obama,
37 for Clinton and we divided our delegates 4-2.   It was exhilarating to see
so many unfamiliar young faces.  It was also, as dem events are likely to be,
chaotic, amusing, and enthusiastic.

I asked new attendees what brought had them out.  I received two answers. 
Most frequently, George Bush, who, I was told, has driven the country into a
ditch, broken the treasury, ruined the civil service, shredded the constitution,
exhausted the military, ruined the environment, packed the judiciary, fought
a senseless unnecessary, and endless war, and put loyalty to his wing of the
party ahead of loyalty to the country.  The second reason:  Barack Obama.  No
question but that Obama has given people in our precinct new hope.

My conclusion:  Colorado is looking good for the Democrats in November.

Title: Forthcoming Swiftboatery
Date: February 08, 2008

HRC, who is essentially a centrist Democrat, is widely perceived as a divisive
and polarizing figure. Why so?  Because she's a woman, because she's married
to Bill, but mostly because  for twenty years now, unscrupulous Republicans
have been investigating, castigating, and smearing her. Is there a more vilified
politician in the world? She's a murderess, a lesbian, an adultery-enabler, a
frigid bitch... etc. etc.

Barack Obama is not perceived as a divisive and polarizing figure, but only
because Karl Rove and his cruel band of conscienceless propagandists haven't yet
gone to work on him. I guarantee that right at this very moment there's a room
full of "conservative" operatives who are brainstorming the most vile imaginings
about Obama. Think Willie Horton, think swiftboat. They are forging documents,
photoshopping pictures; they're developing sick fantasies about Obama's sex
life, his wife, his children, his parents, his patriotism, his education, his
finances, and certainly, his religion. Don't dare to imagine that racism is
dead; the Rovistas will give it new life.

And don't think that you are able to anticipate the attack. It will be
disgusting beyond anything that ordinary people are capable of inventing. And it
will be cloaked by 527s or disseminated anonymously or leaked.

And then Obama too will become a divisive and polarizing figure.

Title: Philip Roth's American Pastoral
Date: February 11, 2008

A couple of months ago, when I had journeyed through roughly half of his
writings, I made some preliminary observations about the fictional world
invented by Philip Roth. In the course of discussion, I advanced two hypotheses.
The first was that Roth hated children, whom he regarded as encumbrances to male
freedom and pleasure. The second is that although Roth had invented a boatload
of adult male narcissists, he had not created a single mensch -- a caring,
responsible, mature man. In Roth's vision of the world, I suggested, "only a
schmuck would be a mensch."

After a pause for rest and rehabilitation, I've now resumed my upriver voyage to
the heart of the Rothworld. I've just finished reading American Pastoral (1997),
a novel set during the difficult, still-controversial Vietnam war. I must boast
that my hypotheses about children and menschdom are fully confirmed by the new
evidence provided by American Pastoral.

In this novel, children are indeed hateful, and the mensch who has at last made
an appearance is nothing more than a schmeggegy. Roth has given us Seymour
"Swede" Levov, an archetypal mensch, and behold, what a poor naive schmuck is
he! Levov nurtures everyone he encounters, but Roth works it so that his virtue
leads directly to his downfall. Poor Swede owns and manages an exemplary factory
but he is betrayed by his workers; he's loyal to Newark, so Newark riots and
pillages; he loves and supports his fragile wife only to discover that she's
sleeping with his friend. Most of all, he adores his daughter, unamusingly
called Merry, who turns out to be, just as we might expect, a devil child. She
screams unaccountably from the moment of birth and stutters through her awkward
childhood (Roth seems to think that colic and speech impediments are signs of
inherent viciousness). At adolescence, Merry transforms into an unhandsome
Patty Hearst clone who participates in several senseless but deadly political
bombings. She then goes underground, only to return secretly in Newark to haunt
Levov all the more. Under this succession of attacks, Swede Levov's carefully-
crafted menschdom is little-by-little exposed as naive schmuckhood. If only
Levov had taken the Zuckerman route: love only thyself, fuck 'em and forget 'em;
abort when necessary.

And now, for the benefit of younger readers, I pause for a few refresher
sentences about the historiography of the Vietnamese catastrophe. The
significance of this period is highly contested. For those on the left, the
war was a foolish attempt to block a peasant uprising against neo-colonialist
overlords. The Bundys and Lyndonites and Kissingers squandered fifty thousand
American and two million Vietnamese lives (plus moral authority and treasure
uncountable). Nevertheless, as the left sees it, the war provided an opportunity
for heroism: for the first time in human history, a free and patriotic people,
making use of peaceful assemblies, petitions, political activism, boycotts, and
resistance to the draft, succeeded in turning an erring government from its
mistaken path. On the other hand, the right wing knows an entirely different
Vietnam war. For conservatives, the war against communism was lost because
squishy liberals lost their nerve. Conservatives remember only the excesses of
the anti-war movement: the culture of drugs, the sexual freedom, the violence,
and of course, the bombings.

American Pastoral is firmly of the right-hand file. Roth has performed an
amazing piece of legerdemain. He has written about the period of Vietnam, but he
has omitted (or suppressed) both the atrocities of the war and the organized,
largely peaceful opposition to it. In American Pastoral, resistance is not
political but personal. It's embodied in Swede's daughter Merry Levov, who is
vacant, violent, angry and disgusting. By stripping the novel of its historical
context and coloration, Roth reduces the opposition to the war to an oedipal
conflict between a demon child and her well-meaning but ineffectual father. The
novel lacks even the decent ambiguity that Roth might have created if he had
given Levov other and perhaps more reasonable children. But it's a sure thing
that in a novel by Philip Roth, more children would have led not to a widening
of focus or to a richer novel, but only to more tsouris.

It's a shame that so skillful an artist (and one who is not generally a right-
winger) has written a novel that's only inches away from neocon propaganda.

Title: Upon "Upon Julia's Clothes"
Date: February 13, 2008

This pretty six-line poem is not nearly as naive as it first appears. But it's
a poem to savor and one that has richly earned its place in the anthologies.
It's often, mistakenly in my opinion, listed among the best "love poems" in the
English language.

Whenas in silks my Julia goes,

Then, then, methinks, how sweetly flows

The liquefaction of her clothes.

Next, when I cast mine eyes and see

That brave vibration each way free

O how that glittering taketh me.

The story, the "plot," is simplicity itself: a poet becomes infatuated with
"Julia's" garments.

"Upon Julia's Clothes" may be a poem about "love," but it seems severely
truncated, because every reader anticipates that, even though the poet
is attracted to his lady's adornments, he'll soon confess that he truly
desires Julia herself -- her hair, her eyes, and if he takes the well-trodden
path, her virtue, which he intends to overcome. But not this poet, not this
poem. "Upon Julia's Clothes" is exactly what it announces itself to be; a
sestet upon Julia's clothes. Readers learn nothing of Julia, and to tell
truth, almost nothing of her costume. The poet lays claim to no interest or
expertise in fashion. Instead, he offers a series of images of a silk dress in
coruscating, shimmering motion: its flow, its "liquefaction", its "vibration,"
its "glittering."

It's in this lovely, odd, and surprising sequence of nouns that the poem's
intrigue lies. The word "glittering" is troublesome. A ardent wooer would
be unlikely to claim that he was attracted to his beloved's "glitter.'' To
do so would be an admission of both his and her superficiality. Plus it's a
matter of record that all that glisters is not gold. The word "vibration" is
an equally curious choice. "Vibration" was brand-new to the language when this
poem was written and the Latin word from which it had recently been annexed
meant "shaking" -- as a spear or a sword is shaken in defiance of the enemy.
"Vibration" was more aggressive than it was loverly. "Liquefaction" -- the
most startling noun, was confined to an alchemical context. Taken together,
the series of dispassionate nouns dilutes any expectation that the poem is
an invitation to romance. The poet may have been "taken" --charmed -- by the
"glittering" -- but he's not all that pleased to have been so.

The contrary or anti-romantic tendency in the poem is realized in a subversive
metaphor so ingenious and subtle that it registers only subliminally."Upon
Julia's Clothes" is, figuratively speaking, about the sport of fishing. The
most overt hint is the employment of the phrase "when I cast mine eyes" which
replaces the more ordinary "when I look." Once a reader notices that piscatorial
"cast," the secondary meanings of other words become immediately clear --
especially when we recall that in those days, fishing line and fishing ties were
made of silk. The watery metaphors in "flows" and "liquefaction" provide the
stream, the "brave (extravagant) vibration" is an oscillating lure, and "how
that glittering taketh me" refers to the deluded poet, who has snapped at a
shiner and is now hooked. As soon as the metaphor bobs to the surface, "how that
glittering taketh me," which at first glance meant only "how that dress enchants
me," acquires a second meaning -- "how that lure hooks me." Julia's clothes, of
course, have been transformed into the dangerous lure.

The sestet is therefore not so much about love-longing as it is about confusion
and ambivalence toward women, toward sex and toward sexuality. Julia's clothes
captivate the poet, yes, but he's a poor fish, unwillingly enthralled.

And so the reader now understands why nothing much is made of Julia, the
supposed inhabitant of these silken, seductive clothes. It's because there is no
Julia -- that is, no specific warm-blooded woman worth the wedding, the wooing,
or even the sport. In her place, there is only an archetypical Dangerous Female
and a culturally-loaded intrapsychic battle between reluctant desire and the
deeply puritanical fear of desire.

Would it be possible to guess, strictly on the basis of this poem, that the
author of "Upon Julia's Clothes" (Robert Herrick [1591-1674]), was a clergyman
and a lifelong bachelor?

Title: The All-Time Most Tired Movie Cliche
Date: February 17, 2008

We watched, don't ask me why, the most recent Jason Bourne extravaganza  -- The
Bourne Hyperventilation I believe it was called. So-called "action" pictures are
not my cup of tea. In my view, it's a genre that is far too deeply infatuated
with its own cliches. The Bourne Mystification was not only prefamiliar but also
unusually tricky to follow. It consisted of swatches of flashback interspersed
with vigorous but interminable fight and chase sequences. The "action" was
delivered in a multitude of stitched-together one- and two- second slices,
which, even on the small screen, were vertiginous and almost barfitudinous.

The Bourne Hyperbole is a multiple car-chase movie. How many time do we need
to revisit this cliche? Cars spinning out of control, cars shouldering each
other for a place on the highway, cars ramming into each other, cars becoming
airborne, cars landing on their sides, cars weaving into the oncoming lane, cars
on sidewalks, sirens blaring, hoods flying open, windows shot out, guys shooting
pistols at each other while driving one-handed at 100 mph -- interspersed with
one-second glances at the speedometer, one-second glances of a foot on a brake
-- all followed by the inevitable noisy, multiple-vehicle crash where the nasty
hired killer winds up dead while our invincible hero emerges with only minimal,
symbolic scathe. Is there anything in movies today that is more hectic, more
predictable, or more boring?

Let me ask my readership this art-versus-life question -- what is the ratio of
your own participation and/or observation of real-life car chases compared to
the number of car chases that you've seen in movies?  Am I the only twentieth-
century American who has never been shot at or pursued? Never seen a fleeing
Oldsmobile pass just inches in front of the oncoming semi? Yet I've experienced
the film version of that very scene scores -- perhaps hundreds -- of times.

I think that in the next century, when movies will be studied by historians
eager to understand the great age of petroleum-based transportation (as well as
the golden age of film), our descendants will take it for granted that it was
absolutely ordinary for pedestrians out for a Sunday stroll to be driven from
the sidewalk by an out-of-control vehicle (usually a commandeered taxi trailed
by a gaggle of motorcycle cops). They will think that in our century, there was
never a time that a fruiterer put that last orange on top of his pyramid of
oranges that some sort of vehicle didn't barrel into the display. They will know
that any time, day or night, every plate glass showroom window in North America
was liable to have a station wagon hurtle through it. Often in slow motion.

So here's my proposal for a new rating system for movies. In addition to the
three or four stars, let's announce in advance how many car chases we are going
to experience  -- or better still, exactly how many cars were destroyed during
the making of the film. It would certainly help me choose my entertainment if
I were to learn that The Bourne Yesterday was a three-star, two-car chase, 197
exploded vehicles film.

While we're changing the rating system, I have another idea. Let's also have
a Cute Puppy warning.  I'm thinking of that scene where the hero and heroine
finally make it to bed and there's a reaction shot of Cute Puppy putting his paw
over his eyes. I never, ever, want to see that one again. Agreed: no more car
chases, no more Cute Puppies. Life will be richer.

One further exercise: let us divide the number of cases of amnesia encountered
in film by the number of cases of amnesia encountered in real life. And the
answer is: it's impossible to divide by zero.

Title: John Milton and Docosahexaenoic Acid
Date: February 19, 2008

Your “mature” brain has mind of its own. It is intermittently balky and
stubborn, reluctant to yield up its stored data.

Many years ago I memorized a few of John Milton’s sonnets.  These poems are
not only noble and politically engaged, they are also reflective, immaculately
crafted, challenging, and melodious  -- as good as any short poems in the
language.

One night, a week or so ago, insomniac as usual, I tried to recall one of the
finest of the sequence -- the great sonnet in which Milton condemned the ethnic
cleansing by Roman Catholic Savoyards of a colony of Swiss Protestants.

There was a time when I knew this poem like the back of my hand, but try as
I might, all that I could dredge out of my recalcitrant mind was the single
phrase “triple tyrant.”  (In Miltonese, the “triple tyrant” is the
Pope, wearer of a three-tiered crown.) It's mighty frustrating to have so rusty
a brain.

The next night, sleepless once again, I re-activated the tired old memory system
and was able to scrape up a few more words. I retrieved “where still doth
sway the triple tyrant.” (The word “sway” does not imply that the Pope
has taken to dancing but rather that the holy father “holds sway” over his
dominions.) In two days, I had assembled only a single line of poetry and still
needed thirteen more to complete the sonnet.  This sorry state of affairs cried
out for radical new approach to memory-jogging.

It is well known that Omega-3 fatty acids (i.e. fish oils) increase the rate
of transmission of certain brain waves that are linked to memory. On the third
day of my adventure in sonnet-recall, I swallowed a fish oil pill rich in
docosahexaenoic acid (commonly known as DHA). When I woke up next morning, there
it was on the tip of my tongue (or the top of my brain) -– another line and
a half of the sonnet:  “Slain by the bloody Piedmontese that rolled/ Mother
with infant down the rocks.” Did I do it all by myself? Or could it possibly
have been the DHA?

And in what part of the brain lay hidden this poignant line of poetry before
I was able to summon it?  In what chemical form?  Clearly the words were
in storage, so to speak, but why couldn’t I freely access them? Was I
unconsciously running some sort of failed search program?  Attention
searchers:  examine poetry quadrant for missing sonnets by Milton, John
[1608-1673]. Did the DHA shift the words from a dusty neglected old storeroom to
facility currently in us?

Does fish oil really lubricate memory?

The next day, I doubled my intake of the oily acid and, marvelous to say,
came up with the poem’s last line:  “Early may fly the Babylonian
woe” ("Babylon" is reformation code for "Rome"). On the fourth day of this
experiment, I took three fish oil pills and lo and behold was able to remember
the entire first quatrain of the sonnet:  “Avenge, O Lord, thy slaughtered
saints, whose bones/ Lie scattered on the Alpine mountains cold,/ Even them
who kept thy truth so pure of old,/  When all our fathers worshiped stocks
and stones.”  There it is: Milton’s agony and fury, his uncompromising
conviction, his contempt for pre-Reformation idol-worship, plus the confidence,
that, because he's something of a prophet himself, he can boss god around.

I continued to take the pills but I was scared to increase the dosage for fear
of provoking what Milton elsewhere calls the “fishy fumes.” After several
days of medication and head-scratching, I had conjured up this much of the poem:

Avenge, O Lord, thy slaughtered saints, whose bones

Lie scattered on the Alpine mountains cold,

Even them who kept thy truth so pure of old,

When all our fathers worshiped stocks and stones;

Forget not:

in thy [blank], [blank] their [blank]

Who were thy [blank]

Slain by the bloody Piedmontese that rolled

Mother with infant down the rocks.

where still doth sway

The triple tyrant;

A hundred-fold

Early may fly the Babylonian woe.

And then, progress came to a halt. No matter how many glutinous pills I popped,
no matter how I greased my memory, I could recover nary another syllable.
Where was the rest of the poem concealed? Why couldn’t I fish it up? Had the
molecules of which memory is constituted long ago disintegrated?

I've now declared the experiment officially over.  Although the results are
inconclusive, I've decided to continue with the fish oil regimen.  It's obvious
that my brain needs all the phospholipids it can get.

And after a week of disciplined forbearance, I've now peeked at the text of
"On the Late Massacre at Piedmont."  Every word was familiar -- even the ones
that I could not recall.  Perhaps I might ultimately have brought them to the
surface;  I'm convinced that they were lurking somewhere in the inner recesses
of the brain.

I’ll re-memorize and hope for the best.  Perhaps my newly fishified
brain is ready for a renaissance.  After all, I’m a lot richer in
phosphatidylethanolamine, ethanolamine plasmalogens, and phosphatidylserine than
I was just a week ago.

Loyal readers: here you may find John Milton's masterful sonnet "On the Late
Massacre at Piedmont." Trust me, it's worth a look. In fact, it's worth
committing to memory.

Title: Another Roth Demon-Child
Date: February 22, 2008

Philip Roth's American Pastoral (1997) attacked home-grown resistance to the
Vietnam war and featured a child of unparalleled wickedness named Merry Levov.
I've now read I Married a Communist (1999) which ridicules the post-World War
II political left and gives prominence to an even more horrible demon-daughter.
This time it's Sylphid Pennington, an Iago-strength villain, who destroys her
mother's marriage to Ira Ringold. She does so by forcing her mother to abort
Ira's child, which, if it is born, she will "strangle in its crib." Roth's
hatred of children is persistent, intransigent and obsessive. Has there been a
writer since Thomas Kyd whose writings were so empty of love (except for self-
love) and so focused on vengeance?

Moreover, what does Roth's prominence tell us about ourselves?

Title: Two Three Tens to Yuma or Two Three Ten to Yumas
Date: February 27, 2008

I had trace memory only of Delmer Daves' 1957 3:10 to Yuma, a film that I had
not seen since the days of my youth. In my mind it was bracketed with a much
better morality-play western, High Noon (1952). I am, frankly, a little vain
that I was able to recall that Van Heflin played the Gary Cooper part of the
good man deserted by fearful townspeople while the clock ticks toward the
climactic arrival of the Iron Horse and while Frankie Laine strums and sings
off-screen. Of course, so much detail had evaporated from the ol'  tired brain
that the return to the 1950s was, once again, well, not mind-blowing, but
certainly eye-opening.

3:10 to Yuma is a remarkably spare noirish western -- not a classic, but
respectable and well-made. At its heart is the near-friendship that develops
between the bad guy Ben Wade as acted by smooth and charming Glenn Ford, and his
captor, the god-fearing impoverished settler Dan Evans, played by the ever-gruff
Van Heflin (reprising his role in Shane). As the two (Wade and Evans) test
each other, an odd mutual respect springs up between them. Wade has money and
authority and the perennial appeal of lawlessness while Evans is grounded in his
ranch and his family.  Each envies the other. The relationship is imperfectly
delineated and as a result the ending of the film is huddled and unsatisfying.

Slipping the DVD of the brand new 3:10 to Yuma into the machine, I thought,
ah, here's a chance to remedy the original. This time, get that off-kilter
relationship between Wade and Evans right;  clarify the ending. I wanted a
suspenseful film rich in psychological insights. I couldn't have been more
disappointed. James Mangold's reworking of 3:10 to Yuma is bigger, noisier, and
a ton more expensive than the original. It adds a lot of ruckus:  a fight with
Indians, a barn-burning, feuding townsfolk, a pair of sadistic monomaniacal
killers, a gruesome bullet extraction that belongs on the surgery channel, a
cursed pistol, thirty seconds of gratuitous torture, and most of all, hundreds
of fatalities. In terms of melodrama and gunfire, there's certainly much
more bang for the buck, but the characters themselves are flatter and less
interesting and the climax, problematical in the first 3:10 to Yuma, is totally
botched and incoherent. An opportunity squandered!

And yesterday I saw the acclaimed Michael Clayton, an eastern western. This
time the bad guy is a woman, chief counsel to a nasty polluting international
conglomerate. Will the good man, Michael Clayton, under financial and emotional
siege, resist temptation and stand up for the right, like Gary Cooper and Van
Heflin and Humphrey Bogart before him? What do you think? Will it spoil anyone's
appreciation of Michael Clayton if I hint that George Clooney finds his place in
the long line of inarticulate American heroes?

Here's the paradoxical upshot: there's less of the old 3:10 to Yuma in the new
3:10 to Yuma than there is old 3:10 to Yuma in the new Michael Clayton.

Title: "Cautionary" Songs of the 1950s
Date: March 03, 2008

A while back, I recalled that during the late 1940s and early 1950s, students
at P. S. 217 in Flatbush were force fed patriotic and religious music. I've now
remembered (perhaps it's the DHA) that we were also indoctrinated with songs
that could be called "cautionary."  For example: do not chase a bouncing ball
into the street, because while you could get a new ball, but "you can't always
get a new leg."

I also remember a lyric in which we were exhorted to solicit divine
intervention, and which contained these deistic lines: "Pray in any language, to
Him they all are dear/ Pray for it is music to His ear." It was this same song,
I believe, in which we were allowed the ecumenical freedom to pray "in temple,
mosque, or tabernacle,/ He won't need to search."  (I had heard of temples, but
the word "mosque" was beyond my ken and "tabernacle" was a complete mystery,
though it had warm associations with "pumpernickel.")

Does anyone out there in Bloglandia remember either of these songs?  Or other
cautionary songs from the old days? They don't google. Any information or
citations will be much appreciated.

Incidentally, despite the well-meant advice, I pursued many a rubber ball into
the street. Nor was I ever once moved to pray in a consecrated building, except
perhaps in Ebbets Field, and then only in tough ninth-inning situations.

Title: Sweet and Lowdown
Date: March 08, 2008

Woody Allen's Sweet and Lowdown is a sentimental love story with an unhappy
ending.  Like most of Allen's works, it has become a far better work of art
with a few years on its back than it seemed on first viewing (1999) -- probably
because audiences habitually come to the Woodman's films with the mouth set
for wisecracks and one-liners.  Woody's films grow on you;  some day, when
the fuss has died down, their emotional range and artistry will be better
recognized.

The lovers in Sweet and Lowdown are Emmett Ray, who talks constantly but says
very little, and Emmett's girlfriend Hattie, who is mute but miraculously
expressive.  Emmett is a shallow, vain, brittle, damaged bit of goods who
exempts himself from emotion and human connection with the assertion that he's
an "artist."  Hattie is said to be dull-witted but whether she is or not we
don't know.  We do know that she's a woman of great appetites: for sex, for
food, for music.  Emmett cannot acknowledge that she's his best audience and he
runs like the wind when it's revealed that she loves him.  The climax of the
film is inarticulate: all Emmett can manage is "I've made a mistake."  Viewers,
however, can easily fill in the gaps.

It's a fine and lovely movie, well worth the re-seeing if only for the music and
the affectionate re-creation of the 30s jazz scene.  And also for the acting. 
Sean Penn twists his face into an expression of perpetual dissatisfaction.  His
Emmett Ray, except for a redeeming moment or two, is horrid and knows it.  On
the other side of the coin, Samantha Morton is transcendent as the vulnerable
but resilient Hattie.

See Sweet and Lowdown for what it is.  It's not a farce;  it's not raucus. 
Don't look to it for more than it offers or for something other than it
offers.  It's sufficient unto itself.

Title: Away From Her/Fiona Andersson/Julie Christie
Date: March 10, 2008

Away From Her explores the infinitely sorrowful subject of early-onset
Alzheimer's. Fiona Andersson, in her vigorous mid-sixties, has begun to lose
her way and to forget names; she stores the frying pan in the refrigerator. She
thinks that she’s “beginning to disappear.” Fiona’s plight is worrisome
to every human being but it is especially disturbing to people of her own and of
Julie Christie's generation.

Here in our home we still manage to find appropriate places for the cooking
utensil, mostly.  Nevertheless, things happen. We set out to purchase six
items at the market and come home with just three. We have three errands to
perform and we arrive back home with two of the tasks undone. We put the camera
in a special secure place and then spend a couple of hours searching for it.
Keys and lists and books and tickets regularly evaporate or disintegrate or
dematerialize.  Are these forgettings normal or are we en route to something
that is too horrible to contemplate?

We exercise, we eat carefully, we gulp those horrid fish oil boluses. Perhaps
these defensive procedures have value. Perhaps we'll be the ones to dodge the
Alzheimer bullet.  Perhaps we won't.

It doesn’t help that we spend many hours a week at the facility where the Aged
Parent is incarcerated. We encounter people just like Fiona -- or the remnants
of them -- every day.  They're hollow shells, slumped in the wheelchair or
poking at the boiled-to-mush food. The angry ones, the ones with dead eyes, the
ones who moan all day long, “help me.” Better the Seconal and applesauce,
the ice floe, or the bullet in the brain than to live in such horrible oblivion.

In Away From Her, Julie Christie is entirely persuasive as the alzheimered
Fiona. But let me ask you, friends of a certain age-cohort, is it really
possible that that gray old lady was Julie Christie? Here’s a woman I’ve
known for forty-five years, ever since she was Liz for thirty incandescent
seconds in Billy Liar -- and feckless Billy was too much of a jerkass coward
to run away with her. Julie and I have had a long (albeit entirely one-sided)
relationship.  I was dazzled by her when she was the voracious Diana Scott in
Darling and I feared for her when she was Laura Baxter in Nicholas Roeg’s
scary-as-all-hell Don't Look Now.  She was my favorite Gertrude. But Fiona
Andersson is outside any recognizable trajectory;  she's too raw, too
dislocating to my tender sense of the way things ought to be.  No, Julie will
always be Liz to me.  I've held on to that first image for most of my adult
life.

I have no intention of progressing to the "second floor," or to sunset village
or to memory lane or to however they euphemize the place that they put the folks
with clogged synapses, but, if I should find myself in such a state, let's hope
that it won't be Fiona but Liz to whom the brain clings.

Title: What Happened at the County Assembly
Date: March 16, 2008

At the precinct caucus last month, I was chosen to be a delegate to the county
assembly.  The assembly is where we Dems nominate candidates for county-wide
offices (and do a lot of other business, using procedures that are obscure to
veterans and incomprehensible to first-time attendees).  Yesterday, we filled
the Skyline High School auditorium with 1600 delegates, at least three-quarters
of whom were young, impatient pro-Obama initiates.  It was exciting and even
more chaotic than usual.

All of the local Dem incumbents were re-nominated without opposition, but there
were some open and contested seats: a state senator, a university regent, and,
the big one, a congressman (our longtime representative Mark Udall is making a
run for the U. S. Senate).  And also the Clinton-Obama showdown, but that event
wasn't held at the morning county assembly but reserved for the afternoon county
convention, to which I was not credentialed.

I was in place at 7:15 A.M, handing out leaflets and stickers for Rollie Heath,
a candidate whom I'm supporting for state senator.  Politicking inures you to
rejection.  Some delegates for the other candidate, Cindy Carlisle, wouldn't
accept my piece of paper; they acted as though it would compromise their
integrity to read or even to touch my pamphlet.  Sometimes they were downright
and inexcusably rude, even though we're all Dems and all in the same family.

The new attendees didn't seem to realize that before we could get to Obama,
we had to carry out the business of local government.  I heard occasional
grumbling and a lot of puzzlement and confusion.  But in compensation there
were some rousing addresses:  Ken Salazar, our middle-of-the-road Senator,
adapting to his audience, emphasized his liberal side.  I'm skeptical of
Salazar, but better a centrist Democrat than a benighted Republican.

Eventually we voted.  The morning results were predictable.  My candidate for
state office came in second but qualified for the party primary, which is in
August.  The race will be a marathon.  But the good news is that whoever wins
the nomination won't have a Republican opponent -- the other side is punting on
state senator.  The Repubs are also surrending the congressional seat, where
Fitz-Gerald won over Polis;  there will be a three-way Democratic primary
(Shafroth is "not going the caucus route" but petitioning on -- I said that
it's  complicated).

In the afternoon, Obama had a smashing 3-1 win over Clinton.

Here's the million-dollar question:  will the Obama enthusiasm carry over to
the general election?  Will the young 'uns who turned out yesterday still
be around in October to donate, to walk the precincts, stuff the envelopes,
make the phone calls?  Or are they just in it for the glamor of the moment? 
Colorado's now in play; it's a swing state.  We could go blue. But not unless
Bush-disgust, Obama- love translates into weeks and months hard work.

Title: My Campaign for City Council
Date: March 16, 2008

It's election season once again. I'm thinking of making a run for city council
in our progessive western town. Here's my new platform, voters.

1.  NO LEAF BLOWERS.  Rationale: it's a horrible noisy unecological machine that can easily be replaced with a broom. And everyone knows that single-stroke engines are major polluters.

2.  ALL MALL PERFORMERS MUST BE JURIED. Rationale: no more off-key singing. No more bad juggling.  No more ugly balloon animals. No more noisy drummers or whining didgeredoos.

3.  EVERY RESTAURANT MUST KEEP A PIG. Rationale: a perfect. ecologically-sound solution to the waste food problem. Come to think of it, let's require a piggery of all institutions with lunchrooms, such as high schools and hospitals. Let's fatten up those porkers, turn them into bacon and savory spare ribs.

4.  NO "HOLIDAY" LIGHTS. Rationale: waste of electricity and other scarce resources. Global warming. Bad taste. Bad theology. Bauble-olatry.

5.  NEW ANNUAL HOLIDAY: Charles Darwin's birthday, February 12. Rationale: uncontroversial celebration of a great thinker. (I reject out of hand those extremists who propose to celebrate Darwin's birthday on December 25. I'm a uniter, not a divider.)

6.  NO MUSIC WRITTEN AFTER 1897. Rationale: obvious. Why 1897?  Death of Johannes Brahms. Also, no amplified music of any kind in an automobile that is audible outside the vehicle. Higher fines and jail terms hip hop and for excessively patriotic "country."

7.  NO SMOKERS.  Rationale:  lung cancer, heart attacks, emphysema, ashes, disgusting odor, cigarette litter. Note: not "no smoking"-- "no smokers." No going outside of city limits to light up and then re-entering.

8.  NO VISIBLE TATTOOS. Why only "visible "tattoos?  Because whole-body inspections might be considered intrusive by squishy civil libertarians. Also, no nose rings, navel rings, or other bodily piercings. Except earrings. I rather like earrings. But no more than one per ear.

9.  ANNUAL JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL PRAIRIE DOG SHOOT AND BARBECUE. Let them kids exercise their Second Amendment rights; eliminate them pesky varmints;  learn to cook. One platform position, three social benefits.

10. NO DOGS PERMITTED WITHIN CITY LIMITS. Rationale: fatal dog attacks, dog bites, barking dogs, whining dogs, ubiquitous dog "waste," dogs carrying on in parks and open space, the goopy indulgence of dog "guardians," the ecological disaster of dog food. But what about seeing-eye dogs, you ask?  Well, that's a slippery slope, ain't it. Sorry folks, no dogs (except for purposes of vivisection).

11.  NO MORE COLLEGE FOOTBALL. Rationale: I don't like college football.

12.  NO "FACILITATORS" WITH WHITEBOARDS OR FLIPCHARTS AT OFFICIAL MEETINGS. Goodness gracious, do I ever hate those things.

That's about it. I feel that I have my finger on the pulse of the
electorate. It's going to be a landslide. Tell me that life won't be better as
soon as we enact these new laws.

Title: Irene Nemirovsky's Fire in the Blood
Date: March 21, 2008

Irene Nemirovsky's spare but luminous novella, Fire in the Blood, is set in an
out-of-the-way French village a few years before the start of World War II. 
Just as the plot is beginning to come to a boil, the author interjects an easy-
to-overlook but very telling incident.  "A car full of Parisians arrived and
stopped in front of the Hotel des Voyaguers. 'It's so quiet,' one woman said." 
The automobile and its condescending passengers soon drive on and Nemirovsky,
speaking through her narrator, offers her readership a few words of guidance: 
"How many peaceful sleepy places they'll drive through tonight, how many sleepy
villages.... They'll pass silent sombre country estates and will not begin to
imagine the dark secret life within -- a life they will never come to know."

In Fire in the Blood, Nemirovky's subject is Issy-l'Eveque and its "dark secret
life."  As it turns out, there is as much mystery and passion in this corner
of rural Burgundy as in Paris or any other modern metropolis.  In fact, the
yearnings and loves and jealousies and inhibitions of these patronized village
folk soon achieve nothing less than tragic proportion.

Fire in the Blood resists easy classification. It's a satire, a novel of
manners, a mystery, and also a romance. Nemirovsky manages to depict an entire
society in little -- not only its ingrained customs, but the resistance to those
customs.

Not to spoil the story, but here's the situation: unmarried old Uncle Sylvio,
after many years abroad, has returned home to the village of his birth.  His
upstanding young niece Colette marries a local miller named Jean Dorin.  A
couple of years later, Jean Dorin falls into the river and drowns.  Uncle
Silvio happens to know that his niece has been carrying on an affair and he
also knows that her young lover has been visiting not just Colette but also
Brigitte Declos, an attractive woman married to an elderly farmer.  From this
beginning, the story takes a series of winding and unanticipated turns.  But
Nemirovsky is not content merely to complicate the plot. Her quarry is larger: 
it's the moral and psychological ramifications of Issy-l'Eveque's mysteries. 
Indeed, the story, the plot ends thirty pages before the novel comes to a close,
and revelations that at first seem like a coda became a climax. It's a little
miracle that Nemirovsky has created a story that manages to be both a wicked
satire of rural complacency and an exhortation to a more full life.

I've now read Fire in the Blood twice, the second time with great care.  The
novella was more intricate, more carefully plotted the second time than I had
noticed or appreciated.  Unless I'm deceiving myself, this is one heck of a
piece of writing.  I'm dazzled.

Irene Nemirovsky was thirty-nine years old when she was murdered at Auschwitz in
1942.  She wrote Fire in the Blood in 1940.  Thought to have been lost, the
manuscript was discovered in an old valise and the novella published for the
first time in 2007.

How many more stories might Nemirovksy have told?  How much more life might she
have lived?

Title: The Kent Theater/ Sex
Date: March 23, 2008

I can't recommend Marion Meade's The Unruly Life of Woody Allen (New York,
2000), which I too hastily snatched off the library shelf. Written at the
tabloid height of the Woody-Mia-Soon-yi fracas, it masquerades as a biography
but in truth it's nothing more than scandalmongery.

Before it gets down in the dirt, however, Unruly Life offers a quick summary of
Allen’s life, a matter of which I was largely ignorant. Of course I knew that
Allen was a Brooklyn boy who grew up in the old neighborhood. Allen Koenigsberg
attended P. S. 99 on East 10 Street near Avenue K (where my cousin Louie was
also a student). In addition, I knew, from Louie, that P. S. 99's principal was
Eudora Fletcher and that, in the very inventive chameleon movie, Woody gave Ms.
Fletcher's name to the psychiatrist who takes Zelig under her wing.

But cousin Louie did not know, or did not bother to tell me, that Allen was a
frequent patron of the Kent Theater on Coney Island Avenue and that it's rumored
that it was at the Kent that the interior scenes in The Purple Rose of Cairo
were filmed. I've seen Purple Rose recently and if it wasn't the Kent, it sure
looks like the Kent of my memory. The Kent, along with its sister theater, the
Leader, was one of my own childhood haunts. In fact, it was my father’s aunt
Manya, substitute cashier, who sometimes sat in the box office and took my
quarter.

It was not at the Kent but at the Jewel Theater on Kings Highway that Allen
encountered Ingmar Bergman for the first time. Well, not exactly Bergman
himself. It was Harriet Andersson disrobing in Summer with Monika that seems to
have caught Allen's attention. Unruly Life reports that Allen sat “with eyes
bulging” to watch this and other early Bergman films.

Allen’s protruding orbs brought to mind the impact that those shocking 1950s
Scandinavian films had on the days of my early adolescence. It was at the Kent
(aunt Manya must not have been on duty that day) that I once watched a Danish
film in which there was a very brief flash of a woman in naked silhouette. All I
can remember is that I sat through to watch the picture again -- it might even
have been a double feature -- and that by the time the silhouette appeared a
second time, my poor bladder was so swollen (I was afraid to leave my seat for
fear of missing the moment) that it was about to rupture. How embarrassing it
would have been to die of an aneurysm of the urinary tract simply to catch a
glimpse of Harriet Andersson or one of her friends.

In the 1950s, naked bodies were simply not on view. Never at all, at least not
in my slice of the universe. I doubt that anyone from the post-Vietnam, post-
sexual-revolution generation can imagine how nude-deprived were those severely
repressed years. Bodies, women's bodies, were so rare and mysterious that a
brief and evanescent flash of shadowed skin, circa 1953, could remain in the
memory for more than fifty years.

Which is why I retain the warmest feelings for Coney Island Avenue's Kent
Theater.

Title: What We Read in the Fifties:  Mutiny on the Bounty
Date: March 24, 2008

Aficionados of this blague will remember that Dr. M. occasionally revisits
books that were notorious in the days of his unnaturally elongated adolescence.
Here’s a small sample of the novels that Dr. M has reported upon: I the Jury,
King Solomon's Mines, The Caine Mutiny, Blackboard Jungle, The Amboy Dukes, Lord
of the Flies, Catcher in the Rye, Scaramouche. It’s quite the roster, isn't
it, of time-sensitive material.

Some of these novels have worn astonishingly well. Others are merely
astonishing: what in the world could I (or the drab Eisenhower-era sensibility,
for that matter) have possibly found worthwhile in most of these colossally
dated and inartistic fictions?

To extend my anti-nostalgia, I’ve now tackled, for the first time in more
than fifty years, a novel that enthralled the heck out of me back then. It’s
Nordhoff and Hall’s Mutiny on the Bounty, first published in 1932 but widely
read at least through the 1950s. Why was I so infatuated? Certainly not because
of the novelists’ skill. The story of the tyrannical Captain Bligh, the
Byronic rebel Fletcher Christian, the mutiny, the open boat, and the settlement
of Pitcairn offered the opportunity to engage all the important themes: family,
power, sex and love, religion, sanity, rebellion, technology, colonialism and
cultural conflict. But N and H fell far miles short of the mark – not only did
they write gawky sentences, but they also left gaping holes in the plot, created
disappointingly shallow characters, and failed to explore the opportunities for
thoughtful commentary. The novel is swift and superficial and clumsy.  It’s
not for all time; it’s for the supermarket checkout stand.

Nevertheless, there’s little mystery as to why the novel captured this
Brooklynites's youthful fancy. What adolescent would demand artistry from a
novel that is awash with exoticism, romance, and sex?

Let us consider the following piece of reheated anthropological observation.
Midshipman Byam (the story is cunningly told through the eyes of a juvenile
narrator) attends a Tahitian entertainment at which young women perform a dance
“believed by the Indians (i.e. Tahitians) to ensure the fertility of the
crops.”

The dress of the dancers consisted of no more than a wreath of flowers and green
leaves about their waists, and the dance itself, in which they stood in two
lines of three, face to face, was of a nature so unbelievably wanton that no
words could convey the least idea of it.

“No more than a wreath of flowers about their waists?”  Does that
mean…?  Holy smoke. “Unbelievably wanton?"  Exactly how wanton is that? 
What in the censorious world did these young ladies actually do?  They
didn’t…?   No, they couldn't. “No words could convey….”

What grand openings did N and H leave to be filled by an inexperienced but
lascivious imagination!

And how does Midshipman Byam deal with such provocations?  Good luck for him as
well as for all the randy young readers who identified with his circumstances. 
Byam takes as his eager concubine a young Tahitian woman. “Slenderly and
strongly made, in the first bloom of young womanhood, and with her magnificent
dark hair unbound, Maimiti made a picture worth traveling far to behold.”

OK, so I fell for it.  Sure it was contrived and manipulative.  But I was
thirteen or so years old, living in concrete, subwayed, bepigeoned Flatbush
where young ladies danced not in wreaths of flowers but in stiff and forbidding
crinolines. Exactly how many fertility ceremonies had I attended?  I was
exoticism-deprived.

I’m just slightly embarrassed to admit that I did not just read Mutiny on the
Bounty and call it a day.  Not at all.  Instead, I read everything that I
could find about Bligh and Christian and Pitcairn Island and even about Norfolk
Island, where the mutineers relocated after Pitcairn became overpopulated. I
became something of an expert on the geography of these islands. I also took to
reading about nineteenth-century sailing vessels, and though an arrant land-
lubber, I could accurately, in those days, define taffrail, yardarm, orlop,
lanyard, hawse-hole, gimbal, lanyard, poop, mizzen.

Nor was it all erotic displacement. Although I began with Nordhoff and Hall, I
later read Cook and Bouganville and eventually moved on to the writings of Mead
and Malinowski and others in that pioneering generation of anthropologists. 
Of course I didn't understand much and have long forgotten what I read -- but
neither Maimiti "with magnificent dark hair unbound" nor that unbelievably
wanton ceremony ever entirely evaporated from my susceptible, impressionable
young brain.

Title: A Parable for Teachers of Writing
Date: March 29, 2008

My good friend Professor L---- is an eminent scholar of American literature
and an upstanding  teacher at the University of C------.  A few months ago,
Professor L------ told me the following story. I repeat it unvarnished and
unadorned -- a curious but instructive anecdote from the trenches of learning.
Some years ago, on the last day of the semester, a student approached my friend
and gushed:  "Oh, Professor L-----, I just want to tell you what a great course
this was, and what a great teacher you are. I learned so much. Especially about
writing. I really really appreciated all the thoughtful comments you made on
my papers. You were so helpful. I feel like I've made a great deal of progress
with my writing. I have just one question. Why do you always write "frog,"
"frog," "frog" all over the margins of my essays?"This anecdote raises a number
of questions. The most obvious: if the student thought that Professor L -----
was afflicted with some sort of obscure batrachian obsession, why didn't she
raise the point with him or with the proper medical authorities?  Poor child,
she must have been both mystified and intimidated.However, it's not the student
but the teacher who should profit from this parable. Here are a few of its many
moralia.If you're a teacher of writing, don't assume that any student knows the
difference between a sentence and a fragment. Or even knows that there is such a
thing as a fragment. Don't assume that just because you have written something
that you think is helpful in the margin of an essay that therefore a student a)
reads it, b) understands it) or c) profits from it. Even more important:  don't
imagine that enthusiastic praise from a middling student has the slightest value
-- it's simple vanity to think so. In fact, better not to build any structure,
however slight, on a foundation of student regard.

And finally: mind your minims.

Title: News from Alameda
Date: March 31, 2008

We’re in Alameda, California, for ten days, visiting the grandchildren and
also their parents. The big news here is that the Alameda public schools
are in a money crunch. The root cause is Proposition 13, the granddaddy of
pernicious tax-limiting amendments (we have one in Colorado, too -- it’s
paralyzed us). The immediate precipitant of the Alameda crisis is Governor
Schwarzenegger’s plan to balance the budget by cutting brazillions of dollars
out of the education budget. Public-spirited citizens in the island city
have responded by proposing a supplementary “parcel tax” -- most people
say property tax –- of $120 per "parcel" of real estate to help the school
district survive these dark days. To me, the tax supplement is an imperfect but
obvious fix.  Public schools must be supported, and if the state shirks its
responsibility, local effort must ride to the rescue.

There’s the usual testy opposition: too much fat in the budget; teachers are
overpaid; school board is incompetent; bad planning. I know enough about public
education's lean diet not to be swayed.

What gets my goat is that some of the arguments against the supplement are just
plain mean. Here’s an example. A local curmudgeon named Guy Smith has written
a guest opinion in the Alameda Journal under the heading: “Make Parents Pay
for Child’s Education,” His gist: “It is no longer appropriate to tax
childless homes for public education.” And also:  people who support such
taxes suffer from “collectivist mentalities."

And here I thought that the American constitution had in its preamble a phrase
about promoting the “general" and not just the individual welfare. No doubt 
Mr. Smith would stigmatize Madison and Jefferson as early collectivists.

The argument that the childless need not contribute to education is flimsy  --
so slight that it’s hard to believe that it’s argued in good faith and is
not just a rationale for skinflintism. Does Mr. Smith think that he shouldn’t
pay for the fire department or the police department, except on the days that he
happens to use them?

Does he think that he doesn’t profit from the educational system because he
has no children in school. He can read and write. Did he teach himself?  He’s
sitting at a computer, designed by someone with an education. His chair and his
table and his coffee and the cup out of which he drinks his coffee were designed
or planned or imported or constructed or distributed by people who could read
and write and figure. Take away the learning of his predecessors and members of
his own age-cohort and Mr. Smith would be out there chasing squirrels with a
flint hand-ax. And whining about the cost of the clan-supplied flint.

The essence of  Mr. Smith’s argument is selfish and narcissistic  --
“I’ve got mine – you take care of  yourself.”  It’s shallow, vulgar
libertarianism.

It's a shame that these nay sayers need to be reminded that we’re all in this
together. We’re interconnected -- a tissue of tessellations.

Even Mr. Smith must know, deep in his heart, that when he promotes the general
welfare, he improves his own lot. In fact, the parcel tax will be the best
investment he’ll ever make.

Title: Tamim Ansary's West of Kabul, East of New York
Date: April 02, 2008

Some months ago, I reported on Hosseini's very popular novel of Afghanistan, The
Kite Runner. I thought it was a must-read-bad-book, that is, a book that is so
informative and interesting that we should overlook its inferior construction
and prose. I've now read another Afghan-American story and I have come to much
the same opinion. Tamin Ansary's West of Kabul, East of New York (FSG, 2002)
is swift and likable and necessary, but oh so very disappointing. Ansary is an
author of children's books, and, perhaps out of habit his prose is so guileless
that it seems aimed not at adults but at a junior high school audience.

Ansary's is the familiar story of an immigrant (this time half Afghani, half
Finnish-American) stranded between two cultures. His transformation may be a
little harder than most because Islam can be an inflexible integument. It's sad
to read that Ansary's brother has become a fanatical fundamentalist who has
embraced some contrary-to-reason, contrary-to-the facts-of-history dogmas. It's
even more discouraging to read of Ansary's encounter with an Egyptian cab-driver
in New York City, who says, "Thank God for the Taliban. I hate America. The
sluts.The booze. The filth. In Egypt, I am a lawyer. I can't earn enough to
support my family, so I come here for six months a year. But I never bring my
wife. I don't want her to get polluted. One of my friends brought his wife
here, and you know what she said to him. 'Don't touch me anymore.' You know
what I would do to my wife if she ever said that to me. I would take her to
the country, I would dig a hole, I would put her in that hole...."   Ansary
is a responsible and rational being and of course he's appalled and I think
embarrassed by the hatred and misogyny that he encounters in that cab. Let us
hope that it's not the angry cabbies but the Ansarys who will prevail  -- in
Islam as well as in closer-to-home religions.

Title: A Corner in Alameda
Date: April 04, 2008

Over there on the west side of Alameda, at the intersection of 9th and Santa
Clara, plunked down right in the midst of an otherwise residential neighborhood,
is a most intriguing commercial island. Once upon a time, I'm sure, it would
have consisted of (let me guess) a hardware store, a mom-and-pop grocery, a
haberdashery or a shoe store, and a gas station. Now it's a fully  contemporary
American mish-mash.

The gas station has been converted into the Islamic Center of Alameda. Where
there would once have been a sign advertising Esso, there's now the harder-to-
parse motto "there is no God but Allah, the self-sustaining, eternal."
Directly across the street from the mosquette is a second store-front worship-
opportunity, the Love Fellowship Church of God in Christ. Here pride of place
goes not to Allah but to "Pastor Elder Samuel Butler," or "Pastor Elder Samuel
Bulter," depending on which hand-painted sign you put your faith. Kitty-corner
to Love Fellowship is Dance 10, no longer a shoe store, but now a venue where
budding toe-tappers are instructed in "Hop. Lyrical. Modern. Musical. Theater.
Jazz. Tap. Ballet. Acrobatics. Hip-hop."  On the fourth corner, there's a
"convenience" store, where outsized neon signs advertise "Budweiser" and
"Tecate."

It's a comprehensive assemblage: feed your soul (for them as believe they have
one), feed your feet, feed your gullet.

Title: Advice for Writers
Date: April 13, 2008

One of this blague's more inquisitive readers is a talented young journalist who
knows that before Vivian de St. Vrain morphed into Dr. Metablog, he had spent
a lifetime either bent unproductively over the ball point or wearily pounding
on the word-processor. The young reader has asked this question:  what have
decades of practice taught you, Dr. M., about the craft of writing?  And in
response, Dr. M. has peered soulwise and discovered -- not a heck of a lot.

Yet in all fairness, the curious reader's question is flattering and deserves
a response. And therefore Dr. M. has pondered and pondered and has now refined
the drossy deposits that clog his brainal synapses into as much wisdom as he
feels qualified to dispense. (Let us be clear -- the advice that follows is not
meant to be argumentative or prescriptive or know-it-all. Different writers do
things in different ways. The precepts that are offered here may not apply to
all writing; they describe only the Way of the Metablog.)

Let us assume that the seeker of advice brings to the table intelligence and
information and a point of view -- but needs a little coaching on tactics. Point
one:

Just as I respect the first tenet of real estate -- location, location, location
-- so I subscribe to the most important (but often neglected) rule of writing,
which is

A)  plot, plot, plot, plot, plot. The writer must tell a story. People
relish stories, respond to narrative, and are most engaged when they pursue a
plot's twists and turns. Just because it's non-fiction, doesn't mean that the
story- teller's bag of tricks cannot be accessed. Fortunately, every piece of
prose from the briefest anecdote to the most convoluted intellectual argument
can and should be structured as a narrative. In non-fiction, the first rule
of plotting is to "establish the enigma." The enigma need not be a formal
question, but it's indisputable that every essay answers either an explicit or
an unspoken question. Is not every writer free to shape that implicit inquiry
to his own purposes? And in the process of delivering an answer, is he not also
free to sprinkle clues (some of them red herrings) along the path? And also
at liberty to let his readers dangle until the moment comes to gratify their
curiosity--and while they dangle, to let them endure suspense; suspense that can
be intensified by teasing the reader about what's going to happen next? And
every once in a while, to spring a surprise by veering off on an unanticipated
or even misleading tangent? Nor is there anything wrong with the judicious
flashback, the flash forward, or the deceptive digression -- tricks of the trade
that have won the laurel since the bronze age, centuries before the time when
"establish the enigma" became the watchword. Remember: "all writing is fiction,
especially non-fiction."

Connoisseurs of storytelling know that the most indispensable element in any
narrative is climax. Because climax is so essential, it must be exploited to the
full, not just on the universal level but also on the particular, and therefore

B)  every sentence should achieve climax. As a general rule, the climax should
come in the sentence's last phrase, or better still, in its final climactic
word. The crucial, contributing part of every sentence, the idea which it
strives to convey, the very target of its forward motion, should, whenever
artistically feasible, come dead last. When this precept is honored, each
sentence becomes an arrow aimed at its own natural target. And it follows
as night the day, that every paragraph should also come to climax--and that
the climax of the paragraph should be its own last sentence. So designed,
sentences and paragraphs carry within them both the exciting pressure of forward
motion and also coherence of argument. There's an ancillary benefit: when a
sentence terminates in a climax, transitions become less awkward, because the
intellectual content (or logic) of sentence B begins just where sentence A left
off, and the logic of sentence C starts where B concludes. Sentences and logic
coalesce and become as one. This maxim, true for sentences, is even more true
for paragraphs. And therefore it follows that a practiced writer, making deft
use of climax, can easily

C)  avoid ungainly mechanical transitions, such as "nevertheless," "moreover,
"on the other hand," and even that offensive bit of pop neojargonianism, "having
said that" -- for these fillers are words that constrict the thoroughfare of
thought. Of course there will be times when such connectives usefully signal a
switch in direction, but for the most part, transitions between sentences and
paragraphs should not be mechanical, i.e. by the use of conjunctive phrases and
adverbs, but logical. Logical transitions need not rely on distracting howevers,
however easy and tempting it might be to employ them. The best transitions
are transparent or, even better, invisible. If a writer studies his sentences
and is compelled to admit that they are only linked by banausic connectives,
then he must judge whether the argument he offers is truly coherent or whether
its logical weaknesses have been plastered over with rhetorical flimflammery.
Any writer who wants his prose to be persuasive will profit by examining his
connectives. And while the writer is engaged in such scrutiny, he should also
check to see that he has

D)  transferred important concepts from nouns and adjectives into verbs. And
by verbs, I mean verbs of vigor--not copulatives, passives, or colorless
neutral words like seem, appear, make, or do. I mean verbs with punch, or
better still, verbs that punch. In revising a sentence, it's a good idea to
determine whether it's the nouns and their modifiers that bear the brunt of
the argument. If they are doing more than their fair share of the labor,
then it is mandatory to reconfigure the sentence so that the verbs strain and
lift and carry. A paragraph rich in colorful verbs is active and infectious
and engaging; a paragraph loaded with nouns and modifiers can be clotted and
static. Strong verbs keep things moving. They keep the plot in gear. They add
grit and heft. And so does the related process whereby

E)  generalizations and abstractions are replaced by instances and examples.
Let me provide an example. A friend, a large man who has always savored his
sauce Bearnaise, wrote this sentence to me: "My doctor--an Asian woman who
weighs about fifteen pounds--has been hectoring me about my reluctance to
subsist on twigs and grasses." What an excellent sentence -- not just because
of the colorful verbs ("hector," "subsist"), the ironic faux-hyperbole ("about
fifteen pounds") or the fact that the sentence rises to a splendid climax,
but because of the specificity of "twigs and grasses." A lesser writer might
have, instead of "subsist on twigs and grasses," employed a bland formula such
as "go on a diet" or "become a vegetarian." But by using the concrete "twigs
and grasses" for the abstract "diet" or "vegetarian," my correspondent has
not only caught our attention and amused us, but he has created a metaphor.
"Twigs and grasses" is specific and visual and memorable. While these nouns
stand for "diet" and "vegetarian," they also stand for whatever penumbra of
meaning my friend's readers bring to the interpretation of these words. In my
own case, it's a irresistible vision of a big guy metamorphosed into a large
twitchy-nostrilled rabbit nibbling the bark of willows. Such is the paradox
of the metaphor: the more specific the word, the more spacious the liberty of
interpretation. Poets know this instinctively; that's why they're poets. But
remember, writers: metaphor is only one of a bucketload of figures of speech.
The astute writer does not limit himself to metaphor alone, but remembers
to     F)  use figures of speech of all kinds: pun, simile, alliteration,
oxymoron, parataxis, hyperbole, understatement or litotes, irony, metonymy
(where an individual stands for a class), synecdoche (where a part signifies the
whole), aposiopesis -- I could go on and on!  It's the figure of speech that
keeps things lively, that makes prose sparkle and that make readers, already
enthralled with plot and dazzled by recurrent exciting climaxes, fully engage
with the written word.  After all, writing has no value unless it attracts and
holds the reader. And so it follows that a writer must, finally,

G)  know and respect his readership. He must provide all the information that
a reader needs to follow the argument. Yet at the same time, he must resist the
temptation to be over-explicit. Let readers do some of the work. Let them
complete the connections that the writer only suggests. It will keep them on
their toes, make them feel intelligent, and retain their interest. And while
they're so engaged, the writer might remind himself of another precept, which
is to try to

H)  make syntax and logic work together. Get them on the same track. Put the
main idea in the main clause, put subordinate ideas in subordinate clauses. Put
the parenthetical idea in a parenthetical clause. Put parallel ideas in parallel
clauses, but when ideas are not parallel, emphasize their incompatibility by
using contrasting syntactic structure. Syntax is a tool. Sentences in which
logic is chugging onward and syntax is all over the map can be confusing and
even impenetrable. Alexander Pope said about poetry, "The sound should be an
echo to the sense."  In prose, the syntax should be an echo to the sense; or
rather, the sense should be an echo to the syntax; or even better, the syntax
and the sense should take each other's hand and dance the same dance. And
finally (and this time the "finally" is not meant to be misleading),

I)  scrutinize every word and see if it is necessary or whether it can either
be omitted or made more precise. When in doubt, throw it out. Or amend it. It
should be a maxim that in good writing, no one ever "walks down the street."
And by "walks down the street," I certainly do not mean "walk down the street."
"Walks down the street" is a metaphor for a colorless expression. Why should
someone walk down the street, when he can totter, or saunter, or sashay, or
hurtle, or trot, or swagger, or stagger, or promenade down an avenue, boulevard,
lane, causeway, footpath, or promenade?  English overflows with words that are
specific, evocative, and suggestive. Let's have fewer street-walkers and more
sidewalk-promenaders. Keats said the the poet should "load every rift with ore,"
and so should the writer of non-fiction. But be careful not to overload; don't
allow prose to slide toward the baroque. And at last

J)   feel perfectly free to ignore the canard that you were taught in grade
school  --that every piece of writing needs a conclusion.  It doesn't.  As a
general rule, avoid formal conclusions.

Title: Williamsburg Bridge/ Naked City
Date: April 14, 2008

On two occasions this year the Williamsburg Bridge (from Manhattan to Brooklyn)
has made a guest appearance in the plot of my life.

In January, as faithful readers know, we set up shop in Manhattan. One day we
strolled over the bridge from the Lower East Side to the Williamsburg section of
Brooklyn. The bridge is a splendid monument of nineteenth-century technology and
the view from above is spacious and commanding. It's a restless, busy path from
one side to another; all around you, automobiles, subway trains, bicyclists,
runners, baby carriages -- the works. NYC in a Victorian nutshell.

Then, a few days ago, came the news of the death of Jules Dassin. Dassin is
famous for Never on Sunday and Topkapi, but as movie-lovers know, he was a
polished director of films noirs during the 1940s -- before Nixon, McCarthy,
and the blacklisting boys drove him into exile. We decided to embark on a
Jules Dassin festival and tribute right here on our very own giant TV. Our
first choice was Naked City (1949), a highly un-subversive policier, markedly
patriotic but disturbing because all the bad guys are vaguely "ethnic." The
climactic scenes of Naked City were shot in the Lower East Side (just where the
Williamsburg Bridge hits Delancey). The murderer/wrestler/harmonicat Willie
Garzah attempts to flee. A voice shouts, "he's on Norfolk near Rivington."
Right where we had just a few months ago wandered! It's right off the bridge!
And then Garzah panics and tries to escape by running across the Williamsburg
into Brooklyn. Police in pursuit, squad cars, pistols, shouting, shots. Garzah
climbs the girders--the very same girders, which, just a few months before, I
had decided to honor my acrophobia by not climbing. And then he's wounded, and,
as always in the movies, falls theatrically to his death.

It's peculiar, isn't it, when a store or a street-corner that you know in real
life appears in the movies. Does it mean that film tells the truth, is real,
or does the celluloid appearance provide us with some evidence that our own
life is genuine? Why should the movies sometimes seem more substantial than
the reports of our own five senses? How can art validate life? And at the
same time, don't we feel a little cheated--in the sense that our privacy--our
uniqueness--has been violated and the things and stuff that are personal to us
have been delivered over to an unappreciative anonymous world? It's odd and
disorienting when a familiar non-fiction bridge plays a supporting role in a
fictional film.

Naked City is a good, solid, intriguing piece of work, well-paced and well-
written. I'm not entirely happy with the way it treats women or the working-
classes, but then, many such films are far more culpable. I liked best the
authentic, unstaged street shots of Manhattan as it was sixty years ago.
Delancey Street was nostalgic and poetic (although the shop signs, then lettered
in Hebrew, are now mostly Chinese).

The Williamsburg Bridge, solid and substantial, has weathered the years
extremely well. It's well positioned to star in many another film.

Title: W. B. Yeats, "An Irish Airman Foresees his Death" (1919)
Date: April 19, 2008

I know that I shall meet my fateSomewhere among the clouds above;Those that I
fight I do not hate,Those that I guard I do not love;My country is Kiltartan
Cross,My countrymen Kiltartan's poor,No likely end could bring them lossOr leave
them happier than before.Nor law, nor duty bade me fight,Nor public men, nor
cheering crowds,A lonely impulse of delightDrove to this tumult in the clouds;I
balanced all, brought all to mind,The years to come seemed waste of breath,A
waste of breath the years behindIn balance with this life, this death.

Whether the Germans or the British win the war is a matter of utter indifference
to Yeats's Irish airman. Even his own death is of no particular concern. The
pilot's detachment is Olympian. Why then does he participate in the war? The
motive, he says in the poem's most challenging phrase, is "a lonely impulse of
delight."

There is more than one historical resonance to the word "lonely." Primarily,
in this poem, it's the individual who feels himself to be separated from the
mass of mankind, which in late Romantic thought transforms him into some sort
of nascent artist. But "lonely" arises out of a second context: the solitude
experienced by the self-sufficient warrior. In this second sense, "lonely"
expresses a nostalgia for the days of chivalry or single combat that survived
into the early twentieth century only in the skies when one skilled pilot faced
another (on the ground, it was all inglorious machine guns, barbed wire, poison
gas, trench warfare, and death by dysentery). "Impulse" is also a word with
Romantic roots. Readers will recall Wordsworth's famous and extraordinarily
irrational assertion that an "impulse from a vernal wood" could be a source
of moral learning, where an "impulse" stands superior to clarity of thought
or to consistency of logic. An "impulse" is a feeling or sentiment, not an
argument, and so functions in this poem also, where the motives traditionally
advanced for going to war (loyalty, patriotism, evidence that one's country is
endangered, profit, law, duty, politics) are specifically disclaimed. For the
Irish airman, a Wordsworthian "impulse" is sufficient -- especially if it's an
impulse of "delight." "Delight" signifies the thrill of the game as opposed to
the dreariness of ordinary life, which is twice dismissed as merely "a waste of
breath." "Delight" is a word that harks back to the art-for-art's-sake movement
of Yeats's youth, though even the most prescient would not have foreseen that it
would come to describe the death-defying or, in this case, suicidal artistry of
the fighter pilot. In "An Irish Airman Foresees his Death," a "lonely impulse of
delight" counterbalances other and more conventional experiences and patterns of
thinking. Some will find the airman's reasoning immensely sad, others will judge
it to be invigorating. Yeats himself does not tip his hand.

Title: Book Report:  The Dean's List by Jon Hassler
Date: April 24, 2008

I had never heard of the novelist Jon Hassler, who died last month. The
obituaries took me by surprise: Minnesota's best artist, more significant than
the Coen brothers, or Bob Dylan, or Garrison Keillor. Or Sinclair Lewis. How
could I be so ignorant?

Off I trotted to the library, where there was a nearly pristine shelf of Hassler
novels. They were clearly virgin and untouched  -- so I'm not the only diligent
reader who is ignorant of Hassler.  From the shelf I plucked The Dean's List
(1997) and attacked it with great expectations.

I'm very sorry to report that this particular novel is a lot less exciting than
the ecstatic obituaries would have led me to believe. The Dean's List is an
academic story with a familiar cast: a  harried dean, a celebrity poet, an
overbearing mom, an elusive girlfriend -- nothing that David Lodge or Malcolm
Bradbury hasn't done with more wit and verve. Or Robertson Davies, for that
matter. Too many quirky characters; too many satirical targets. Perhaps I made
a mistake and chose the wrong Hassler novel. I'll borrow another one and report
back.

Title: Crockery
Date: April 24, 2008

I'm not a person who cares terribly about material objects. Some of the
evidence: I've now written two hundred and fifty essaylets on this blague, and
nary a one of them took as its subject a purchase or a possession.

What I've read, what I've thought, where I've traveled, people I've known, yes;
what I own, or bought, or didn't buy, no.

But in these last weeks, we're in the process of discarding and giving away
while we prepare to move to much smaller quarters. The things we own, and there
are too many of them, have been front and center. The general rule here is,
"when in doubt, throw it out."  But yesterday, I didn't throw away, I packed
and preserved.

We have two sets of crockery. The first was part of the 1960 wedding loot. It's
a perfectly fine set of dishes, and we've used it on formal occasions for half
a century. It's Franciscan china, very 1950s abstract-modernist in design.
Entirely sufficient. Why, then, is there a second and redundant set?

Because when I was a boy, my folks owned a handful of pieces of flowery Charles
Field Haviland china that came out of storage once a year, at Thanksgiving, to
eke out the festive board.  I thought, and still think, that these plates were
simply beautiful. In addition, because they were so seldom used, they had very
specific and warm Thanksgiving-y associations -- food and drink and laughter and
conviviality  -- that were once-a-year events in our not-particularly-sociable
household. When the folks died, I inherited the Haviland remnants:  a few
hand- painted plates, some of them chipped; a number of saucers and a few
very delicate coffee cups. A decade ago, at age sixty, feeling nostalgic, I
decided to make it my business to fill in the set. It wasn't easy. I located a
couple of cups at an antique show and by mail-order acquired some plates from a
"replacement warehouse" in Georgia. But one day, browsing Ebay, I discovered on
auction a complete -- serving pieces and all -- set of dishes in what I had come
to think of as "my pattern." I bid, I was nervous, I won. The design exceeded
my hopes. It's a handsome bunch of crockery and it's now standard for our
occasional parties and our annual Thanksgiving. We'll carry the Haviland with us
to the new home.

What to do with the old? The next generation expresses utter and uniform
indifference; the generation that follows is far too young to care. Nor can we
sell or discard -- there are just too many fond memories. But here's what I'm
thinking. Suppose one of the offspring comes to feel, as I did at sixty, an odd
longing for objects that carry familial resonance. That set of Franciscan china
might become valuable to them. I don't mean monetarily valuable, but genuinely
valuable, in the ways that matter.

So I've carefully packed the crockery. It's multi-newspapered and double-boxed.
If not preserved for all eternity, it's certainly packed in a way that will
outlive every member of my age cohort.  It's labeled. It will go into the
"storage unit" in the basement of the new condo. It will sit there for an
unpredictable but not infinite length of years.

We'll let someone else decide whether to retain or discard.

Title: The Helene Mullins Mystery
Date: April 26, 2008

We're still cleaning out and throwing away (as I reported a couple of days
ago). Today I discovered, in amongst a small cache of books that I inherited
from my father, a volume of poems called Earthbound. I'd never heard of the
poet, Helene Mullins, but I traced her via a 2001 The New York Times obituary.
"Helene Mullins Johnson, a poet, died on Oct. 26 at her home in Manhattan. She
was 92 years old. She died of congestive heart failure. Mrs. Johnson first had
her poems published in The Pagan, a Greenwich Village magazine, in the 1920s.
After Thornton Wilder introduced her to his publisher, Harper's published her
first novel, Convent Girl, and her first volume of poems, Earthbound, in 1929.
Her final collection of poems, Mirrored Walls, was published in 1970. There are
no survivors." Google provided me with another couple of facts. Helene Mullins
was born in 1899 in New Rochelle, New York, and educated in "convent boarding
schools." In 1935, she was so severely injured in an automobile accident that
she lay unconscious for three weeks.

And also: the library nearest to me that owns a copy of Earthbound is the Dakota
State University, in Madison, South Dakota, which is precisely 502 miles from
where I sit.

The poems are, in my view, brimming with pre-Raphaelite fervor. The precursoress
whom Mullins most resembles is Christina Rossetti, though there's an occasional
dash of Ernest Dowson, and every once in a while, a gesture borrowed from the
early Yeats. The poems are as intense and agonized and spiritual as Rossetti's,
and were, even in their own time, composed in an extremely old-fashioned style.

What does the world offer a hard-working but not brilliant poet who was clearly
ambitious and tense, and who poured all her strength and feeling into her
writing? There she was, a young woman fleeing the convent and shocking her
family by taking up residence in Greenwich Village, where she lived near
Thornton Wilder and other 1920s gentlemen of literature and where she frequented
the irreligious offices of The Pagan. I mourn for the struggle and yearning and
effort that went into those long-forgotten poems.  And which, all said and
done, earned her little beyond a  perfunctory obituary in the Times.

But what in the ever-living universe was this volume doing in my staid father's
library?  It's implausible that he could have found anything empathetic in
such poems as "St. Theresa" and "The Boy Christ."  Especially since Earthbound
was the only volume of "contemporary" poetry that he seems to have possessed.
In 1929, when Earthbound hit the streets, my father would have been a buoyant,
studious young fellow of twenty-five -- a diligent bachelor law clerk with still
a year or so to go before he would find Lilly. Helen Mullins herself was just
thirty years old. Is there a story here? Am I missing something?

There are no clues; not even a single pencil mark. Nothing from one end of the
book to the other. Something doesn't compute.

Title: New Words
Date: April 30, 2008

Dr. Metablog, like all bloggers, is his own editor. With the new freedom comes
a downside: lapses of coherence and flaws of grammar, along with the occasional
typos and printos that an editor's eye would catch, now go uncaught. But
independence is also beneficial. In my former incarnation, I was regularly
disciplined by stern editors who called me on the carpet for undermining
academic prose by smuggling in a smile.

Once upon a time I composed an encyclopedia entry on the earthy and entertaining
seventeenth-century English diarist Samuel Pepys. Pepys was an extremely
diligent writer who kept his voluminous diary for nine years, rarely missing a
day. To appreciate Pepys's art, it's wrong to rely on snippets; a reader has
to swallow whole large hunks of the diary.   recommended, therefore, that
nouveau- Pepysists engage in "deep and promiscuous reading" of the volumes.
My joke, weak though it may have been, played on the fact that most people
read Pepys not for illumination so much as for the frank revelations about his
vigorous sexual life. I was not sent page proofs of my contribution to the
encyclopedia, and so I was surprised when I cracked open the spruce new book to
discover that, for the words "deep and promiscuous," a vigilant but unsmiling
editor had substituted "wide." What can I say? The editor batted last and had
more clout.

It was perpetually curious to me that the editors would give a pass to
incomprehensible jargon but would go to the mat against playfulness.

A few months ago, on this blague, I parodied the curious language of literary
criticism in an entry on the imperialist romance King Solomon's Mines. I
did not invent the ridiculous vocabulary that I poked fun at, not even
"multichronotopic" or "hybridity."  Now that I have no glum editor peering over
my shoulder, I'm free to play my own game of word-coining. I'm not alone;  Is
it my imagination, or is English vocabulary going through an internet-fueled
growth spurt?

Reviewing my own posts for the past few months, I see a number of words that
I can claim to have invented.  I'm proud of "precursoress," "soulwise,"
"brainal," "neojargonianism," "flimflammery," "mosquette," "skinflintism,"
"bepigeoned," "scandalmongery," "baubleolatry," "alzheimered," "cinderelloid,"
"prefamiliar," and "barfitudinous."  Can I guarantee that I'm the first
user of these contributions to linguistic variety? Of course not -- I've
no doubt been anticipated in most of them. But I attest that each one of
these novelties came to me in a thrilling burst of clarity and light.  I'm
especially fond of my jekyllian word "menschdom" and its hydish antonym
"schmuckhood," of "swiftboatery," "dysgeographicoid," "wallstreetway," and
"gigantico."  My favorite, and here I'm 99% sure that there can be no other
claimant, is "antimonofilamentarianism", defined as opposition to certain recent
manifestations of orthodoxy in religion. I also claim "eruvista," (a person
who adheres to these particular beliefs). Only time will tell if one of these
novelties turns out to be a nonce word (or as the classicists say, a hapax
legomenon), or a word that sneaks into our working vocabulary, its origin as
well as its proud originator obscured by the mists of time.

Title: The Springless Kibitka
Date: May 01, 2008

No, despite appearances, I'm not obsessed with nineteenth-century horsedrawn
vehicles, although I do love those classic novels in which our hero dashes to
the rescue in one kind of coach or another.

It's just that I have this little bee in my bonnet about the fact that we
gasoline-era moderns understand the exact social significance of jeep, Jaguar,
Jetta, and jalopy, but we are, except for specialists, utterly clueless as to
the valence of barouche, basket carriage, berlin, britchka, brougham, buckboard,
buggy, cabriolet, caleche, cariole, carryall, chaise, chariot, clarence, coupe,
croydon, curricle, cutter, dearborn, diligence, dog-cart, fiacre, fly, four-
wheeler, gig, go-cart, governess cart, hansom, jaunty car, jersey-wagon, landau,
phaeton, post-chaise, rockaway, shandrydan, shay, spider-phaeton, spring-van,
stanhope, sulky, surrey, tandem, telyezhka, tilbury, tarantass, trap, troika,
victoria, vis-a-vis, wagonette, or wurt. Which of these words tells us that
the driver is rich or stylish, and which of them implies that he is vulgar and
tasteless?  Or downtrodden?  We don't know, and so we read our traditional
literature with a handicap.

It is good fortune that when in Don Juan (a comic epic well worth the
revisiting), Byron trots out a kibitka (a vehicle new to me), he tells us
all we need to know: "And there in a kibitka he rolled on,/  (A cursed sort
of carriage without springs,/ Which on rough roads leaves scarcely a whole
bone...."  [IX, 234-6]). Byron testifies that the kibitka is down there in
the horsedrawn slums. An online dictionary is less poetic but more detailed
than Lord B: "a kibitka is a rude kind of Russian vehicle, on wheels or on
runners, sometimes covered with cloth or leather, and often used as a movable
habitation."

Definitely not the kind of vehicle out of which Sir Plantagenet should step when
he opens Parliament or accompanies Lady Glencora to the ball.

May 10.  My friend W. S. wants to know if history provides an instance in which
a "a cabal of kibbutzniks kibitzed in a kibitka?"  A good question to which I
am at present unable to provide an answer. May 19.  Professor Marion Morrison
wants to know why I prefer Russian vehicles to "les voitures hippomobiles."
Whoa, Professor M. Time to get off your high horse!

Title: A Truly Romantic Poem
Date: May 09, 2008

The poem that might entrance you when you're young might not be the poem for
your older years. In my "mature" phase, poems that I earlier ignored take on
new significance. I'm now quite taken with Tennyson's "Ulysses,'" a dramatic
monologue that meant nothing to me until a few years ago. "Ulysses" celebrates
perseverance, a late-onset virtue.

Another poem that I've latterly come to love is Robert Burns' jaunty "John
Anderson my jo, John." To me, in my present incarnation, it's the most romantic
poem in the English language (or, to be precise, the Scottish language).  While
most love poems celebrate desire and longing, "John Anderson," takes as its
subject continuity and longevity. As opposed to more conventional works that
come to climax with a wedding, "John Anderson" situates itself near the end of
life and glances happily backward over a life well lived. Its frankness about
bodily changes is comforting (especially to readers who may no longer glow with
first youth). John Anderson may be bald and gray and tottering, but he's still
loved and loving.

The cheerful woman who speaks the poem has lived "hand in hand" with John A. for
a lifetime.

John Anderson, my jo, John                            dear

When we were first acquent,                         
 acquainted

Your locks were like the raven,

Your bonnie brow was brent;                           smooth

But now your brow is beld, John,                      bald

Your locks are like the snow;

But blessings on your frosty paw;                     head

John Anderson, my jo.

John Anderson, my jo, John,

We clamb the hill tegither.

And many a cantie day, John,                          happy

We've had wi' ane anither.

Now we maun totter down, John                      must

But hand in hand we'll go,

And sleep thegither at the foot,

John Anderson, my jo.

Title: More P. S. 217 1952 Graduates
Date: May 13, 2008

Searching the out-of-the-way corners of this ol' house that we are leaving
behind after thirty-five years, I discovered a mutilated copy of The Log, an
eight-page mimeographed pamphlet produced by students of P.S. 217 in June of
1952.  The entries seem to have been written not by the students but by the
teachers and  were designed to inculcate a moral. For example: "Class 8-1 has
made many things in cooking, shop, sewing and arts and crafts. The girls under
the supervision of Miss Willig have baked many good cookies and cakes while
the boys, under the supervision of Mr. Kaminsky have made expertly constructed
pieces of furniture. In grammar we have learned to diagram long sentences and
are beginning to excel at it. On Graduation Day, when the girls wear their
beautiful organdy dresses which they themselves made, they will be very grateful
for the instructions they received from Mrs. Ennis." The bottom line: "you may
have run wildly amok, you horrid little creatures, and created ruckus after
ruckus, but some day you'll appreciate us, we hope hope hope."

Also In The Log,  and far more interesting and useful than the forced feeding
of pre-nostalgia, is a list of the 1952 graduates of our fabled elementary
school.

A month or so ago, I posted on this blague a formal picture of the assembled
graduates, and, with the help of a committee of distinguished volunteer
mnemosynists, was able to identify about half of the members of the class.
With the discovery The Log, I am now able to to list the remaining students
who graduated from P. S. 217 that last Truman June.  Here's hoping that
my enthusiastic comrades will now be able to assign faces to the following
seventy- seven most musical names: Carol Berse, Diane Goldberg, Norma Harris,
Rosalind Symons, Sheila Slovis, Dorothy Steinfeld, Sara Steinman, Harriet
Young, Robert Derwin, Harold Schienkoff, Myron Sklar, Maryann Abrahams, Sheila
Carp, Ria DeCastri, Anita Friedman, Ricki Gottlieb, Marcia Katz, Sheila Katz,
Sandra Kopelton, Rochelle Miller, Diane Spatz, Janet Solomon, Eleanor Troy,
Appolonia Yacovelli, Carole Zietlin, Thomas Bellavita, Donald Carbone, Joseph
Cassano, Robert Cohen, John McKay, Arne Neilson, Toby Anker, Renee Dickson,
Sylvia Gordon, Francine Herskowitz, Marguerite McGinty, Florence Rosenthal,
Yvette Rosenthal, Doris Sippel, Hope Steuer, Michael Gerber, Alan Lipis, Stuart

Gold, Leah Goodman, Evelyn and Norma Greenberg, Laurie and Roberta Katcher,
Selma Schnier, Edith Snyder, Robert Goldstein, Leslie Shernoff, Barbara Bider,
Ann Cacioppa, Sheryl Jerome, Patricia McCabe, Marilyn Snow, Barbara Williams,
Ruth Wintheil.

Identifications as well as news of our friends and companions are solicited. 
Who are these people?  What paths in life, glorious life, did they tread?  Did
they embark on careers of baking, or furniture making, or sewing long dresses? 
Did they ever truly excel at diagramming long sentences? Your contributions are

Title: What We Read in the Fifties:  The Ox-bow Incident
Date: May 15, 2008

Walter van Tilburg Clark's 1940 western, The Ox-bow Incident, was required
reading in English classes at Erasmus Hall High School during the Eisenhower
years.  I assume that I studied and possibly even answered some assigned
questions about the novel, but judging by the minute shards of information that
my porous head has retained, I’d be hard put to swear yea or nay.

The Ox-bow Incident is still in print and apparently still part of many
curricula, which is a surprise, considering its racist caricaturing and taboo
language. For those who can overlook its offenses, it raises some peculiarly
American questions about violence and personal responsibility. It's not a
beautifully-crafted novel: it takes a long time to get going, leaves gaps in the
continuity, and although just a couple of hundred pages long, is peopled by more
characters than I could easily track. The principal defect is that the narrator,
a young cowpoke named Art Croft, is never forced to choose between the good guys
and the bad.

Despite these defects, The Ox-bow Incident proved to be well worth the re-
reading, largely because of the story, which is inventive and which takes a
number of surprising, unexpected turns. It's an anti-western, I now realize, in
which readers wait in vain for a white-hatted hero to ride to the rescue and to
wing the black-hat and bring the gang of bad guys to justice. Instead, thugs
and bullies drag the weaklings down to their own level. Although I had already
read my share of Zane Greys, I’m sure that I did not understand that Clark was
toying with the conventions of the western genre. Nowadays, The Ox-bow Incident
seems less kin to Riders of the Purple Sage than it is to Lonesome Dove.

Clark wrote when Hitler was menacing the world and he clearly aimed his shafts
at temporizers and appeasers. I suspect that at Erasmus, my teachers understood
The Ox-bow Incident in the context of the anti-communism that was the religion
of the 1950s. I would not be at all surprised if the novel is now taught as
anti-Jihadist, but it needn't be, because it's not so much anti-this or anti-
that as it is about decency and the need to stand firm for law and justice.
"Because most men are more afraid of being thought cowards than anything else,"
says the author, and because "real" men, so-called, believe that it's manly to
take the law into their own hands, the cowboys and shopkeepers and drifters who
cohere into a necktie party are defenseless against masculinist demagoguery.

While Clark never uses the word "honor," he implies that the cowardly-fearful
would think it dishonorable to back off from their commitment to violence.

I think it was Spinoza who said that "honor" was a "slavish dependence on the
opinion of others." His definition could serve as a an epigraph to this novel.
Honor, as well as law, justice both domestic and international, masculinity, and
violence, are all matters of contemporary debate, and as a consequence, The Ox-
bow Incident hangs in there quite nicely.

I've now seen the 1943 William Wellman-Henry Fonda-Dana Andrews-Anthony Quinn
film of The Ox-bow Incident. It's faithful, much too faithful to the book. I
found it plodding and prosaic, inoffensive, but far too moralistic. It was just
the merest tad more optimistic than the bleak novel. The political semi-allegory
was barely there.

Title: CCNY Basketball Ups and Downs, 1950-51
Date: May 18, 2008

My friend Otis Jefferson Brown reminds me of the crushing sports-and-morals
tragedy of our joint childhoods. It all took place in 1950/51, when I was a
creeping like snail to sixth grade in P. S. 217 and Otis, a child of Bay Ridge,
was trudging his shining morning face to P.S. 102. Our guys, our local heroes,
the CCNY basketball team, won both of the major basketball tournaments, the NIT
as well as the NCAA. The city -- New York City, especially Brooklyn  -- was
electric with excitement. Headlines, victory parades, and demonstrations in all
the neighborhoods.

The twin wins -- it never had happened before and will never happen again --
were great events in the public sphere but of even greater moment in our 9th
Street home.  Back in the 1920s, my father had attended CCNY for a year, but
like so many of the sons of impoverished immigrants, had to drop out to help put
potatoes and black radishes on the family table. While at City, he had played on
the freshman basketball team. Would he have made the varsity? Who can tell? He
was a strong man, a fine natural athlete, very graceful in his movements even
into his 70s, and very serious about basketball.

His coach had been Nat Holman (one of the earliest stars of professional
basketball), and Nat was still the City College coach twenty-five years later.
So whenever CCNY played, everything in our family came to a halt, and we all
gathered around the wooden Philco to listen as my father's team went down to the
wire against Bradley or Kentucky or Toledo. My father, generally a restrained
man, was as partisan and as jubilant as I ever knew him to be. Not only were the
victories a fulfillment of his own hopes, but they were all achieved by a bunch
of local players -- Jews and "Negroes" from the Bronx and Brooklyn who, in those
days, would not have been welcome at most of the big basketball powers. Ed Roman
and Ed Warner and Irvin Dambrot and Normie Mager and Floyd Lane were household
names as familiar and as admired as those of Koufax and Campanella.

It was the very next year that it all blew up in our faces. The CCNY players, or
many of them, confessed to taking bribes from the gamblers and bookies and to
shaving points and managing the spread. There were indictments, "perp walks,"
headlines, indignant editorials. O the shame!

My father was devastated. Although in size he was just a scrappy guard, in
person he was a tower of rectitude, and it was beyond his ken that our guys,
even poor guys who desperately needed cash, would compromise their integrity and
their futures for a few bucks.

My father turned the disgrace into a morality play. Every day, for years it
seems in retrospect, I listened to still another passionate sermon about keeping
to the straight and narrow. (Not that there was anyone in the world who would
pay me to miss a shot; I could miss shots on my own. But I knew what he meant.)

I've now read Charles Rosen's Scandals of '51, how the gamblers almost killed
college basketball [New York, 1971]). It's a shoddy, melodramatic, disheartening
book, but it does help to put things in perspective. Rosen makes it clear that
there was more than a little American nativist glee about taking CCNY and its
upstart culture down a peg. It was sad to read that players from many other
colleges were also indicted (I hadn't remembered), but discouraging to learn
that their defenders were happy to extol heartland values and to scapegoat the
corruption onto big city immigrant depravity. It was also sad to be reminded
that the only basketball player who served hard time was Sherman White, the
biggest, the best, and the blackest of all the athletes. Nor was it pleasant
to discover that although there were apparently point-shavers at St. Johns, a
Catholic college, DA Frank Hogan brought no indictments because the evidence
against the Red Men was "inadvertently" destroyed.

The events were a blight on my basketball-loving childhood. And still a great
sadness after all these years. But I must say that we, as a family, engineered
a strong comeback. It was only a few years after the scandals that one of those
13" black and white TVs with the rabbit ears made its first appearance in our
home. And along with the Zenith came the NBA. I think that my father was on
perpetual alert for signs of malfeasance, but our faith in the game and in
humanity was restored by a new set of New York heroes: Harry Gallatin, Connie
Simmons, Carl Braun, Dick McGuire, Bud Palmer, Vince Boryla, Sweetwater Clifton,
Max Zaslofsky.

Title: Family Matters
Date: May 21, 2008

Yesterday, in a long-buried collection of file folders, I found some papers of
my father's that were written during those last painful years when he was a
widower. Some of the pages comprise a "commonplace" book, the theme of which is,
'why am I still alive when my wife is dead?'  In addition to the lamentations,
there are two anomalous paragraphs of reminiscence  -- constituting the sum of
my father's known autobiographical writings. For the benefit and edification of
my own children and grandchildren and family, I now put these writings on the
record.

My father writes:  "My maternal grandmother was a thin, almost gaunt  woman
about 5 ft 5 inches tall. Although I am sure she loved all her children &
grandchildren, I cannot remember her ever showing any overt sign of affection.
We children always knew when grandma was to visit us. My mother would go into
a frenzy of housecleaning. All the curtains would be washed and re-hung; the
kitchen floors scrubbed and the silverware washed and polished. Her [i.e. my
father's grandmother's] face was unwrinkled, the skin drawn tightly. Her most
dominant feature was her eyes, piercing, direct, demanding. There would be
Grandma, wearing a little hat, glancing around the room while she slowly took
off her gloves. If she was satisfied with what she saw, she would give a little
nod as if to say, 'well done.' We would all relax."

A historical footnote:  my grandparents came to this continent in about 1895
and the events that my father remembers are all turn-of-the-century and pre-WWI.

Until I uncovered this paragraph, I thought my grandparents came to North
America on their own.  I did not know that they were accompanied by this
formidable great-grandmother. Although she herself was long gone when I came on
the stage, I certainly encountered those piercing black eyes in other faces, my
father's in particular.  I wonder why my father (who was born in 1904) never
mentioned his grandmother to me -- she certainly made an impression that lasted
to the end of his life. Come to think of it, why the heck was my family so
entirely tight-lipped about their ancestry?

But wait.  There's more.

"My grandparents (that would be the ferocious grandmother and her equally
unknown-to-me husband), had 5 children, 4 daughters and one son. There were
born to their children in a space of 10 years, 18 grandchildren.  Each one of
these children were delivered at home. My grandmother attended every one of
these births.  About 2 weeks before the expected date of birth, my grandmother
would appear wearing her little hat and gloves & carrying a small satchel; she
immediately took charge of the household. The expectant mother would be freed of
all household obligations."

From this evidence it would appear that in addition to his three siblings (Max,
Sol, and Molly), my father had fourteen cousins on his mother's side of the
family.  Why didn't I know about them?  Why did I never meet a single one? Or
even hear their names?  Or the names of their progeny, if there were any?

Also in my father's hand, scribbled in a corner of the paper, is a
calculation:  Mom - 4, Manya - 6, Nadya - 3, Mary - 2, Maris (or Saris, or
Norris) -3.  And then the sum:  18.

So, children and children's children and collateral descendants, you now
understand a piece of the family history.

And readers:  if there's anyone out there in internetland who had a strong,
perhaps dictatorial great or great-great or great-great-great grandmother who
came to assist at births armed with a satchel, a little hat and memorable black
eyes (first name unknown but surnamed Hessel), and who knows that his or her
ancestry includes a woman whose maiden name was Mary Hessel or Manya Hessel or
Nadya Hessel, or if there's someone who's descended from Noris or Moris or Saris
Hessel, hey, cuz, take a moment and add a comment to this entry and I'll get
right back to you.

Title: Embarrassment is Forever
Date: May 28, 2008

One of my childhood friends confesses to me that his otherwise peaceful early
years were marred by a perfectly unnecessary bit of fighting -- which he
himself initiated. "We were in the middle of a softball game in the P. S. 217
schoolyard and I struck out with two or three men on base. One of my teammates
said something uncomplimentary to me and started to walk away. Humiliated and
frustrated, I charged after him and jumped on his back. I'm not sure what I
intended to do (my fighting skills were even worse than my softball skills)."

This less-than-earthshaking softballmachia occurred somewhere between fifty-five
and sixty years ago. It is impossible that anyone in the known universe
remembers either the score, the sides, the game, the strikeout, or one boy's
vault onto the back of another -- no one, that is, except the perpetrator
himself, who goes on to confess that he is "embarrassed and ashamed even now." 
I do not doubt for an instant that he's telling the exact truth, because even
though glaciers have receded and oceans of water have passed under the bridge,
embarrassment is forever.

Like my friend, and like many another poor suffering mortal, I too retain
ancient memories that make me cringe.  A few of these acts, I'm sorry to say,
are, like my friend's, instances of unjustified and petty violence. A larger
category: the recollection of saying something stupid at a party or over dinner.
Or a lame, feeble, failed witticism. An irony that was misunderstood and taken
to be serious. A mispronounced word. The realization that my presence was
unwelcome or that I had overstayed my welcome. The largest category of all:
something that I did or said that was vain or pretentious or self-aggrandizing.

My Better Half, who knows that often, half-asleep, I will suddenly recall
an embarrassing moment and will vent a profound sigh or pound my fist into
"Everyone who heard what you said has been dead for years. Go back to sleep."
It's a good protocol and is moderately effective. But the hallmark of authentic
embarrassment is that even though the offending act was performed in public,
it will be recollected in solitude years later to disorder our tranquility and
to disturb our rest. Whether the witnesses have long since forgotten the event
(if they noticed it in the first place) or even if they've been underground for
decades doesn't seem to moderate self-flagellation.

In point of fact, embarrassment is the only natural phenomenon that has tempted
me to believe, even slightly, in an afterlife. If anything is eternal, it's
embarrassment.

It is sometimes said that Western society has evolved from a shame culture
to a guilt culture. In earlier ages, social disapproval kept the lid on our
transgressive impulses. Nowadays, the theory goes, we've been psychologically
transformed and have learned to internalize shame as guilt, so that we regulate
ourselves without our fellow tribesman crying tut-tut and shame, shame, shame.
Perhaps there's a bit of truth to this formula, but it's simplistic. In my own
fragile ego, guilt has not supplanted shame; both emotions are thriving rather
nicely, thank you very much.

Embarrassment is neither guilt nor shame, but a third thing that combines the
two emotions -- as for example in the case of Joey Valachi, mafia hit man and
stool pigeon, who once told an investigating committee, and I quote verbatim,
"you can imagine my embarrassment when I killed the wrong guy." An awkward
moment for Joey V., but whether its memory would be sufficient to disturb his
pleasant dreams is not for me to guess. It is certainly embarrassing to all
concerned that he would classify a murder as an embarrassment. Compare Macbeth
in the same situation:  "O full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife."

I guess I should be happy that my sleep is troubled by social gaffes rather than
by crimes. Mini-scorpions, so to speak.

Title: Another Novel by John Hassler
Date: May 29, 2008

Last month, I reported that I had read The Dean's List and that I was not
sufficiently impressed to enroll myself in the John Hassler fan club.  But
inasmuch as Hassler had been so celebrated upon his death, and I felt negligent,
I thought it only fair to give him a second try. Now I've done so: I've read
The Staggerford Flood (2002). It's a congenial satire that concerns itself with
an aging group of small-town Minnesota Catholics. It's intermittently witty,
but either too subtle or too fey for me. Hassler has been praised as a great
regionalist, but in my view can't hold a candle to the upper New York state
chronicles of Richard Russo and isn't even in the same league with the inventive
and often very beautiful Baltimore novels of Anne Tyler.

Title: What is a Cutter?
Date: May 31, 2008

Regular readers of this blague should be able to anticipate Dr. Metablog's best
and favorite answer to the important question, "What is a cutter?"

Familiar with Dr. M's lifelong passion for baseball, the king of all sports,
an informed reader might be tempted to say that a "cutter" is short for a "cut
fastball" -- a variation, baseballophiles know, of the two-seamer -- perfected
by the likes of Mariano Rivera. Or one might think to guess that a "cutter" is
a skilled craftsman in the garment trades. Good answers both, but not the echt
metablogian answer.

How about a utility knife or box cutter, prominent in the new world of
terrorism?  Or a small fore-and-aft rigged sailing vessel, junior to the
sloop?  Or one of those self-destructive teens who inflicts injury upon
himself?  A shaper of gems?  An unlicensed, underworld surgeon?  A film
editor? A queue- jumper? A quarry worker from Bloomington, Indiana?  A mohel?

Good answers all. But Dr. M, in a moment of ultra-metablogism, is proud to
announce that the properest answer can be found in William Dean Howells' 1882
novel, A Modern Instance:

"On a Saturday evening in February, a cutter, gay with red-lined robes, dashed
away and came musically clashing down the street under the naked elms. The young
man slackened the pace of his horse, as if to still the bells.  The girl took
the hand he offered her when he dismounted at the gate, and as she jumped from
the cutter, 'Wont you come in?', she asked.  'I guess I can blanket my horse
and stand him under the wood-shed,' answered the young man, going round to the
animal's head, and leading him away."

The answer: a cutter is a nineteenth-century horse drawn vehicle.

Howells doesn't bother to mention whether it runs on wheels or on runners. He
assumes that his readers will know.

Title: Flagrant Greenwashing
Date: June 02, 2008

A new and useful word is "greenwash," which is what happens when a can of ozone-
destroying chemicals comes to be decorated with cute bunnies. Corporations have
perfected this kind of propaganda: it's cheaper to portray the company as green
than to cap that smokestack.

The Bushies have brought greenwashing to politics and given us Clear Skies
(which clears the skies of birds) and Healthy Forests (which would more
accurately be called Healthy Seedlings, because that's all that remains after
the forest has been clearcut).

Anti-environmental candidates frequently cover themselves in greenwash. Here's
a particularly flagrant example. Former U. S. representative Republican Bob
Shaffer, who scored just 5% on the League of Conservation Voters' scale and has
been targeted as one of 2008's "dirty dozen," is running for an open Senate seat
in Colorado. In addition to being in Jack Abramoff's pocket, Shaffer supported
the Cheney-led initiative that gave $33 billion in tax breaks to big oil. He
opposed incentives for developing alternative fuels and dug in his heels against
fuel efficiency standards for automobiles.

Schaffer was Vice President of an oil company, Aspect Energy.  Here's his brief
biography on Aspect's website.

"Bob Shaffer is Vice President for business development at CHx Capital,
LLC, where he is involved with a variety of energy, mining and education
projects. Additionally, Bob is actively involved in international business
development activities for Aspect Energy, including sourcing and development of
international oil and gas exploration opportunities for the Company."

Hold on.  That WAS his biography until a couple of days ago. Now that he's been
nominated for the Senate, his history has been greened up. Here's the substitute
paragraph:

"Bob was involved in a variety of wind power investments, international energy
opportunities, and education projects. Bob worked to improve the US Wind
Industry. Specifically, he worked to increase entrepreneurial opportunities
for small business owners by ensuring that wind-specific tax credits could be
utilized indirectly by wind developers classified as small business owners. Bob
helped educate Congress about the benefits of wind power including its positive
impact on the environment, job creation, and its importance in making the United
States less dependent on foreign sources of oil."

Truly amazing. One day he's prospecting for foreign oil;  the next day he's a
fanatical supporter of windpower.

Ooh, ooh, ooh, what a little greenwash can do.

Title: News from Nebraska
Date: June 09, 2008

Today we covered 200 miles or so of Route 34 of western Nebraska, the reddest
part of one of our reddest states.  We started in the high steppes and
finished in fertile (when irrigated) farmland.  Here are some of the roadside
highlights.  Nine reassuringly green John Deere dealerships, evenly spaced
along the route.  A number of llama farms, producing either wool or llamchops,
I don't know which.  Outside Benkelman, a large roadside sign:  "Birthplace
of Ward Bond."  Entering Funk, Nebraska (pop. 204), a sign, "Welcome to
Funk."  The curious slogan of the small community of Minden:  "The Christmas
City"  (for which act of arrogance Minden should be rechristened "The Chutzpah
City").  Just west of McCook, a giant billboard:  "In God we trust, not
Hillary."  A challenge to logic, I think.  Or perhaps, a challenge to divine
exactly what the billboardist was thinking.  Are we supposed to imagine that
Hillary Clinton is conceived of in McCook as the anti-Christ?  And finally,
just east of Hastings, for some years the residence of Willa Cather, the largest
of billboards, viewable for miles:  "Don't Beat Your Kids -- God."   An
admirable sentiment to be sure, and one to which we can all subscribe.  Alas,
the words that God put on the record are these:  "He who spareth the rod hateth
his son: but he that loveth him correcteth him betimes (Proverbs 13:24) and also
"Withhold not correction from a child:  for if thou strike him with the rod,
he shall not die.  Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and deliver his soul from
hell" (Proverbs 23: 13-14).  The amateur theologican who composed the words on
the billboard offers a paraphrase of God's words which is, how shall I say this
kindly, somewhat loose.  Revisionist even.

Title: An American "Victorian" Novel
Date: June 09, 2008

It's not just sexual prudery that makes a novel "Victorian."  The more of these
novels I read (and trust me, I've read my share), the more clear it is that the
heart of the matter is that hero and heroine are kept apart not by Mrs. Grundy
but by paralyzing social constraints.

To demonstrate my point, I will now invent the plot of a generic "Victorian"
novel.

Lydia Armstrong, who is charming and rich and has been greatly improved by her
singing and drawing lessons, loves handsome, intelligent Reginald Cockerell,
but she can't hint that she does so for fear of appearing forward. Besides,
her parson father looks down on the upstart Cockerells, who made their small
fortune in trade.  Meanwhile, young Cockerell feels that his first enthusiastic
courting of Lydia was awkward and unwelcome;  moreover, he's been informed
that she loves Bentley Rayburn, an empty-headed aristocrat who drives a mean
barouche.  As a result, Cockerell emigrates to Australia, and although presumed
to have been shipwrecked, returns after nine years and 650 pages to discover,
quite inadvertently, that Lydia has been pining for him all the while she has
sat patiently sewing and providing French lessons for her numerous adoring
nieces and nephews.  After a few more chapters and much agonizing, he at last,
awkwardly, affirms his longstanding affection.  Much glee; as W. S. says, "the
more delayed, delighted."

Why the heck didn't Lyddie and Reg sit down and talk things out before he left
for the Antipodes?

Because frankness is impermissible;  it's insufficiently "Victorian."  The
rules don't allow it.

Although there must be a quarter of a zillion variations on the theme, the
essence remains constant.  All those Lydias and all those Reginalds are kept
apart by the social artifices that exalt and fetichize propriety and inhibit
self-realization and pleasure.

I've been indulging these sour thoughts because I've just finished reading
William Dean Howells' high-Victorian (1882) domestic novel, A Modern Instance.
Howells is often described as a "realist" novelist.  I suppose he is, if by
realist is meant that in A Modern Instance the central figure, Bartley Hubbard,
is a rotter, a gambler, and an opportunist, the hero Ben Halleck limps, and
the heroine, Marcia Gaylord has a foul, jealous temper.  But take away these
flaws and the so-called realist novel looks typically Victorian.  The crux
(here come spoilers) is that the scamp Bartley marries Marcia and then deserts
her.  A divorce follows.  Our upstanding friend Ben Halleck has loved Marcia
unselfishly for many years, but he can't propose to her because he has violated
the rules by loving her even in the years when she was married.  Will the
sanctity of wedding vows and all of western civilization come crashing down if
he marries a previously-loved divorcee?  Howells even goes so far as to kill
off Bartley, but he still can't see his way clear to allowing any happiness to
Ben and Marcia.  How does the novel end?  Well, it doesn't end;  it just
stops, with Marcia rusting in Equity, Maine, and Ben puzzling and paralyzed down
in Boston.

Howells, though an American, a "realist" and an excellent craftsman, cannot
resolve the dilemma he has created.  He is incapable of bringing his novel to
satisfying close because he is as deeply Victorian as the characters to whom he
has given life.

Victorians are often called Puritans, but it was the most radical of the
Puritans, John Milton, who, in the 1640s, two hundred and fifty years before
Howells, first advanced the thesis that divorce should be legal and that
marriages should be based not on sacrament or law but on mutual love.  And
although he doesn't say so, I'm sure that Milton would have been perfectly at
ease if Ben Halleck and Marcia Gaylord had talked about the divorce, found their
way to bed, and lit out for the territories.

Title: My New Career - II
Date: June 11, 2008

Regular readers of this blague will remember that last year I made myself
available for the NBA draft.  I'm sorry to report that not a single one of the
general managers was daring enough to gamble on me.  It was disappointing and
inexplicable.  I would have suspected that at least one or two of the teams
would have read my official statement.   And jumped at the chance of adding me
to their roster.  I was depressed for a couple of weeks, but now, every day for
eleven months, I've been working on my inside moves.  Baby hook with both the
right and left hands.  My basketball is worn smooth from the concrete driveway.

I now believe that I have discovered the reason that I was not snatched by the
Lakers or the Celtics or another one of the elite teams (frankly, I'm not all
that enthusiastic of starting my pro career in an off-brand situation like
Memphis or Denver).

Last year, I was scrupulously honest about listing my height.  It was exactly
"five feet ten and one-quarter (formerly five feet ten and three-quarter)
inches." How naive I was!  Apparently, guys are exaggerating their credentials,
and I now discover that chicanery and bloviation are rife in the hallowed halls
of the basketball-draft world.  For example, Michael Beasley of Kansas State,
supposedly 6' 10", measured only 6' 7" even wearing sneakers.  Derrick Rose of
Memphis dropped from 6' 4" to 6' 1".  You see what's happening -- I'm playing
the draft game fair and square and so I don't get the same kind of publicity
that the guys do who tweak their credentials.

So there will be some changes on my application this year.  a) I'm taking
out all references to my atrial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy -- it hasn't
bothered me for months and certainly doesn't stop me from playing at my peak
for periods of 3 or 4 minutes at a stretch.  So that's gone.  b) I'm also
going to list my height at 6' 2 1/2".  A slight exaggeration but I doubt
anyone will notice because I play big.  Also, I'm wearing thick soles. c) In
the interest of absolute truth, I'm going to admit that I've put on a couple
of pounds during the last year.  Not a deficit -- an asset.  I'm getting to
the point that I could be described as a "widebody"  -- very rare in the NBA
--and much coveted.  Also, my cataracts are stable and, though I take the
prostate medicine every other day, there's no sign yet that it will compromise
my ferocious aggressiveness.  And let me be perfectly clear -- there's not the
slightest bit of truth to the rumor that I will have to frequently leave the
field of play to make use of the restroom facilities.

Title: Stepping Eastward
Date: June 14, 2008

It's just about 2000 miles from our residence in Colorado to our summer quarters
in Vermont.  Early this week I made my 33rd drive from the one to the other. 
We were lucky -- we sidestepped both floods and tornadoes, though fields were
flooded throughout Iowa and there was impressive and nasty twister damage in
Aurora, Nebraska.  There were the remnants of dwellings and big hunks of metal
roofing lying on the side of the road.  Nevertheless, it was one of our easier
trips:  four solid ten- to twelve-hour days of driving.  As usual, I was
impatient for the first hour  -- It takes a while to get into the swing. 
But after a while I went into a "zone"  -- otherworldly, attentive, resigned,
content.  It's another state of being.

It was only at the end of the trip, along narrow and undulating Route 4 from
Rutland to Woodstock, when for twenty miles I trailed the Executive Director of
the Slow Drivers of America, that I lost my equanimity.  I was just about to
metamorphose into the Incredible Hulk, vault from my vehicle and toss the guy
and his Plymouth into the Ottaquechee River, when I found an opening to drop
into third, floor it, and zoom by him.  Ah, what satisfaction!

It's an amazing trip -- an ever-changing and fascinating landscape.  Some
people claim that the mid West, with its astonishingly large cornfields, is
boring, but those who think so are just not paying attention.  It's a long
book, to be sure, but every page is different.  Despite the pleasure of it all,
I'm relieved to get out of the vehicle, stretch the old legs, and get going on
the gardens.   With nothing on the driving horizon except an occasional trip
to town for supplies.

Title: Something of a Fairy Tale
Date: June 19, 2008

My granddaughter Ella, who is pushing six, is here for a brief visit. 
Yesterday, after catching four salamanders, kicking the soccer ball, planting
the yellow snap beans, and running in exuberant circles, she asked me to tell
her a story.  I'll report only the gist of my long, detailed, but uninspired
narrative.

A young princess is born with a birthmark on her back in the shape of a red
heart.  Her parents consult a wizard, who tells them that their daughter is
destined to marry a powerful, handsome prince.  The parents are elated and the
princess grows up with the guarantee of a blissful marriage.  However, one day,
when the princess is in high school and trying out for the swimming team, one of
her friends notices the birthmark and asks her why she has a birthmark on her
back in the shape of a diamond.  "A diamond?" says the princess.  She consults
the wizard who tells her that she's not going to marry a prince after all; 
instead, she's going to have to carve out her own career.  She'll have to study
her French, take her piano lessons seriously, learn arithmetic and work very
hard in school.  So the princess takes the advice and becomes a very diligent
and hard-working young girl and has many successes.

I was now putting myself to sleep with this highly moral and improbable tale,
so I asked Ella whether she would finish the story.  "Sure," she said, " one
day the diamond turned back into a heart and she married the prince and lived
happily ever after."

So much for contemporary, enlightened fairy tales.

Title: Bone in the Ear
Date: June 20, 2008

The new clerk at the local Aubuchon has a green Mohawk.  The non-Mohawk part of
his head is clean-shaven.  The clerk looks to be about twenty years old.   He
couldn't tell me in which aisle to find a S-hook.

I'm surprised but not offended by the Mohawk.  I wonder, though, how the would-
be clerk dressed for his interview?  Did he come in full war paint, or did he
secure the job looking like Joe HighSchool and then later switch to the foppish
hairstyle?  Or was the regional manager, or whoever pulled the trigger on the
hiring, more tolerant than your run-of-the-mill mid-level corporate executive. 
Hey, maybe green Mohawks don't cut into profits?  I'd guess so, but perhaps I'm
wrong.  Vermont's a tolerant state.

Unlike tattoos, Mohawks can be ephemeral.  In six week, green Mohawk guy could
revert to being plain old Thurston Sleeper.  But a green Mohawk is a curious,
labor-intensive affectation.  it takes work to keep it erect and keep it
green.  To me it says that the clerk is far more interested in making a fashion
statement than in doing his job.  He's in the epater le bourgeois business --
but it's M. Bourgeois who's going to come to the hardware store searching for
just the right kind of wood chisel.

When we first came to this town, back in 1968, Aubuchon was the second-line
hardware store.  Everyone who wasn't just passing through shopped at locally-
owned Gove and Morrill, which carried three or four times the number of items
as Aubuchon, including all the hard-to-find stuff that nowadays you can only
locate on the Internet.  Moreover, Bart Morrill and Lester Wakefield knew how
to fix everything.  Not only would they gladly learn and gladly teach, but they
had a bit of a machine shop in the basement and would whip up the odd part when
necessary.  Now they're both long gone and so is their store and the new guys
at the Aubuchon don't know nothing  -- although they're gussied up in ways that
Bart and Lester could never have dreamed.

The new waitress at The Perfect Pear sports the usual nose ring but she also
displays a hefty piece of bone in her left ear lobe.  It looks, to the
unsophisticated eye, like the tooth of a small shark.

Title: My Facebook Friends
Date: June 25, 2008

My Internet consultant, who is forty-something years old, signed me up on
Facebook.  He said that I needed to understand how communication takes place
between young folk in the modern era.  He also thought that I should assemble
some Facebook friends.

He himself concedes that in Facebook years he is an oldster.  "You're on
Facebook?" say his astonished junior colleagues and employees, not shy to hint
that he's a bit long in the tooth for an activity so totally 'with it' as social
networking.  Hey, what about ancient me?  A generation and an electronic
revolution older, I allow my pre-Cambrian self to be Facebookized.

It's a new world.  A "Facebook Friend" is not to be confused with a real
friend.  In the traditional universe (mine), relationships were either intense
or diffuse.  You can enjoy a few important relationships or spread yourself
over many -- say, twenty or thirty -- that are superficial.  It's taken me
a lifetime to acquire and sustain a very small number of genuine, intense
friendships.  But young people seem to diffuse their emotional attachments,
as I discovered by browsing the Facebook site.  They form networks of three
or four hundred or eight hundred fellow Facebookers.  No doubt but that these
young folks possess memories far more retentive and perspicuous than mine -- but
what can it mean to have relationships that number in the hundreds?  "Facebook
Friend" can signify nothing more than someone whose path has crossed your own
sometime, somewhere.

Nevertheless, it's intriguing to be in instant communication with a more-or-less
compatible cohort.  I must say, however, that there are practical limits to
the grandparental Facebookish experience.  Real friends of my own years not
only suffer from limited computer literacy but are natively grumpy and therefore
indifferent to social networking.  They're basically Internet hermits.  When I
stumble upon the page of coevals who are Facebookers (perhaps, like me, because
a young friend or grand-daughter took pity on their Facebooklessness), what
generally appears -- along with a generic subsitution for an actual photograph,
which they don't have the skills to post -- is a dispiriting message such
as "Frank has no friends."  As a result, almost all of my "Friends" are a
generation or two younger than I -- which makes me feel pseudo-youthful but also
as though I've crashed the party but I'm not dancing.

I tried an experiment.  I solicited (is that the word?) Friendship with Zoe,
just entering our local university and whose father I've known since 1969. 
She has not "confirmed me."  I also approached, timidly, Sam K., who's in high
school abroad.  I've been good friends with his grandparents for most of a
lifetime.  Sam also declined to confirm me.  ("Confirm" -- the proper Facebook
locution -- seems both too religious and too 'rite of passage' for me.)  I also
tried Rebecca M., a junior in college -- no confirmation.  Is it possible that
these young people don't want one of Gramp's friends to know who's writing what
on whose Wall?

There seems to be some sort of competition among Facebookers to acquire the most
Friends.  I'm as competitive as the next guy, but, handicapped by my years,
I'm stuck at thirty-five Friends, which is absolutely zip zilch in the galaxy
of Facebook amical achievement.  Moreover, I must confess that one of those
thirty- five Friends is a 6" foam donkey named Lefty who is the miniature mascot
of a Democratic consulting firm.  Zooming ahead, Lefty has left me to choke on
his donkey-dust.  The  donkey has one hundred and twenty-four Friends, all of
them, no doubt, intimate.

Title: Vivian de St. Vrain is now Vivian Hussein de St. Vrain
Date: June 30, 2008

Hatemongering right-wingers have been using Obama's name to attack him.  It's
only-slightly-disguised bigotry.  Obama sounds like Osama, Hussein is the late,
unlamented  dictator, while Barack is strangely foreign and rhymes with Iraq. 
It's primitive tribalism --a way of calling Barack "foreign" or "un-American"
without actually using the words.  Although Obama generally calls himself
"Barack Obama," foxnewsistas and McCain surrogates like to chant, "Barack
Hussein Obama."  You can hear them waiting for the audience to hiss.

In response, supporters of Obama have adopted Hussein as their own middle
name. There's a good article in The New York Times:  (June 29, 2008: "Obama
Supporters Take his Name as their Own").  "I am sick. of Republicans
pronouncing Barack Obama’s name like it was some sort of cuss word,” one
commentator  wrote in a manifesto titled “We Are All Hussein.”

So today, Vivian de St. Vrain joins the movement and proudly announces that
henceforth the proper designation is "Vivian Hussein de St. Vrain."  It has a
nice lilt, doesn't it?

Go Blue!  Go Dems!  Go Barack!  Yes we can! Yes we can!

Title: Wheel-man, I Salute You!
Date: June 30, 2008

My brother Jonathan says, "The wheel.  I could have invented the wheel." 
Meaning, I think, that he understands the advanced scientific principle -- a
wheel turns round and round.  Unlike, say, the refrigerator or the radio,
which he doesn't understand and will concede that he couldn't possibly have
invented.  As for myself, I don't think that  I could possibly have conceived
of something so elegant as the wheel.  The chair.  I could have invented the
chair.  No moving parts.

And yet the wheel, history tells us, was anything but obvious.  Homo sapiens
sapiens had been on the planet for half a million years before some Mesopotamian
genius, or series of geniuses, figured out the fine art of rolling (in fact, the
wheel was apparently used for pottery for centuries before it was adapted for
transport).  In the Americas, both the Mayans and the Incas domesticated plants
and animals, perfected smelting and weaving, carved out roads and aqueducts, but
never hit upon the wheel.

If my brother had been born near the Olduvai rift in East Africa in the minus
four hundred thousands, would he have been smart enough to come up with the
wheel?  Would he even have had the opportunity?  Wouldn't he, like the rest of
us, have spent his time cowering in the cave, occasionally rushing out to grab
a hunk of dead gazelle whenever the lions turned their backs?  And employing
every bit of his brain power learning how better to knap the flint.

And besides, even if you figure out that a tree trunk can be made to rotate, you
still have to invent the axle.  And the spoke.

The lever?  Yes, I think so.  Put a hunk of wood or a piece of bone under a
rock and pry it up.  I could have done that.  But how about the pliers -- a
double lever, now in use for about 4000 years.  I think I could have stared at
a three pieces of metal for a zillion years and not invented the pliers.

I'll make a prediction.  One day, when the aliens come to visit us from their
infinitely more advanced civilization, they will marvel at us the way we marvel
at the Incas.  How astonishing, they're going to say, they got as far as
they did but they never figured out the glugg.  The glugg will be something
as elementary and as obvious and as useful as the wheel or the lever or the
inclined plane.  Some simple machine that we've completely overlooked.

So wheel-man, whoever you are, I celebrate you.

Hey Jon, why don't you go invent the glugg?

Could I in actual fact have invented the chair?  Well, perhaps I would have
been smart enough to think of sitting on a rock or on a tree stump. But a chair
with legs?  Or with legs strengthened with stretchers?  Not very likely that
I would have been smart enough to invent a chair.  If it had been left to me,
we'd still be squatting on tree stumps.

Title: Garden News
Date: July 04, 2008

Last fall, I purchased two bottlebrush buckeyes by mail order and set them
temporarily in the kitchen garden.  Yesterday, I finally picked out the right
spot.  I cleared some weeds, carted over a generous supply of the well-dried, 
and transplanted the buckeyes into their permanent location on a slope that's
been difficult to maintain, just at the edge of the sheep pasture.  It's an
experiment;  I've never seen a bottlebrush buckeye this far north.  But hey,
they made it through their first winter with flying colors and the climate is
warming up.

The bottlebrush buckeye is one of those magnificent flowering shrubs that I
first encountered years ago in the Brooklyn Botanical Garden.    It's a plant
that will take three years to flower and a decade to mature, so it's touch-and-
go whether I'll see it in its glory -- assuming that it survives when we have
one of those snowless frigid winters that turn nominal Zone 4 into actual Zone
2.

In addition, I planted a four foot tall bur oak (also new to the norhern
neighborhood). I like to plant an oak tree even though it will be a decade
and a half before it makes an impact on the landscape.  Oaks are for the
grandchildren and the great-grandchildren,  should there be any.  And for the
planet.  Although this part of Vermont is rich in oaks, our particular property
was oakless when we arrived.  We now have many northern reds, a swamp white and
a bur.  I'm on the lookout for other varieties that can tolerate the winters.

Not everything's going up.  Coming down, yesterday, a huge mature balsam fir,
which was in the wrong place and needed to go.  We finally bit the bullet
yesterday.  It took my neighbor Ed's big chainsaw and his Massey-Ferguson
tractor, along with chains and cables to fell it.  It will take a whole day to
cut it up and prepare for the big bonfire.  On the way down, the fir took some
limbs of a beech and made quite a mess of the front lawn.  We've replaced the
divots and re-seeded and mulched the hard-hit areas.  The beech will recover
eventually, but it will take a couple of years. It can now see the light.

Title: "He Got the Witch Grass out of his Garden"
Date: July 09, 2008

Last summer, planning to extend a flower garden, I covered a weed-choked area
of about 4 feet by 10 feet with a foot high pile of dense lawn clippings.  The
plan was to kill the sod by excluding the light of the sun. It's an effective,
proven method  -- most people use black plastic for the same purpose. What sort
of weed was I combating?  The population endemic to this part of Vermont:  a
mixed stand of goldenrod, milkweed, plantain, dandelion, blackberry, bindweed,
dogbane, Indian paint-brush, buttercup, bracken fern. Yesterday I inspected
the results. The sod is dead, but it's been replaced by a nearly pure stand of
witch grass, which not not only survived but prospered. Every other plant was
door nail dead. I spent the day pulling up and digging out forty square feet of
tenacious witch grass.

Witch grass is the most noxious of the weeds with which I daily contend. It's
invasive, almost indestructible, powerful. If you dig it out and leave behind
the merest shred of root (underground stem, actually), the plant immediately
regenerates. It finds its way through wooden barriers and under metal barriers.
It grows rapidly in almost all soils.

Witch grass has forced me to stop growing bearded iris. It so surrounds and
overwhelms the irises that they can't be weeded without dislodging the shallow
corms. I've occasionally dug up an iris where the witch grass didn't even bother
to go around the corm -- just dug a hole and bored right through it. On the
other hand, Siberian irises compete well with witch grass.  Siberians make
such a dense deep cluster of roots that they squeeze the witch grass to death.
Strangles it. Does my heart good.

There's some pleasure in weeding witch grass, especially when you can get a
good grab and drag out a long root. In good soil, after a rain, I've pulled
out pieces three or four feet long.  But you have to dispose of it properly.
It takes the sun a week to kill the root, and should you accidentally cover it
with other weeds, it will come to life even even though it's not even under the
ground.

I used to say that I wanted my gravestone to read: "He got the witch grass out
of his garden." But now I know that it was mere vanity to think that I could win
the battle of the witch grass.  Here's a prediction: there will come a day when
witch grass will grow over and under and around my marble marker.

Witch grass (agropyron repens) is not even native to the New World. It's come to
us from Europe. Along with the dandelion, the starling and Dutch elm disease.

1.  The completely botched New Orleans mess (incompetent Bushies in critical offices, carelessness, implicit racism).

2.  The attorney-general scandal (incompetent immature Bushies in critical office, subversion of the constitution, elevation of party loyalty above loyalty to the country).

3.  Compromising of the civil service (appointments based on ideology rather than merit, suppression of informed opinion).

4.  War on the environment (incompetent Bushies in high places, suppression of scientific evidence, politicization of science).

5.  Torture -- or "enhanced interrogation techniques" -- of suspects (subversion of the constitution, illegal legal memos, clandestine government).

6.  Collapse of housing market (under regulation, false optimism, indifference, atavistic economic policies).

7.  Skyrocketing of national debt (tax policy favorable to the very rich, war on the cheap).

8.  Medical policy that rewards insurance companies, penalizes patients and doctors.

9.  Collapse of the dollar.

10  Energy policy (secret, favorable to big oil, indifference to conservation).

11. Iraq war (endless, fraudulent, expensive in treasure and lives, counter-productive).

12.  Failure to capture Bin Laden (stupidity, obsession with Iraq).

Title: Firlik, Bezoars
Date: July 16, 2008

I don't like gore. I’m the kind of person who won’t recklessly channel-surf
for fear that the changer gizmo will maliciously lock onto our 24/7 surgery
channel, where some poor soul's innards will be on garish hi-def display.
 And yet, despite my squeamishness, I steeled myself and read right through
to the end of Katrina Firlik's Another Day in the Frontal Lobe, which is a
young neurosurgeon’s bildungs-autobiography. Of course, I allowed myself the
indulgence of zooming through some of the more gruesome parts. How much do I
need to know about maggot infestations in the living brain?

I’m grateful to Firlik for her vivid stories, for the occasional moment of
black humor and also for offering a forthright glimpse into an alternative
world. Nevertheless, I'm sorry to report, Another Day is not a good book. It's
too transparently a package shaped by agent and editor for short-term commercial
appeal. The author is so anxious to be cute and to be loved – she must have
been one of those front-row, admiring-eyes-glued-to-the-professor straight-A
pupils -- that whenever she comes up against a controversial topic, such as the
irrational funding of our medical system or the egomania of surgeons or the
morality of expensive, hopeless surgical interventions, she hints at concern but
then swerves and punts. She doesn't want to offend a single potential buyer.

Not a courageous writer, she is not an admirable being either: what can one say
about a highly-skilled professional who turns down job after job in the American
hinterland and elects to live in New Canaan, Connecticut, because, she admits,
it would be impossible to find a good Japanese restaurant in the sticks,  and
who in one sentence notes that her rich town has more neurosurgeons than all of
sub-Sahara Africa and in another reveals that she works on spines rather than
brains nowadays because spines are more lucrative.

Hey, Katrina, the next time you publish something, sacrifice some of that
royalty money and write directly from your heart (even though it's one cold and
stony organ).

Readers of this blague will not be surprised to learn that Dr. M. was much
intrigued by the book's medical vocabulary. Another Day serves up a feast of
beautiful and exotic words:  venous infarct, dura, spicule, rongeur, neuroma,
glioma, glioblastoma (you don’t want one!), bone dust, debulk, pachygyria. The
ugliest of all: intubated. My personal favorite, and a word that I've now put
in the running for Word of the Year: bezoar.

How could I have lived all these years without knowing the word bezoar?  Could
there be a surer index of my ignorance of medicine?  A bezoar, as everyone but
me seems to know, is a concretion of indigestible stuff stuck somewhere in the
digestive tract – hairballs, medicines, bits of food. Sometimes they can be
dissolved, but on occasions they can only be removed by surgery. A bezoar was
formerly thought to be a magical antidote for poisons –- so score another
couple of strikes against our ignorant superstitious ancestors. The most common
kind of bezoar is the phytobezoar, which is a collection of lignin, cellulose,
or tannin of food fibers. Common sources: celery, grapes, raisins, prunes,
pumpkins, all of which, if you’re like me, you’ve probably unwittingly eaten
without having given a thought to their bezoar-potential and therefore neglected
a splendid opportunity for hypochondria.

A bezoar caused by eating persimmons (an especially dangerous fruit,
bezoarwise), earns its very own word-- diospyrobezoar -- an odd amalgam of
Greek and Persian linguistic roots and a word which, just as soon as a suitable
opening arises, I intend to insinuate into the conversation.

Title: The Wave
Date: July 20, 2008

When we arrived in West Bradford forty years ago, there were lots of cows but
very few people. The main road was unpaved and aside from morning-and-evening
milk trucks and the tractors pulling hay wagons, there were very few vehicles.
Now, they've run electricity out Welch's old road and must have built forty new
homes and as a result there are a ton more folks who commute south. (In the
1960s, the nearest exit off the interestate was thirty-five miles away; now, the
interstate is just five miles away.) Very few milking cows are left nowadays --
some horses, some sheep, some heifers raised for beef. Hobby farms, mostly. Inch
by inch we've been surburbanized. Or more properly, exurbanized.

In the 1960s, when two cars passed on the road, the drivers would often stop
to chat, knowing that it wasn't likely that another vehicle would pass by for
a half an hour. If they didn't stop to talk, they'd at least wave. It was bad
manners not to acknowledge an oncoming vehicle. I remember that Ron Jepson, now
long dead, who made a living off twelve acres and a handful of cows, complained
to me once about one of our neighborhood grumps. "He doesn't even wave when he
goes by." Not waving was an intolerable breach of road etiquette.

What's happened to the custom? The wave is in steep decline and only survives as
a vestige of an older way of life. When we take our morning walk on South Road
or on Hackett Hill Road, I make a point of waving at the oncoming drivers. The
response is inconsistent. There's a rare enthusiastic open palm wrist-waggle,
an occasional mock salute, and sometimes a big windshield wiper wave, but more
often merely a perfunctory palm lift off the steering wheel. Sometimes the palm
lift is reduced even further, to a right index finger lift -- a feeble gesture
to antiquity.  Half the drivers don't wave at all; they are recent immigrants
who don't know that the wave has a history. They're in a hurry to get where
they're going, wherever that may be.

Clearly, the great age of waving has passed. But not for all of us. That will
be me out there on the side of the road, elbow raised and wrist oscillating,
clinging to the customs of our forefathers.

Title: "The verse is not/ So long as we can say 'This be the verse'"
Date: August 01, 2008

The most widely-known as well as the most notorious poem of the second half
of the twentieth century is Philip Larkin's "This Be the Verse." For those of
you who don't know the poem by heart, here it is in its brief and startling
entirety.

They fuck you up, your mum and dad.

They may not mean to, but they do.

They fill you with the faults they had

And add some extra, just for you.

But they were fucked up in the turn

By fools in old style hats and coats,

Who half the time were soppy-stern,

And half at one another's throats.

Man adds on misery to man.

It deepens like a coastal shelf.

Get out as early as you can,

And don't have any kids yourself.

Pessimistic? Jaded? Angry?  Yes, I think it's fair to call it so. And let's
also add, unsubtle with a vengeance.

Larkin is hyperbolically illogical. It can't be that every generation is
more deranged than the one that preceded it. When were the good times? A few
generations ago?  In the medieval period?  In antiquity?  In Larkin's view,
it's been all downhill, all the time. No doubt those early primates were already
fucking up their kids when they came down from the trees and started to walk
upright on the savannah. "There's only one piece of roasted rhinoceros left. You
take it. I don't mind being hungry."

Despite its dyspepsia and illogicality, "This Be the Verse" is a curiously
lovable poem. Whenever I've heard it read or recited, audiences react not
with horror but with amusement. The poem's misanthropy is so absolute and its
language so blunt that it can't help but provoke tittering.

The laughter arises because the poem doesn't earn its pessimism. It's too
fluent and too easy. Unlike, say, King Lear, where the sublunary world is rank
with incest, betrayal, and murder.  After three thousand lines and five full
horrific acts, Shakespeare acquires the standing to conclude that life is
miserable and that "humanity must perforce/ Prey on itself, like monsters of the
deep."

The events in Oedipus lend credibility to the difficult apercu that it's best
not to be born at all, next best to die very young.

While Shakespeare and Sophocles are philosophically serious, Larkin is merely
flip. There's a monumental disproportion between his gloom and the light-verse
vessel in which his gloom is contained. And as a consequence, the off-kilter
comedy. It's a whiny poem. "Poor poor pitiful me. I had a difficult mommy."

If "This Be the Verse" is in fact the most popular poem of the last fifty years,
it supersedes Frost's "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening." What a remarkable
devolution! While Frost endures, Larkin abhors.

I doubt whether Larkin had "Stopping by Woods" in mind, but he certainly glosses
Robert Louis Stevenson's "Requiem" -- the poem from which he drew his title.
Stevenson's performance is charming, gentle, self-effacing, and modest.

Under the wide and starry sky,

Dig the grave and let me lie.

Glad did I live and gladly die.

And laid me down with a will.

This be the verse you grave for me:

Here he lies where he longed to be.

Home is the sailor, home from the sea,

And the hunter home from the hill.

Stevenson praises the adventurous life lived well and brought to completion.
Death may end it all but it also closes the circle. No completion, no circles
in Larkin, where natural processes are crudely truncated: "don't have any kids
yourself."

"This Be the Verse" is a hilarious and wonderful piece of joking, but it's
victimology is unsettling. It's tempting to claim that it satirizes its own
pessimism, but, sorry, it doesn't. Larkin loves his own gloom.

Here's another Victorian variation on the thema Larkiniana.

Is life a thorn?

Then count it not a whit.

Man is well done with it.

As soon as he's born,

He should all means assay

To put the plague away.

Pessimistic, yes.  But Colonel Fairfax, even-handed, also entertains the
possibility that life might be a boon (which, as we all know, is true for at
least part of the time).

Title: A Non-Mystical Experience
Date: August 03, 2008

It was the evening of a cloudy day and I had my face in among the clumps
of blooming day lilies, which I was trying to protect from the constant
encroachment of witch grass. It's a minor art -- to lie on the ground and reach
arm's length into the forest of leaves, careful not to knock the fragile buds
off the scapes, and identify and remove the underground stems of the witch grass
by feel alone. I had pulled out a heap of noxious weeds and was lost, absolutely
lost, in the project, when suddenly, from behind my back the about-to-set sun
emerged and illuminated the scene   For no more than thirty seconds the day
lily spectrum was on full display: apricot, pink, a range of yellows, each
slightly different from its neighbor, a near white, along with a few fully
saturated, shimmering crimsons, plus some bi-colors with their cute contrasting
throats. For a glorious moment, everything leaped at me. It was truly theatrical
to be surrounded by such brilliant colors and shapes and fragrances -- a rare
and memorable instance of transcendent aesthetic bliss.

The next day, on he telephone, I tried to convey my rapture to The Daughter.
She was concerned. One of her friends had had a similar moment. Her friend
was walking in the Colorado mountains and came upon a magnificent field of
wild flowers. The experience was powerful and life-changing, and she's now,
after years of study, an Episcopal priest. "You're not going to tell me that it
was a religious experience, are you?" I could hear the worry in her voice. My
response: "I would have thought you'd have known me better than that."

Some people conflate beauty with spirituality and religion. I'm not one of those
people. Beauty is transcendent, yes, but it's also material and explicable.

No question but that the profusion of day lily colors is glorious. For a
hundred years now, careful hybridizers have worked on the homely fulvous lily,
a roadside weed sometimes inelegantly called the "outhouse lily", and have
transformed it into the bearer of the rainbow colors in which it now sparkles. 
Thank you, clever day lily breeders, for your generations of imaginative work.
Thanks also to the parcel post driver who every year brings me three or four
more new varieties from Oakes in Tennessee. And while I'm at it, I would also
like to thank the people who designed and built that brown truck and its rubber
tires and constructed the roads and refined the gasoline -- no border of day
lilies without their help. Nor without the designers and manufacturers of my
spade and my favorite dibble and my all-purpose dandelion puller. I could add
other equally essential people -- go right back to the first practitioners of
smelting -- but I think I've made my point.  The day lilies do not declare the
glory of god; they declare the glory of human civilization and human enterprise.

I  grow a single wild fulvous lily on the grounds, just as a reminder.

It's drab.

Praise for what is not praiseworthy is mere flattery. All the more so, if
fair words gain advantage. Praise even of the dead is suspect if it flatters
survivors. Persons in authority must be wary of false praise: be mindful
that for every man who praises you, ninety-nine hold their peace or mutter
imprecations aside.  A friend of long standing said to me, "You are the
hardest person to praise of anyone I've ever known," by which words he meant to
tax me, but which I took as compliment. I offer praise generously when it is
merited, but not for ordinary deeds. Of a churlish man, it was justly said at
his funeral, that he was a good speller; of a sloven, that his fingernails had
never been so clean. Praise need not be effusive and is most sincere if simply
couched. I was once most happy to be praised, when a discreet man, looking over
a landscape of which I am vain, said to a friend who marveled, "He works on
it."  Of all virtues, I am most apt to praise diligence, the want of which I
deplore in myself. Children are most easy to praise as they know not irony.

Title: The Sculpin.  Slimy or Mottled?
Date: August 14, 2008

Knowing little of the finny tribe, I borrowed the Bradford Public Library's
copy of Langdon's introductory Fishes of Vermont (2006). It's an excellent,
informative, helpful guide. With Langdon's help, I can now declare that it's
undeniably the brown bullhead, a species of catfish, that has been multiplying
in our pond, The bullhead, a villainous omnivore, is one of the causes of the
steep decline of our population of frogs. The butt-ugly, scaleless, bebarbelled
brute gobbles frogs' eggs.

Readers of this blague will not be astonished to learn that Dr. M .has fallen
deeply in love with fish names. Take the brown bullhead, for example. It's
also known by such evocative and lunatic denominations as the horned pout, the
mudcat, and the minister. Minister?  To whom, and under what circumstances,
would a brown bullhead minister?

My favorite Vermont fish, nomenclature-wise, is the slimy sculpin, also
performing under such titles as the blob, the chucklehead, the rock cusk, the
stargazer, and the cockatouch. The slimy sculpin should not be confused with its
near cousin, the mottled sculpin -- which can also be addressed as the slowfish
or gudgeon.

Many of the common Vermont fishes have lost their colorful historic names. The
bowfin was once called the John A. Gindle, the stonecat was the doogler, the
lake trout was the togue or longue, the burbot was variously ling or lawyer
(lawyer? minister?  why not accountant? or dentist?), the quillback was the
buffalo, and the gar was the needlenose. On the other hand, the blandly-named
pond perch of olden days is trending in the reverse direction: it's now called
the pumpkinseed -- a name which seems curiously vegetarian for a denizen of the
deep.

If I had known that there was a fish called the cisco (known on jolly days as
the tollibee and on prosaic days as the sand herring), I would long ago have
promoted Galen Cisco to my all-time-great Baseball-Fish Team, adding him to such
piscine luminaries as Catfish Hunter, Dizzy Trout, Chico Salmon, Sid Bream,
Bobby Sturgeon, Art "Red" Herring, and Shad Roe. And Mudcat Grant.

that the grandfather of existentialism was Fyodor Dostoevsky.  Who, in those
days, would have confessed to ignorance about Raskolnikov, his heady jumbled
philosophy, the murder, the remorse?  We were all striving to be Alienated
Youth, and Raskolnikov was the king of alienation -- a hundred times more
alienated than the runner-up, James Dean.

I've just finished reading Crime and Punishment, and I have a confession to
make.  I didn't remember the plot, the characters, or the outcome.  Not the
picture of louche, impoverished, oppressive St. Petersburg.  Nothing except the
mellifluous name:  Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov. Come to think of it, I didn't
remember the Rodion or the Romanovich either.  Just the Raskolnikov part.

Did I read the novel back there in the fifties?  If I did, is my memory now
so flimsy and porous that I've lost everything?   Did I pretend to have read
the novel?  Or was it so much spoken of that I absorbed it without effort. 
Whatever the facts, I certainly managed to fool myself.

Crime and Punishment is an exceedingly vivid piece of writing.  I think
that the trampling of Marmeladov and the suicide of Svidraigalov are such
brilliantly written scenes that they could not possibly slip my mind. How
could I lose track of the pathetic waif Sonya, her dreadful occuption, or her
lunatic stepmother?  The grand generous gestures, the poverty, the overwrought
emotions, the flaunting of propriety.

It's a thrilling, iconoclastic novel -- painful, and not fun for the morally
squeamish.  It's absolutely unforgettable.

Title: Duke, Duke, Duke
Date: August 20, 2008

Ain't it shocking that Gene Chandler's excellent song is now almost half a
century old?  Seems like just yesterday.

This be the verse in its full splendor.

Duke, Duke, Duke, Duke of Earl Duke, Duke, Duke of Earl Duke, Duke, Duke of Earl

Duke, Duke, Duke of Earl Duke, Duke, Duke of Earl Duke, Duke, Duke of Earl Duke,
Duke, Dukeof Earl

As I walk through this world Nothing can stop the Duke of Earl And you, you are
my girl And no one can hurt you, oh no Yes, I'm gonna love you Come on let me
hold you darlin' 'Cause I'm the Duke of Earl.

And when I hold you You will be my Duchess, Duchess of Earl We'll walk through
my dukedom And the paradise we will share.

Yes, oh, I I'm gonna love you Nothing can stop me now 'Cause I'm the Duke of
Earl.

Duke, Duke, Duke of Earl Duke, Duke, Duke of Earl Duke, Duke, Duke of Earl

I'm gonna love you Nothing can stop me now 'Cause I'm the Duke of Earl.

1)  "Duke of Earl" is classic, though late, doo-wop. It's lineally descended
from songs in which a supporting male quartet sang meaningless syllables: doo
wop, wop, wop. In this revisiting of the genre, nonsense doo doo doo de wop
has been superseded by words that carry meaning of a sort: duke duke duke of
earl. Return we now to the pages of history: in their turn, doo wop quartets
were themselves secular offspring of gospel quartets, where a reverent foursome
would sing do lord do lord, do lordy lord (a good example: the unnamed quartet
supporting Georgia Peach in "Do Lord Send Me").

2)  It's a fascinating process: Gene Chandler's replacement of doo doo with
duke duke is in fact a return to the roots, except that the previous and
inherent religious content has undergone secularization. "Lord" has become
"Duke," while the heaven of gospel has become the "dukedom" of doo-wop.

3.  It's easy to deride the naive aristocratic title "Duke of Earl"; but would the song preserve its meaning if it were "Duke of Buckingham?" "Earl" may sound silly, but because it's a generic title rather than a specific one it carries allegorical significance."Duke of Earl" is no one and therefore everyone.

4.  It's entirely likely that the word "earl" was chosen because of it echoes "lord": liquids "r" and 'l" and unemphatic vowel.

5.  The first line of the lyric --"As I walk through this world"-- introduces a secularized religious motif (an inheritance from the song's gospel forbears). Some will recall the opening sentence of the most famous of all religious allegories, Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress (1672): "As I walked through the wilderness of this world."  Gene Chandler, walking through this world, is reborn just as Christian was reborn in the classic allegory. Not religiously, but in a worldly way. He is not saved;  he is duked.

6.  What is the significance of aggressive "nothing can stop me now?" What obstacles stopped the Duke of Earl in the past, before his duking?  The triumphalist language is highly developed but the obstacles remain vague and unarticulated. Audiences find their own meaning in the lacuna, but indignities historically suffered by the black underclass lurk only slightly below the surface of the lyric.

7.  The transformation from a previous but unknown and unarticulated existence to an aristocratic, unstoppable Duke of Earl takes place offstage, nor is any explanation offered for the metamorphosis. It's entirely magical.

8.  Because it's magic, it's pure fantasy. Pastoral fantasy in fact, which, curiously, is simultaneously primitive ("paradise") and sophisticated ("dukedom").

9. But it's a shared paradise: the duke along with his duchess. The retreat to domesticity is almost Victorian: "ah love, let us be true/ To one another...."  This particular Duke does not know that "Two paradises were in one/ To live in paradise alone."

10.  The Duke retreats to domesticity and ayet he seems to stake out ("nothing can stop me now") new territory to conquer, in which regard the spacious lyric seems to embody contradictory or even incoherent vectors of thought. However, the enthusiasm of the singing obliterates the ambiguity of the lyric; in sum, the song is remarkably optimistic -- which is just one reason for its continued popularity.

Title: Lebanon, Puccini
Date: August 23, 2008

I'm just back from Lebanon (that would be Lebanon, New Hampshire) where I
heard a performance of Puccini's Madame Butterfly.  If you pay no mind to the
ridiculous racist orientalist anti-American story, it's a pretty good opera. 
The orchestra, though small, was excellent and the singers top-notch.  The
music is a little on the overwrought side, and the garish emotional display
makes Dostoevsky seem in comparison like drawing-room comedy.  It's a sad,
dated story.  While Emma Bovary found the solution to her problem in arsenic,
Anna Karenina in the locomotive and Edna Pontellier in the water, Cio-cio-san
elects the knife -- more evidence, if more is needed, for women's paucity of
choices in the grand old days.  But great melodies, no question.  The opera
crowd was, as usual, a little on the geriatric side -- and as a consequence I
felt quite youthful bounding up to the balcony.  At breakfast the next day, a
friend admitted to being moved by Cio-cio-san's suffering.  "Did you cry," I
asked.  His reply:  "I'm not saying."

Title: Smoking, Smokers
Date: August 25, 2008

My father smoked cigars and later a pipe;  my mother smoked Lucky Strikes --
lots of them.  When I was a boy, the air in our house was a blue-gray haze. I
believe that my mother smoked throughout her four pregnancies. Why shouldn't
she have?  The tobacco industry advertised that smoking was good for you. 
There wasn't "a cough in a carload."  Doctors smoked Camels and were paid to
testify that smoking was harmless all the while corporate leaders knew about
but suppressed evidence of fetal damage, heart disease, and lung cancer. 
Cigarettes were the perfect product:  "make it for a penny, sell it for a
dollar, and it's addictive as hell."

I tried to smoke -- I stole my mother's cigarettes and lit up in the cellar. 
It was horrible, nasty, and disgusting.  I couldn't do it.

Smoking was omnipresent in those days.  Foul odors and brimful ashtrays were
the norm.  In my first year in college, I was assigned a roommate who smoked
constantly.  I hated it, but there was no recourse.  Professors smoked
while lecturing and students, naturally, followed suit, so classrooms were
distractingly polluted.  Smokers had everything their way and dissenters were
a prissy minority.  At dinner parties, guests would bring their cigarettes to
the table.  Is there anything more odious than a tray of smelly ashes at the
festive board?

In the 70s, I got up the courage to place a modest, hesitant sign on our
front door:  "Please no tobacco."  But sometimes guests would smoke anyway,
unwilling to believe  that a hospitable person would try to restrict a commonly
accepted right.  I was regularly outraged by the insensitivity of my friends.

But little by little, customs and laws began to change.  It took lots of hard
work by anti-smoking lobbyists and organizers.  Many lawsuits. Now it's hard to
remember that until recently airplanes had smoking and non-smoking sections --
although in fact, the air stunk no matter where you sat.  As did restaurants,
buses, arenas, theaters, offices.

Nowadays, no one that I know would dream of smoking indoors; certainly not in
someone's home.  Cigarette smoking has become a shameful addiction.  The
change in attitude toward tobacco has been one of the few unequivocal social
betterments of my lifetime  -- but too late for those dear friends and family
members who died far too painfully and far too early.

And what about those knots of poor proud deluded newly-addicted teen-agers? 
The increase in tobacco use world-wide?  And those fat pompous corporate execs,
still lying through their shiny teeth, who deserve to be strung up by their
thumbs?

Title: Nanny State!  Nanny State!
Date: August 29, 2008

According to Charles Dickens, who visited the United States in 1842, American
men were constantly masticating tobacco.  He was thoroughly shocked by the "two
odious practices of chewing and expectorating" -- a habit that he found to be
both "offensive and sickening."

"In all the public places of America," wrote the novelist, "this filthy custom
is recognized.  In the courts of law the judge has his spittoon, the crier his,
the witness his, and the prisoner his."  They all spit "incessantly."  Worse
still, In the hospitals the students of medicine are requested, by notices upon
the wall, to eject there tobacco juice into the boxes provided for that purpose,
and not to discolor the stairs."  A further horror:  "in public buildings
visitors are implored ... to squirt the essence of their plugs... into the
national spittoons, and not about the bases of the marble columns.  This custom
is inseparably mixed up with every meal and morning call, and with all the
transactions of social life.  The stranger will find it in its full bloom and
glory, luxuriant in all its alarming recklessness."

It must have been horrible.  Dickens says that every floor, staircase, carpet
was disfigured with traces of "tinctured saliva."  It's hard to imagine that
our revered ancestors lived in such a foul, smelly, slippery environment or that
your doc would have a spittoon at his feet while he discussed your symptoms.

Eventually, there was a movement to ban public spitting, but it took almost
a century before the odious custom was conquered (except on the baseball
field, where it flourishes today in all its ancient glory).  There were those
who resisted change, of course.  To prohibit spitting was to regulate and
ultimately to deny a human freedom.  If the catchword had been invented, the
right-wingers of the day would have been shouting, the way they do now when it's
not the spitting but the smoking of tobacco that's in question:  "Spitters'
rights!  Spitters' rights!  Nanny state!  Nanny state!"

When Sir Simonds d'Ewes visited Paris two centuries before Dickens toured
America, he was shocked to find the steps of the Louvre littered with "a
thousand ordures."  Defecating in public was the French custom and a human
freedom.  Eventually, however, laws and customs changed.  But I'm absolutely
positive that 1640s libertarians were out there on the barricades, screaming
"Shitters' rights!  Shitters' rights!  Nanny state! Nanny state!"

Title: What is a Drag?
Date: September 05, 2008

What, exactly, is a drag?  Here's a sentence from Kate Chopin's edgy (in a
Victorian way) 1899 novel, The Awakening.  "Alcee Arobin and Mrs. Highcamp
called for Mrs. Pontellier one bright afternoon in Arobin's drag."  A drag? 
Could it be "a large four-horse coach with seats inside and on top."  O my
gosh!  It's still another nineteenth-century horse-drawn vehicle!  Along with
a cutter and a kibitka.   Memo to self: add to list.

I didn't know of the existence of The Awakening, a novel which had dropped
completely off the map, until sometime in the 1980s, when it re-established
itself in courses in AmLit.  It was a banned book for a while, not, I would
guess, because of the adultery itself, but because Edna Pontellier acknowledges
and acts on sexual desire.  Alcee Arobin, drag-owner, senses her vulnerability,
but I don't think that in this case the vehicle figures in the seduction.  It's
a fine, liberating book, the prose a little on the hothouse-gardenia side, but
well worth the re-reading.

Dr. M. (in a state of shock):  "Surgery?  On a chicken?  How much is that

Title: Citizen Dentist
Date: September 09, 2008

Sarah Palin is like Jesse Ventura; she's a "novelty" governor.  Every once
in a while, Americans like to stick it to the pols by electing an amateur. 
It shakes things up for a while.  Sarah Palin is a joke, but now McCain has
endangered our beloved nation by taking her seriously. Here's a scenario: 
McCain is elected, he dies or is taken out by a conspiratorial maniac, and
there's a dangerous small-minded, uneducated, right-wing fringe religious-bigot
demagogue in charge of the nuclear stockpile.

Governing is the most difficult of all arts, and yet Americans seem to think
it's a snap.  When you take your car in to be fixed, you want an experienced,
knowledgeable mechanic, not, not an actor or an athlete.  I'm yet to meet a
person who wants his impacted wisdom tooth treated by a citizen dentist.  But
to run the government -- let's just hire anyone at all.

I'm reading Milan Kundera's excellent novel, The Joke.  It's set in 1950s
Czechoslovakia, and like all novels of the communist era, portrays a world in
which the government is in the hands of mediocre people chosen and promoted not
for brains, wisdom, or talent but for ideological orthodoxy.  t's a system
that's doomed to failure, but it's exactly the system that has now been imposed
on this country by the Bush administration, which regularly hired graduates
of Patrick Henry and Liberty --ideologically pure right-wing colleges -- over
applicants of genuine distinction.

Republicans oppose affirmative action when it works to the advantage of the
underrepresented, but they are its greatest proponents when it comes to
political correctness.  Major examples (there are zillion minor ones) are such
disasters as Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, Justice Clarence Thomas, and now
likely Vice President Sarah Palin.

Title: Expertise by Proximity
Date: September 15, 2008

Regular correspondent Otis Jefferson Brown inquires whether, in lieu of the
precedent by which Sarah Palin claims expertise in foreign affairs because
she can almost see Russian from Alaska, he is now a rocket scientist because,
through his bedroom window, he can, on starry nights, see the moon.

Otis, I'm sorry to say,  does not grasp the precedent.  Of course he's not
a rocket scientist, because he's not educated or practiced in that difficult
field.  However, he is certainly qualified, by the principle of expertise
by proximity, to become the head of NASA, for which position I urge him to
immediately apply, especially if he attended high school with Sarah.

Is each and every Alaskan equally qualified to be Vice President?  Of
course they are, but with a caveat.  Those who live in the western part
of the state are obviously more knowledgeable and are to be preferred to
dwellers in the Alaskan interior.  Eastern Alaskans have not achieved more
significant expertise by proximity than what would prepare them to serve as
trade representative to the Yukon, or perhaps, ambassador to Canada.

Title: What I Learned in Frackville
Date: September 19, 2008

TV-free for more than three months, we stayed last night at a motel in
Frackville, Pennsylvania and couldn't resist taking a gander at the tube.  I
was shocked to see how artificial and contrived it all seemed.  The actors were
not real people, nor were they actors pretending to be real people.  They were
actors trying but failing to act like real people.  They were, at least to me
last night, no more convincingl than those archaic Egyptian sculptures.

Try this experiment.  Switch on the TV and then surf from channel to channel. 
I guarantee that you'll be able to tell within ten seconds whether the
person you see on the screen is acting in a "daytime drama," a TV series, a
documentary, or a movie.  The style of performance in each of these genres is
so heavily conventionalized that the cues become immediately obvious to the
TV-literate.  (By the word "convention." I mean "an agreed-upon departure from
reality").  Good actors have assimilated these conventions.  When they appear
on screen, they gesture and smile and speak in agreed-upon but unnatural ways.

My new perspective was an artifact of the three-month hiatus.  Temporarily
unfamiliar with the style, all I could see were the conventions at work.  Of
course actors are always faking, but I had stopped seeing it.  In Frackville,
it all became transparent, offensively transparent.  And because it was so
transparent, it wasn't worth my time, especially when a little clicking brought
me to baseball.

I wonder how long my resistance will continue.  Not very many days, I
Iimagine.  'll forget.

Stepping westward, we left St. Louis behind and detoured northward to enjoy

Louisiana, an old river town where a handful of century-old mercantile buildings
are hanging on precariously, waiting to be redeployed for modern uses.  I
recommend if, especially for those who are not fazed by a seventy-five mile add-
on to a twenty-four hundred mile jaunt.

While I'm dispensing advice, let me also commend Route 50 between and Bridgeport
and Parkersburg in West Virginia -- another less-well-traveled and very
beautiful highway.

Louisiana, Missouri (unknown to me until today) now enters that small but
distinguished category of cities that are named according to an unusual

Delaware, Ohio  and Delaware, Wyoming and Indiana, Pennsylvania. Related but

Date: September 26, 2008

I watched a part of the Couric-Palin interview (all I could stand).  For me, it
was a deja vu experience.  Took me back to the days when I examined students
who had missed most of the classes and hadn't done much of the reading but had
the effrontery to see if they could bullshit their way through.  It was all
there:  the repetition of a handful of memorized phrases, the circumlocutions,
the volley of words when an occasional thought entered  the otherwise vacant
brain, the telltale fumbling, the sheer unadulterated bluff.  But as for
Palin's level of analysis -- it wouldn't have earned a C in any class that I
ever taught.  At best, it's at the level required to run for vice president of
the student body in a mediocre high school.

Title: Left-right Confusion
Date: September 29, 2008

As far as I know, there have been exactly zero scientific studies of directional
dyslexia.  As a consequence, all of our knowledge is anecdotal.  No one can
say for certain whether the condition is inherited or acquired, or whether it's
more (or less) common among women, southpaws, redheads, eastern Europeans,
bad spellers, or chocoholics.  "Common sense" suggests that it might be
associated with right-left confusion, and indeed, a number of the individuals
who've commented on ""People who Lose their Way" indicate that they have
severe problems telling the one hand from the other.  For example:  one
commentator reports that a lifelong problem is that "I've been completely
unable to instinctively tell left from right."  The emphasis on the word
"instinctively" is meaningful.  Without conscious effort, most unaffected
people intuitively and easily understand the difference between right and
left;  for another class, some of them DDers, it's something that must be
learned by effort, as in the case of the reader who thinks her DD is related
to the fact that she "had lots of trouble as a child learning right and left,"
or of another who, learning to dance, can't consistently raise "right hand and
left leg -- or vice versa."  Another non-instinctive person "still doesn't know
my left from my right (I have to put my hands out and see which one makes an
'L).'"  A high school student plaintively confesses that her mom "threatened to
write the words left and right on the back of my hands before I had to take the
test for my driver's license."  It's a frequent complaint:  "I was almost 20
years old before I stopped having to think 'I write with my left hand...  if I
were to pick up a pencil which hand would I hold it in.'"

Is there, then, an association between right-left confusion and directional
dyslexia?

I don't think that the evidence allows us to conclude so.

Most of the people who commented do not mention any such condition.

Perhaps they take it for granted that everyone in the DD community shares the
trait -- but we don't.  Even though I'm among the world's most frequently lost
souls, I have not the slightest bit of trouble with left and right.  In fact,
I'd say that I'm hyperconscious of my handedness as well as the handedness of
others.  I always observe and remember which of my acquaintances are right or
left-handed.  And if someone says, "turn left," I turn left.  Unerringly and
instinctively.

Pending further investigation, the evidence suggests that left-right confusion
is independent of directional dyslexia.  It's a separate problem (and one which
may further disorient those of us who are chronically lost).

Title: Lessons from R. B. Hayes
Date: October 04, 2008

Rutherford B. Hayes, whose biography (by Hans J. Trefousse) I have just read,
was a an intelligent, well-meaning, but not very imaginative president.  It's
a blemish on his record that he compromised his principles and allowed ex-
Confederate leaders in the southern states to install Jim Crow policies that
would take a hundred years to undo.  He should have fought much harder.

Hayes' most famous sentence dates from his 1877 inaugural address: "He serves
his party best who serves his country best."  It's an admirable principle --
and one that that has been thoroughly violated by Mr. Bush and the pack of
clowns and schmegeggies that he has installed to ruin our government.

After Hayes left office, he wandered to the political left.  Although as
president he had intervened to crush the railroad strikes, he later came to
believe (according to Trefousse) that "the taxation system was unfair, taking
a much smaller share of the estates of millionaires than of ordinary people."
"The real difficulty," Hayes wrote, "is that vast wealth and power reside in
the hands of the few and unscrupulous.  Hundreds of laws are in the interest
of these men and against the interest of the workingmen.  Lincoln was for
government of the people.  The new tendency is for government 'of the rich, by
the rich, and for the rich.'"

These are words of remarkable pertinence.  It woult appear that we haven't
moved very far from the mark -- the more shame to us.  If Hayes had said these
same words today, he would not doubt have been accused of fomenting "class
warfare."  (Class warfare: redistributing money from rich to poor.  Normal
state of affair (not class warfare):  taking money from the poor to give to the
rich.)

We enjoyed In Bruges for its black humor, its witty profanity, and the
unpredictability of its plot (that is, until the mandatory chase scene).  And
especially for the lovely views of medieval Bruges, an old Hanseatic town.

In Bruges contains a film-within-a-film which is described by Chloe, the
handsome drug dealer and thief, as an imitation or a homage or a 'nod of the
head' toward Don't Look Now, Nicholas Roeg's scary-as-hell Julie Christie-Donald
Sutherland masterpiece.  I've been racking my poor brains, trying to decide
whether there's a meaningful connection between the two films -- or whether the
writer-director Martin McDonagh is just planting red herrings.

Bruges and Venice (where the earlier film is set) are old, architecturally rich,
becanalled towns and both directors make much of their warm civic atmosphere. 
The plots of both films are initiated by the deaths of young children.  In each
film, an important character is a dwarf who is, one case, the perpetrator of
violence and in the other its victim.  That's all that I can come up with at
the moment, so I'm leaning to the red-herring theory. But I'd be interested in
other people's views.

Title: Non-Existent Republican Friends
Date: October 10, 2008

Although I'm not a particularly sociable individual, I have friends all over
the U.S and a few in other parts of the planet.  I have friends of various
interests and complexions and ethnicities and ages and of both (or all) the
genders.  Although religion is said to be great divider, and I'm not in any
sense a believer, I have maintained rewarding and intimate relationships with
people who are regular churchgoers -- even with some who are devout beyond
ordinary devotion.  But there's one class of people with whom I share no
friendships -- I have not a single friend who is a Republican.

I don't that think it's merely a question of opportunity or proximity.  I
think that there are such fundamental differences between the way Republicans
and Democrats see the world that it's nearly impossible to create a basis for
friendship between the two groups.  A while back, we traveled to Bulgaria. 
There were some thirty people in the group, who, within a day or two, had
sorted themselves into two distinct clans. In the bus: Repubs together, Dems
together.  In the restaurants, same thing.  Walking, talking, visiting the
museums and archaeological sites -- the same.  It was a clear case of mutual
affinity and mutual repulsion.

There were no overt political discussions, no debates on the issues. What, then,
were the cues to which we (and everyone else) responded?

At heart, I think, It's the difference between those who see the world as
necessarily competitive and those who think that it can be cooperative.  The
crucial sign is the way that people think of money and taxes.  As soon as
someone started to talk about his money, I became wary.  When the same person
complained about his taxes, I knew that he was never going to be my friend.

A Republican responds positively to a candidate who announces that he's going to
let people "keep more of their own money in their own pockets."   The phrase
"your own money" gives me the willies.  I don't think that anyone makes money
on his own -- he makes it because there's an enormous public investment over
many hundreds of years that has created  the opportunity to "make money." 
Our taxes have supported this titanic effort.  I think that the  standard
of living of many Americans -- certainly of those who can afford to travel
to Bulgaria -- is high enough that they can think about improving the living
standard of others,  and stop thinking first of their own pockets.  People who
have enough and yet continue to prioritize their pockets are simply selfish.

It's the difference between a Hobbesian universe -- a war of all against
all -- and a universe in which competition is no more real than altruism. 
 Republican electioneering is designed to appeal to the worser side of human
nature, not the better, the more community-minded side.

Hobbes believed that men were so depraved and competitive that they required
authoritarian government to keep them in check.  Is that why Republicans are
so tolerant of government intrusion into their personal lives?  And why they
profess liberty but continue to fall in love with simplistic heavy-handed
nationalists?

Title: The Libertarian Universe
Date: October 12, 2008

Out here in the west, social services are administered by the county
commissioners.  At a candidate forum last night, libertarians running for
commissioner opposed a .05% (i.e. a penny on a $20 purchase) extension of
a sales tax that would go to support battered women, the alcohol recovery
facility, mental health, walk-in clinics for the poor, etc.   The libertarian
argument: "charity" should be voluntary.  When the government collects taxes,
it will be elected officials not "the people" who decide which "charity" to
support.

It's a truly grotesque argument.  Of course elected officials (democratically-
elected officials) decide.  Its their job;  we've delegated it to them.  We
elect officials to to decide how to spend all public revenue.  What exactly is
the problem?

Moreover, I know of not a single instance in which a complex society such as
ours has been able to support the less able and less fortunate with strictly
private charity.  It hasn't happened and it's certainly not going to happen
soon.

Is private giving morally superior to public intervention, as the libertarians
assert?  I don't know that it is.  Most of us express our commitment to the
general welfare by paying our share of the burden.

I can only conclude that the libertarians, at least the ones that I heard last
night, live in an alternative and wholly theoretical universe.  They're in
thrall to a foolish and impractical ideology -- one that renders their actions
unintentionally hard-hearted and cruel.

And what makes them so damn angry, intolerant and insulting?

Title: Reading Trollope
Date: October 19, 2008

I would have thought that there wasn't a novel by Anthony Trollope that I hadn't
read, but browsing the library shelves, I found one that was unfamiliar to
me.  It's a short, late novel called An Eye for an Eye. It dates from 1878
(Trollope, born in 1815, died in 1882.

Trollope wrote forty-seven fluent novels and thoroughly mastered his craft. An
Eye for an Eye reprises familiar motifs, most notably Trollope's favorite
situation of the weak hero torn between private and public callings. Shall it
be love, this time, or shall it be duty? In this particular case, the hero is
young, uncommonly simple Fred Neville, who promises himself to the Irish beauty
Kate O'Hara but also agrees that he will never dishonor the Scroope name (he's
the heir to the Earl of Scroope) by marrying beneath his station. It's a typical
Trollope situation but daring for its time, because Fred impregnates Kate
(when?  between chapters?Although I thought I was reading attentively, I missed
the moment).

Trollope creates an awkward situation, but I'm sorry to say, gets himself and
Fred off the hook by throwing one of the major characters under the metaphorical
bus, so to speak. I don't like it when novelists sidestep the dilemmas that
they create. Trollope clearly admires the aristocratic Scroopes, but either
volitionally or unconsciously (it's hard to say which) manages to persuade his
readers that they're better off giving the upper classes a wide berth.

Trollope was not a learned or innovative thinker, like his greater contemporary
George Eliot, but in his later novels he pushed, a little, against Victorian
prudery.  His last novel, Dr. Wortle's School, which I've recently re-read,
deals with the potentially shocking question of bigamy.

I often wonder why I'm such a Trollope fan. There's so much about him to
dislike: his crude anti-feminism, his condescension to people of other colors
and to non-English nations, his obsessions with class and cash, his disgust
with Jews, his ridiculous worship of horses and hunting, etc. And yet, he tells
a great story, he loves his characters, and his dialogue is always bright and
witty.

Although he is not an author who transcends time and place, Trollope is still
the best writer to investigate of you want to learn about both the strengths and
the weaknesses of nineteenth-century England.

Title: Undergraduate Squalor
Date: October 21, 2008

An "orphan precinct" is one that lacks a regular committee and chair. We have
one nearby, and I've been recruited to walk the neighborhood and deliver GOTV
flyers to registered Dems. I'm natively shy and I hate knocking on doors, but
there are votes to be had and lordy-mercy don't we need every single one. The
neighborhood in question is near to the university, high-density, undergraduates
mostly -- 98% of the people on my lists are under 25 years old. But the squalor!
Here are these beautiful old 1910s and 1920s arts and crafts bungalows, or the
remnants of them, and they've been allowed to go to seed, or way past seed --
bricks unpointed, wood unpainted, porches sagging, screen doors ripped and
hanging off.  And then the beer cans, the cigarette butts, the newspapers that
have been decaying in their plastic sleeves for half a year. Garbage strewn
everywhere, foul odors. It's disgusting, an affront to the decent citizenry. Who
are these children?  How can they live in such cisterns of filth?

I was working myself up into quite a fit until I started to think about the
conditions in which I lived when I was in college, back there in the just-
barely-post-diluvian 1950s. I didn't drink alcohol, even then, or smoke
cigarettes, but I lived amongst as much dirt and disorder as any modern
undergraduate could manage. When I concentrate my mind, I remember the floor
of my room littered with every garment I possessed. Every sock and every shirt
grey with dirt, sweat, food droppings. I remember an ancient tattered rug that
was not swept or vacuumed a single time in two consecutive semesters. I remember
a bathtub that was so foul that it was shunned by the roaches. And am I right
(my apartment mate Otis J. Brown might be able to confirm this) that we found
two hundred empty Coke bottles strewn around Terry Cannon's room after he had
cleaned up and moved out. And also that our back stairs were littered with a
thousand dog droppings, around which we maneuvered in and out, not thinking that
such pollution was a circumstance that we might think to remedy.

Is it possible that these degenerate kids are no filthier than their venerable
grandfathers? Gives one pause. Well, who cares, really, just so long as they get
their pathetic drunken butts in gear and vote for Obama.

Incidentally, for anyone who cares: I'm now compulsively neat and cleanly.

Title: An Obsession
Date: November 01, 2008

These last few weeks, I've been reading political news obsessively.  Not
just the NYTimes and the WaPo, but the left-wing blogs as well:  Politico
and Daily Kos and HuffPo and TPM.  I follow the local political gossip on
ColoraoPols.  I check the latest polls on Pollster and 538, searching for
trends and differentials.  Worse still, I'm up in the middle of the night
almost every night:  what's the latest news from North Dakota, Montana,
Florida?  I keep up to date on senatorial and house races all over the country
especially where the red candidate is a horror or is running a particularly
loathsome campaign:  Dole, McConnell, Bachmann, Sununu, etc.  My days (and my
nights) are no longer my own.

I'm not the only one.  Many of my friends are doing the same thing.

Not without reason.  I believe that the republic is at stake.  If McCain/Palin
is elected, I fear for the century and for the country and for the planet.

On days when I do something for the Dems (knock on doors, deliver those flyers
that they presume to call "literature," fold-and-stuff) I sleep better.  But I
won't be at peace until Virginia is in the Democratic column.  Only then will I
breathe easy.  Who knows, maybe I'll be able to get through the night without
logging on to the internet to learn exactly how many points Obama is ahead in PA
according to Gallup and Rasmussen and Harstad and CBS.

I ran into my friend Mike S. a few days ago.  He had just been to the doctor
about his high blood pressure.  While he was all wired up he started chatting
with the nurse about Sarah Palin.  His blood pressure shot up 40 points.

I wonder what's going on with mine.

Title: Takacs Geezers
Date: November 04, 2008

At Grusin Music Hall last night to hear the Takacs play Beethoven and Schumann,
always a delight, and also a quartet by Bartok, which is, I'm sorry to say, even
after many exposures is still screechingly hard on my tender ears (except for
the very amusing pizzicato 4th movement).  Perhaps some day I'll "get" Bartok,
but it's been forty years of hard listening and frankly, I'm not there yet. 
I'm still hopelessly stranded in melody, harmony, and rhythm.

Meanwhile the chamber music crowd get older and older.  Anyone with the least
amount of pigment in his/her hair is young;  in fact, anyone without a wheel-
chair, a walker, an oxygen bottle, or a "minder" is young.  Grusin is the place
I take my septuagenarian self in order to feel youthful and vigorous.  I admit
that it's a strategy that doesn't have much of a future, but I'm not thinking
long term.

I think Ed and the Takacses should accommodate to their elderly audience.  For
example, when it comes time for the violin to play solo parts in the highest
register, the notes are barely audible.  It can't just be me having this
problem because half of the geezers in the auditorium have sprouted hearing
aids.  I think that Ed should make an effort to play the high notes a lot
louder.  Or possibly, plug in that near-Strad that he wields so well.  I'm
sure that there's a electronic program designed to amplify the top of the
register.

On the other hand, If the Takacs wants to attract a younger audience, there
are some changes they might make.  For one thing, it's time to give up on the
all- black tuxes.  Why must they all dress like Johnny Cash?  Sequins would
be good, or anything glittery.  And those shiny black shoes in an age when
footwear has become plastic and colorful?  What's with that?  And how about a
little chest hair (or in the case of Gerri the violist, a little bosom)? Bring
that Broncos/Buffs/Coors crowd to Grusin!! A new generation of Brahmsophiles. 
And why must they just sit there like lumps when they could move around the
stage a bit.  An occasional dance step.  Slap that cello, swing those violins
from side to side.

Lots of room for exciting innovations in the world of the classical string
quartet.

My election day was much like that of many Americans, I betcha. In the morning,
out walking the neighboring precincts, to knock on doors and rouse up the
occasional procrastinator. I was greeted for the most part by enthusiastic
thumbs-up Obama voters but also by apologetic laggards whom I forced to swear
holy oaths that they would hustle down to the polling place "right now." I
encountered one sour young woman who told me that she was so tired of being
urged to vote that she was sorry that she had voted. I was on good behavior and
did not respond that there was a lot more at stake than her convenience. Later
in the day, after the mandatory septuagenarian nap, I talked with a candidate
for county commissioner and together we made a last check of the polls. Then
to a downtown restaurant where partisans had gathered to await the results. I
was nervous as a cat when at first Virginia showed up in the red column and
I couldn't relax until Ohio came in blue. Then, moderately joyful, off to a
friend's house to watch the long parade of blue states. Lots of shouting and
applause. At last the polls closed on the California coast and the US was once
gain in the care of a person with brains, education, and values that I could
recognize. Then home to watch McCain gracefully concede and Obama accept. Broken
sleep, but this morning up early to search the archives for the flag and the
flagpole. Right now Old Glory, looking might relieved and cheerful, is flying
above all the Obama/Biden and Dem yard signs. A great lift to the world's
spirits, and to mine.

Title: Latter-Day Confederacy
Date: November 06, 2008

The Republicans have voluntarily transformed themselves into a regional and
agrarian party. If the Democrats play it as it lays, they have the opportunity
to create a permanent Democratic majority -- permanent into the foreseeable
future, that is.

McCain was the candidate of a geographical region, not of the nation. How
many votes did the Arizona Jekyll/Hyde senator win that were outside of the
old Confederacy (reminder: the Confederate States of America were, in order
of their secession, South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia,
Louisiana, Texas, Arkansas, North Carolina, Virginia and Tennessee. The "border
states" of Missouri and Kentucky did not legally secede but were allied with
the Confederacy)? These states constitute the heart of McCain's support. Of his
162 electoral votes, 113 came from the southern pocket.  he rest came from the
otherworldly Mormon states of Utah and Idaho (9 votes) and from impoverished
agrarian states, many of them suffering from declining populations, such as the
Dakotas, Nebraska, Kansas, and Montana. In the entire country, the only areas
where McCain in 2008 ran ahead of Bush in 2004 were some of the all-white rural
counties in the old confederacy and Oklahoma and an occasional retrograde county
in undeveloped western Pennsylvania and West Virginia. If anyone in America
found Palinity appealing, it was people in the poorest, least educated parts of
the continent  -- and also in the atypical Alaskan kleptocracy.

The Democrats made inroads into the new old south because northern Virginia's
Washington suburbs and the research triangle area of North Carolina have joined
the new century, and because Florida is a haven for northeastern migrants.

The Democrats are the party of the future: multicultural, educated,
international, young, high-tech, entrepreneurial, secular. The Republicans are
the part of the past:  geriatric, racist, melanin-deprived, Bible-thumping,
rural, poor, less well educated. Their day is over and gone.

The "pundints" (as McCain calls them) want Obama to govern from the middle. I
agree, except that I think that he should govern from the middle of New York,
New England, the upper middle west, and the far west -- not a middle somewhere
between Virginia and Mississippi. Obama should make an effort to educate the
denizens of the American backwater, but if it's necessary to drag them kicking
and screaming into the 21st century, then so  be it. But the United States
of America can no longer allow itself to be shackled to a mean, recalcitrant,
atavistic, pre-Darwinian southland.

It's not longer red state versus blue state. It's all blue except where it's all
white.

Title: Number 44 and Number 42
Date: November 10, 2008

I'm jubilant that, come January 20, we'll once again have a president whose
brain waves are dancing, who can bring an English sentence to completion, and
who understands that America consists of much more than the Bushian roster of
Fortune 500 executives, evangelicals, know-nothings, high school dropouts,
gay- bashers, neocon imperialists, dittoheads, gun nuts, military contractors,
upward redistributionists, fetus-worshipers and health insurance profiteers.
The new president will abandon the present system of government (trust the
market -- capitalism is always right!) and return us to the world of evidence
and reason. Quite the revolution, isn't it?  And speaking of revolutions,
the new president, if you haven't heard, is black (or to be more accurate,
black-and-white, which is this country still means, in defiance of all logic,
black). How splendid to bury a long-standing racial taboo. Nothing makes me
prouder than that we've elected an African-American, Kenyan-Kansan president.
With a brain.

The election of Barack Obama brought me back to hometown Brooklyn of sixty-one
years ago. I was eight years old on April 15, 1947, when Jackie Robinson "broke
the color barrier." It was Jackie on first or Jackie running the bases that
alerted me to the idea that I lived in a conflict-riven society. We (family,
friends, neighbors, writers for the Brooklyn Eagle) were enthusiastic about
Jackie, but there were those reactionaries and bigots in other cities who were
convinced that their world had just come to an end. No question but that the
advent of Jackie Robinson was the major formative political experience of my
early childhood -- even though it was decades before I could fully appreciate
its cosmic significance.

In my mind, and I think in the minds of others of my generation, there's a
direct line from Jack Roosevelt Robinson to Barack Hussein Obama. Two smart,
skilled performers; two ferocious but very cool competitors. Two very courageous
gentlemen.Two barriers busted all to smithereens.Two milestones in American
history. Never the latter if hadn't hadn't been for the former.

Jackie's fabulously athletic body fell apart early and he died young of
diabetes. He was born in 1918, and if he had been blessed with longevity, he
would have been ninety years old today.

Wouldn't that have been a pretty picture -- Jackie Robinson, frail, gray,
stooped, leaning on his cane, but still in possession of that marvelous knowing
glint in his coal black eyes, sitting right there on the platform in front of
the United States Capitol, a tear on his cheek while Barack Obama holds up his
hand and swears to protect and defend the constitution of the United States of
America. I see it oh so clearly in my mind's eye. It gladdens my fond old heart.

Title: Up in the Sky, Ever So High
Date: November 16, 2008

Today's essaylet is being composed thirty thousand miles above ground, somewhere
over, it appears from up here, Utah. I'm flying on Southwest Airlines, the
Trailways of the sky -- no frills, no food, no nothing. No passengers to speak
of, either. Big ol' three-quarter-empty jet plane. "Nobody's flying nowadays," a
stewardess told me. Chalk up another one for W.

Air travel was in its florid adolescence when I was a boy. Propeller-driven
planes flew over Flatbush every two minutes on their way to Idlewild (latterly
JFK). But not with me or anyone I knew on board. I can't imagine who traveled
by plane in those days -- probably only the Filthy Rich, certainly no one
from the old neighborhood. In the late 1950s, I remember hearing rumors that
there were Cornell undergraduates so wealthy that they regularly made the
journey from NYC to Ithaca in the air (while I crawled upstate on a smelly
Greyhound that left the Port Authority at midnight and made "rest stops" at East
Stroudsburg, Scranton and somewhere in the southern tier before arriving on
Aurora Street at 8 in the morning). My very first airline flight (it was on an
expense account) took place in 1960 on a 12-passenger Mohawk from Ithaca to NYC.
I was one wide- eyed gawker, let me tell you. There were very few flights for
me during the 60s but by the 70s, I was more prosperous and air travel became
semi-routine. Airlines had once been an upper-class preserve, and there was
still some leftover graciousness, especially on the long haul to Europe. Menus
and decent food and complimentary wine. But little by little, flights became
more expensive and less elegant. Is it my imagination or have they magically
shrunk the size of the seat? I recall a particularly bad run of luck when I was
routinely placed in a middle seat, surrounded on both sides by plump widestance
armrest-hogging smokers.

The extinction of the cigarette is a plus, but it's hard to think of another
improvement. Nothing to look forward to air-travel-wise but "consolidation,"
fewer flights, smaller seats, negative frills, and grubbier planes. The great
age of the airplane has gone the way of the steamship and the railroad. No more
dress up, no more glamor. Just as well, I think, or would be if the decline of
service were reflected in a decline of prices.

There's no first class on Southwest  -- although what would it matter to me?
I never once sat in a first-class seat -- not a single time. In fact, in all
honesty I must admit that I indulge a bit of class resentment that there should
be any distinction of classes. Although I wouldn't mind if someone offered
me something more gracious than one of those nasty mini-bags of over-salted
pretzels -- the kind  you have to be an experienced safe cracker to break into.

Title: My Henry James Problem
Date: November 20, 2008

I'm reading, or re-reading (what does it matter when it's been fifty years
since the last go-around) Henry James' The Wings of the Dove. Once again, I'm
variously stimulated, frustrated and infuriated. Has there ever been a writer
who cries out to be parodied more than does Hank the J? Try to resist the
impulse to make fun house mirrors of this representative, convoluted sentence.

"Her welcome, her frankness, sweetness, sadness, brightness, her disconcerting
poetry, as he made shift at moments to call it, helped as it was by the beauty
of her whole setting and by the perception at the same time, on the observer's
part, that this element gained from her, in a manner, for effect and harmony,
as much as it gave -- her whole attitude had, to his imagination, meanings that
hung about it, waiting upon her, hovering dropping and quavering forth again,
like vague faint snatches, mere ghosts of sound, of old-fashioned melancholy
music."

Let me guess that most of Dr. M.'s loyal readers did not finish reading the
quoted bit. They made a good faith attempt at the first few words, then
whistled, threw up their metaphorical hands, and surrendered. Or if they did
get all the way to the end of the sentence, they were certainly puzzled as to
whether they had fully deciphered the Jamesian code. It's not that the sentence
has no meaning, but is it worth a reader's time to parse and disentangle its
many syntactic knots? Now, dear friends, just Imagine 539 small-print pages
of prose, every paragraph on every page loaded with similar abstractions,
assertions, modifications, withdrawals, subordinations, and equivocations. It's
taxing. James takes it out of you, wears you down.

And therefore let me confess that a big chunk of my Henry James problem is that
it's so damn hard to keep the ol' eye on the ball when every sentence is so
laborious to construe. In most novels, readers are pulled along by the plot.
You might have trouble "getting into it," but once you do, your attention is
galvanized and you start to sail. In the case of HJ, there's very little plot,
very little in the way of story. It's all hyper-subtle character analysis and
teasing conversation. I can't speak for every reader, but I must admit that,
while reading Wings, my mind frequently took flight. I regularly had to forcibly
snap myself back to attention. It's anything but effortless to stay with the
Jamester.

But let me return to the exemplary sentence that I quoted above. The two key
words are "poetry' (line 1) and "meanings" (line 5).  To paraphrase: she (i.e.
James's character Millie Theale) has "poetry" and the situation has "meanings."
Underneath all the wobbly circumlocutions, that's kind of it.

But neither of these two crucial nouns gives much away. What sort of poetry
does Millie 'have,' you might ask?' What particular 'meanings' inhere in the
situation? I myself want --crave, in fact -- further definition and explication.
That's the novelist's job. If he wants to keep me happy and focused, he has to
provide considerably more specificity that HJames deigns to supply. Words such
as "poetry" and "meanings" don't constrain a reader;  rather, they are empty
vessels into which I, or any other reader, can pour a variety of significations.
The reader, i.e. me, is simply asked to do far too much of the work. I resent
it, some of the time.

Which takes me back to where I came in, in the 50s and 60s, when James was the
king of the American canon -- or at least he was very much the boss in the Large
Eastern University where I was a graduate student in literature. I don't know
how my ever-so-civilized teachers managed it, but to appreciate and understand
Henry James was framed not as a test of the author's creative skill, but as
a test of the reader's sensitivity. James, it was confidently and regularly
asserted, was subtle, delicate, loaded to the gills with the most exquisite
sensibility. Did I, a kid from Coney Island Avenue, possess the sophistication,
the tact, the sensitivity to grasp James superfine insights and his characters'
inclinations and velleities?

You know what? I didn't.I failed the test.

James portrays a world to which I could not easily relate. No one in Wings of
a Dove works for living.The characters all live off their incomes, derived who
knows how? When HJ has to bring two characters together, he has two choices and
two choices only -- a dinner party or a chance encounter at a museum. Action? 
Yes, the characters travel from one resort city to another. I'm exaggerating
just the tiniest bit. There is one character in Wings who has an occupation.
Although we never see him at work, Merton Densher is a journalist. Which is
precisely his problem. How can he be a suitable mate for Kate Croy if he has a
job? How shockingly vulgar!

It was a chore to take James seriously, especially in 1960 and especially
for someone of my background. But then, not to take James seriously, not to
understand him, was presumed to disqualify a guy from the serious study of
literature. Which turned out not to be the case.

But I'm glad to say that I persevered with Wings. If I hadn't, I never would
have re-read the infinitely splendid, magnificently tawdry piece of dialogue
between Densher and Croy that brings Book 8 to a conclusion -- a conversation
that's as well done as anything in English since WS lay down his quill in 1613.

Coming soon to these pages: my Marcel Proust problem. Hint: way worse than my
James problem.

Title: Overheard Conversation
Date: November 30, 2008

A long weekend in Santa Fe, New Mexico -- a handsome small city. I don't know
of another place in the nation in which the principal economic engine is the
making and selling of arts and crafts.  I myself am in the familiar situation:
anything I can afford, I don't want, and anything I want, I can't afford.
Besides, we're in de-accessioning mode -- a condition which doesn't prevent
us from appreciating the astonishingly high level of artistic achievement on
display here. Fortunately, there's no cost to hiking in the nearby mountains
-- we went to Bandelier National Monument to gasp at the spectacular rock
formations and marvel at the Anasazi cliff dwellings. A most enjoyable and
worthwhile expedition. The guidebook says that Santa Fe is the product of the
melding of three cultures: Native American, Hispanic, and Anglo. I guess, by
default, I must be an "Anglo." It's odd to be an Anglo, but not as disorienting
as my experience in Salt Lake City, where, as a non-Mormon, I was considered to
be a "gentile."

At breakfast in the hotel, a man at the table next to me told the following
story to his friends (I was alone at the moment, pretending to inspect the
complimentary USA Today).  "A Hindu, a Jew, and a Republican are driving in a
storm. The car breaks down, they walk to an isolated farmhouse and ask the owner
if they can stay the night. 'Sure,' he says, 'but I have only two beds. One of
you will have to sleep in the barn.' "'No problem,' says the Hindu, 'I don't
mind sleeping in the barn.'  But after a half hour, there's knock on the door,
and the Hindu says, 'There's a cow in the barn. Cows are sacred. I can't sleep
with a cow.' So the Jew says, "Don't worry. I'll sleep in the barn." But after a
half hour, there's a knock on the door, and the Jew says, 'There's a pig in the
barn. I can't sleep with a pig.' So the Republican says, 'Don't worry, I'll go
sleep in the barn.' But after a half hour, there's a knock on the door. It's the
cow and the pig."

Actual dialog, captured in the wild.

Title: It's Been a Long Time Coming
Date: December 08, 2008

I'm enchanted that our new president chose to cite -- or "sample" as they say
in the world of pop music -- one of my favorite, and one of the most important
of the songs of the 1960s. Here's the borrowed sentiment, delivered in Chicago
on November 4, just after Obama cleared the electoral hurdle: "It's been a long
time coming, but tonight, because of what we did on this day, in this election,
at this defining moment, change has come to America." The big O's citation is to
the refrain of Sam Cooke's great anthem, "A Change is Gonna Come": "It's been a
long time coming/ But I know a change gonna come, oh yes it will."

Those who know their Sam Cooke will appreciate Obama's sentence. To the Cooke-
innocent, the "change" is a new administration and new policies. To the Cooke-
knowledgeable, the "change" to which Obama refers is a tectonic shift in
American racial politics.

So I'm reproducing Sam Cooke's lyric right here.  If you're one of my coevals,
you probably know the song by heart. If you don't know it, you should. If you're
curious, you can see and hear Sam and Otis Redding and a host of others sing the
song on You Tube. Here's the lyric.  It's one great, inspiring song.

"I was born by the river in a little tent

And just like the river I've been running ever since.

It's been a long time coming.

But I know a change is gonna come.

It's been too hard living, and I'm afraid to die.

I don't know what's up there, beyond the sky.

(refrain)

I go to the movie and I go downtown

Somebody keep telling me, don't hang around.

(refrain)

I go to my brother, I say help me please,

But he winds up knocking me down on my bended knees.

(refrain)

There's been times that I thought I couldn't last long,

But now I think I'm able to carry on.

It's been a long time coming,

But I know a change is gonna come, o yes it will."

Talk about the ability to say a lot in a little.  O yeah!

Title: More on Sam Cooke
Date: December 08, 2008

Sam Cooke's "A Change is Gonna Come" condenses centuries of tangled racial
strife into a brief lyric. The song begins in rural, impoverished, perhaps
southern, America: "I was born by the river, in a little tent."  Then, with
a glance at the old man river who just keeps rolling, it alludes to African-
Americans as on-the-lam outsiders: "Just like the river, I've been running
ever since."  The third stanza, now shifted to an urban location, refers
specifically to the insult of segregation (shortly before writing the song,
Cooke had been barred from a Shreveport hotel): "I go to the movies and I go
downtown;/ Somebody keep telling me, don't hang around." The second stanza
is surprisingly confessional for a man who had started his career in gospel
and had sung lead for the Soul Stirrers;  it's about loss of faith. "I don't
know what's up there, beyond the sky." Nevertheless, despite all the reasons
for losing heart, including the lack of support from brothers of different
political factions, Sam retains an uncompromisIng optimism: he will "carry on,
yes I will." The song is a miniature allegory of a triumph over separation and
persecution. It celebrates endurance, perseverance, fortitude in the face of
long odds.No wonder that Barack Obama adapted Cooke's affirmative "Yes I will"
into "Yes we can."

Sam Cooke himself didn't get to the promised land; he was shot, under
"mysterious circumstances" in December of 1964. "A Change is Gonna Come" was
released posthumously.

Title: "I Dream of Georgie with a Whole Lot of Shoes."
Date: December 15, 2008

Just before pulling the blankets over me, I watched (via You Tube) the Iraqi
journalist wing not one but both his shoes at the Duck Most Lame. Not much of an
arm, I thought, but a symbolic act of courage nevertheless. A few hours later,
waking from troubled sleep, I realized that my dreamatorium had been working
overtime. I had imagined a White House press conference where at a signal all
the correspondents, led by Helen Thomas herself, unzip, untie, unvelcro and hurl
whatever was on their feet at the Great Incompetent. He weaves and bobs, takes
one on the shoulder.  Everyone is on board but Fox, whose "correspondents" lace
up even tighter. Next  thing you know, regular citizens start packaging pairs
of old shoes and mailing them to "W, The White House, 1600 Pennsylvania." Huge
mounds of shoes fill a nearby warehouse; the secret service refuses to estimate
the total but reporters guess fifty cubic yards. Someone creates a Facebook
application "One Million Strong to Hurl Shoes at George W."  Everyone visiting
El Lamo is now asked to remove shoes before meeting with him; but then, what
do you know, people start throwing their smelly socks. I dreamed of political
buttons: "I'm Shoeless for George." And songs: "I Threw A Shoe at You Know
Who."  A website springs into existence: send ten dollars from anywhere in the
world and we'll leave a pair of old shoes at the front gate of the White House.
It's a democratic movement: all shoes are equal. Sneakers, loafers, Blahniks,
boots, moccasins, babouches, buskins, pattens, galoshes, scarpines, clogs, air
georges. A protest movement with real soul.

Title: Carrots, etc.
Date: December 18, 2008

I've experimented a bit in with flowers but in my choice of vegetables I've been
quite conservative. My garden has always relied upon the standards: black-seeded
Simpson lettuce, Detroit red beets, Danvers carrots, Waltham 29 broccoli.
But now I've decided to take a walk on the wild side  In today's mail came
my brand- new heirloom and rare seed catalog. (Is there anything that more
brightens a cold December morn than the colorful garden catalog that arrives
in the mailbox at winter solstice?)  Consider the lowly carrot, for example.
Here are some of the possible choices for next year's adventure garden: the
12" long red-orange St. Valery, dating from the 19th century; Lunar Whites --
"white carrots were grown during the Middle Ages but now rare";  Cosmic Purple
-- a dark variety, loaded with lycopene; Parisienne -- "small round carrots
popular in France"; Chantenay Red Core -- "a large stump-rooted carrot with a
deep red-orange center" dating from 1929; the "mild and sweet" Shin Kuroda,
a Japanese variety. And twenty other equally entrancing varieties. How to
choose?  I have room for twenty feet of carrots. Just enough for one variety,
or possibly, if I push it, two.

What about tomatoes, the king of all summer vegetables, but an uncontrollable
plant that turns itself into a jungle come August. Nine pages of varieties --
greens, yellows, pinks, reds, purples in various sizes from cherry to plum to
2-pounders; some of them mottled, others striped, round, cylindrical, and every
one of  them claiming to offer old-fashioned sweet/acid tomato taste. How many
can I possibly plant?  However few, I know I'll be imploring my friends take
some, please, with you when you leave. Old Vermont saying:  "always keep your
car locked in August, otherwise someone will open your door and throw in a bunch
of zucchinis." Or tomatoes.Which brings me to the nine pages of exciting squash,
including the Hopi Cushaw and the Pink Banana and the... well, you can see my
dilemma.

Title: My New Career - III
Date: December 21, 2008

This blague's enthusiastic readers are well aware that each year for the
last two, Dr. M. has made himself available for the NBA draft, but that not
a single team has selected him, even the lowly, strife-ridden Knicks. It's
incomprehensible, but true. Why are these GMs so unadventurous?

As a consequence of being overlooked, I'm developing an entirely new marketing
strategy this year. I'm no longer going to sit at home waiting for the telephone
to ring. Heck, no!  I'm going to advertise my skills by competing in the
dunking contest.

I've developed three imaginative new dunks, any one of which could carry the
day and get me the attention I require.

The first is a variation of "making change." I drive to the basket, leap into
the air with a basketball in my left hand. With the right hand,  I leave
a quarter on the top of the backboard and take down the dime that's been
previously placed there.With the left hand, I gracefully drop the ball through
the net.

My second dunk. I have a ball in each hand and put another one under my shirt.
I spring, dunk both basketballs authoritatively and successively, then grab the
third one and throw it high into the air. I land right under the backboard, and
then, without pause, immediately spring into the air again and power that third
one through just as it comes down into the cylinder.

I've perfected these two moves, which, I can say without bragging, are far more
interesting than anything I saw in the contest last year. To be absolutely
honest, so far I've only done them with six-foot rim and with those mini-
basketballs that they sometime distribute free during the second half timeouts.
Not to worry -- I'm working on it every day and in a couple of weeks I'll be
ready for the standard rim and full-sized basketball. There's still plenty of
time before All-Star Weekend.

My third dunk is even more extraordinary. I start at the far basket and do a
series of back handsprings and back flips across the floor. Then, as I approach
the target basket, I pick up a basketball between my ankles, and with one final
back flip -- in which my feet are actually above the level of the rim -- I slam
that sucker home. It's going to be something spectacular to watch, I guarantee,
just a soon as I work out a few kinks in the execution.

Title: Nightmare Made Worse by Critique
Date: December 27, 2008

Last night -- another horrible dream. I was riding in the passenger car of an
old-fashioned railroad and there was this big puffy guy, a smaller version of
Oliver Hardy, who was brandishing a pistol. He was about to take hostages and
shoot us folks. I grabbed his gun arm and wrestled him to the floor, but he was
mighty strong. I called out to the other passengers, "Help me!"  Eventually, a
couple of people came to my aid and started to twist his arm. Then I yelled out,
"Hit him!" and a couple of people started to bang his head with books. Heavy
books. Then I shouted "Kick him!" and a crowd gathered and started in with their
feet. After a while, I realized that the gangster/terrorist/kidnapper was dead,
but I continued to punch to and kick him. I woke up with my heart beating 180 or
so.

It took a while to regain my equanimity, but it wasn't long before I returned to
sleep. I dreamed that I was reporting the dream to my daughter and son-in-law
and that they were totally uninterested and bored by my story. Which I took to
be a critique of my ability with narrative.

So if I tell any more dreams, I'll abbreviate (as I did above, where I left out
all sorts of interesting details) for fear of alienating my audience.

Title: Can You Believe It?
Date: December 29, 2008

And now a brief quiz for Metablogian readers who are familiar
with nineteenth- century fiction. I will describe the situation and quote a
short excerpt, and you will be required to identify the novelist. Ready? 
Let's go. Here's the story: a clergyman considers whether to commit a
murder.  Although he takes no concrete action, he's overcome with guilt about
what might have been. Here's a sample of his extensive, tortured musings.

He struggled to drive from his mind and from his eyes the phantom of the
terrible deed but that he did not succeed was made evident to himself by the hot
clammy drops of sweat which came out upon his brow, by his wakefulness through
the livelong night, by the care with which his ears watched for the sound of
the young man's coming as though it were necessary that he should be assured
that the murder had in truth not been done.  Before that hour had come he found
himself to be shaking even in his bed; to be drawing the clothes around him to
dispel the icy cold, though the sweat did still stand upon his brow;  to be
hiding his eyes under the bedclothes in order that he might not see something
which seemed to be visible to him through the utmost darkness of the chamber.
Why then, could he not sleep?  Why should he be hot and shiver with cold by
turns? Why should horrid phantoms perplex him in the dark?

And the correct answer is?  Obviously, it's Russian anguish, the novelist is
Fyodor Doestoevsky and the passage is from Crime and Punishment.

Except that it's not. Surprise. It's Anthony Trollope, master of manners,
anthropologist of English civilization. The character who is described is not
Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov, but Thomas Greenwood, D. D.; the novel is Marion
Fay and the year is 1882. (Crime and Punishment appeared in Russian in 1866,
in English in 1914).

In Dostoevsky's novel, Raskolnikov does the deed right at the outset. There's
no murder at all in Marion Fay. As is common in Trollope's last novels, there's
a flirtation with boundary-breaking (bigamy in Dr. Wortle's School, premarital
sex in An Eye for an Eye, interclass marriage in this particular novel), but
there's also a withdrawal or hesitation.

Marion Fay would have been quite something if Trollope hadn't lost his nerve
and had let Greenwood pull the trigger.

It would have been an even stronger piece of fiction if Lord Hampstead had
actually married the low-born tubercular Quaker lass and if Hampstead's sister
Frances had married the Post Office clerk George Roden before, not after, it was
discovered that he was an Italian Duke by birth. But Trollope drew back from
the dilemmas he created, alas and alack, and as a result there is no  English
parallel to Dostoevsky's radicalism. More's the pity.

Title: Etymology of the Word "Steerage"
Date: January 06, 2009

The origin of "steerage," a word used to describe the part of the vessel
allotted to the poorest of passengers is not fully established. Some say that
"steerage" originally referred to the section nearest the rudder, but for this
theory I can find no confirmation. As far as I know, steerage passengers were as
likely to be housed fore as aft. Another guess is that the cables that ran from
the steering wheel to the rudder passed through this level of the ship. It's
also been ventured that emigrants were located on the same deck that was used
for transporting steers. This suggestion seems inherently unlikely, although it
is certainly true that in pre-refrigeration days, large numbers of livestock
were carried on ships in order to maintain a supply of fresh milk, eggs, and
meat.  Is it possible that the "-age" in "steerage" is used as in "storage" or
baggage?" "Steerage" seems to be unique to English. Other European languages
simply say "between decks"; so German "zwischendeck," Spanish "entrepuente,"
Swedish "mellandaeck," Norwegian "mellomdeck," French "entrepont," etc. Until
the nineteenth century, "steerage" simply meant "steering," as in Romeo's
picturesque "But he that hath the steerage of my course,/ Direct my sail."

Title: Extrapolation
Date: January 11, 2009

When you consider an adult whom you've known from infancy, you're tempted to
think that their traits at maturity were evident from birth. You saw it in them.
Shyness or assertiveness or enterprise or doggedness or volubility or curiosity
-- all there right at the starting gate. "It stands to reason that she would
have entered the field of medicine -- she was always so compassionate." I'm
never convinced when people say such things. I think that it's easy to make
retrospective claims. If a child is interested in fifty things, we look back and
only remember the ones that "foretold" -- so to speak -- her mature interests.
We forget about the traits that didn't develop or which metamorphosized.

As simple as it is to claim that the mature being is a predictable exfoliation
of childhood traits, just so difficult is it to make actual predictions. In my
experience it's almost impossible to look at a two-year-old or a five-year-old
or even a sixteen-year-old and extrapolate to the adult. In fact, it's far
easier to misjudge a child than to get him or her right. No matter how well you
might think you know them, children are hard to read.

These thoughts are prompted by reading Nicholas Murray's skillful new Life of
Matthew Arnold. The poet's father, the famous education reformer 'Arnold of
Rugby,' a man who should have known better, was absolutely wrong about his son.
According to Thomas Arnold, Matt was 'not likely to form intimate friendships;"
"He flitters about from flower to flower but is not apt to fix."  "I do not see
how the sources of deep thought are to be reached in him." " He  does not know
what it is to work because he knows so little what to think."  The best he can
say: "I think he is not so idle as he was."

Idle! and shallow!  Has there ever a been a more colossal misjudgment of a son
by a father? Or did Matthew Arnold live the most of his life with a giant "I'll
show him" chip on his shoulder?

Come to think of it, I'm rather glad that I don't know what judgments or
predictions my father or other adults might have made about me.

Title: "Actively Dying"
Date: January 15, 2009

Grandma is 96+ years old.  She's an accomplished, strong-willed, tough old
lady who has survived just about everything life can throw at a person: polio
in childhood, over two dozen major surgeries, diabetes, and then two times in
the last decade, cancer. Now she's very close to the end.  She has been in
a nursing home for four years, declining almost imperceptibly from day to
day. Until last week, she could carry on a conversation of sorts. But then
something happened. She lost the ability to move, even a little; she became
agitated, her long-term memory collapsed, and she could not, however hard she
tried, complete a thought (though she was able to say, and repeat, "This
dying business doesn't bother me").  She recognized only one person, her
eldest daughter, and it was not clear that she knew her own name.

For the last six months someone at the nursing home has had to help her with
fork and spoon. Last week, we decided that to prop her up, sit her at the table,
feed her cake and then propose that her insulin intake be increased was
a senseless, bizarre procedure.  A compassionate doctor suggested that it
was time for insulin and other non-palliative medicines to be withdrawn. We
readily agreed. We confronted the head nurse at the nursing home; she announced
to us that the home's chief of medicine would reverse the order to withdraw
insulin;  Grandma must be fed ("We're a nursing home," she said, "we nurse").
Last Friday, we moved Grandma from the nursing home to our local hospice. 
Grandma immediately stopped eating and drinking. I would like to think that she
chose to give up food, but there's no way to know. Her eyes have a glazed,
far away look on the rare occasions that she is strong enough to open them. She
fumbles with the sheets.

Nevertheless, on Monday, hospice told us that they couldn't keep her. She's not
"actively dying" -- according to the official Medicare rules -- and is therefore
not eligible for hospice. Where to take her?  Unclear.  We negotiated a
two-week reprieve. Grandma will be allowed to remain in hospice as a private
patient for fourteen days, but unless she starts "actively dying" during that
period, she'll be expelled. We cried.

Yesterday, however, we were told that Grandma had taken a step forward.  She's
"entered her process" --another bit of hospicespeak.  She's experiencing,
we're told, sufficient pain to warrant morphine and her heartbeat has
become rapid and irregular.  She is "less responsive."  Good news for
Grandma, I guess.  Unless she "plateaus" and stops "actively dying," she'll be
allowed to stay to the finish, which, if there's any mercy, will not be very
long.

Here's what Kent says about Lear, at the end.  "O let him pass.  He hates him/
Who would upon the rack of this tough world,/  Stretch him out longer."

January 17.  Grandma died last night, having squeezed the last drop out of life
and sliced through the last shred of bureaucratic red tape.

A.  "Tattoos Get You Sex."  A forthright, undisguised sentiment.  Here we
have an enormous advertising establishment working indefatigibly to imply
that the car, the beer, the perfume, the toothpaste, the sneakers will get
you laid.  But do they ever come out and say so directly?  No.  It's
all implication and suggestion (except for the commercials for Viagra/Cialis
-- a special case).  But here's a bumper sticker that lays it on the line. 
No sly metaphors or beating around the bush.  But is it true that there's an
alignment between sex and tattoos?  Where's the double-blind evidence?  I'll
wait until I see the utterly unbiased report from the National Association of
Tattoo Artists.

B    "Ann Coulter is a Man."  This one puzzled me a bit because it didn't
say whether Ann was born a man or had recently been surgically tranformed
into one.  In any case, I'm not all skeptical about the accuracy of the
assertion.  What else could account for the fact that Ann (or Andrew, let us
now call him/her) acts and speaks like an ignorant, show-offy, foul-mouthed,
testosterone-fueled teen-age boy?

My evaluation:  A is false in most cases;  B is certainly true.

hiking boots instead of spikes.  Eventually, I retrieved the ball and tried to

Source: 2009/02/academic-reminiscence

Title: A Pitiful Reminiscence of Academia
Date: February 01, 2009

In an earlier life, Dr. M. served as chair of a large academic department
at a state university out here in the American west.  On the whole, the
teachers that Dr. M. nominally supervised did their work very well.  They
were responsible, self-motivated, liked their teaching and reading and
writing, and fortunately, did not expect to be lavishly rewarded either in
salary or appreciation or assistance.  But there were a few employees who were
difficult.  There always are.  Ten per cent of the people take 90% of your
time, no matter what the enterprise.

We had very little secretarial staff -- not even enough people to take and
relay telephone messages, So (this was before the advent of sophisticated
electronic communication), innovative chair that I was, I took some scarce
departmental funds and purchased inexpensive, tape-driven answering machines
and attached one to each professorial telephone.  The theory was simple: 
most of the faculty weren't in their office many hours a week (nor were they
paid to be), but the new technology would allow them to come to work, listen
to yesterday's telephone calls, and return messages rapidly and efficiently. 
Ninety-five per cent of the faculty was happy with the new system.  But a
few of them rebelled.  One particularly recalictrant member of the faculty
-- let us call him RR -- categorically refused to touch his new machine. 
His reasoning:  pushing the button and playing back the tape was not a
"professorial responsibilty";  it was mere secretarial work, and in his view 
the new system asked that a professor lower himself to the level of staff. 
It would be "unprofessional" for him to listen to recorded telephone call,
asserted RR..

I should mention that RR was the least distinguished member of our faculty. 
He was a poor teacher and his contributions to scholarship lay somewhere between
non-existent and negligible, depending on the decade.  You might think that his
sense of nobility derived from a ducal or regal grandfather, but not so --he
came from a working-class Kansas background, if I remember correctly.

"Professional" is a word about which I have ambivalent feelings. In its best
incarnation, when it denotes adherence to an internalized set of responsible
and shared values, it's a damn good word and an uplifting concept. But there
are many occasions when "professional" is used to camouflage willfulness,
laziness, and privilege, and then it is a word of which I am ashamed.  I
take the case of RR to be an example of "professional" used in order to
justify indolence.  For the rest of my faculty, it was "professional" to make
ourselves available to the students whom they state paid us to educate and
assist; not for RR.

I think that RR had a peculiar, retrogressive understanding of university
life.  He didn't like students or scholarship, but he did enjoy ceremony.  He
was the parliamentarian at meetings of the university's governing board.  And
every year, at commencement, he was the person who led the procession, bearing
the university's mace (or whatever the heck that strange object was).  Not a
born teacher, he was a born presider at rituals.  A large, ponderous fellow,
he was a terrific mace-bearer -- and a truly crappy colleague.

I never did find a way to make him use his answering machine.  If I owned
the company, I would have fired him in a flash.  But the university likes
to separate responsibility from authority, so all I could do was cajole
and beseech and shame -- a procedure that proved in his case to be totally
without effect.  You can't shame the shameless.

Title: What the Heck is an Elfskin?
Date: February 05, 2009

In one modern edition of Shakespeare's The First Part of King Henry the Fourth,
Falstaff, in a fit of exuberant swearing, describes Hal as an "eel-skin." 
But in another edition, the word is "elfskin."  What's going on?  Only one of
these curious words can be "correct."

Paunchy Falstaff attacks Prince Hal with a string of half-comic, half-offensive
epithets:  "you starveling, you elfskin (or eel-skin), you dried neat's tongue,
you bulls-pizzle, you stockfish...."  A "starveling" is a person emaciated
by hunger, "stockfish" is desiccated cod, and a "bull's pizzle," which an
Elizabethan might dry to use as a whip, is self-explanatory.  But "elfskin"
or "eelskin?"  "Elfskin" is the original reading, although in actual fact the
earliest quarto prints not "elfskin" but "elsskin" where the first "s" is
the old-fashioned "long s."  "Elsskin" was as incomprehensible then as now
and someone who participated in the making of the 1623 Folio changed the word
to "elfskin" on the grounds, it is easy to imagine, that the first of the two
long s's properly signified an "f."  If "elfskin" is a word, then it's a
Shakespearean coinage -- the word being otherwise unknown and the skin of elves
not a subject of speculation even in an era that took such imaginary beings
more seriously than does ours. Is it possible that, considering the context,
"elfskin" could carry the meaning "as thin as fairy skin" -- even though elves
were generally described as small and stunted rather than diaphonous?

The alternative, "eel-skin" is the inspiration of Sir Thomas Hanmer, whose
edition of Shakespeare's works appeared in 1744.  "Eel-skin" jibes with
"stockfish" and "neat's tongue" as an example of Falstaff's fixation on edibles,
although it was the eel itself rather than its skin that was the delicacy.  As
Hanmer well knew, Shakespeare had used the word "eel-skin" in a not dissimilar
context in King John, when Philip the Bastard described his feeble half-
brother's skinny arms as "two eel-skins stuffed."

"Elfskin" is therefore the earlier reading, closer by 150 years to William S.
himself, but "eel-skin," though it dates only to the mid-eighteenth century, is
much more colorful and apposite. It's therefore entirely possible that Hanmer
restored Shakespeare's original intention.  Possible, but not proven.

Title: Sursum Corda;  Brain Surgery
Date: February 08, 2009

Last night I awoke from troubled sleep with a mysterious and
inexplicable Latin phrase drumming on my agitated brain. As best I can
remember the dream, I had taken a razor to an essay I was writing and had
cut out the two words--and I mean "cut out" as in scissored, not merely
deleted--"sursum corda."  And then there I was with a slip of paper on
which the two words were inscribed -- andnow comes the nightmare part--I
couldn't translate the damn phrase. I went so far (still in the dream!)
as to hypothesize a past participle "*sursus" of the verb "surgere" (to
rise)--although, as everyone knows, the proper form would be "surrectus"--but
I still couldn't parse the phrase (*"sursum" or "risen", would be a singular,
"corda," "hearts," a plural). I forced myself out of sleep, distressed that
I couldn't make sense out of what my dreamatorium was screaming was an
important phrase. So there I was in the middle of the night, checking the
Latin dictionary to discover that "sursum corda" is a versicle in the Roman
mass generally translated "lift up your hearts," but, inasmuch as "sursum,"
I can now attest, is not a participle but an adverb, might more properly come
into English as something like "upward your hearts." OK, now I understand
the phrase, but why in the living bejeesus was I a) dreaming in Latin, b)
dreaming a part of a mass, and c) slicing the phrase out of some papers of my
own composition?

Enough of that. Back to bed, back to sleep and then, holy moly, another weird
dream. No more Latin, at least, but now I'm being held responsible for the low
rate of pollination of apple trees. Whose apple trees?  I can't say.  And
what is the remedy. Brain surgery -- and on my brain. The surgeon announces
to me (somehow we're in a very official looking operating room) that "we're
going to remove the smallest bone in the human body, which is in the hinge to
the top of your head."He takes his scalpel, cuts through my hinge, and flips
opens my skull. Inside the dome (somehow I can observe the interior) right
where my brain should be, is a heap of glowing stuff that looks like orange
Jell-o.

OK, that's enough. Time to wake up once again.

Unanswered questions. a) why am I responsible for the fruiting of apples? 
Blame the lazy bees, for goodness sake. b) Who says the smallest bone in the
body is this imaginary hinge?  The smallest bone is in the inner ear--the
stirpes, I think. c)  what's with the Jell-o? Just because I couldn't translate
"sursum corda," must it therefore follow that my brain is gelatinous?  Some
of your most intelligent Wall Street investors and bank presidents couldn't
translate sursum corda, and they must be the most accomplished people we have,
at least to judge by their annual bonuses.

On the whole, I think that both of these dreams put me in somewhat of a
bad light. Nevertheless, I'm impressed that my unconscious is so gosh-darned
creative. Let's face it - it's a ton more imaginative than my daytime self,
which doesn't much concern itself with either the Latin mass or the pollination
rates of mali domesticae.

Title: Oscar Wilde's Siblings
Date: February 11, 2009

According to Richard Ellman, whose 680-page extremely- detailed Oscar Wilde
(1988) I've now read and enjoyed, Oscar Fingal O'Flahertie Wills Wilde
came out of more colorful family situation than is generally known. 
Oscar's father, the famous eye surgeon Sir William Wilde, brought three
children to his marriage with Jane Elgee -- apparently by three different
mothers, none of whom he bothered to marry.  The first child, a boy named
Henry Wilson, was supported by his father and eventually became a partner
in his medical practice.  The girls, Emily and Mary, born two years apart,
were adopted by Sir William's older brother "as his wards" and were also
acknowledged to be part of Oscar's family.  Emily and Mary were not so
fortunate as their older half-brother. "In the course of showing off their
ball dresses before a party, one went too close to an open fire, caught her
crinoline in the flames, and was terribly burned.  So was her sister, who
tried frantically to rescue her.  Their gravestone records that they both
died on the same day, 10 November, 1871. Sir Williams's grief was intense,
and his groans could be heard outside the house."  The girls were twenty-four
and twenty-two years old.  Oscar, born in 1854. was just seventeen at their
deaths.  Although he wrote voluminously about his own life, Oscar nowhere
records this horrific event. But was he affected? Certainly the knowledge that
his father lived a second, darker life seems to have made a contribution to
the plot of Dorian Gray -- a novel in which Dorian is in love with a woman
of questionable birth.  Matters of legitimacy are raised in two of Wilde's
best known plays.  Nevertheless, it seems extraordinary that the tragic deaths
of two half-sisters should have left no mark either on Wilde's public or private
personality. It might be argued that Wilde's lifelong aim was self-destruction
and that his sister's deaths served as a template for his own tragedy -- but
such an argument would be weak in evidentiary support.  The sisters and the
fire is a terrible tale that may signifiy nothing beyond its own horror.

Title: Life Lessons from F. P Schubert
Date: February 15, 2009

Our local chamber players, the Takacs, performed the Schubert Quintet (D.956).
It's a glorious work -- one of the finest in the entire chamber repertoire --
and was brilliantly performed.  It's a turbulent, nervous, tense piece of
music. With the last notes, the entire audience rose simultaneously to cheer. 
There were fist-pumpings, whistles, "bravos," "yesses," and other spontaneous
shouts of pleasure from the octogenarian listeners.  It was a rock and roll
moment at Grusin Hall.

I cheered too, but not so much for the Takacs as for Schubert.  It's so often
the case that the interpreters are rewarded while the creator is neglected. 
Here's Schubert, dead of poverty and syphilis and mercury poisoning at age
31, never having made a nickel out of his many compositions.  In desperate
straits, with only two months to live, Schubert sent his new quintet to the
Leipzig publisher H. A. Probst. Probst rejected it, asking instead for something
"easily understandable."  The world "does not yet sufficiently and generally
understand the peculiar, often ingenious, but perhaps now and then somewhat
curious precedures of your mind's creations."  The quintet was first performed
in 1850, twenty-two years after Schubert breathed his last.

Is there a moral?  Yes, I think there is.  If you're in the composing or
painting or novel-writing business, do it your own way -- not the easy way.  If
you lose, you lose.  So what?  If you win, you win big.

Title: Another Crack at Moby Dick
Date: February 16, 2009

I read this great so-called classic of American literature once in the '50s and
twice in the '60s and I just didn't get it.  I've now re-read it and, after
forty-something years of seasoning and experience, I'm still a dissenter. Moby
Dick is like opera or ballet -- it's so highly stylized that either you buy into
it or you don't, and I don't. To me, Melville is a quite ordinary GrubStreet
quill-driver whose every sentence screams at the very top of its lungs, "Look
at me, I'm Shakespearean."  I resent Melville's attempt to draft using WS as
puller. Ultimately, there's a deep  incompatibility of sensibility between
me and HM.  I'm not a big Romantic guy. Baring the soul isn't enough to
keep me happy, certainly not  for the length of so elongated and dense a
novel. Perhaps for a brief lyric.  I like stories.  Moby Dick must have the
thinnest plot in the history of 800-page novels. Man hunts whale, man finds
whale, and (last ten pages) whale wins.  Charles Reade's formula for the
long nineteenth-century novel was "Make them laugh, make them cry, make them
wait."  Melville neglects the first two of these maxims.  There's nothing
either amusing or pathetic about Moby Dick but I'm here to tell you that
Melville totally mastered the "make them wait" part.  Totally.

You're lucky to be alive.'  I'd go in with a sore throat.  He'd say, 'Can you

Title: What We Should Have Read in the Fifties:  Two Years Before the Mast
Date: February 23, 2009

It's been a long time since I enjoyed a book as much as Richard Henry Dana's Two
Years Before the Mast, which describes events of 1834-36 and was first published
in 1840. It's a great piece of writing. I've heard about it since I was a
child, but just got around to reading it this week. It's a book that alters my
understanding of the early nineteenth century.

Why did I like it so much.  Let me count the ways.

1.  It's a sensitive work. Dana's a Boston patrician but instead of going to sea as a junior officer, which he could easily have done, he enlists as a common seaman. He describes life on board the ship from the seaman's point of view. I don't know another book that's so honest, so real, and so uncomplaining. Dana later put what he learned to work, becoming an advocate for sailors' rights. His is not a modern sensibility, but on the whole there's far less of the deplorable racist and sexist assumptions that disfigure the earlier literature and make us cringe for our ancestors.

2. I've always loved sea stories. Wasn't I transfixed, as a child, by the Bounty and Hornblower stories?  But Dana is leagues ahead. Two Years  is non-fiction that is more compelling reading than most fiction. I couldn't put it down. Besides, I had just read Moby-Dick, a thoroughly romanticized version of life on sea. Melville is poetic; Dana is gritty and detailed. I'm sorry, but I'm almost always happier in the world of the enlightenment than the world of nineteenth-century romanticism.  Something in the mitochondria, perhaps.

3.  A large hunk of the book takes place in California, when it was still part of Mexico and there was a shack or two where there's now Santa Barbara or San Diego or Monterey.  It's an invaluable record of California before the gold rush, both picturesque and enlightening

4.  It has great characters:  ship captains both competent and cruel, sailors brave and cowardly, as well as the occasional onboard eccentric.  A good account of naval camaraderie.

5.  Language. Some of us enjoy specialized vocabulary of any sort.  This book is a treasure trove of words unfamiliar to a landlubber like me.  "It was clew up and haul down, reef and furl, until we had got her down to close-reefed topsails, double-reefed trysail, and reefed forepenser."  "I threw the downhaul over the windlass, and jumped between the knight-heads out upon the bowsprit.  The crew stood abaft the windlass and hauled the jib down, while we got out upon the weather-side of the jib-boom... the great jib boom flying out to leeward and slatting." "The cook made us a mess of scouse." "Dessert was duff." Sometimes Dana lays it on a bit thick, but it's worth it.  What is a martingale anyway?   Well, "it comprises the parts of the standing rigging which strengthen the bowsprit and jib boom against the force of the head stays"  Clears that up.  Who's up for a great big helping of scouse?

Title: The Big Seven-Oh
Date: March 13, 2009

In the course of the Great Downsizing, a long-buried letter emerged from the
"archives."  It's from my long-gone father, and was written in December of 1974
on the occasion of his seventieth birthday.  A most fortuitous discovery --
inasmuch as I am now exactly the age that Pop was on the day that he wrote to
me.  In his letter, Pop reports that he is taken aback by the person whom he
has become.  Who is this guy with the gray hair and the "little paunch" who
"takes a day or two to recover from any physical activity" and who "finds events
repeating themselves."

"In my mind," he says, "there is another me, a real me," who looks upon this
present self as a "stranger and an interloper."

It appears as though my father's self-image was lagging behind the reality of
things

I hadn't remembered reading the letter -- it sat in a box for thirty-five
years -- but I'm not surprised by its content.  My father was a strong,
athletic, handsome man who didn't easily accept the inevitable changes that
come with septuagenarianism.  I vividly remembering him saying, at eighty, "I
hate my body."

I'm with him, but only a part of the way. Of course I'm dismayed by the
decline. The gray hair, the thickened figure, yes.  The deterioration
of memory, certainly.  But I don't share Pop's sense that my real or
better self is somewhere in the past. True that I can't jump as high -- yet,
paradoxically, I feel more like myself, more comfortable being me now
than ever before.  I'm also more cheerful, on the whole -- although not at
nighttime, when i sleep just as badly as ever my father did). When I look in
the mirror, I don't see a face ravaged by age -- I see a face that now looks
like it was always destined to look and finally got there.  I have become more
like myself, so to speak, every year. But how long until the me-ness starts
to plummet? It must happen eventually. Time will tell.

My father used to say, "You're entitled to your biblical three score and
ten.  But after seventy, you're in extra innings."  o which I would respond,
"In some sports, extra innings is known as sudden death."

But hey, let's not forget that the extra innings are frequently the most
exciting part of the game.

Title: A Merchant Mystery
Date: March 24, 2009

In the middle of The Merchant of Venice, right out of the blue, without warning,
the audience is suddenly told that Launcelot the clown has gotten a "Negro"
pregnant. Who is this 'Negro'? Why haven't we heard of her before?  Why does
Shakespeare introduce her into his play?  And why, having invented her, does
he precipitously drop her? A loose end, to be sure.

The pregnancy seems to be unplanned, both by the characters and the author. It
occurs at the point in the play when Shylock's runaway daughter Jessica, newly
married and newly converted to Christianity, engages her bridegroom Lorenzo
and their clown/servant Launcelot in a bit of superficial banter. Launcelot
puts forward the barren jest that Lorenzo is "no good member of the
commonwealth," for "in converting Jews to Christianity, [he] raises the price
of pork." Lorenzo veers from the context to reply sharply. "I shall answer
that better to the commonwealth that you can the getting up of the Negro's
belly. The Moor is with child by you, Launcelot."  Up until this very moment,
there had been no mention of a "Moor" or "Negro" (north Africans and sub-Saharan
Africans were not always distinguished in the Elizabethan imagination). It's
a sensational, unanticipated accusation and one that Launcelot does not
deny. Instead, he attempts to deflect Lorenzo's indignation with clownish
wordplay. The subject is abandoned as precipitously as it was raised and the
pregnant Moor vanishes from the play.  Neither Launcelot nor any other
character has alluded to a "Negro" before, nor had there even been the
slightest hint that Launcelot has been wooing a lady  A perplexed editor simply
shrugs his shoulders: "This passage has not been explained."

But where there is no explanation, there is room for conjecture.

The fleeting and mysterious black woman reminds us that The Merchant
of Venice explores questions of exogamy. Jewish Jessica elopes with
Christian Lorenzo, while the heiress Portia, a native Venetian, is pursued
unsuccessfully by Morocco, a "tawny Moor." When Morocco fails the test that
might have won him Portia for his bride, Portia expresses pleasure in words
that were acceptable then but are unpleasant now: "Let all of his complexion
(i.e. race) choose me so." So it would seem that one possible explanation for
Launcelot's insemination of the Moor is that Shakespeare started a hare that he
didn't bother to pursue; he was sufficiently intrigued by interracial sexual
doings to provide Launcelot with a non-white lover, supplementing comedy with
farce -- but he lacked either the inclination or the space to develop the
relationship more fully. (The fertile subject of love between the races was one
that Shakespeare had previously engaged in Titus Andronicus -- in which Aaron
the Moor fathers a child upon Tamora, the queen of the Goths -- and would become
the tragic motif of Othello.

There's a second possible explanation for the presence of the pregnant Moor. 
It's known that as originally perormed, the part of the clown Launcelot was
played by the much celebrated comedian Will Kemp, whose part Shakespeare might
have wanted to sweeten.  Who now can imagine with what facial expressions or
gestures Kemp, in 1596, responded to Lorenzo's charge.  The visual comedy of
the past is unrecoverable.  Even though Launcelot's quibble on the homonym
Moor/more ("It is much that the Moor should be more than reason...") lies
absolutely limp on the modern page, we can guess that it would have been made
much of (who knows how?) by the great comedian for whom it was composed.

So that while Launcelot's getting the Moor pregnant must remain ultimately
mysterious, its odd and curious introduction at this juncture of the play very
possibly offered its original audience a moment of humor which later readers and
playgoers will never understand or appreciate.

Unsatisfying answers I know. But we must accept the fact that the past is not
always explicable.

Title: Another Merchant Mystery
Date: March 28, 2009

In The Merchant of Venice, as it appears in one up-to-date modern edition,
Portia's husband-to-be Bassanio is attended by a pair of friends named Solanio
and Salerio. Yet In another equally authoritative edition of the play, the
friends are named Solanio and Salerino -- and moreover, in this edition, a third
and apparently separate character named Salerio enters half-way through the
play. What's going on? Why the inconsistency?

First some onomastic context. Shakespeare could be quite casual about the naming
of his characters. In The Second Part of King Henry the Fourth, there are two
distinct figures, one named Bardolph and the other, for no good reason, Lord
Bardolph. Two separate and very different Jacques complicate As You Like
It, while in The Taming of the Shrew, easy-to-confuse Gremio and Grumio have
needlessly perplexed generations of readers. Even in The Merchant of Venice,
Shakespeare twice used the name Balthazar -- initially for a servant of
Portia and then a second time, gratuitously, as the pseudonym that Portia
adopts when she poses as a Paduan lawyer. But nowhere is Shakespeare quite
so arbitrary as he is with the names of the two (or is it three?) Sallies.

Solanio, Salarino, and Salerio all inhabited Merchant when it first appeared in
the 1600 quarto edition known to scholars as Q1, but whether Shakespeare meant
there to be two characters or three is a matter of mystery. It's possible, in
fact, that the playwright changed his mind in the course of writing. And what
would be evidence for Shakespeare's indecision? Scholars have now determined
that the first Merchant quarto was set in type by compositors who worked
from a manuscript in Shakespeare's own handwriting -- an "autograph" --
that preserved evidence of the writer, quill in hand, in the very thick of
invention. Shakespeare himself, it appears, vacillated about the names by
which to denote the Sallies and also about how many of them there were to be.
His waffling was reproduced by the compositors who dutifully set what they
had in front of them -- first thoughts, re-thinkings, revisions, errors, and
all. No wonder that modern editors have been baffled.

Here's a brief outline of a complicated textual tangle. In the stage direction
with which the play begins, Shakespeare introduces two of the characters in
question. "Enter... Salaryno, and Salanio."  In terms of personality, the
pair seem to be conceived as twins or doubles. Both are excessively talkative
-- long on enthusiasm and short on common sense. It appears that Shakespeare
not only cast the two characters from the same psychological mold, but that
he also decided to underline their similarity by giving them near-identical
names -- and it is from this initial decision that the confusions springs. The
trouble begins right there in the play's first scene. If Shakespeare had
retained his original names and followed his customary procedure, he would
have assigned Salaryno and Salanio the abbreviated speech headings "Sala." and
"Sala." -- clearly a recipe for disaster. So before he had entered fifty lines
into the scene, the playwright traded in one vowel for another and transformed
Salanio into "Sola." It's a curiosity that in the first scene of The Merchant
of Venice (as it appears in Q1), Salanio enters but Solanio exits. Oddly
enough, the pattern repeats itself when Solanio re-appears in the subsequent
scene in which the Sallies and Lorenzo plan Jessica's elopement. Solanio is
once again Salanio in the initial stage direction and Solanio or "Sola." in the
speech headings. Was Shakespeare irresolute or simply forgetful?

And now Salanio/Solanio's companion, Salarino, also begins to mutate. When
Jessica steals from Shylock's house, she is accompanied by a character who bears
the name Salerino -- that is, Salarino/Salaryno rechristened with a medial
"e."  We're now a third of the way through the play, and readers have already
encountered two characters, one of whom is named Salanio/Solanio and the other
Salarino/Salarynol/Salerino. At this point things become truly messy. Jessica
elopes with Lorenzo and they and their co-conspirators flee Venice for Belmont.
Gratiano, first to arrive at the country retreat, greets Lorenzo and his bride
Jessica and an accompanying friend. "But who comes here?" he inquires. "Lorenzo
and his infidel?/ What, and my old Venetian friend Salerio?"  Who, we may ask,
is this Salerio?  Readers who have been paying attention know that Gratiano
doesn't have an "old Venetian friend" Salerio. Instead, he has two old Venetian
friends -- Solanio and Salarino. Is Salerio a new character? Or, given the
whimsicality of Q1's spellings, is he simply a orthographical variant of one of
the Sallies with whom readers are already acquainted?

The action then returns immediately to Venice where a new scene begins with the
following stage direction: "Enter the Iew (i.e. Shylock) and Salerio."  But
Salerio, if he's anything more than a spelling error, can't be in both Venice
and Belmont at the same time (in fact, he's just been commisssioned to carry a
message from country to city). An editor vents her frustration: "Q1's Salerio
cannot be right, as he is on the way back to Venice." Apparently Shakespeare
himself was totally befuddled about whom he had named what and where he had
sent whom. Certainly, the printers themselves were baffled. The three earliest
editions of The Merchant of Venice each assign a different name to the Sally
who remained in Venice in the company of Shylock. In Q1, as we've just noted,
it's Salerio; in the lightly-edited second quarto (dated 1600, but actually a
forgery printed in 1619), he is Salarino, and in the 1623 Folio, it's Solanio.

If Q1 did, as is supposed, follow Shakespeare's manuscript, then the playwright
himself made the muddle, but who can say for certain that the confusion couldn't
have been the fault of one of the various scribes, book holders, compositors,
or editors through whose hands the manuscript might have passed.  In any case,
the snarl wasn't untangled in Shakespeare's time, and it hasn't been sorted out
since. Some editors give two characters, some three;  some name the characters
Solanio and Salarino, and some add a Salerio to the mix.

Why didn't Shakespeare simply create one all-purpose Sally? Because the
duplication makes dramatic sense. When one of the Sallies attacks Shylock
venemously, his bigotry might be dismissed as personal idiosyncrasy, but
when two of them gang up, they speak not as individuals but as a chorus that
expresses the nasty side of Venetian society.

But why didn't Shakespeare himself fix the problem? Did he leave it to his
actors to work it out on the stage, or was he a big-picture guy indifferent to
such details? Perhaps he did sort it all out in a scribal or subsequent version
of the play to which Elizabethan printers never gained access?

In any case, Shakespeare learned a lesson from his adventure with Salerio,
Solanio and Salarino. When he next came to invent characters who were doubles
or twins, he took the precaution to give them names that were impossible to
confound: Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

Title: On Aggasiz
Date: March 29, 2009

Louis Agassiz was, Darwin aside, the nineteenth century's most acclaimed
naturalist. He was the first to speculate about the ice ages and the first
to suggest that mastodons and other giant quadrupeds had become extinct as a
consequence of the deep freeze in Asia and America. Agassiz was much celebrated
in his lifetime, and at his death, Harvard, where he taught, shut down for a day
for his majestic funeral. James Russell Lowell contributed an eleven-page elegy
to the Atlantic. "Seldom, if ever, has the death of a man of science been so
deeply felt," reported The Nation.

These details are drawn from Barry Werth's Banquet at Delmonico's (2009), an
oddly-titled but informative and accessible history of Darwinism in gilded-age
America.

Here's a striking and crowded sentence about Aggasiz, also drawn from
Werth's book. "The son of a strong-willed assistant pastor to the Protestant
congregation of a lakeside village in French-speaking Switzerland who married
well, he was his parents' fifth child but the first to survive infancy."

Agassiz was a therefore a "replacement child" with a vengeance. He "replaced"
four lost siblings (but whether male or female Werth does not say). Imagine his
parents' pain; imagine how young Louis must have been cherished and protected
but also, possibly, afflicted with the 'guilt of the survivor.' Or how he must
have unconsciously competed with his deceased and therefore perfect brothers and
sisters. And then try to imagine both his mother's suffering and also how his
aspiring and apparently devout father might have responded to such an appalling
succession of family tragedies.

Agassiz was America's foremost opponent of evolution. He rejected natural
selection because, he claimed, "Darwinism" led inevitably to "atheism" -- which
hasn't turned out to be the case, although I personally can't imagine why it
hasn't. Agassiz took his own idiosyncratic route and proselytized for the
curious and retrograde doctrine of "polygenism" -- the idea that the various
races of man were separately -- and hierarchically -- created. Agassiz imagined
eight different kinds of humans, ranked according to their "cranial capacity"
-- Caucasian, Arctic, Mongol, American Indian, Negro, Hottentot, Malay, and
Australian (thereby running afoul of both "monogenists" like Darwin and bible-
worshippers who acknowledged only one creation -- that of Adam and Eve). For
Agassiz, each species was "a thought of God." An odd path for usually observant
scientist. Agassiz was the favorite intellectual of slaveholders and their
apologists.

Agassiz was also a virulent and odious racist. Here's what he wrote to his
mother when he stopped at a hotel in which he was served by black waiters. "It
is impossible to repress the feeling that they are not of the same blood as us.
Seeing their black faces with their fat lips and their grimacing teeth, the
wool on their heads, their bent knees and elongated hands, their large curved
fingernails, and above all the livid colors of their palms, I could not turn
my eyes from their face in order to tell them to keep their distance, and when
they advanced that hideous hand toward my plate to serve me, I wished that I
could leave in order to eat my bread apart rather than dine with such service.
What unhappiness for the white race to have tied its existence so closely with
that of the Negroes. God protect us." And so on, and more, and worse. I can't
remember reading a paragraph that more turned the stomach or that more cried out
for psychological analysis.

I cannot help wondering whether there might not be a connection between
Agassiz's status as a replacement child and his embrace of polygenism. Is it
possible that he unconsciously thought that he was a special and superior
person because he, of all his siblings, was chosen for survival?  And that in
the same way, white people were chosen and superior among all the "races" of
humankind. His deeply-held resistance to the evidence that persuaded almost all
of his fellow naturalists is inexplicable -- unless he clung to the doctrine of
special creation for reasons that were fundamentally irrational. Put it this
way: Agassiz's unusual situation required him to believe that he, and people
with whom he could identify, were marked for distinction -- and that all others
were inferior. One of five among the siblings, one of eight among the races.
How else could he free himself of the guilt that he lived and thrived while his
apparently less deserving siblings had perished?

Broad-brush cheap pop psychologizing, to be sure -- but let's reserve
judgment until we find some time to get ourselves to the library and learn a
little about this brilliant, disgusting man.

Title: This Old House
Date: March 30, 2009

We've left the old place for a slick new condo.

It was a good ol' house. A 1912 arts and crafts bungalow, probably built
right out of the Sears, Roebuck catalog.  When we arrived, in 1973, she
had been much abused:  some of her fir woodwork painted, some removed; the
stained-glass window and the original prairie-style chandeliers long gone;  the
handsome five- paneled living room window (prominent in the old photographs)
replaced with an Eisenhower-era "picture window," the original fireplace mantle
superseded by a monstrosity in native stone; the brass registers covered with
layers upon layer of paint, all those beautiful, then-fashionable pre-World
War I built-in cabinets carted to a dump; the classic oak floors covered with
wall-to-wall carpets.  Over the years, little by little, we did what we could
for the old lady: insulated her walls and ceilings, replaced the primitive
electrical wiring, stripped and refinished the woodwork and the registers,
fabricated a "new old" mantle and "new old" bookshelves and cabinets, modernized
the heating system, removed the asbestos, and (Boulder is hotter than it was a
hundred years ago) retrofitted it with air-conditioning. We updated the kitchen
-- brought the kitchen into the modern world.

We left the old dear in far better condition than we found her. Trust me on
this.

And let's not forget the backyard garden.  Where there was once an
incoherent jumble of thorny plants, there are now peonies both herbaceous
and tree (Including my favorite, the ever-larger Joseph Rocks), irises
bearded and Siberian, a variety of multiplying day lilies, climbing roses, a
thriving weigela, a Rose of Sharon, an abundance of clematis, and fences draped
with thick healthy ivy. I'm sorry to report that I never did get around to
replacing the sticky, aggressive bear-berries.

Are we sad to leave?  A little, but only a little. We did well by the old
house, and the house did well by us. We leave with a good conscience. But the
time has come to move along. It's only an object, after all; a machine for
living.

So here we are now, in this bright shiny new apartment. Floor-to-celing windows.
Fancy new appliances. A "great room," a "master bedroom."  An elevator.  It
took almost a full month to move, but in that month we progressed from the turn
of the previous century to the turn of the next.

And it feels right. It's OK.

Title: Nick and the Candlestick
Date: April 09, 2009

Sylvia Plath's "Nick and the Candlestick," a scalpel of a poem, is exasperating
in its details but crystal clear in "plot" and feeling. Here it is in its
entirety. Read it through; don't be alarmed if it seems impenetrable or opaque;
it's not. Or not entirely so.

I am a miner. The light burns blue.Waxy stalactitesDrip and thicken, tearsThe
earthen wombExudes from its dead boredom.Black bat airsWrap me, raggy
shawls,Cold homicides.They weld to me like plums.Old cave of calciumIcicles,
old echoer.Even the newts are white,Those holy Joes.And the fish, the fish----
Christ! They are panes of ice,A vice of knives,A piranhaReligion, drinkingIts
first communion out of my live toes.The candleGulps and recovers its small
altitude,Its yellows hearten.O love, how did you get here?O embryoRemembering,
even in sleep,Your crossed position.The blood blooms cleanIn you, ruby.The
painYou wake to is not yours.Love, love,I have hung our cave with roses.With
soft rugs----The last of Victoriana.Let the starsPlummet to their dark
address,Let the mercuricAtoms that cripple dripInto the terrible well,You are
the oneSolid the spaces lean on, envious.You are the baby in the barn.

Here''s the story in simple outline: the candlestick-bearing poet enters a dark
bedroom in which she finds rugs on the wall, an aquarium, and her sleeping
infant -- the "Nick" of  the title. The poem's import: simply that the world
may be dangerous and hostile, but is redeemed by the child. It's a simple tale
in a traditional form ("dramatic monologue") but its language and imagery
are startling, intense, even revolutionary. The poem's governing idea is not
unusual, but it is conveyed with magnificent electric imagery and emotion.

Some lines are clear, others entirely mysterious. A line-by-line commentary
follows.

"I am a miner." For the purposes of the fiction, the poet bluntly transforms
herself into a miner and explorer. The space into which she enters is a
bedroom, which in terms of the metaphor, is cast both as a mine and a
cave. What minerals will the miner extract?  Both the rich and rare (a ruby)
and the poisonous (mercury).

"The light burns blue."  The candle that she carries is nearly extinguished
(or, alternatively, there is a gas heater in the room).

"Waxy stalactites drip and thicken." Candle drippings, in the poet's
imagination, become stalactites; we are in a cave. But she holds a candle as
it would be employed in worship. It is through the agency of the candle that
religion (specifically Roman Catholicism) enters the poem.

"Tears/ The earthen womb/ Exudes from its dead boredom." The room, the
mine, the cave, is now figured as a womb. Tears/womb extends and transforms
candle/cave. The series of terms  "room" (implied) "mine," "cave," "womb") is
the metaphorical center of the poem -- the "spaces" that will be evoked in the
poem's next to last sentence. The womb is the previous home of "Nick," who is
also a babe of larger meaning in the climax of the poem.

The phrase "from its dead boredom" is not clear, at least to me. It's tempting
to say that the poet transfers her own emotion onto the wax/stalactite/tear
-- so that "the womb is crying just as I am" -- but nevertheless the phrase
"dead boredom" is too personal and vague to communicate perspicuously. The
room/cave/womb, at this point in the poem, seems to be infertile ("dead") and
un-engaging. But that will change.

"Black bat airs/ Wrap me, raggy shawls,/ Cold homicides." I understand why the
poet encounters bats in her cave, and it makes sense that she defines her own
clothes as a tattered shawl. It is also clear that the room into which she has
entered is dangerous and inhospitable. The syntax of the sentence is less than
clear. Does the phrase "cold homicides" stand in apposition to "airs?" Who are
these "cold homicides?" A "homicide" can be a murderer or a victim of murder or
even an abstraction. In what sense can a poet be "wrapped" in "cold homicides?"

"They weld to me like plums." The least explicable line in the poem. "They"
seems to refer to "black bat airs" -- but how airs can "weld like plums" is
beyond me. In the same way way that plums weld to me?  What way is that?

"Old cave of calcium/ Icicles, old echoer." Calcium icicles are clearly the
stalactites and a cave is certainly a place of echoes. But "old? Once again,
tired, unproductive, never fertile, but possibly also "old" in the sense of
familiar, as in "old friend."

"Even the newts are white,/ Those holy Joes." The stalactite-dominated cave with
its calcium icicles is drained of color. So too are the newts, or salamanders,
which ought to be red. Newts are traditionally associated with fire, but not
here. In Christian symbolism, they stand for faith, because, in the legends,
they survive the fiery passions of disbelief. Why are they "holy Joes?" The
only meaning of "holy Joe" with which I am familiar is "military chaplain,"
which isn't pertinent. But "Joe" is significant, because Joe or Joseph is the
absent father of the baby in the barn. But why is there a salamander in the
room, unless it lives in some sort of aquarium or terrarium?

"And the fish, the fish---/Christ! They are panes of ice,/ A vice of knives,/A
piranha religion, drinking/ Its first communion out of my live toes." Not just
a newt in this room/cave/womb, but fish as well. Fish, of course, are the pre-
eminent symbol of Christianity -- the Greek word ixthos, fish, signifying Jesus
Christ theos ouk soter (god and savior). But these fish, like the salamander,
are anything but redemptive. On the contrary, they stand for a "piranha
religion" and a sacrament not of communion but consumption -- with the poet
herself, or perhaps only her toes, the sacrifice.

These lines bring to conclusion the first part of the poem, which does not offer
any good news. But then begins the second movement of the poem, which is of a
more optimistic character.

"The candle/ Gulps and recovers its small altitude,/ Its yellows hearten." Well,
that's encouraging. The candle was almost extinguished, and with its return
comes a bit of color, at last. And perhaps some cheer.

"O love, how did you get here?/  O embryo/ Remembering, even in sleep,/Your
crossed position."  How, my child, did you find yourself in such a cold and
inhospitable universe. The baby is newly arrived, his legs still crossed as
they were in the womb -- "crossed," being, of course, an obvious reference to
"the cross."

"The blood blooms clean/ In you, ruby." No original sin in this jewel of a
child.

"The pain/ You wake to is not yours." It is the world's pain to which the
innocent child must gradually accommodate -- but not yet, and not in this
poem.."Love, love,/ I have hung our cave with roses./ With soft rugs----/ The
last of Victoriana."  The room is momentarily figured as a better world -- a
pre-modern world. It's comfortable, blooming; a room in strong contrast to the
colorless, cold cave of the first movement of the poem.

"Let the stars/ Plummet to their dark address,/ Let the mercuric/ Atoms that
cripple drip Into the terrible well," "Let" has the force of "even if." Even if
the world ends, even if the earth is polluted and poisoned, the poet exclaims,

"You are the one/ Solid the spaces lean on, envious." You, Nick, my infant
child who makes the world whole, are the "one solid," the only palpable
reality, which the spaces (vacuities, caves, rooms, emptinesses of all sort)
lean upon. And finally, at last,

."You are the baby in the barn."  You, my own newborn infant, are the baby
in the barn. Which is to say, you, not Him. You, not Jesus, are my savior. As
we've seen, the poem is not traditionally reverent. The baby in the barn is
stripped of religious mystery. The poet has already made clear her feeling about
Christianity -- it's a "piranha religion." But the "baby in the barn" -- Jesus
in the manger -- that's another thing. This barn-born baby (barn, not cave) is
a universal, trans-religious symbol of rebirth, of hope. "You are the baby in
the barn" invests meaning in Everyinfant. It repudiates the claim to special
importance of any particular child, even the god/man of theology. The poet
rejects Christianity in favor of a universal human and natural relationship
(parent-child) that underlies and precedes all religion.

It's a poem that travels a great distance in a handful of lines.  Brilliant,
isn't it?

Title: The "Singing Man of Windsor"
Date: April 14, 2009

In The Second Part of King Henry the Fourth, it is reported that Falstaff once
boldly compared the King to a "singing man of Windsor" -- and was assaulted for
doing so. Who, then, is this controversial "singing man?"

The evidence that might solve this mystery is buried in the dark backward and
abysm of time. The throwaway reference to a "singing man of Windsor" may have
tickled Globe audiences, but later playgoers (and scholars) don't have a clue as
to why.

The singing man owes his shadowy existence to Mistress Quickly, who inserts him
into a one of her ungainly rambling narratives, the point of which is to claim
that Falstaff has promised to marry her. "Didst thou not swear to me... when the
Prince broke thy head for liking his father to a singing man of Windsor...," she
complains.

Presumptuous indeed for Falstaff to compare his King to any ordinary mortal --
but what, we may ask, was so offensive about the "singing man" that his mere
mention provoked the prince to violence?  Misshapen, ugly, drunken,
foolish?  There must have been more jeer to the "singing man" than is now
obvious.

The phrase "singing man" was a technical term that described not popular
balladeers but professional choristers, usually priests, who were associated
with a church or college. Shakespeare knew about a priest of Windsor named
Maudelen -- the story is in Holinshed's Chronicles -- who resembled Richard II
and was deployed as a figurehead in a plot to overthrow the king. Is it possible
that Falstaff''s "singing man" referred to Maudelen and therefore challenged the
legitimacy of Henry's kingship?  Maudelen is not known to have been a singer,
and so the theory, weak as it is, seems to founder badly.

More likely is that there was a real, notorious Windsor singer, offensive in
some unknown way, who enjoyed local celebrity in the 1590s. Would Shakespeare
insert a real person into the history play?  Well, yes, he does such things.
This sequence of Henry plays, nominally set in the early decades of the
fifteenth century, is given to anachronism and occasionally introduces one of
Shakespeare's contemporaries into the story, perhaps as some sort of private
joke. A "William Visor of Woncote" who was very likely a member of the Visor
or Vizard family of Woodmancote in Gloucestershire is mentioned by Shallow's
factotum Davy. And then there's "Clement Perkes a' th' Hill," who as been traced
to the Purchas or Perkis family who dwelled on Stinchcombe Hill. And also the
"red-nosed innkeeper of Daventry" (Daventry is a village on the London-Coventry
road that Shakespeare no doubt frequented.)  These imagined beings are
indulgences on Shakespeare's part that might have amused the knowledgeable but
can only puzzle us.

The "singing man of Windsor" stands as another such bafflement. It's a clue to
Shakespeare's temperament, but a clue that leads nowhere.

Title: Some Euphemisms
Date: April 24, 2009

"Physical pressure" is entirely too vague -- goodness gracious, it could refer
to something no more serious than a firm handshake -- and as a result it's
impossible even to guess what's being euphemized. "Abuse" is similarly hazy.
Verbal abuse?  Spousal abuse? Gosh, it's hard to say. "Harsh methods" and
"harsh tactics" offer more of a clue, except that nowadays the word "harsh" can
be used semi-comically, as in the teen-age "oh, that's harsh." You don't want
inadvertent comedy when you're inventing prize-winning euphemisms. But "harsh"
has more heft when used in combination with other adjectives, as for example
"harsh interrogation methods" and "harsh interrogation techniques." The three-
word phrases sound as though they've been translated from the original German,
always a plus when language is being corrupted. "Rough treatment" is not very
imaginative. I definitely prefer "abusive treatment," and "abusive techniques."
"Coercive interrogation" has a nice ring -- and it leaves a lot of room for
the imagination. "Brutal treatment" and "brutal methods of interrogation" --
well, what's the point? Once you start using words like "brutal", you might
just as well just abandon euphemism altogether and say "torture," for goodness
sake. "Enhanced interrogations" and  "enhanced interrogation techniques"
effectively combine euphemism and bureaucratese. It's a stroke of genius to
take the word "enhanced," which ordinarily denotes an improvement, and transfer
it to the world of thumbscrew and electric shock. "Enhanced" is much more
effective than its alternative "extreme," as in the widely used but colorless
"extreme interrogation methods." My personal favorite is "advanced interrogation
techniques," in which the word "advanced," customarily employed to describe
progress in civilization, has been thoroughly perverted to refer to primitive,
barbaric practices. "Advanced interrogation techniques." Now that's what I call
a world-class euphemism! Credit another success to our government and to our
compliant journalists.

"contemporary gospel" -- which, according to AH, the world's expert, is called
contemporary because it is both a "con" and "temporary."  An all Gilbert and
Sullivan station -- but perhaps that would be a gift too precious to imagine?

But if  there can be eight all-Elvis stations, shouldn't there be at least

Title: Etymological Panic
Date: May 11, 2009

I can't remember what I was dreaming, but I woke up in a state of
pure etymological panic -- over the revelation that I didn't know the
derivation or meaning of the "welter" part of "welterweight."  How could this
be?  Context was not the least help:  lightweight, welterweight, middleweight,
light- heavyweight, heavyweight.  Why not the more logical, more consistent
"light- middleweight?"

What does "welter" mean?  I was barely awake, but I skimmed my mental
resources.  German "welt" -- world.  "Worldweight." Nonsense.  "Welt" as in
a wound on the skin caused by a punch.  Possible, but, all boxers raise welts
-- that's what boxers do -- not just welterweights.  A possible past tense
of "weld."  No, that won't do. Boxers don't weld, or repair, anything. It
was now time for a quick check of the mental Shakespeare concordance.  Whoops,
a blank.  Mental Milton:  hold on, now, here's something:  the phrase
"welter to the parching wind" in Lycidas.  But that particular "welter" means,
I had always assumed "roll." In what sense would a welterweight "roll" more
than any other size of boxer?  Another dead end.  OK, it's now time to get
out of bed, fire up the computer, and check the on-line etymological dictionary.
"Welterweight    1832, "heavyweight horseman," later "boxer or wrestler of
a certain weight" (1896), from earlier welter "heavyweight horseman or boxer"
(1804), possibly from welt (v.) "beat severely" (c.1400)." Now I'm starting to
relax;  the panic is beginning to fade.  Nothing more calming than to discover
that the internet doesn't have a better answer than I do.

But what the internet knows is intriguing. "Welterweight" used to
mean "heavyweight" and then somehow devolved into something less than
middleweight (147 pounds, to be exact, in American boxing)?  By what
etymological process?  It all sounds arbitrary and inexplicable to me. 
What is the root of "welter" in the sense of "heavy?"  To what words is it
related.  And when and why did it come to be demoted?  Well, there are,
as a well-known epistemologist liked to say, "known unknowns and unknown
unknowns."  The history of "welter" is unknown to a power.

On the other hand, the word "welter" standing all by itself is very
much known: "to roll or twist," c.1300, from M.Du. or M.L.G. welteren "to
roll," from P.Gmc. *waltijanan (cf. O.E. wieltan, O.N. velta, O.H.G. walzan "to
turn, revolve," Ger. wälzen "to roll," Goth. waltjan "to roll"), from PIE base
*wel- "to turn, revolve")."

But hold on here.  The noun meaning "confused mass" is first recorded 1851. 
That's the "welter" in, say, "his mind was a welter of confused etymological
ideas."  Could the welterweight welter and the confused mass welter be
related -- in the sense that a "welterweight" is neither light nor heavy? 
Well, it's a theory, but frankly, not a very good one.

Besides, it's still the middle of the night, and it's time to return to bed. 
The etymology of "welter" remains a mystery, but at least the symptoms of
etymological stress have faded. Will sleep come  -- or will I welter in a
welter of confused thoughts?

A while back, I complained about Allen Iverson.  Here's what I said:  "he
can do everything on the basketball court except win....  When the Nuggets
come down the floor, whether Iverson eventually shoots or not, he clings to
the ball and dribbles around while the rest of the team stand and watch. 
Iverson turns his teammates into spectators....  He isn't going to become a
team player;  he's 31 years old and he's averaged 23 shots a game with a .422
shooting percentage for an entire career."  "The Answer," I said, was not the
answer.  Not even close.

But things have changed for the Nuggets.  They finally unloaded Iverson
-- which would have been blessing enough.  Detroit put him on the shelf
-- didn't even play him at the end of the season.  But in exchange the
Nuggs received Chauncey Billups, who is everything Iverson is not:  a skilled
point guard, an intelligent man, a team player.  A leader, a defender.  It's
marvelous how one player can change the complexion of a team.  The Nuggets are
now a serious contender.  I like their chances against the Lakers.

Was it a brilliant move by the team owners and management?   I'm not privy to
the details, but I'd say, not brilliance -- just plain dumb luck.  I don't
think they knew either how bad Iverson was or how good Billups could be.

Bad planning, in any case.  If management could have guessed that the Nuggets
would make it to the western conference final, would they have let Marcus Camby
and Eduardo Najera slip through their cheapskate fingers a year ago?  No --
they would have made the investment that one makes when a championship is a
possibility. The Lakers can put three seven-footers (Bynum, Gasol, Odom) on the
floor at the same time -- wouldn't we love it if we could bring in Camby (an
all-league defensive player) to help Nene?  And who's going to guard Bryant? 
Dahntay Jones will take a crack at it, but wouldn't it be helpful if Najera
could have given us some minutes as well -- if not to stop Bryant, at least to
bang him around a bit?

And hey, does anyone remember that we gave up not only Andre Miller but two
first-round draft picks for 'The Answer'?  We might have had a dynasty in
the making if we had played our cards right -- and been willing to pay the
freight.  Two first-round picks, I repeat.

So the Nuggs have a chance -- but not the chance they might have had if they'd
been a little smarter, a little more imaginative, a little less tightfisted..

We're still dealing with the bureaucratic fallout from Grandma's death in
January. One consequence is that we receive impenetrable, inexplicable documents
from Medicare every few days.

Here's an opaque paragraph from the latest missive. Try to judge at what level
-- your choices are sixth grade through twelfth grade remedial -- this entirely
irrelevant and gratuitous advice is written.

"Medicare may pay for services that you get while on board a ship within the
territorial waters of the United States. In rare cases, Medicare may pay for
inpatient hospital, doctor, or ambulance services you get if you are traveling
through the territorial waters of Canada without unreasonable delay by the mos
(sic) direct route between Alaska and another state when a medical emergency
occurs and the Canadian hospital is closer than the nearest American hospital
that can treat the emergency. Medicare won't pay for this service since you
didn't meet these requirements."

It's the transition between the that long snake of a penultimate sentence and
the final injunctive sentence that throws me.  I made no request, so why the
prohibition: "you didn't meet these requirements?"  I never claimed to meet
them; in fact, I've never (nor did Grandma) traveled from Alaska to the lower
forty-eight by waterway. What the heck is Medicare talking about? Yikes! Double
yikes!

And what's with the idiom "get services."  Isn't it "receive services?"  Or
better yet, "receive care?"

There is no word more overused in American English than "get, got, gotten." Can
we agree to ban all forms of the word "get" from our vocabulary for a year. 
Get it out of our collective systems. Except, of course, in classic exchanges
such as, "Get it?" "Got it." "Good."

Is it possible that there are insurance-company moles in the Medicare system?
They've infiltrated the bureaucracy and they cleverly undermine the drive for
socialized medicine by generating cascades of dark, bilious, fearful prose.

Title: De Pecunia
Date: May 27, 2009

I've never understood money.  It doesn't do you any good until you spend it,
and once you spend it, you don't have it anymore.

I never understood income, either.  I was employed for most of my life at a
frugal, let's call it, state university.  I earned much less money than friends
in the "private sector" or the trades, but it didn't seem to matter much. 
I never missed a meal, I sent my kids to good colleges, and I enjoyed the
security of knowing that I wouldn't be laid off.  Meanwhile, I spent a good
hunk of my life reading books and talking about literature with young people. 
On the whole, it seemed like a good deal.

I did have some resentments, however, one of which was the disparity in salary
between faculty and adminstrators.  If we were all working in the same place,
why should the guy who ran the student union, or who managed "public relations,"
or who lobbied the legislature, or who was in charge of campus parking or
admissions, or who coached the linebackers, or who was second assistant vice
chancellor for this-or-that receive a salary twice or three times as large as
mine?  I never grasped the reason.

But then I discovered that the real money in the University system wasn't
in these areas.  It was in managing the University's portfolio.  A few
years ago, Harvard Magazine reported that the managers of its endowment were
receiving annual salaries of $8,000,000 to $10,000,000 -- or about 100 times
what I was pulling down.

But, it was reported, they earned these phenomenal salaries because they were
such financial geniuses -- and their genius could be judged by the enormous
growth of the endowment.

I have to say that I was sceptical.  I remembered one of my father's
maxims:  "when the stock market is going up, everybody's a genius."

Then I received a letter from Harvard's President, reporting on the steep
decline in the value of the endowment.

In a fit of pique, I wrote to President Faust (her real name).

Dear President Faust:  when the stock market was flying, the managers of
Harvard's endowment were geniuses and were paid astonishingly high salaries. 
Now that the endowment has lost 30% of its value, do you plan to a) lower
the salaries of endowment managers to realistic levels, and b) ask them to
recompense the university for their absurd past overcompensation ?    Yours,
Vivian de St. Vrain  (Ph.D. 1966)

I didn't expect an answer, but after several months, I received the following
letter, which, truth to tell, I regard as rather cold and perfunctory.

Dear Dr. St. Vrain.

Although I cannot comment on matters of employee compensation, I understand and
appreciate your concern for Harvard’s wellbeing.  Please be assured that the
endowment management remains entirely focused on supporting the University’s
most fundamental education and research priorities.Regards,Drew Faust Whoa. 
Back o' the hand to poor Vivian.

OK, that's it.  In retaliation, I'm striking Harvard out of my will. President
Faust will have to find someone else to endow that new administration building.

Here's my latest 'personal best.'  It's now seven consecutive airplane trips
in which the person next to me has been an obese hulk. The kind of person who
spreads his (or her) legs, drips his (or her suet) onto and over my armrest
and claims and colonizes territory that I have purchased and which should be
inviolate.

As usual, we've arrived early.  We have the aisle and the middle, and we're
hoping that the window will be unoccupied, but we know that to wish so is
probably hopeless.  I watch the doorway.  Any number of slim - size 2,
size 4 -- young ladies appear, progress down the aisle, glance at my row,
and continue on their way.  Small nine-year-old boys whom I would joyously
welcome emerge from the doorway.  They too pass by.  Elderly grandmothers,
too frail and slight to threaten my space, totter to the rear. Then,
finally, here he is, my destiny.  Just my luck once again!  An enormous
whale, big enough to block the sun, swims and jiggles me-ward.  Clouds
of thick tobacco smoke rise like mist from his clothes.  He pauses. "May
I?" he says, unapologetically, shamelessly.  We stand, exit the row, and
wait in the aisle while he slowly maneuvers his massive bulk into place,
sighs, and crushes his seat. He loosens the seatbelt to maximum girth. By
the time I return, he's already claimed the armrest  and his keachy elbow
has broken the imaginary plane.  Now he spreads his heroic sumo thighs.  In
all fairness, there's no way he could get both legs under his seat, nor any way
that his flabby arms could be confined to the space that he has paid for. I
huddle to one side, forced to list to the left.  I am majorly pissed but too
polite (or inhibited) to utter the vindictive words that form themselves in my
brain:  "Hey, buster, next time buy yourself two seats. Or a whole row."

In my near future:  four-and-a-half hours of undeserved compression. Back ache.
Head                                                                       ache.

We drove from DC to Bradford, Vermont. Not desrious of hazarding the I-95
corridor, we veered far to the west, almost to Scranton.  It was a mostly
pleasant ride. Travelers, remember the Taconic State Parkway --  it's
underused, neatly landscaped, truck-free.

Along the way, we encountered a road sign which said, Lititz, Pennsylvania.

Lititz. I know that name. How? Have I been there?  No. Did I have a
Lititzfriend from ?  I searched my mind.  Nope. Some famous person come from
LititzLititz?  No.

It bothered me. Something in my mind connected with Lititz but I couldn't
recall it.

Is it LIT-its?  Luh-TITS?

We at last we arrived here in Bradford, Lititz still puzzling me.  What kind
of word is Lititz? Time to fire up the wikipedia.  OK, here it is. "Lititz
was founded my members of the Moravian Church in 1756, and was named after
a castle in Bohemia named Litice....  For a century, only Moravians were
permitted to live in Lititz, and until the middle 1800s only members of the
congregation could own houses  The lease system was abolished in 1855." Nice
little exclusivist Pennsylvania Dutch town, but still the question lingers  --
how do I know it?

"Lititz is also home to Linden Hall School, the oldest all-girls boarding school
in the United States, founded by the Moravians in 1746."  That's an interesting
piece of news.

Do I know someone who attended Linden Hall?  No, I don't think so.

I went to sleep, puzzled. Why is Lititz, PA so familiar to me?

Next day, we started spring-cleaning the house and ran into distinct signs of
recent mouse habitations.  I got out some mousetraps, the kind with the spring
that I've been baiting with peanut butter at various catless times these last
50 years.  They're Victor mousetraps.  Aha. Printed on each one, in small
letters:  "Woodstream Corporation, Lititz, Pennsylvania."

Mystery solved.  Next time through, perhaps we'll stop at Lititz, check out the
church, the school, and the Moravian mouse-trap factory.

I had to dispose of the corpse.

My choice was either to take it to the dump, piece by piece, weekly, or bury
it on the property.  Whose body?  Don't know.  How did it get into the
freezer?  I put it there, in a black plastic bag, after I killed him.  I gave
careful consideration to the pros and cons of each method.  If I took it to
the dump, there might be fingerprints or perhaps pieces of paper with my name
on them.  And it might take weeks to complete the process.  If I buried it on
the land, it would always be here.  Who knows what excavations there might be
in the future.  I started to bury it, but just as I put a shovel in the earth,
a small, yappy dog started pestering me.

Time to wake up.  Hey, good deal.  I didn't murder anyone.  I'm clean.

-I-

You were basking

in what seems a great spot.

I am most jealous

of  your salad

under the palm trees.

I do not want to raise expectations

about feelings

and things.

You are special

and unique

and fabulous

in a whole host of ways.

I will write you a longer note

with a few more profound thoughts

tomorrow

or

Wednesday.

It won't be worthy of bedside placement.

-II-

I went out and ran the excavator with lights until the sun came up.

There is something wonderful

about listening to country music playing in the cab,

the air conditioner running,

the hum of a huge diesel engine in the background

the tranquility that comes with being in a virtual wilderness

of trees and marsh,

the day breaking

and vibrant pink becoming alive in the morning clouds.

And getting to build something with each scoop

of dirt.

It is admittedly weird.

-III-

Do you really comprehend

how beautiful your smile is?

Have you been told lately

how warm your eyes, and how they softly glow

with the special nature of your soul?

The rarest of all commodities in this world is love.

You already had

a full tank of love

in the emotional bank account.

Since our first meeting there in  the wind-swept

somewhat open air

dance spot in Punta del Este,

I felt that you had that same rare attribute.

You have a level of sophistication that is so

fitting

with your beauty.

You have the ability to give magnificently gentle kisses.

I love the curves of your hips.

I love your tan lines.

You have a particular grace and calm that I adore.

In the faded glow of night's light

that we spoke of

at the steakhouse.

-IV-

This soul-mate feel

I alluded to

is real.

How this lightning strike snuck up on us

I am still not sure.

My heart wants to get on a plane tonight to be in your loving arms.

My head says how do we put the genius back in the bottle

The bottom line is two fold.

I stopped at one of those highway gas-station convenience stores a few weeks
ago, searching for some invigorating M&Ms. I couldn't find them, but I said to
myself, this is America and I'm an American, and if there's one thing I know
it's that there are going to be M&Ms somewhere in this quickstop. I poked around
a little more and sure enough, just a little out of the way, there they were
-- five different kinds of M&Ms. I went for the classic multi-colored ones. Am
I the kind of person who's going to experiment with peanut butter M&Ms?  It
wouldn't be me.

But I'm off the point, which is, that when you're a native of the place, you
know more or less what to expect. You're not likely to be taken by surprise
very often. But every once in a while, something hits you right between the
eyes, and you say, where the heck am I? I had such an experience today when I
read a flyer from the West Fairlee Center Church, which is right over there on
Middlebrook Road, not more than three or four miles from where we live.

I have no quarrel with the "Old Fashioned Community Hymn Sing" on July 12 or
the "Shape Note Singing" on August 2 -- that's exactly what I would expect
from a church in West Fairlee Center. I'm a little puzzled by the "Blessing
of the Animals" on July 19, but then I remembered St. Francis, in some ways my
favorite saint, and I remembered that he preached to the birds and that when he
was dying, he thanked his donkey and (this is a bit hard to believe but what the
heck) his donkey wept. So I'm OK with blessing the animals, although I myself
would feel hypocritical blessing the particular animals that I was preparing
to transubstantiate into lambchops or hamburger.

But what makes me feel like a stranger in a strange land is the event that
is scheduled for August 9 -- the "Blessing of the ATV's" (sic). ATVs,
for those of you who don't know, are "all-terrain vehicles," and are very
useful if you're out on the range in the vast West patrolling miles and miles
of barbed-wire fence, but which in the crowded East are used mostly for
"recreation," which seems to involve tearing up private land (someone else's
private land, that is) or government land, making a whole lot of noise, and
sometimes driving underage and illegally, and much too fast, on our usually
peaceful "unimproved" dirt roads. No mufflers, no insurance, no license.

So what's with "the blessing of the ATVs?"

St. Francis has become the patron saint of environmentalists. Is
"the blessing of the ATVs" supposed to be a rejoinder to St. F and to
ecological thinking? Are we experiencing a Christian sanction of
anti-environmentalism?  Or have these back-country bible churches long been
blessing tractors and balers and pickups and backhoes, and I've just not
noticed?

WTF is going on? Am I in the America I know and understand?  Why am I
feeling vertiginous?

Would St. Francis have thanked his ATV?  And if he did, would his ATV have
wept?

I've shamefully neglected the writings of John Updike.  I read the first Rabbit
novel when it appeared in 1960 and was struck by its vigor and authenticity. 
A talent to watch, I said to myself -- but then I lost track.  I loved one of
the Bech books, devoured on an airline ride from somewhere to somewhere else
twenty years ago.  I've been dazzled by short stories in various anthologies
and by art criticism in the NYRB.   But for a writer considered an American
master, nominated for a Nobel  -- well, I've been inattentive.  And now Updike
is gone.  I'm late (as usual).  To remedy the personal deficiency, I hastened
to the Bradford Public Library, where, sad to say, the only Updike on the shelf
was one I'd never heard of,Villages, published in 2004.

Villages is billed as an autobiographical novel and appears to be so.  It's
eminently readable, slickly written (sometimes so facilely that it crosses into
self-parody).  But, my-oh-my, what an embarrassingly bad performance.  It's
no more than a sexual history of "Owen Mackenzie" in which the succession of
women Owen encounters are diffentiated only by the size and shapes and degrees
of mucosity and erectility of their reproductive organs.  It's an adolescent
novel written by a seventy-year-old eminence.  What the heck was Updike
thinking?. Why would he waste precious time on such unambitious, indulgent
stuff -- unless he took a long-ago manuscript out of a drawer and fooled around
with it a bit?

Disappointing indeed. A few years ago, I read through the novels of Philip Roth,
who is an exact contemporary of Updike.  My conclusion:  that Roth (see Books
over there on the side of the page) was a writer of arrested development.  Oh
no, not again!

Let's see if the BPL has anything else by Updike today.  Let's hope for the
best.  Villages has got to be an aberration.

In Terrorist, Updike takes us inside the head of a young,malleable, soft-spoken
Islamist fanatic.  The protrayal is persuasive, in part because the horror
bigotry is understated and casual.  It's quite a feat of imagination on the
author's part.  It's a good novel -- a page-turner, as they say.  It's
most remarkable feature is that the hero of the novel is a tired and bedraggled
high school guidance counsellor;  What a breakthrough -- the guidance
counsellor, figure of o-so-much contempt and satire, as savio!.  Of course,
the contrived/dramatic ending in which the terrorist and the counsellor square
off is totally unbelievable, but at least it doesn't involve fistfights
or animatrons.  On the whole, Terrorist is a very readable, imaginative and
largely satisfying novel.  It's a bit spare, laconic  -- but perhaps it
only seems so because I'm also reading Doestoevsky.  It's not a novel for the
ages -- it's too obviously occasional.  And I must say, I'm suspicious of
a piece of fiction about the interaction of various ethnicities in which the
only two Afro-Americans are a whore and a pimp named Tylenol.

Off to the Bradford Public to see what else is in their Updike holdings.

The Stephen Foster songbook was a staple of my childhood. My mother sitting at
the old Hardman baby grand, sang "Camptown Ladies" and "O Susanna" and "Old
Black Joe." But times change and Foster was pushed to the sidelines years ago.
Too racist, too sentimental, too 'soft'. It's undeniable that the lyrics of many
of his songs are reprehensible.

Now we're enjoying a Stephen Collins Foster Revival and Festival in our very
own home. It began with the discovery of the "American Dreamer" cd that Thomas
Hampson recorded in 1992.  Hampson, opera lovers will know, is the world
champion of living baritones, and in this cd, he does Foster proud -- to the
inventive accompaniments of Jay Ungar and Molly Mason. No question but that
Foster was a truly superb melodist -- with a long string of songs that would
have gone double-platinum, if there had been such a thing, in pre-Civil War
America.

Hampson sings the Foster songs as if they're Schubert lieder, but there's
another recent cd, "Beautiful Dreamer" -- a "tribute album" in which Suzy
Bogguss, John Prine, Allison Krauss, Mavis Staples and a bunch of excellent
lesser-known (to me) but wonderful musicians lay into these tunes with
enthusiasm and verve. Who would have guessed the "Beautiful Dreamer" was
country before country was cool? Pure country.

Foster was a better melodist than poet. Often his lines are awkward and time-
bound and mawkish, but occasionally he hits the nail on the head. I like
"beautiful dreamer, queen of my song"; I think that "slumber my darling the
birds are at rest" is fine, but a succeeding line in the same song -- "thy
pillow shall sacred be" -- is bad beyond ordinary bad; "weep no more, my lady"
is positively Shakespearean and "all the world is sad and dreary/ every where
I roam" is well-rooted in the medieval contemptus mundi  tradition; "long
may the daisies dance the field, frolicking far and near" is far too pseudo-
Wordsworthian for my palate. Foster's best lyric, in my view, is "Hard Times
Come Again No More" --  "'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary/ Hard times, hard
times, come again no more/ Many days you have lingered, around my cabin door/
Oh! hard times, come again no more."  It's inspired, heartfelt, and eternally
pertinent -- and also, wedded to an excellent melody. "Hard Times" was not known
to me in the days of my youth -- more's the pity.

Old guy, maybe a bluesman, bottle of hooch in a brown paper bag, sits on a bench
in the middle of the night, downtown, playing air-sax, nodding. Young fellow
comes by, cheerful, asks him, "Crosstown buses run this way?" Blues guy looks
up, pauses for a second, and then drawls, "Doo--dah, doo-dah."

Two more Updike novels down the hatch. The first, Seek My Face, published in
2002, is an extended short story rooted in the author's prodigious knowledge of
the contemporary art scene. It's casually written -- as if Updike didn't try
very hard. Should I be insulted that Updike didn't extend himself to invent a
plot?  The second novel is Rabbit at Rest, composed back in 1990 when Updike
was trying harder. Harrry "Rabbit" Angstrom, "hero" of four novels, is a force
in modern fiction. He's nasty, amoral, and crude, but hardly more so that the
gaggle of suburbanite creatures who surround him. Updike mercilessly draws
attention to everything odious in America culture -- he's the poet laureate of
tacky. Rabbit is fascinating but repellent. Whatever happened to "to teach and
to delight?"

Every once in a while Rabbit, always, alas, comprehensible, becomes momentarily
sympathetic. But then Updike allows him to speak -- and Rabbit's words are
invariably aggressive and offensive.  I think that the gap between what Rabbit
thinks and what Rabbit says is a major structural flaw in the novel -- and
one that will eventually push the novels from center to periphery. But time
will tell. For now, the Rabbit books are a guide to our own American kind of
shallowness -- and so here I am, off to the library or to the second-hand
bookstore to hunt down the earlier novels in this series. What does Dickens say
about Uriah Heep -- something about "fascinating in his own repulsion."  Yes, I
think that phrase will serve nicely for Updike's Rabbit.

Title: Ligawinitude
Date: August 03, 2009

The word "ligaw" in Pilipino, a language of which I am totally ignorant,
apparently means both "totally lost" and "courtship." And therefore the
adjective "ligawin" refers to someone who is both "directionally disabled"
or "directionally dyslexic" and also "attractive to persons of the opposite
sex." What a wonderful correspondence, especially to those of us who regularly
lose the car in the parking lot and to whom a walk in a strange city is
a fearful and daring adventure.  My lexicography is contributed by a
Manila reader whose forthright and thoughtful blog can be accessed at
this address.)  "Directionally dyslexic" is an ugly phrase, filled with
self-loathing; "ligawinitude" trips off the tongue. Well, almost trips; 
it's certainly superior to "ligawinness" -- which sounds like the female of an
extinct predator.

Here are some examples of ligawinitude (fellow sufferers will empathize) which I
have borrowed from Ana in Manila:

"I am so ligawin I still lose my way around the UP campus after 30 years working
there. I am so ligawin I'd enter the main door of an unfamiliar office, transact
my business, and then try to let myself out through the door of a conference
room right smack at a dozen people all gaping at me. I am so ligawin that when
I eat out, I can get lost going back from the comfort room to my table at a
big restaurant till my friends are about ready to page me....  When I am in a
strange place and I wish to explore it, I walk a straight path. When I reach a
fork, I turn back."

Ana claims to be "the most ligawin person in the world."  t's a hard claim to
substantiate. The instances of ligawinitude that she cites -- well, I can match
them with one hand tied behind my back. We won't crown a world ligawin champion
until we tabulate the results of the International Ligawinitude Olympics.
Nevertheless, it is curious to me that the ligawinitudinous often boast of the
severity of their condition.  No one says -- "Oh, I am the most colorblind
person in the world," but we (the ligawinoids) take a perverse pride in topping
our lost friends. "Loster than thou" is our odd claim.

Because the general public and even our closest friends treat us as comic, we
respond by boasting of our affliction. In effect, we identify with those who
laugh at us.

The chronically lost require liberation. We're not clowns;  we're just subject
to ligawinitude.

Which means that we're a) lost and b) sexy.

boats,  squealing and keening. The kids watched as he speared a small fish and
swallowed it whole. I worried:  perhaps he's hurt and can't fly.  But after
a day or so, he rose into the air, wheeled about, and off he went. Was he a
poorly-educated juvenile out on his own for the first time?  We'll never know.

And then, yesterday, a new critter. The pond has become home to a muskrat, which
swims slowly along the opposite bank. Should we be happy about this? Muskrats
eat cattails, of which we have a more-than-adequate supply. But they also eat
small frogs, and we love our frogs. They are philoprogenitive, reproducing like
rabbits. We don't want vast colonies of these lemming-like creatures.  And
they burrow into and undermine banks -- which is not good if they damage the
artificial dike. OK, Mr. Muskrat, here's the deal -- you stay on your side of
the pond, the natural side and we'll be good friends, but don't try to make a
home on the artificial side.

When I was a boy in the unenlightened 40s, women wore fur coats. One of the
common furs was called "Hudson seal." Guess what?  "Muskrat fur that is dyed,
plucked, and sheared to resemble seal."

Two can play the same game. If anyone asks, that rodent over the on the far side
of the pond with the long ratlike tail -- that's a Hudson seal.

Title: Zucchini News
Date: August 23, 2009

In our part of Vermont, the common wisdom is, "never keep your car unlocked in
August, because someone will open your door and throw in a couple of zucchinis."
Like most local gardeners, I'm drowning  in the  squash. We can't eat our
zucchinis fast enough. And no matter how vigilant I am in picking them, I wake
up in the morning to lift one of those huge hairy leaves and there it is ---
another baseball-bat long, sumptuously fat zucchini, staring its one-eyed stare
at me. To make matters worse, this year I'm growing two kinds of zucchinis --
the standard green supermarket variety and a fancy striped "Romanesco."  Also
another exotic squash, a buttery globe called "Ronde de Nice," most plentifully
produced.

Last week I was weeding in the garden when I had an unexpected visitor --
unusual for our dirt-road, off the beaten track neighborhood.  I can't remember
having to deal with a solicitor since two barely fledged Mormons popped by,
fruitlessly, in 1978. This young man, who arrived noiselessly on bicycle was
from VPIRG, and he came to tell me about the hazards of the Vermont Yankee
atomic power station. I told him right up front that I wasn't going to donate
any money and I told him why -- it all went to Obama.  But he was cordial
nevertheless, and we chatted. He's a Latin major, just graduated from UVM,
off in the fall to join Americacorps. Nice kid, I thought, but an easy mark.
After twenty minutes, he rode off with no donation but with  two substantial
zucchinis and a Ronde de Nice in his backpack. Also a large head of broccoli and
a handful of beets.

Title: The Slightness of the Lambs
Date: August 25, 2009

As far as I can tell, the deer generally keep clear of the back field where
the Morgans and the Scottish Blackfaces are pastured. Perhaps it's because
the domestic animals eat down the grass, or perhaps the deer just don't like
company. But a few days ago, I watched four white-tailed deer -- a doe with
three fawns, I believe, though such a group makes an unlikely family -- chase
twenty-two sheep out of the field and back to their fold. Sheep are notoriously
skittish, but then, so are the white tails. It was a battle of cowards. It was
especially painful to watch because one of the sheep was the ram, McCavish,
and it's his job (aside from the annual servicing, at which he performed
brilliantly) is to guard the ewes. McCavish is the "herd sire," new to the
flock. He was recently imported from Wisconsin; his grandfather came from
Scotland in the form of a vial of sperm packed in dry ice. What was Mr. McCavish
thinking when he ran from the field?  I was embarrassed for him and for the
entire flock. Query:  will the sheep stand their ground or will they allow
themselves to be intimidated by the wild turkeys?

Title: Richard Poirier (1925-2009)
Date: August 31, 2009

Richard Poirier died last week at age 83. The New York Times paid tribute with
a long obituary and an appreciative essay. Poirier was a "distinguished man of
letters" and also a Professor of English.

In 1960, as the juniorest and least-sophisticated graduate student in the
history of the universe, I enrolled in an AmLit course taught by Poirier. Fifty
years later, I can affirm that it was the single course in my graduate career in
which I performed the absolute worst -- both in the instructor's judgment and
in my own. I'm still embarrassed at the woeful mess of a paper I offered him.
I remember little of it, except its incompetence and the recollection that I
used the phrase "a writer of his ilk" -- I can't remember to which I writer I
referred -- and that Poirier wrote a longish exasperated note explaining to me
that I did not have the standing to treat any American author with disrespect.
However, the honest-to-goodness reason why I did so badly in the course was that
Poirier expected his students to think -- and thinking was not an area in which
I was gifted. I had discovered early in my educational career that my memory
was far superior to most of my contemporaries, that I had an ear for language,
and that I had a moderately fluent prose style. But I never, ever, possessed a
logical, orderly, or penetrating intelligence. (I could remember sentences and
phrases and whole poems, but not arguments or chains of reasoning).  My skills
were sufficient for literary study -- indeed I doubt that I could have managed
an academic career in any other discipline.

In fact, I did rather well in studies with most of my graduate-school
professors -- distinguished and learned gentlemen all of them -- who were so
happy to encounter facility that they didn't notice the want of brain.

It is curious that some of the most profoundly learned of my professors were the
least adventurous of thinkers. I remember, particularly, Douglas Bush, now a
mere trivia question, but a most renowned scholar in his day, whose superficial,
fey, conservative, neoChristianist, pixie observations on Spenser and Milton I
duly recorded. for two endless semesters, learning absolutely nothing of worth
or value.

Poirier was more serious. Only 35 (I was 21), he was thinking deeply about the
qualities that made American literature distinctive (he was formulating the
ideas that came together in A World Elsewhere). He was an intellectual rather
than an academic. It would have been wise for me to have listened carefully to
him. I might have learned something.

It's shocking to me that the young, dashing lecturer whom I remember so clearly
could be so old, so dead -- but there's no denying that half a century has
slipped away since I last listened to his rumbling voice.

Title: Late Blight
Date: August 31, 2009

It seems so allegorically named, late blight, especially appropriate to your
septuagenarian gardener. But it's more than symbolic -- late blight is here
and it's real. It's official name is phytophthora infestans. It's a noxious
fungus and it appears just when you're about to start harvesting your abundant
tomatoes. Late blight blackens and putrifies leaves, stems, and the fruits
themselves. It leaves nothing edible, and there's no recourse but to pull out
your plants, and then either burn them or put them in black plastic and take
them to the dump. We're trying to rescue a few of the tomatoes by pulling off
the bad leaves, but it's a losing cause.  All that work -- starting the seeds,
watching and watering, fertilizing and staking and tying up -- all wasted. What
a pity.

Late blight also affects potatoes. In fact, this nasty fungus is responsible for
the great Irish famine of the 1840s. So while we're mournful, we're glad that we
don't depend on our tomatoes for sustenance or income.

Why this year?  Some say that the disease comes to us from the great factory
farms in the south, where tomato plants are started early and then shipped north
in late spring. My neighbors put the blame on Wal-Mart. But in all honesty, I
must admit that all my tomatoes were started locally, by friends and relations.
The fungus can't be transmitted through the seed, so the tomato factories are
off the hook. The real culprit is the weather -- the soggy cold of June and July
was hideous if you're a tomato but just perfect if you're a blight.

I think I'll take a year off from tomatoes -- let the garden go fallow, or just
plant flowers. I couldn't bear to lose another crop. I'll follow the official
advice -- root out every single volunteer tomato and pull every weed in the
nightshade family. No tomatoes until 2011.

Title: New Bird in Town
Date: September 03, 2009

A creature previously unknown to me has appeared in the pond. After a few
moments with the binoculars and a glance at Peterson's classic Field Guide to
the Birds along with some intense internet research, I could make a positive
identification. It's a double-crested cormorant, usually found at the seacoast
but sometimes in rivers and lakes, which has been "recently extending its range"
and which has just now arrived on Hackett Hill Road. Although it's exciting
to encounter a new bird, especially a large graceful swimmer and diver, the
cormorant arrives tarnished by a bad reputation. Cormorants form very large
colonies and over-indulge their voracious appetites -- they gobble fish, frogs,
salamanders, clean out the lakes. Is it after our trout? They've become a pest
on Lake Champlain, where the authorities are "taking measures" to reduce the
population. I don't mind one cormorant, but I certainly don't want to host a
horde of them.

When the first wild turkey arrived, about fifteen years ago, everyone would stop
and stare. Now turkeys are as common as pigeons, but as far as I can tell, do
no damage (unless they get into the garden, which they haven't, so far). They
eat insects, not frogs. Plus they're good eating. I've never heard of anyone
salivating over roast cormorant.

I'd trade the cormorant, and the turkeys for that matter, for some of the birds
that have disappeared over the last forty years. We used to have a symphony
at dawn and dusk -- now there's hardly a peep, except for the robins and the
bluejays. I'd give a lot to hear a white-throated sparrow at daybreak. It's
been years since I've seen a bluebird, a wren, an indigo bunting, an oriole, a
purple martin, a red-wing blackbird, a sandpiper, a tanager, a vireo. Or seen
the swifts overhead. Even our once-abundant swallows have become rare. Where are
they?

[November 9, 2020: the cormorant never returned. Nor did any of his friends or
relatives.]

Title: My First Racist
Date: September 07, 2009

There was this nasty kid in our class at P. S. 217, back there in the Flatbush
'50s. I'm not going to name names, but if anyone is cares to look, you can
tell him by his superior, know-it-all smirk in the picture of our eighth
grade graduating class. For convenience, I'll call this guy K. K was not
particularly smart, or athletic, or talented, or attractive, or congenial,
so he was quite a way down the social pole, a resident of the land of the
nebbishes. But to give him his due, he was intense, dogged, hard-working, and
perpetually argumentative. He was not afraid to offend. He took positions
that no one else in the schoolyard supported. I remember him haranguing me on
the subject of social security. It was a bad thing, he asserted, because his
father could make more money by investing on his own rather than contributing
to the pot. "But, but, but...," I remember stuttering, "it's insurance, and
not everyone is a good investor." This exchange must have taken place during
the Truman years. In the P. S. 217 schoolyard, where everyone was the child
or grandchild of immigrants, FDR was our guy and social security was a
revolutionary improvement in the quality of life. Wasn't it the case
that my widowed grandmother received $32 a month from social security --
not sufficient to live on, surely, but a great help, enough to pay her rent?
To argue against social security -- where in the world did K get such weird,
off-the-track ideas?  Plus, equally astonishing, K was an enthusiastic Yankees
fan. What an unholy, contrarian jerk!

Then K disappeared for a month or a year -- some period of time, I can't
remember exactly how long. He had relatives in a southern city -- Baltimore, I
believe -- and he lived with them for an extended while. When he returned,
he starting spouting the most grotesque racist claptrap. It's engraved on my
memory:  "they have a lot of uppity blacks down there, they won't even get
off the sidewalk for you." Whoa, daddy. First of all, no one said "blacks" in
those days -- they were "Negroes." And second -- "uppity?" I had never heard the
term before and was shocked out of my skull. And "get off the sidewalk" --WTF???
 These were words and sentiments far beyond my experience or conception, beyond
anything I had ever heard uttered in our part of the universe. I was offended
and flabbergasted. Remember, dear readers, that the only person more sacred to
P. S. 217 schoolyarders than FDR was Jackie Robinson. It was from K that I
first heard the grotesque sentence, "Would you want one to marry your sister?"

I tell you, I gave K a lot of room after those conversations. Truth to tell,
there was no need for our paths to cross -- we weren't in the same classes and
K didn't play softball or basketball -- as I said, he was pretty much of a
klutz.

Recently I looked up K on the internet. He's a retired professor of economics
and is a "fellow" at a right-wing think tank. He's made a career out of opposing
third-world development and supporting "free market solutions" to all our ills.
That dogged dullness has produced a number of books. I've even found a picture
of him -- where he was once flabby and pimpled, he's now bald and sleek, with a
malevolent cast to his eye.

There's always been a connection in my mind between conservatism and racism. The
link is narcissism. "I've got mine, let "them" take care of themselves." For
the Ks of the world, it's not "how do we take care of less fortunate and of our
old people?"  It's, "how do 'we' deal with 'them.'"  And "they" are usually,
almost always, darker-skinned than "we."  I'm sure that K would deny that his
"free- market" views have anything to do with racism. But I know better -- I was
there at the beginning, before K became quite so sleek.

Title: Notes on the "Tarpaulin"
Date: September 12, 2009

We're packing up, getting ready to go -- even though there hasn't been the
slightest hint of frost. When I loaded the metal sculptures into the bed of the
truck, I realized that it would be a good idea to cover them with a tarpaulin.
So down I drove to Main Street and to the recently enlarged Aubuchon. "Where
do you keep your tarpaulins?" I asked the young clerk. "What is a tarpaulin? 
I've never heard of it?"  "Never heard of a tarpaulin," I replied, taken aback,
"you use them to cover boats or cargo or the backs of trucks." "Oh," he said,
brightening, "a tarp," and he took me right there where the shelves were loaded
with blue "polytarps" -- canvas being virtually extinct, at least in our part of
the landlocked world.

The young feller didn't know the world "tarpaulin" and looked at me as if I
were some sort of pretentious snob. But "tarpaulin" goes right back to my
childhood -- it might be the first three-syllable word I ever learned. Not
that I was nautical, not in any sense a "tar." But when it rained at Ebbets
Field, the ground crew would roll out the infield tarpaulin and then we'd all
sit and listen while Red Barber and Connie Desmond chatted for an hour or so
until either play resumed or the game was postponed. "Tarpaulin" is not a hard
or obscure word -- certainly not to baseball fans who can remember when fields
didn't have roofs. But the big linguistic question is -- will the word tarpaulin
survive in all its glory or will it be truncated into a pathetic apocopic
monosyllablic shadow of itself?  Or will it be confused with the TARP, which is
a horse of another acronymic color. Troubled (or more accurately, Toxic) Asset
Relief Program.

Well, I bought the "tarp"  -- not at Aubuchon, which didn't have the right size
-- but down at the Farm-Way. So now we're one step closer to shoving off for DC
and then back home. I'm overwhelmed with pre-nostalgia.

Title: Updike -- Part IV
Date: September 13, 2009

The Updike-athon continues  Since my last report, I've read Museums and Women,
Bech is Back, In the Beauty of the Lilies, Rabbit Run, Rabbit Redux, Rabbit is
Rich, and Rabbit at Rest.

The good news:  Updike is fluent, a masterful stylist, a remarkable story-
teller, a distinguished craftsman.  He's original, entertaining, bold,
inventive.  The section of Beauty of the Lilies that describe Alma DeMott's
childhood in Basingstoke, Delaware is as good as anything I've read in years --
a truly classic piece of writing

The bad news:  Updike's characters have no heart  They're almost uniformly
small-minded, bigoted, hateful, unloving and, in fact, incapable of love.  The
novels are distressing and depressing.  And inconsistent.  The Rabbit quartet
is reputed to be Updike's masterpiece, but the long section about Skeeter in
Redux is a ludicrous mess, a total bomb, a failure that disfigures the entire
series

A reader who knew America only through the Rabbit series would be
convinced that Americans in the second half of the twentieth century were
selfish, money- grubbing, racist, entirely without culture, sex-obsessed,
alcoholic, uneducated, insecure, obnoxious, undisciplined and knowledgeable
only of TV trivia.  I suppose that there are such people -- but there are also
substantial citizens, artists and artisans, and good, functioning families. 
I must say that four large novels in the company of Updike's folk can wear a
reader down.  I think it's time to re-read Trollope's Palliser novels, where
there is villainy but also redemption.  I crave an antidote.

Title: Plastic Flowers
Date: September 15, 2009

Our property adjoins the old West Bradford cemetery. The two- or three-acre
plot of ground is the most visible remnant of the dairy, sheep and apple
community of  West Bradford, which was hacked out of the steep slopes above the
Connecticut river in the first part of the nineteenth century, peaked before the
Civil War, and then went into decline more than a century and a half ago. West
Bradford lost its post office address in the 1920s and its schoolhouse (if word-
of-mouth can be trusted) before W W II. We still have a few sheep and horses and
some beef cattle but also an ever-increasing number of commuters who head down
I-91 for their employment in Lebanon or Hanover.

The history of West Bradford can be read in the cemetery's gravestones. There
must two hundred of them. The oldest are made of local slate and are only a foot
or eighteen inches in height; these date from the 1820s. One or two of them
feature lugubrious, stunted iconic weeping willows which rain and wind have
rendered barely visible. The markers that date from the end of the nineteenth
century are larger, made of marble that was quarried thirty miles to the west of
us, and reflect the area's growing prosperity. They're laconic  -- just name
and dates -- and entirely bereft of adornment or decoration. They celebrate
the Baldwins and Cunninghams and Lows and Tebbetses who cleared these hilly
fields with horses and oxen and who left behind all those massive and beautiful
stone walls that snake and twist their way through lands that are once again
deeply forested. There are women buried here who have been denied even the brief
immortality that a grave marker affords: a man's name and dates and the notation
"his wife" or sometimes even "his wives."

Quarter-size headstones, numerous and unincised, attest to unbaptized infants.

There's a new part of the cemetery, still in use, which to my eyes is less
sturdy and more frivolous -- an emblem of a culture in decline. Just because
it's possible to laser a prancing reindeer onto a granite headstone doesn't
mean that it's a good idea to do so. How all those long-bearded and puritanical
Emersons and Pipers would have railed against such trifling?

A few years ago, one of our local Thurstons erected a pink granite stone with
a plastic cross epoxyed to its surface. The cross, it was said, was to be a
perpetual lantern -- lit until the end of time by some sort of device that
gathered energy during the day and discharged it at night. "Oh no," I thought
the first few times that I came home late at night and was greeted by a ruby
and unwinking polysterene crucifix, "how ugly, how tacky, how out-of-keeping."
Fortunately, the perpetual light only lasted a year or so before extinguishing
itself for good.

I rather enjoy having a cemetery is nearby. "Quiet neighbors," as they say
here. Our house lies halfway between the cemetery and the pond. It's satisfying
to be flanked by crucial symbols of life and death. My only quarrel is that
occasionally a visitor to the cemetery, perhaps a decayed descendant of one of
the pioneers, will pitch an old vase or some sun-faded plastic flowers onto
our land. I don't so much mind picking up a few pieces of trash as I object to
my property being used as someone's rubbish heap. It's disrespectful. But any
person who would think to commemorate his mother with polycarbonate or acrylic
geraniums will generally not be the most mannerly or ecologically sensitive of
souls.

One day, many years ago, I was sitting on the cemetery's split-rail fence with
D., a local farmer. We were chatting about the weather and such. He suddenly
swung around and pointed to one of the headstones: "That's the boy that died of
eating the crayons."

To honor both the visitors and the inhabitants of the West Bradford cemetery,
I've composed a country-and-western quatrain.

Remember me in marble and in granite;

Remember me with rose and lilies brave;

Remember me in sunshine and in shadow

But don't put plastic flowers on my grave.

Title: On Noise
Date: September 27, 2009

Even as my hearing deteriorates, I become more and more disturbed by excessive
noise.  For example: coffee shops, which in any sensible world, would be oases
of tranquility, have become positively uninhabitable. When I visit such a place,
I do so either to talk with a friend or to read silently.  I do not go to
be assaulted by what the tattooed, benose-ringed young staff fancies to be
"music" -- grating sounds amplified to 11 on the Nigel Tufnel scale.  And then
last week I went to a baseball game at one of the new stadiums where they have
embraced to the ultimate the philosophy of  the "total entertainment package,"
which means bright blinking lights, almost constant "music," and exhortations
on the giant scoreboard to "Get Loud."  But baseball, more than any other
sport, requires thought and concentration.  It's a subtle game, not enhanced by
distractions. And yet it seemed that very few of the spectators around me were
actually paying attention to the events on the field.  The noise forbade it. 
When our side's left fielder played a routine fly ball into a single -- an act
which would have provoked indignation and jeers at the low-tech Ebbets Field of
my youth -- the crowd remained preternaturally silent, reserving its roars for
the inter-inning "kiss-cam" and similar travesties.

Do we truly enjoy or are we simply inured to the noise that has become so
constant at the old ball game, in the restaurant, or even on the leafy suburban
street, where the egregious leaf-blower has become an oppressive commonplace.
(Why do we not ban a mega-decibel machine that is less efficient than the time-
honored and virtually silent broom)?

The noise of machines and the noise of amplified sound is a relatively new
phenomenon.  Until 1650 or so, no such sounds oppressed our ears. There was the
occasional thunderstorm, and there were church bells, and there was the clatter
of horse and coach on cobblestone streets  -- but there was nothing comparable
to the sea of noise in which we daily swim. Our ancestors lived for a million
years in a world that we would judge to be virtually silent.  There were no
factories, no trucks, no airplanes overhead, no electric guitars and, inasmuch
as 95% of the people were village-dwelling agricultural workers, not even large
crowds.  The noise that we routinely endure is unprecedented and unnatural. 
And unhealthy as well.

Title: Yellow Face
Date: October 06, 2009

"Yellowface" is the Asian equivalent of theatrical "blackface," as in the case
of Warner Oland (a Swede) or Sidney Toler (an Scottish-American) impersonating
Charlie Chan. "Yellow Face" is also the name of an uncharacteristic Sherlock
Holmes short story -- one that is unusual among Conan Doyle's compositions in
that no crime is solved nor none committed, and also because Sherlock Holmes'
overconfident deductions prove to be entirely erroneous.

Grant Munro has married a young widow, Effie Hebron, who returned to her native
England after her Atlanta husband died of yellow fever.  After some years of
blissful marriage, Effie begins to act most strangely;  she sneaks out to a
neighboring house in the middle of the night -- a house at the upper window of
which her puzzled husband catches sight of a strange and unnaturally immobile
yellow face.

After listening to Munro's narration, Sherlock Holmes confidently theorizes
that Effie's first husband did not die, but has secretly returned to England
to blackmail his erstwhile wife.  But when Munro, Watson, and Holmes break
into the house, they discover at the window not a husband come back to life
but a young girl, Effie's daughter, wearing a mask to conceal the fact that
she is a "little coal-black negress."  The mystery is solved:  Effie has
been behaving peculiarly not because she is seeing another man (as Munro seems
to fear) or because she is being blackmailed, but because she was afraid to
confess to her second husband that her former mate was black --  even though,
she proclaims,  "a nobler man never walked the earth."

And so the story proceeds to its climax.  How will Munro respond to the
revelation? Will he reject his wife, or embrace her?  "It was a long two
minutes [ten minutes in the first American edition!!] before Grant Munro broke
the silence....  He lifted the little child, kissed her, and then, still
carrying her, he held out his other hand to his wife, and turned towards the
door. 'We can talk it over more comfortably at home,' said he.  'I am not a
good man, Effie, but I think I am a better one that you have given me credit for
being.'"

"Yellow Face" is designed to be an uplifting story of tolerance and trust and
in truth it is extraordinarily progressive, even radical, by the standards of
1894.  But it's also a naive story.  It elides and dodges the complications
that it raises, especially about matters of race.  Is it credible, or is it
not more fear than fact, that a mixed-race husband and an English woman would
produce a "coal-black" offspring. Doyle's belief that such an engendering is
possible is a mark of the simplicity of his thinking about race.  Moreover,
there were strict "anti-miscegenation" laws in Georgia in the last part of the
nineteenth century. How did Effie and John Hebron manage to evade them?  In
what way did they live?  Hebron managed to leave a considerable estate to his
wife?  How did he achieve his wealth?

Doyle is interested in making a case for tolerance and he is interested in
Holmes.  But he does not much concern himself with the other characters that
he creates.  He does not explore the psychological costs for Effie when, as
she says, "she cut herself off from her race."  What prompted her to violate
so strong a taboo?  And why would a strong and independent woman suddenly
become so fearful when she re-married?  What did it cost her, emotionally,
to leave her child behind in Georgia where a dark mixed-race girl would be so
awkwardly situated?  How could she conceal so much of her history from Grant
Munro without overwhelming guilt?  How did she manage to achieve so blissful
a union with him while carrying many important secrets?  And what about the
poor child?  Born to an illegal union that is soon fractured by death, then
abandoned, then reclaimed and brought to a strange land -- and asked to wear a
yellow mask for fear the someone would be shocked by her pigmentation. Doyle
does not even broach the question of the damage to the child?   And what kind
of future can be in store for her in England?

Doyle seems to consider that "Yellow Face" concludes happily -- but does it?
While it is certainly to the author's credit that he is unfazed by the taboo
against "intermarriage," it is also true that he rests satisfied with easy,
superficial, and naive answers to hard questions. Or rather, he does not even
seem to realize that he has started a whole pack of hares in motion.

It's curiously negligent that Doyle does not even give a name to the "coal-black
negress."  She remains a plot-device, not a person.

It is equally odd that Doyle does not find fault with Sherlock Holmes' inability
to think past the convention of the genre, where blackmail is a commonplace. 
Intermarriage, Doyle seems to suggest, is so exotic, so unusual, that it would
not occur even to so brilliant a detective as Sherlock Holmes that a yellow mask
might hide a black face.

Title: Why I Love Health Insurance Companies, Reason # 453
Date: October 14, 2009

I hate to fetch the mail nowadays because there are so damn many importunate
communications from doctors, hospitals, from medicare, and from insurance
companies.  Even though I'm in relatively good health and need only routine
servicing, each time I visit a doctor the system manages to generate one piece
of paper after another -- most of them written in codes that are almost entirely
inexplicable.  Could anyone have devised a more lunatic, more inefficient
health-care system?

The other day I received a letter from Great-West Healthcare, my "supplemental
carrier,"  to this effect:

"We recently reviewed one of your claims and discovered that we mistakenly sent
you a benefit check for $31.80.  We now realize that payment should have been
sent directly to your provider.  We have reprocessed the claim to pay the
provider.  Therefore, this letter is a request for the $31.80 paid to you in
error.  Please send a check for $31.80 to the address on the back of this
letter.  If you have any questions, please contact our service center at the
number on the front of your health plan ID card.  Thank you.

Of course, there was no address on the back of the letter, so I could not
respond.

But if there had been an address, this is what I would have said:

Dear Great-West Healthcare:

Thank you for you letter of August 10.  I will be happy to refund the $31.80. 
However, I have no record of this transaction, so before I pay you, I need
the following data.

A copy of a cancelled check for the amount that you claim to have sent me.

Evidence that you have actually paid the funds to the unnamed "provider." 
This evidence should be in the form of a cancelled check but if the $31.80 was
sent as an electronic deposit, a notarized affidavit from an officer of the
"provider" will be ample.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call me at my home
phone number, which can be conveniently found in the local telephone book
or obtained online, so that I can play you some nice elevator music while you
languish on indefinite hold.

Thank you. Your call is important to us.

Title: Another Baseball Dream
Date: October 26, 2009

I have recurrent baseball dreams, most of them nightmarish. The most frequent
is that I hit a sharp line drive to right, start for first but run as if I were
stuck in a sea of mucilage.  My legs won't move. The right fielder throws
me out before I'm halfway down the line.  I leave the field in disgrace,
thirty- thousand fans vigorously booing.  What does it mean?  "I can't get
to first base" sounds like an adolescent sexual worry, but I suspect that such
an interpretation might be too specific. Let's just say that the theme of the
nightmare is ineffectiveness and frustration.

What a relief, then, that this World Series time I can report on a very pleasant
dream.  My team (Dodgers or Phillies or just a bunch of nameless guys) was
pounding the Yankees.  (Cultural context for you non-Brooklynites out there in
Bloglandia: the New York Yankees represent all that is evil in American society,
and have done so since the days of Joe Page and Snuffy Stirnweiss and Charley
Keller, or for some sixty-plus years.  There is no question but that the rich,
whiny, crybaby Yankees are the special favorites of Bernie Madoff, Ann Coulter,
and Dick Cheney.)  In the dream, my side hit one opposite-field line drive
after another and the score went from 5-0 to 13-0 to 17-0.  Finally, we brought
to the plate a cute, tow-headed four-year-old boy.  He blasted the first pitch
over the head of their center fielder and knocked in three more runs. I woke up
elated, and in an aroused condition that gave me confidence that, yes, I could
get to first base. Possibly to third base.  Perhaps even score.  .

Title: A Visit to a New Health-care Provider
Date: October 29, 2009

Today I went to see a new doctor, a specialist.  His receptionist sits
behind a sign that reads "Co-payment must be made at the time of service. 
Failure to pay the co-payment will result in an additional charge of $10."  I
took a seat to wait and to fill out various forms -- and to be apprised of
a "policy change":  "A patient who misses an appointment without canceling 24
hours in advance will be charged $45."  I read a little further:  "Extended
telephone conversations will be subject to a charge of $15."

I know that doctors have to make a living and I don't begrudge them a decent
wage.  But goodness gracious, must they transform themselves into shameless
nickel-and-dimers?

I want to have confidence in my doctor.  I want to think that he's the
heir to Aesculapius, Hippocrates, and Jean Hersholt. I don't want to think
that he's a money-hungry "provider" whose primary aim, transcending all others
(especially healing), is to squeeze me for a buck here and a buck there.

Which is in fact what I did think.  Not a good first impression, Dr. Provider!

Title: Updike's Gamble
Date: November 02, 2009

John Updike's novels are loaded to the ever-loving gills with invocations of the
most evanescent and ephemeral manifestations of "popular culture."  I can't
think of another writer who is so relentlessly fascinated by the most trivial of
things.  If his novels are to be read in a hundred years, they will not be
fully understood unless encrusted with extensive and elaborate footnotes.

"Roy has been carefully shaping can his Total mush into a kind of a pyramid with
the back of a spoon."  Who will understand the meaning of this sentence. 
"Total mush?"  I imagine a footnote:  "'Total' was the brand name of a fibrous
dry packaged breakfast food which, when liquids such as milk were added, could
be formed into a paste."

Here's another example.  Rabbit is musing.  "Biblical names.  Rachel,
Esther.  Not always.  Barbra, Bette."  And here's the putative footnote. "In
this passage, Harry muses about the names of Jewish women.  "Barbra" (sic)
refers to Barbra Streisand, a popular Jewish-American singer and actress of the
period.  Professor Harvey Wrongbody's assertion that "Bette" refers to Bette
Davis is clearly uninformed, as Miss Davis was not Jewish. "Bette" as Professor
Wrongbody should have known, references Bette Midler, a performer famous in her
day for impersonating Janis Joplin (see Index) in The Rose."

In the first few pages of Rabbit at Rest --  which is perhaps the most
consistently fine of Updike's novels, there are dozens or scores of allusions
that will test a future annotator's learning.  It's highly unlikely that with
the passing of generations anyone but specialists in late twentieth-century
Americana will be able either to identify or grasp the significance of  "this
guy Bundy who murdered dozens of women in dozens of states."  (Bundy?  Is that
King Kong Bundy?  McGeorge Bundy?  Al Bundy?)  Or have the least idea what
is meant by a "Cabbage Patch doll with its bunchy beige face" or the possible
thematic significance of "Cara Lott Gets Hot" or "Winn Dixie" or "Ekerd Drugs"
or the National Enquirer or "Planter's Peanut Bar" or "Melanie Griffith"
or "Deion Sander's recent arrest."  It's only twenty years since Rabbit at
Rest was published, and I was there, paying reasonable attention, but frankly,
I'm already becoming a bit vague about some of  the details.

If I were a novelist of Updike's talent, I would think twice about loading up on
trivia that cannot help but  barricade the novels from future readers.  But
perhaps Updike doesn't care.  Perhaps he's only interested in the moment and
in readers of his own generation.  To me, it seems as though he doesn't give a
royal fig for the future.

Shakespeare, a writer not for his age alone but for all time, occasionally
included references to fleeting phenomena.  I rather like it that he did so. 
I'd be intrigued to learn, once and for all, who was that "red-nosed innkeeper
at Daventry" to whom Falstaff refers.   But neither Shakespeare nor any other
writer with whom I'm familiar so saturated his work with multitudinous and
forgettable popcultch trivia.

But perhaps Updike has made the right choice.  Perhaps the density of reference
makes the novels so credible, so real, that scholars will be happy to annotate
and readers will revel and glory in the footnotes.

It's a gamble.  My guess is that it's a losing one, but time will tell.

Title: STAAS
Date: November 05, 2009

The woman with whom I've shared the last fifty-plus years has developed an
alarming new symptom.  She disappears in markets.

We'll be together, innocently pushing the basket in the vegetable section, for
example, and I'll wander off to fetch some cream cheese and a half-gallon of
milk.  When I return, she's gone.  Nowhere to be found.  I walk up and down
the neighboring aisles.  Nothing.  She's completely dematerialized.  I walk
up and down, back and forth, vainly searching.

After a twenty minutes, or half-an-hour, she's back, but teleported to an an
entirely different part of the store.  She doesn't even know that she has
vanished.  Sometimes she pretends that it's I who has disappeared.

I can understand that she could lose herself in the acre-and-a-half King
Soopers, or in the McGuckin prairie, or on the vast Costconian steppe.  But
in Bradford's minuscule P & C?  Or in Bradford's Main Street, comprised as it
is of far fewer square feet than any mid-size contemporary Walgreen's?  No,
there's more here than meets the eye.  This is no natural process.  Something
supernatural is going on.

It took some serious reflection before I came to the realization that it's a
clear case of abduction by aliens.  There is no other credible explanation.

I've given a name to the disorder.  I call it Spousal Transient Alien Abduction
Syndrome, or STAAS.

I've made some inquiries, and it seems that STAAS is not a condition found
only in my family.  In fact, it's quite common.  More than four-fifths of
the people that I questioned had experienced recent instances of STAAS. 
Curiously, it's much more frequently discovered in long-marrieds than among the
recently- hitched.  And less common among women than men.  In fact, men tend
to disappear for longer periods of time than women.

Moreover, just as might be expected, not a single one of the disappeared
remembers that he (or she) had ever fallen into the ungentle hands of aliens
-- which is certain proof that the abduction took place, inasmuch as it is
well known that these extraterrestrial beings possess the ability to scrub
human brains and obliterate memory.

I don't know what can be done to arrest the spread of this alarming syndrom   e.
Perhaps a Federal task forc                                                   e.

The Yankees 2009 payroll was $201,449,189, exceeding the next largest (the
Mets) by more than $50,000,000.  The median major league payroll was about
$80,000,000 and the lowest $36,834,000.  With 103 wins in regular season,
each victory cost the Yankees $1,955,810.  The other teams that made it
to the playoffs incurred considerably smaller but greatly varying costs per
win:  Boston Red Sox, $1,285,300;  Philadelphia Phillies, $1,215,097; Los
Angeles Angels $1,172,325; Los Angeles Dodgers, $1,056,995; St. Louis Cardinals,
$852,803; Colorado Rockies $817,402;  Minnesota Twins, $816,165.  Should
we be surprised that the Yankees could beat the Phils?  Given the numbers,
it would have been shocking if they couldn't.

Cheers to the Cardinals, Rockies, and Twins.

Cost per victory is a measure of management efficiency.  By far the most
effective 2009 team, dollar for dollar, was the frugal Florida Marlins, who won
87 games at a cost of just $423,379 per win.  On the other end of the scale,
the woeful New York Mets, with just 70 successes, were the only team to pay more
per win than the Yankees.  It cost the Mets $2,133,910 each time that they
walked off the field in triumph.

As long as the Yankees are allowed to pay salaries one-third larger than
their nearest competitors and two and a half times more than the median, it must
be expected that they will win regularly  -- which is why I'm for rigorous,
enforced parity.  Let's level that playing field.

And with all that money, how to account for the fact that the Yankees sported
such an entirely run-of-the-mill outfield.  Melky Cabrera?  Nick Swisher? 
Gosh, there must be better players than those to entice to the brand new
ballpark.

Which brings us to the next spending spree. free-agent outfielders wanted. 
Must be able to hit the short porch. Bring joy to the eyes of George S.

Title: ADH2*2 in My  Life
Date: November 16, 2009

I can't drink wine, beer, or spirits. Alcohol of any kind, no matter how
sophisticated or elegant, makes me ill. In this respect, I'm similar to my
father and to one of my sons. People who know me only slightly  imagine that
I am unsociable or ascetic. Or that I'm a recovering alcoholic. In fact, I
suffer from an inherited disability.

Now at long last the culprit gene has been fingered. It's ADH2*2, "a rare
variation of ADH2, which produces a more active form of alcohol dehydrogenase,
the enzyme that catalyzes the first step in alcohol metabolism."

Alcohol dehydrogenase? There are more than a sixpack of them: "alcohol
dehydrogenases are a group of seven dehydrogenase enzymes that facilitate the
interconversion between alcohols and aldehydes or ketones with the reduction of
NAD+ to NADH...." More succinctly, "they break down alcohols." I don't know
whether ADH2*2 digests alcohol too fast, or too slow, or just idiosyncratically,
but the effect on me is stomach-ache, headache, and general queasiness. Wine,
"the merry cheerer of the heart," sours my digestion.

The eccentric allele occurs in 20 to 30 percent of Jewish populations
"suggesting that ADH2*2 is one of the factors explaining the low rates of
alcoholism in this group." Recent investigations have demonstrated "significant
relationships between ADH2*2 and alcohol use ... in all Jewish groups studied."
"Those with the variant gene have been seen to drink less frequently, consume
less alcohol overall or have more unpleasant reactions to alcohol."

This analysis makes perfect sense to me, but Science is apparently unsatisfied:
"the exact reason why ADH2*2 tends to discourage heavier drinking isn't known."
Well, Science, let me see if I lend a hand here. If you get sick rather than
high from a few sips, you stop drinking -- unless you're a complete and total
Schmuck."

Perhaps because I'm a teetotaler (though a reluctant one), I have little
tolerance for drunken excess. I'm not amused by loss of inhibition, by sloppy
speech, or by too-loud staggering enthusiasm. I've honored my father's warning
-- "never get into an argument with a drunk" -- to the letter. In actual fact, I
try very hard not to engage the alcoholically-addled in any discussion, whether
serious or flippant.

I regret that I can't participate in wine-tastings -- the stuff looks and smells
so good. But even there, I'm skeptical of the poetic language that oenophiles
employ -- hints of rubber and raspberries and old leather and that sort of
hyperbole. I tend to sniff deeply, and then proclaim, "tumescent but not
rigid."

It's not hard to be witty when you're sober and your Falernian audience has been
quaffing the pinot grigio.

I did so write a check to register the car, it turns out, but since we have
changed our residence, the registration certificate and the little adhesive
tab that you're supposed to fix to the license plate never arrived here, and
of course I forgot all about the legality of the vehicle. Had no idea. The
upshot is that while driving to the airport, I was stopped by a police guy who
was lurking in the shadows to pounce on malefactors such as I. I was issued an
expensive ticket. Very annoying. I'm generally a law-abiding citizen and I'm not
used to being in trouble with the authorities.

Not immediately able to figure out what went wrong, I hustled down to the Motor
Vehicle Bureau out there on 33rd Street. I took a number, sat down and rehearsed
what I would say to the clerk on duty. All I could think of was, "I need help."

When my number was called, I walked up to the designated clerk, a woman of
uncertain age. The sign on her desk said, in rather large letters, "Rhonda." And
so I did it. I couldn't help myself. I said, "Help, help me Rhonda." And then,
of course, I was immediately chagrined. "I'm sure you hear that all the time,"
I apologized, admitting to my appalling banality. "Not all the time," she said,
"but often enough."

It could have been even worse. I could have declaimed the entire poetic chorus
to the Beach Boys' 1965 hit:

Title: Sons of Ham, Sons of Japheth
Date: November 23, 2009

In Caroline Hentz's The Planter's Northern Bride (1859), Eulalia, the daughter
of a New England abolitionist, has married a slave owner and traveled with him
to his home in Georgia.  Here's what she sees. Warning: be prepared to be
shocked and revolted.

"All around, far as the eye could reach, the rich rolling fields of cotton,
bearing the downy wealth of the South, stretched out a boundless ocean of green,
spotted with white, like the foam of the wave.  Soon returning in grand march
from the fields, came the negroes, poising on their heads immense baskets,
brimming with the light and flaky cotton. Little children looking very much
like walking semicolons, toddled along, balancing their baskets also, with an
air of self-importance and pride. Eulalia recollected all the horrible stories
she had heard of negro insurrections, and thought what an awful thing it was
to be at the mercy of so many slaves, on that lonely plantation. When she saw
her husband going out among them, and they closed round, shutting him in as
with a thick cloud, she asked herself if her were really safe. They gathered
around him, eager to get within reach of his hand, the sound of his voice, the
glance of his kind, protecting, yet commanding eye. More like a father welcomed
by his children than a king greeted by his subjects, he stood, the centre of
that sable ring. She had never seen him look so handsome, so noble, so good.
As she looked at her husband, standing in their midst, the representative of
the fair sons of Japheth, wearing on his brow the signet of a loftier, nobler
destiny, every lineament and feature expressive of intellect and power, and
then at each of that dark, lowly throng, she felt a conviction that freedom, in
its proudest latitude, education with its most exalted privileges, could never
make them equal to him. She never dreamed that slavery could present an aspect
so tender and affectionate. Do the hundreds and thousands buried in the black
coal-pits and wretched dens of Great Britain, who have never heard, in their
living graves, of the God who created, the Saviour who redeemed them, pass their
sunless lives in greater comfort or fuller enjoyment."

Hey, it's good to be a slave. Apparently. "Tender and affectionate????

I was aware that there were anti-Uncle Tom's Cabin novels, designed to showcase
the glories of slavery, but I had never read one. The Planter's Northern Bride
is supposedly one of the best of the genre. It has the power to make you despair
for the intelligence of the entire human race. Some samples:

"Merry voices singing in the fields of labour or filling up the pauses of
toil...."

"The joyful songs and exhilarating laughter of our slaves...."

"The negro has an intense appreciation of beauty and grace, and feels the
influence of mental superiority."

"You will see the negro, not as he is at the North, an isolated, degraded being,
without caste or respectability, a single black line running through a web of
whiteness, but surrounded with the socialities of life, and though doomed to
labour, yet free from the cares and anxieties that rest so heavily on us."

Here are the words that Caroline Hentz puts in the mouth of one of Eulalia's
slaves.

"I tell you what, Crissy, when de nigger have good massa and good miss, dey well
off. When dey have bad massa and missis, dey bad off. Talk 'bout us being on a
'quality with white folks, no such ting. De Lord never made us look like dem. We
mustn't be angry wid de Lord, for all dat: He knows best, I 'spise. Look a'me,
black as de chimney back, -- dey, white as snow; what great, big, thick, ugly
lips I got, -- dere's look jist like roses. Den dis black sheep head, what de
Lord make dat for?  Dey got putey, soft, long hair, just like de silk ribbons.
Now look at dat big long heel, will you?" added Judy, putting out her bare foot
in the moonshine, giggling and shaking;  "who ever saw de white lady with sich
a heel as dat?  I do wonder what the Lord made us nigger for? I spect de white
dust gin out, and he had to take de black."

Slavery deformed society.  Arguments in support of slavery deformed the
intellect. The attempt to find supernatural sanction for slavery perverted
religion. Slavery incapacitated the slaveholding states. One hundred and fifty
years after slavery, they have still not caught up and they are still pulling
the country down.

Does Caroline Hentz believe the words that she puts on paper?  I believe she
does. I believe that she makes these observations and arguments with total
sincerity. I also believe that the kind of utterances to which she gives vent,
though no longer respectable, no longer made in public, are not dead but
continue to appear in VFW halls, in bowling alleys, in union halls, and in truck
stops all over the land of the free and the home of the brave.

So, a couple of days ago, we were watching some basketball on the HDTV, and

a few seconds, I screamed, "Holy moley, what in the living heck has happened to
me?"  Is it now the case that the outer limit of my once-voracious imagination
is a cup of decaf tea and two prunes?  So embarrassing, so downright geezerish.
What ever happened to ice cream sundaes with Fox's U-Bet and real whipped cream,
to rich and gooey lasagna, to late-night salami sandwiches on deli rye (not

eating. Ou sont les pepperoni pizzas dantan?  Where are the bacon cheeseburgers

Title: A Further Note on Nineteenth-Century Horsedrawn Vehicles
Date: November 29, 2009

Modern readers of the great classic novels of the previous era generally have
no clue about the significance of horses and horse-drawn vehicles. As I wrote,
right here on this blague a couple of months ago, "no, I'm not obsessed, it's
just that I have this little bee in my bonnet about the fact that we gasoline-
era moderns understand the exact social significance of jeep, Jaguar, Jetta,
and jalopy, but we are, except for specialists, utterly clueless as to the
valence of barouche, basket carriage, berlin, britchka, brougham, buckboard,
buggy, cabriolet, caleche, cariole, carryall, chaise, chariot, clarence, coupe,
croydon, curricle, cutter, daumont, dearborn, diligence, dog-cart, fiacre, fly,
four-wheeler, gig, go-cart, governess cart, hansom, jaunty car, jersey-wagon,
kibitka, landau, phaeton, post-chaise, rockaway, shandrydan, shay, spider-
phaeton, spring-van, stanhope, sulky, surrey, T-cart, telyezhka, tilbury,
tarantass, trap, troika, victoria, vis-a-vis, wagonette, and wurt."

What does it tell us when our hero arrives on the scene in a wurt?  Does it
mean that he is rich and stylish, or vulgar and pretentious, or tasteless, or
downtrodden.  We don't know, and so we read our own traditional literature with
one hand tied behind our backs.

Well, I though that I had made my point, and I thought also that I had exhausted
the list of nineteenth-century horse-drawn vehicles. But then I came upon
this passage in Edith Wharton's The Age of Innocence (a truly splendid novel
published in 1920, though the action is set in the 1870s).

They [Archer and Countess Olenska] walked back toward Beacon Street, and
near the club Archer caught sight of the plush-lined "herdic" which had
carried his note to the Parker House, and whose driver was reposing from this
effort by bathing his brow at the corner hydrant. "I told you everything was
predestined!  Here's a cab for us.  You see!"  They laughed, astonished at
the miracle of picking up a public conveyance at that hour, and in that unlikely
spot, in a city where cabstands were still a "foreign" novelty.

The novelty, the herdic, was "a kind of carriage invented by Peter Herdic
of Williamsport, Pennsylvania, in 1881" (so Wharton is guilty of a tiny
anachronism).  "A predecessor of the taxicab, the herdic was a small
two-wheeled carriage that had side seats and an entrance at the back.  Their
low entry made it easy for passengers to enter and exit the cars.  The first
herdics carried up to eight passengers.  The earliest herdics were painted
bright yellow."

Cheers to Peter Herdic, forgotten father of the Yellow Cab.

English teachers are such colossal jerks, at least whenever they appear in
movies. A case in point is Smart People (2008), which is the second-best
academic movie ever made in Pittsburgh (Wonder Boys is superior). Smart People
offers us a Carnegie-Mellon Professor of English, played by a shambling Dennis
Quaid, who is a depressed, angry, uncommunicative, and miserable being, and
who insults and patronizes both his students and his family. He's the perfect
embodiment of traditional and persistent American anti-intellectual stereotypes.
Book-learning has turned him into a mere grammarian, a pedant, who must learn
about "real life" from his rolling-stone, improvident, frequently-stoned but
streetsmart brother. Smart People is constructed around stereotypes that were
exhausted when Shakespeare created Holofernes and Sir Hugh Evans more than four
hundred years ago.

I've known a lot of English teachers -- some good, some bad -- but I've yet to
encounter the shallow stereotype.

English teachers make their way into a disproportionately large number of
movies. There are two reasons for this phenomenon. The first is that the writer
of the film wants to illustrate some thematic point, so he brings his characters
into a classroom where a pompous old fart or fartess can provide some cheap
laughs while explicating a poem or novel that is tangentially related to a point
the film is trying to make. The second reason is pure revenge. In films in which
English teachers figure, there's often --almost always, in fact -- a young man
whose writing is unappreciated by the narrow-minded professor. In Smart People,
he's the son of our own nasty hero, and his sparkling poem is published in the
New Yorker while his indifferent father is still waiting to hear whether his
critical-theory manuscript has been rejected yet once again. This character --
the brilliant but unappreciated young poet or playwright or novelist -- stands
in for the writer or director of the film, who is saying, in filmspeak, "look
at me now, you colossal jerk. I'm making movies and you're still back in high
school or at State U., grading freshman term papers. So there!!! That'll teach
you to give me a C+."

By the way -- Smart People is an intelligent, well-written film. I heartily
recommend it.

Title: Dinner Conversation
Date: December 06, 2009

A:  Do you remember Walter Peter, used to teach history at the university?

B.  Yes, he had quite the reputation.

A.  Lazy as sin, among other things. I was his grader in the late 60s. He never
looked at a paper or at an exam. When a girl would complain about a grade, I'd
tell them to go see Professor Peter. Some of them would, some of them wouldn't
dare. There was this one young nubile maiden, very beautiful. She had a D on
the mid-term and didn't show up for the final, so of course I gave her an F.
She was one of those who were willing to see Professor Peter in his office. I
never heard back from her but eventually I took a look at the grade sheet. He
had changed her grade from F to B.  I asked him, how come?

B.  Did you get any kind of explanation?

A.  He said, I talked to her, and I felt sure she would have gotten an A on the
final, if she had taken it, so I changed her grade. He said it with a straight
face.

B.  I wonder if he thought you believed him.

A.  I don't think he even cared.

B.  Let me tell you my favorite plagiarism story. I was handed a paper which
began, "Moreover...."  Student just took a couple of paragraphs out of the
middle of a chapter. Didn't even bother to change the first word.

A.  There's also the story of the student who handed in a paper with the bill
from the ghost writer still in it.

B.  Here's one I heard from Don Baker.  He was teaching in  Mississippi,
early in his career. Freshman English. He receives identical papers from two
students in the same class. He gives an A to one and an F to the other. This
would be in the 1950s sometime. The F student comes into his office.  He says,
"Uh, uh, Mr. Baker.  I have a friend in the class. I sometimes study with him.
He, uh, uh, handed in a paper, kind of, uh, you know, similar to mine."  Baker
says, "and." The kid says, well, he got a much better grade than I did."  Baker
says, or at least he swears he says, "Oh, but I like him. And I don't like you."

Title: The Chosen Zebra
Date: December 09, 2009

Ordinarily, I'm skeptical when supernatural images magically appear on everyday
objects. To me, such manifestations are perfectly explicable run-of-the-mill
instances of pareidolia.  [Pareidolia:  the tendency, inherent in the human
brain, to discover patterns (e.g. faces) in random markings.]  No matter how
intently I peer and squint, I simply cannot find the blessed virgin and her
child in the Ritz cracker. Nor in the stump of that felled yew in Donegal nor
in the water stain on the Samoan wall nor on the broken storm window in Jesup,
Georgia and certainly not in the miraculous bird dropping on the rear view
mirror of a pickup in Bryant, Texas. Not even in the revered and legendary 1978
Mexican tortilla. I am also willing to confess that although I haven't seen it
with my own eyes, I remain unpersuaded by the internationally-celebrated image
of Jesus in the partially-eaten toasted cheese sandwich that is reported to
have sold on Ebay for $28,000 and is now framed and publicly exhibited in the
Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino of Hollywood, Florida, where it amuses the
agnostics and wows the credulous.

In my conception, if the Ancient of Days had wanted to impress an image of his
very own filius unigenitus or of JC's tender and mild mom on breadstick or
bagel, cornbread or challah, he would have the made the representation clear
and distinct -- certainly not subject to dispute or interpretation or doubt or
skepticism. That's the way the Big Guy in the sky should operate when he's at
the top of his omnipotent game.

Which brings me to the illustration above, where, when you point and click, you
will encounter in sharp detail a  complete and perfect menorah incontrovertibly
etched, this Hanukkah season, on the port side of a zebra. No ifs, ands, buts,
or pareidolia.

Why a zebra, a creature not mentioned in the Holy Book?  Well, once again, the
L-rd moves in mysterious ways. If He chooses a zebra, who are We to question his
mighty decision?

Moreover, there's absolutely no question but that His menorah on a zebra beats
His Jesus on a toasted cheese sandwich all to heck.

Just sayin'.

Unless perhaps the Lord of Hosts uses photoshop?

Title: The Golden Age of Sex Ed
Date: December 17, 2009

I've been reading the novels of Edith Wharton. It's been one heck of a thrilling
experience. The Age of Innocence is a world-class masterpiece, as subtle a
novel as any that I've read in years, and The Buccaneers, which Wharton left
uncompleted at her death, is almost as good (fortunately, she left behind a
plot summary so we know how it was to conclude. Edith, couldn't you have hung
on for just a few more weeks?!) In addition, I was dazzled by The Reef and
The Children. Also a couple of volumes of short stories. I'm now reading the
very intriguing Glimpses of the Moon. And all the while, I'm wondering how I
could have passed over all this great stuff in my first seventy years and still
considered myself a serious reader. Wharton wrote forty books and I think that
until this month I had only read The House of Mirth, which, it turns out, is her
most notorious but not her finest work. But I'll give H of M another chance --
when I come to with new perspective.

Edith Wharton and her great contemporary Henry James are often bracketed  --
both of them upper-class New Yorkers and writers of "psychological" fiction.
I suppose there's some justice to the comparison, but I prefer to think of
Wharton's works as a culmination and also a critique of the great Victorian
novelistic tradition. One (of many reasons) is that nineteenth-century fictions
often revolve around the keeping of secrets. In the archetype, Mr. A loves Miss
B, and Miss B loves Mr. A, but some sort of social constraint forbids them
to acknowledge or to speak their love until 450 pages have elapsed. Wharton
repeatedly brings these conventions out into the open in order to rip them to
shreds. She scrutinizes and satirizes the imprisoning systems of manners (as
well as conventions of fiction) that the earlier era left unchallenged.  She
punctures taboos.

The secret that underlay all of those punishing proprieties was, in one form or
another, sex: sexual needs, sexual passions, sexual gratification. The godawful
messiness of it all.

When the twenty-three year old Edith Wharton was about to be married, she was
ignorant and terrified of sex (and this despite the fact that she was then
known, and I don't [and couldn't] make this up, as "Pussy" Jones ["Jones" as in
'keeping up with the Joneses', "Pussy" an affectionate diminutive certainly not
employed in its modern street-corner signification]). Like many another young
lady, she turned to her mother (in her case, Lucretia Rhinelander Jones, the
'best-dressed woman in New York') for advice.  The outcome was catastrophic.
So here it comes, sex ed in Victorian America, recollected in anything but
tranquility:

A few days before my marriage, I was seized with such a dread of the whole dark
mystery, that I summoned up courage to appeal to my mother, & begged her, with
a heart beating to suffocation, to tell me "what being married was like."  Her
handsome face at once took on the look of icy disapproval which I most dreaded.
"I never heard such a ridiculous question!" she said impatiently; & I felt at
once how vulgar she thought me.

But in my extremity of need I persisted.  "I'm afraid, Mamma---  I want to
know what will happen to me!"

The coldness of her expression deepened to disgust. She was silent for a
dreadful moment, then she said with an effort: "You've seen enough pictures and
statues in your life. Haven't you noticed that men are -- made differently from
women?"

"Yes," I faltered blankly.

"Well, then  ---?"

I was silent, from sheer inability to follow, & she brought out sharply: "Then
for heaven's sake don't ask me any more silly questions. You can't be as stupid
as you pretend."

The dreadful moment was over, & the only result was that I had been convicted of
stupidity for not knowing what I had been expressly forbidden to ask about, or
even to think of."

Poor dear Edith, our hearts go out to you and to all the maidens of the last
era. Her "heart beating to suffocation," her pathetic ignorant (not stupid, but
ignorant) inquiry, and the imperious mother hiding her embarrassment behind
an affectation of anger. O my!  Along with the ridiculous idea that furtive
(I'm sure) glances at "pictures and statues" could convey any bird-and-bee
information of value. Edith's derelict mom punted when she should have pulled
her goalie. She missed the "teachable moment." But then again, how do we know
what mamma Lucretia knew about sex. Perhaps she had nothing to offer. Perhaps
she was one of those Victorian ladies who was taught to lie back and think of
England (or, in her case, to think of Washington Square).

Pussy Jones's marriage to Teddy Wharton was a miserable failure. Some of Edith's
friends suspected that it was what used to be called a "mariage blanc" --
a marriage without sex. After twenty-eight years and, I'm glad to report,
a couple of fervent affairs, Edith divorced Teddy, by that time alcoholic,
manic- depressive, and institutionalized. Among her manuscripts Edith left an
unfinished pornographic fragment, Beatrice Palmato (which I have not yet read
but which is supposed to involve, double-eek!!!, father-daughter incest).

Edith Wharton's passage from unnaturally prolonged innocence to sexual
sophistication or perhaps even to sexual derangement summarizes, in little, a
big hunk of American social history. In the course of her lifetime, she had to
cope with revolutionary changes, and those changes provide the background for
some extraordinary and sometimes painful works of fiction.

So I will read on.

2007).

Title: The Entirety of My Career as a Nude Model
Date: December 19, 2009

A friend of mine was teaching a course in life drawing and was having trouble
finding models. He asked me if I'd be willing to donate an hour. Hey, it was
the drug-crazed 1960s (or perhaps early 70s) and I had long since put modesty
behind. So I agreed.

It was odd to be naked  among a roomful of the clothed. I was more sensitive
to drafts than I would have guessed. It was difficult to remain motionless,
especially with all the houseflies a-lighting on the sensitive areas. It was
peculiar and a little flattering to have so many pairs of eyes fixed upon me.
However, my clearest memory is the student, a young woman, who at the end of the
hour, asked the teacher, "Next week, could you try to find someone with a more
interesting body?"

December 20.  I now realize that, bodywise, I have become more interesting over
the last forty years -- if interesting means lumpy, wrinkled, and asymmetrical.

Source: 2009/12/silliest-word-

Title: The Silliest Word in the Entire English Language, Bar None
Date: December 23, 2009

To decide upon the language's silliest word, many would steep themselves into
the gallimaufry that features such sesquipedalian monstrosities as mollycoddle,
liripoop, and kinnikinnick, but in my view such words are no more than flagrant
tomfoolery. (In point of fact, almost every word seems silly, if you just say
it over and over again, especially spoon, swivel, and sluice [just in the s's
alone]). A more promising category in which to delve is among those words that
ought, from their sound, mean something entirely other than they do, as for
example turdiform, titmouse, cacoethes, antimacassar and crepuscular. Some
words are silly because it is inherently ridiculous that their combination of
consonants and vowels should mean anything at all: usufruct, zeugma, ginkgo and
glebe fall into that unlovely grouping.

As a child, I thought that the silliest word in the English language was
"pumpernickel," but now I can make more mature judgments. I therefore announce
that the second most ridiculous word in English -- the penultimate -- is
"indubitably."  "Indubitably" is composed of a series of staccato syllables
that can only be spoken by a duchess, or a dandy wearing a tuxedo and a
monocle  -- or perhaps even a lorgnette. I have never heard anyone utter the
word "indubitably" with a straight face. It's a word that is intrinsically
litotic.

And now, after decades of pondering, I proclaim that the grand champion silliest
word in the English, and of this there can be no shadow of doubt, no possible
probable shadow of doubt, is: ointment.

The evidence?  Well, first of all, there's that wayward "oint." Except for
"oil" and oil-related words (oiler, oily), there are very few English words
that begin with "oi" --and for good reason. "Oi" lacks the dignity of more
imposing vowels. It's an unstable gliding sound, hard to fix in the mouth,
almost thriphthongic.  Moreover, "oint" comes perilously close to "oink" and
therefore reeks of the piggery. To couple "oint" with "ment" is to augment the
awkwardness. Most words that end in "ment" make obvious sense: battlement,
pavement, amazement, advancement. If the "ment" in ointment is such a suffix,
what, pray tell, is an "oint"?  And then there's that foolish near-congruence
of the first and second components of the word --its perfect and quintessential
spondeehood -- exaggerated by slant rhyme and the awkwardness of "nt"/"nt."
Altogether, "ointment" is indubitably absurd.

Etymology offers no solace. The silly thing came to us through Old French
"oignement" from late Latin "unguimentum" and from classical Latin
"unguentum."  "Ointment" may ultimately derive from an ancient root for butter.
Just as might be suspected, that first ludicrous "t" is an accident, having been
smuggled in, by analogy, from "anoint."

When Jean Lundegaard bites Gaear Grimsrud on the hand, he grunts, famously,
"Unguent, I need unguent." One hesitates to suggest an improvements to classic
dialogue, but, tell the truth, wouldn't the scene have been even funnier and
more memorable if Gaear had muttered, "Ointment, I need ointment?"  Especially
if the tip of his tongue had landed plosively on both of the lingual-palatal
stops?

Title: "His Meanest Garment."
Date: December 28, 2009

I was all alone for a week or so.

I'm not what you would call a spiffy dresser, even on the best of days, and
perhaps, solitary, I was even less attentive than usual to my presentation.
It is possible that I had neglected to comb my hair and it is also possible
that I hadn't shaved for a few days. I do know for sure that I was wearing my
favorite, familiar blue sweatshirt, the one with the hood, which is perhaps
fifteen years old and a trifle faded. It may even have had a stain or two on its
sagging front -- perhaps jam or spaghetti sauce or something equally tasty. The
veteran sweatshirt may also have been slightly frayed at the sleeves -- but it
is, or was, in my opinion, a very wearable garment.

In any case, one morning last week I took a walk over to Breadworks, my
favorite establishment for day-old muffins. I set down my notebook, which is, I
admit, slightly chewed, on a vacant table, noting that the next table over was
occupied, but at that moment only by a plate of eggs and a cup of coffee, the
customer no doubt hunting up more food or making a quick trip to the bathroom.
I dug into a stack of used newspapers, came up with yesterday's Camera and sat
down to read.

And then my putative neighbor, the young woman who must have previously claimed
the next table, returned. She took a long look at me. I smiled slightly, as one
does in such situations.  She quickly gathered her plate and coffee and moved
to a vacant table three over from me.

Oh my gosh! I know exactly what she was thinking. "Homeless." "Loathsome."

How awful it must be to be regularly and unapologetically shunned!

My daughters have been visiting this week. I hadn't even mentioned this
incident, but they independently took one look at my well-worn-in stained
garment and quite spontaneously trotted off to Army-Navy store just off the
Pearl Street Mall and came home with a brand new Carhart sweatshirt, which after
a few years of use will become a new favorite. The old blue friend-of-long-
standing is in the rag bag.

I can now I enter any coffee shop in our fair city and proudly rejoin the
respectable citizenry. Or should I say the fastidious citizenry?

Reading at one of our local Starbucks, I was, as is often the case, lost in my
book. But I looked up when a late 20s-early 30s blonde and bearded man sat down
at a table across the way. I noticed that he was holding his cup of coffee in an
odd way. And then I realized that where his right hand should have been there
were a pair of stainless steel hooks. Sad, I thought. And yet he seemed cheerful
and optimistic. I wondered if I would be in such good spirits if I had lost a
hand in an accident. I went back to reading, but looked up again when he fumbled
with the sleeves of his jacket. And then I saw that he had no left hand either.
Instead, a  pair of hooks, left and right, where hands and fingers should be.
What terrible accident could have caused a young man to lose both hands, I
wondered. Perhaps I was more sensitive than usual, but I was moved almost to
tears as I watched him manipulate his coffee and his napkin and his muffin with
his mechanical prosthetics. Soon his young and attractive girlfriend joined him.
She came on aluminum crutches. "Must have broken her foot," I thought. Then I
saw that there was no foot and that she had only one leg.

I'm slow, but I figured it out at last.

Soldiers. Home from Iraq. Bombs -- IEDs --  took off his hands and her leg.
They met at a rehabilitation hospital. Fell in love. They're trying to start
life over again.

I'm not ashamed that I turned away and started to cry.

And then grief converted to anger.

That damned useless war! That idiot ignoramus Bush! That villain Cheney!. Those
two megalomaniacs, and their co-conspirators,  who started this war -- they're
sitting pretty right now, aren't they? But these young folks right next to me --
they're not sitting so comfortably. They've paid the price.

Belatedly, I wish them all the joy that life can offer. As for crazy George and
strutting Dick, there's no penalty that they can pay, there's no retribution
sufficient -- but if their pernicious bodies would rot half a centimeter a day,
why, that would be a start.

Title: Well-aged Outrage
Date: January 04, 2010

Another day, another solicitation  from Cornell, the university that I attended
back there in the Bronze Age 1950s. I've got to admire their tenacity -- they've
been holding out the tin cup for fifty years and I've never dropped in a nickel.
Not even a copper.

Why so negligent? Well, there are a number of reasons. The first, and probably
most important, is that I took my education so seriously that I became a
teacher, and as a result,  I never accumulated the kind of dough that would
make the least impression on a multi-billion dollar endowment. A second reason:
I sent my daughter to Cornell during the 1980s (at what now seems like the
bargain rate of only $20,000 - $25,000 a year), and the total four-year cost of
her stay was a sufficient contribution to the ole alma mater. And finally, other
causes felt more pressing (last year, for example, Obama, and this year, helping
to keep our state legislature blue). But these reasons are mere rationalization
and excuse, for, truth to tell, I bear a grudge against Cornell. Let me unclasp
a secret book and tell you about it.

In my first year at Cornell, I shared a room in an all-freshman dormitory. It
was not gracious living, but I hadn't expected it to be. Cinder-block walls,
composition floors, cheap extruded-aluminum furniture. Worst of all, the doors
were fragile, hollow-core, and were always busting. I busted one -- I slid a
piece of furniture and sliced a hole into the 1/8" plywood sheathing of Room
2117. (Whose brilliant idea was it to put fragile doors in the way of a thousand
adolescent males?) Anyway, some guys came to fix the hole, which they did by
gluing a 2" by 6" piece of plywood ONTO THE SURFACE OF THE DOOR. Talk about
craftsmanship!

But here's the rub. I was billed $10 for the so-called repair. $10.00?  Not so
much, you say?  Well, I was then employed at $1.25 an hour, so the perfunctory
repair, which couldn't have taken five minutes to complete, represented the
before-tax wages of a full day's labor. (Further context: the rent for my half
of the room was $315 for the 32-week school year, or less than $10 a week.) 
Plus the bill was sent directly to my father, who was scrimping to send me
whatever bucks he could afford and didn't need to know that I had wasted $10
laying waste to the elegant decor.

I was outraged. I'm still outraged.

Hey, Cornell. Make it up to me. Do the right thing. When you've contrived an
apology and a recompense, well, then, maybe we can start to talk about possible
donations.

Before Grandma died, she specified cremation and asked that her ashes be divided
between the graves of her husband Dan and her daughter Phyllis. Now the time has
come to fulfill the first half of the assignment. We'll fly to NYC later this
month. We'll make a pilgrimage to the Baron Hirsch cemetery on Staten Island,
scatter a portion of the ashes, leave behind a ceremonial stone or two, and
think thoughts as positive as the occasion will allow.

However, in the light of the Detroit plane incident, I'm concerned about
carrying a box of white powder on board. Am I paranoid? is it completely nuts to
imagine that some vigilant but misguided TSA employee will take a gander at the
ashes and think "anthrax" or "explosives." Take me into that little room where
they peruse your "body cavities." And then on to Gitmo.

Apparently, I'm not the only person with this worry.

"Passengers are allowed to carry a crematory container as part of their
carry-on luggage, but the container must pass through the X-ray machine. If the
container is made of a material that generates an opaque image and prevents
the security screener from clearly being able to see what is inside, then the
container cannot be allowed through the security checkpoint." Is our container
sufficiently transparent? How would one know?

Instead of carrying the ashes aboard, why don't we just check them through?

"Some airlines do not allow cremated remains as checked baggage so please check
with your air carrier before attempting to transport a crematory container
in checked baggage." Why would United Airlines care whether I put ashes in
my bags?  It's obvious -- they lose the luggage and then we sue them for
zillions.  How about if I promise not to sue?

I'm going to guess that it's not a good idea to sew the "cremains" -- hideous
neologism -- into my underwear.

OK, here's the plan.  We take a symbolic portion the ashes, secure it in a
transparent ziploc baggie, and insert a visible all-caps large-font note: "These
are Grandma's ashes. They are not dangerous. Feel free to examine or to sample."

Incidentally, I can offer no confirmation to the rumor that the Department of
Transportation plans to ban all underwear. Or that it will insist that underwear
be worn on the outside. These are vicious canards.

A friend of long standing (a Shakespeare scholar) has posted a recipe for a
dish that she calls grieven but which was known as gribbinis in our part of the
world. It was a staple of my childhood, perhaps even my favorite food. Gribbinis
also linked me to my grandma. Inasmuch as she didn't speak the only language I
knew, it was natural and appropriate for us to bond over food.

"Accumulate a cup or two of chicken fat. Render the fat in a pan with about an
equal amount of chopped onion. Slowly heat the fat and onions over a low
flame, being careful not to let the mixture ignite. The onion will turn golden,
then brown, and some of the fat will become crisp."

My friend suggests serving the resulting mixture over mashed potatoes,
but for grandma and me the preferred vehicle was a hefty portion of about 3/4
grated black radish and 1/4 onion--along with some black bread to sop up the
grease. I thought it was a delicacy for a king, not knowing, then, that it was a
dish for an impoverished  peasant in a Ukrainian shtetl.

Black radish? Not a vegetable familiar to you? Black on the outside, white on
the inside, turnip-size. Very, very, very, pungent. Not widely used here in
North America, nowadays, but apparently still common in eastern Europe, where
mouths are more acclimated than ours to allyl isothiocyanates.

Whenever I'm among folks who make a fetish of  food preparation, I fantasize
about taking them home and plunking down a trough-size trencher of black radish,
onions, and gribbinis.

Would that be hostility? Possibly, just the merest tad. Or perhaps just a need
to remind myself where I came from when, perchance, I find myself among tender
and exquisite palates.

Title: The Shop on the Corner
Date: January 11, 2010

From our window, looking left across the street, we can see a squat old cinder-
block building that sits diagonally on its corner lot.  I remember when it
housed a gas station, then a taqueria, and afterward, for at least a decade, an
import rug store that was always 'going out of business,' until, contrary to
all expectations, it went out of business. The building lay vacant for a year
or so, but now it's found a new purpose. It's a medical marijuana "dispensary."
(Marijuana, when used for the relief of pain or nausea, is legal in Colorado).

When we're curious, and willing to make the effort, we watch the arrival of the
chronically afflicted patients. The are uniformly youthful and they come by car,
on foot, on bicycle, on skates or skateboard or scooter. The only vehicle in
which they don't arrive is the wheelchair.

In fact, neither "our" dispensary nor any other dispensary bothers to pretend
that their product (aka stash) is anything but recreational. GreenLeaf Farmacy,
for example, advertises Kief Hash! at $25/gram. Boulder Wellness Center offers
"High Quality Medical Marijuana: Tinctures, Vaporizers, Ointments, Teas, and
More." TopShelf Alternatives competes at $10/Gram and with "your choice of 34
home grown strains. Edibles include Mile High Ice Cream." DrReefer specializes
in "clones." Boulder MM Dispensary is "an upscale establishment with high
quality medicine."  Colorado Patients First, "where compassion for patients and
quality of medicine comes first," offers "Sour Kush, Big Blue, Opium, AK-47,
Maui Mist, Jack White, and Pot of Gold." For each painful disease, apparently,
its own uniquely targeted variety of ganja. To judge by the exuberance of the
clientele, the "medicines" must be alleviating tons of pain.

How did it happen?  Some years ago, voters approved an amendment to the
state constitution legalizing the medical use of marijuana. The argument was
compelling (and I voted for it).  Marijuana mitigates chronic pain and also
minimizes the nausea that accompanies chemotherapy. Until this year, the state's
Department of Public Health had limited individual physicians to five such
suffering patients. But then a judge ruled that the constitutional amendment
did not impose such limits, and, in the words of John Milton, "all hell broke
loose."

There's no zoning (as with liquor outlets), no sin tax (because marijuana is a
prescription drug), and no decorum.

"The latest data from the Medical Marijuana Registry maintained by the Colorado
Department of Public Health and Environment shows that as of Dec. 15, 2009, 
a total of 820 licensed physicians had authorized medical marijuana for 15,800
patients. Of those 820 physicians, just 15 accounted for 73 percent of total
patients, and just five have authorized 49 percent of all recommendations."
There are now more than eighty marijuana dispensaries in our town. (There are
just ten traditional pharmacies.) It makes one wonder about the size of the
underground economy.

It's the Wild West -- unregulated, unbridled capitalism!  It's a growth
industry!

It's also massively hypocritical.

Why don't we just legalize marijuana, and then regulate and tax it the way we do
liquor and tobacco? Of course, neither liquor nor tobacco pays its way -- the
social cost of both drugs well exceed their revenues -- but that's a topic for
another day.

There are bills in the legislature to regulate the marijuana industry and
everyone knows that within a year there will be tight new restrictions. But
until then, we will much enjoy the scene at the corner store.

What would prompt a guy to dream that his carrots were growing upside-down?
Their abundant orange roots pointing straight into the air?  What point is my
dreamatorium trying to make?  In this particular nightmare, I'm absolutely
perplexed about photosynthesis. If they're upside-down, how do they..?

There's more. In the dream, my lettuce is growing right-side-up, but it's
encrusted with some sort of white stuff that forms a collar around the base of
the plant.

Courageously, I taste it. It's -- by gosh -- feta cheese. Salty, but still quite

Title: The "Motor" vs. the Horse
Date: January 18, 2010

Edith Wharton loved the "motor" but never lost her nostalgia for the horse drawn
vehicles of her youth.

A passage in A Backward Glance (1932) conveys the novelty and thrill of her
virgin voyage.

"There were no motors in 1903; but as a toy for the rich they were beginning to
appear. My old friend George Meyer was the owner of a magnificent specimen. I
had never been in a motor before, and could hardly believe that we were to do
the run from Rome to Caprarola and back (fifty miles each way) in an afternoon.
The car was probably the most luxurious, and certainly one of the fastest, then
procurable; but that meant only a sort of high-perched phaeton without hood or
screen, or any protection from the wind. I had the high seat like a coachman's
box. Off we tore across the Campagna, over humps and bumps, through ditches
and across gutters, windswept, dust-enveloped, I clinging to my sailor hat. I
spent the next days in bed, fighting an acute laryngitis. In spite of this I
swore then and there that as soon as I could make money enough, I would buy a
motor, and having a delicate throat, scoured the country in the hottest weather
swaddled in a stifling hood with a mica window, till some benefactor of the race
invented the wind-screen and made motoring an unmixed joy."

The early twentieth-century "motor" was hectic, prone to breakdowns, and
erratic. In contrast, the vehicles of Newport, Rhode Island of Wharton's
aristocratic youth were dignified and stately, as much for display as for
utility. "Young ladies, married or single, expected to be taken for an afternoon
drive by the master of the house. The vehicles of the fashionable young men
were either dog-carts (drawn by a pair driven tandem) or a high four-wheeled
conveyance called a T-cart, which was drawn by one big stepper, while the older
men drove handsome phaetons with a showy pair, and an impressive groom with
folded arms in the rumble. Carriages, horses, harness and grooms were all of the
latest and most irreproachable cut, and Bellevue Avenue was a pretty scene when
the double line of glittering vehicles and showy horse-flesh paraded between
green lawns and scarlet geranium borders."

"Dog-cart?" "Phaeton?"  T-cart?"  What do these words signify?  And moreover,
what the heck was a daumont, "preceded by outriders, which swayed gracefully on
its big C-springs to the rhythm of four high-stepping and highly-groomed horses,
a postilion on one of the leaders, and two tremendous footmen perched high at
the back."

Title: One Heck of a Big Miller
Date: January 22, 2010

The miller in The Miller of Angibault is, according to George Sand, really,
really huge. "The big miller descended, stretching, from his corn-loft, cracking
the joints of his long arms and legs. He was well-proportioned, robust, easy in
his movements, and strikingly featured. This specimen of the countryside was
remarkable for a region whose inhabitants are generally on the short side." 
How tall was this "tall miller?"

Nineteenth-century novelists rarely give us hard data, but George Sand provides
the exact measurement for this "specimen." "Grand-Louis" is exactly five feet
eight inches tall!

Le Meunier d'Angibault was written in 1844. It's in Thackeray's Pendennis
(1850), I think,  that one of the female characters is described as a "maypole"
of five feet four inches.

I wonder how tall Shakespeare imagined Helena -- the famous "painted maypole"
of A Midsummer Night's Dream.  Probably just as tall as the boy who played the
part, but how much would that be in inches?

Height is believed to have increased a centimeter a decade in western Europe
from 1850 to 1950.  Is it possible that the great heroes of antiquity --
Hector, Samson etc. -- were all under five feet tall?  My grandfather was just
a hair above five feet tall.

The average height of American males was 5' 8" in 1960 and is 5' 9 1/2" today. 
How tall would a Louis have to be today to be called Grand-Louis?

Title: A Visit to the Post Office
Date: January 25, 2010

Package to mail, so off I go to the post office. When I arrived, eight people
are on line ahead of me. I took my place. There were only two clerks on duty
and let me tell you they were not breaking any speed records. They were moving
as though through mucilage. If I had to guess, I'd say that they were working
at just above the speed in which all molecular motion ceases. Their pace seemed
carefully calibrated, as if in answer to the implicit question, "what's the
least possible amount of energy I can expend and still retain my job?"  There
was some grumbling on the line: "Only two clerks on duty!" It took me twenty-
five minutes but I completed my transaction. When I left, there were ten people
behind me, letters or packages in hand, shuffling and stamping their collective
frustrated feet.

How much time wasted?  Well, here were nineteen productive citizens taking
twenty minutes or half an hour to do five minutes worth of work. You do the
calculation. If there had been another clerk, and if the clerks were to move at
normal human speed, I would have been in and out in a flash. Multiply the TWF
(time waste factor) by all the post office stations in urban America. What an
astonishing, third-world loss of productivity.

The post office has been essentially privatized. It's not allowed to run a
deficit, so it cuts back on services and continues to raise the cost of mailing
an envelope. And makes people wait.

But it retains from its former incarnation the lifetime-employment uncivil-
service mentality. It combines the worst of free enterprise with the worst of
public ownership. It's a truly remarkable solution to the implicit question, can
we design a completely dysfunctional bureaucracy?

About a decade ago, some idealistic postmaster-general announced a campaign
to serve every customer within ten minutes of arrival. To that end, a large
clock was set in a prominent spot in the every office in the land (in ours, just
where the line commences).  A big PR fuss was made. About a year later, all
the clocks were quietly removed.  I wonder, where did they go. Does the USPS
maintain an old clock warehouse somewhere in central Nebraska? Or were they
discarded? Or taken home by the local postmasters. In any case, the campaign was
a total disaster. The system did not move.

The USPS didn't even do a good job of removing the clocks. When I stand in line,
I stare at a wire sticking out of the wall where a clock used to hang.  I stare
at it for ten minutes, for twenty minutes, for half an hour....

Title: Another Long Night
Date: January 27, 2010

Last night, I had a specific sense that I hadn't been sleeping in clover.
I worried for hours and I worried about everything. I started, I think, by
brooding on the inevitability of a comet striking the earth and extinguishing
life as we know it. From there I moved to the collapse of the ecosyste. The
earth will soon (in geological terms) be hot, waterless, and lifeless. In
the nearer future, monsoons, tornadoes, tsunamis, hurricanes and other "acts
of god" will occur with increasing frequency. My pillow was hot, and the bed
sheet somehow managed to tangle itself around my legs.  I worried about the
possibility of nuclear weapons or vials of botulism falling into the hands
of jihadists. I worried about the declining population of our swifts and
swallows, our frogs and toads, our bats and bees and about the certainty that
the Asian longhorn beetle is about to do to the maples what the blight did to
the magnificent chestnuts and the Dutch elm disease did to ulmus americanus. Not
to mention the wooly adelgid that is intent on making hash of our hemlocks. I
worried about the decline of the American economy, about the rebirth of bigotry
and know-nothingism among the Republicans and about the pitiful fecklessness
of the Democrats. I was working myself up to quite a state, sweating into my
blankets. What about our radical-reactionary-interventionist supreme court?
Oh my gosh, I forgot to worry about all those poor people in Haiti! At about
four in the morning, I switched to more local worries: my apical hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy, my increasing failure of memory, and my lifelong tendency
toward procrastination, once resisted but now re-emerging with a vengeance. I
reviewed the recent deaths and diseases among my age-cohort of friends:  --
K's polycynthemia vera, R's brain tumor, S's alcoholism, J's obstructed colon,
B's shingles, C's lung cancer, my brother's sudden death of stroke or embolism
or who knows what it was. I thought of the friends to whom I should have been
more kind, more concerned. I worried about my children and grandchildren, all
apparently thriving, but you never know. I fell in and out of sleep. I got up
and paced.

Toward dawn, I straightened the bedclothes, took a leak, ate some yogurt, and
tried again. I woke up in a cold sweat, having dreamed that I was painfully
plucking hairs out of my lips. Not hairs, exactly. More like boar's bristles.
And that every handful of bristles was infested with spiders and other verminous
insects.  Eew, hairy lips. How disgusting.

I did not worry about dying.

Death: no more nightmares, no more insomnia, forever.

Title: Reposted:  Salinger
Date: January 28, 2010

J. D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye is an anti-bildungsroman -- a "novel
of education" without the least shred of moral, intellectual, or spiritual
growth. Holden Caulfield, the novel's naive yet jaded narrator, learns
absolutely nothing either about himself or about life. Unable to profit from
his various encounters, he dismisses almost everyone he meets as "phony."
That one adjective, repeated incessantly and ad nauseam, might lead a reader
to hope that Holden will find authenticity somewhere in his horizon, but The
Catcher in the Rye is not a novel that rewards optimism.  It concludes with
a vision of Holden's pre-pubescent sister Phoebe going "round and round" on a
symbolic carousel-- going nowhere, it would seem -- and in a brief coda Holden
himself has been institutionalized and placed under the care of an unsympathetic
psychoanalyst. Nor does the whiff of Humbertism in the relation between Holden
and young Phoebe contribute any last-second learning or cheer.

Even in the 1950s, The Catcher in the Rye enjoyed a cadre of fiercely loyal
partisans who powerfully identified with Holden Caulfield. I didn't believe
then, and certainly don't believe now, that Holden mirrored the anguish of my
own particular soul. I was not a true believer, and I was not entranced by
Holden. For me, the novel was nothing more than a better-than-average coming-of-
age story -- although a dispiriting one because Holden Caulfield does not mature
but instead remains stranded in perpetual, painful adolescence.

A novel without hope, The Catcher in the Rye has become an inspiration for the
hopeless. In Los Angeles, in 1989, twenty-one-year-old Robert Bando shot and
killed a young actress whom he had been pestering with trinkets and messages.
In a nearby alley, police found a .357-caliber handgun, a bloody shirt, and
a copy of The Catcher in the Rye. Two years later, John Hinckley shot and
crippled James Brady and almost succeeded in assassinating Ronald Reagan.
Hinckley had fantasized that killing the president would impress the actress
Jodie Foster, whom he imagined that he was wooing. In his pocket he carried
a well-read, tattered paperback of -- you guessed it --The Catcher in the
Rye. In 1980, on Manhattan's West Side, Mark David Chapman, concealing his
pistol under a copy of The Catcher in the Rye, shot John Lennon five times at
point blank. He had inscribed his copy of the novel with the words "To Holden
Caulfield from Holden Caulfield" -- Chapman had tried to legally change his
name to that of Salinger's troubled narrator. From jail, the proud murderer
issued an endorsement: "My wish is for all of you to someday read The Catcher
in the Rye."  At his trial Chapman asserted that he had killed Lennon because
the singer had become "phony," and at his sentencing he read to the judge the
section of the book in which Holden tells his sister Phoebe that he imagined
himself in a field of rye with "thousands of little kids" whom he must prevent
from falling off "the edge of some crazy cliff."

The Catcher in the Rye still sells well (15,000,000 copies in print by 1996) and
has become a fixture in the high school and college classroom, where successive
generations of adolescents can calibrate their degree of angst against Holden's.
But increasingly, and paradoxically, attention has turned from the novel to
Salinger himself, who has not published anything since 1965 and, secluded in his
Cornish, New Hampshire retreat, has become the world's most notorious hermit
since St. Simeon Stylites mounted his pillar in sixth-century Antioch. Although
he is a hermit, Salinger is anything but a saint. In 1987, in a bizarre echo
of Holden-obsessed stalkers, Salinger, then sixty-eight years old, flew to
California and barged onto the set of the TV show Dynasty in search of one of
the series's starlets, Catherine Oxenberg, with whom he had apparently fallen
into long-distance electronic infatuation. He was "escorted" off the set.
Did Catherine Oxenberg have a precursor?  She did, indeed she did. Several,
in fact, including Joyce Maynard, described as "the Lolita of all Lolitas,"
who was eighteen and a freshman at Yale in 1972 when Salinger, at the age of
fifty- three, initiated a romance by sending her a fan letter. These and other
even less savory details about Caulfield-Salinger's life can be found in Paul
Alexander's thin, amateurish biography Salinger (Los Angeles: Renaissance Books,
1999), which does not propose, although it might, that J. D. has learned as
little about life as his most famous character.

Title: Compliment/Complement
Date: January 29, 2010

Here is a sentence drawn from a contract for new condominium construction.
"The laundry room flooring is a composition tile called Stonewalk; it is a
warm light color that compliments all of the wood floor options." And here's a
second sentence from the same contract: "bedroom carpets are a warm light color
that compliments all of the wood floor options."  Compliments?  As every
schoolchild is taught, "to compliment" means "to praise."  The wording of the
contract therefore asserts that Stonewalk, a composition tile, speaks highly of
the wooden floor. The bedroom carpets join in the chorus of adulation. No doubt
that it's a praiseworthy floor, but are the warm light carpets and the warm
light tiles fully qualified to make so positive a determination?

Surely the highly-skilled and well-compensated lawyers who drew up the contract
meant to write (if they subscribe to conventional canons of usage) that "the
color of Stonewalk complements the color of the floors." That is to say, the one
color "completes" or "makes perfect" the other.

For example:  you may compliment the sommelier, but the sauvignon rouge
complements the rosbif or the biftek. Them's the official rules.

But should they be?  Is the distinction between compliment and complement
meaningful? Or is it pedantic and arbitrary?

What can history tell us about these twins?

In Shakespeare's Love's Labor's Lost, Don Adriano de Armado is "a refined
traveler of Spain..., /That hath a mint of phrases in his brain;/ One whom the
music of his own vain tongue/ Doth ravish like enchanting harmony;/ [He is]
a man of complements."  But is a "man of complements" a courteous man who
offers gratuitous compliments, or is he rather a fulfilled or a complete man. 
Clearly, Shakespeare's word conflates the two meanings. A second example, this
one from King Lear:  "There is further complement of leave-taking between
Burgundy and [Lear]."  Does "complement" mean, "politeness" or "formal
civility," which would be "compliment";  or does it mean that Burgundy and Lear
have finished or completed or brought to perfection their parting sentences? 
Once again, both meanings are possible. Examples of such blurring can be
multiplied. Falstaff (in The Merry Wives of Windsor) says this: "I see you are
obsequious in your love and I profess requital to a hair's breadth; not only,
Mistress Ford, in the simple office of love, but in all the accoutrement,
complxment, and ceremony of it."  Complement, compliment; take your pick. 
Either is possible;  both make perfectly good sense.

It's obvious that the doctrinaire distinction between the spellings has been
imposed since the time of Shakespeare. In fact, the dictionaries tell us
that the introduction of a second, separate word is an example of learned
Frenchification. OED:  "Compliment (Fr) is a doublet of complement (the form
directly from Latin). The latter was in use before the introduction of the
French form, which slowly took its place between 1635 and 1715." The twins have
been, and still are, closer in meaning than traditionalists allow (which is why
the condo contract writers got it, so to speak, "wrong").

What to do?  My suggestion: let's overleap the conservatives and embrace the
truly reactionary. Let's declare that from now on, "compliment" and "complement"
are, just as they used to be, one and the same word.  No more racking the
brains over "i" and "e," no more anxiety, no more guilt.

Let the word go forth that from this moment on, tiles and carpets are free to
complement or to compliment floors -- just as they prefer.

Title: This Old House
Date: January 31, 2010

"It was irresponsible for me to have bought this house," he thought. "And yet
it is so glamorous, so desirable.  I should have inspected it more closely. 
There are many parts of the building that I've never even looked into. Take
this room, for example.  It's far too long and narrow to be useful  I must
have been attracted to the bookshelf and to the books. But now that I look
closely, I see that the books are tattered and  worthless. I thought that they
were valuable, but they're just thrift store discards. And the kitchen -- I
don't think it's functional. These hand-carved boards, which I thought were so
beautiful -- they obstruct the sink and the stove. I'll have to remove them. And
in this room -- what is it, a bedroom? -- the murals are nothing more than the
scrawls of children. What could I have been thinking? I have purchased a house
that is a shambles. It's going to cost me a fortune just to make it habitable.
Look, in the living room the wallpaper is pulled off and the lath is exposed.
And here, in the grand ballroom, there's been leakage around the window frames.
This huge fireplace is falling in. This passageway, which ought to go to the
nursery --it's been blocked off. And this sitting room has no outside wall. No
protection from the weather at all. The wind could blow right through. It was
self-destructive of me to buy this house. It's financial suicide. What could
have attracted me to it? Let's walk around the outside. There are entrances that
I didn't know existed. Anyone could come in. It's not secured; there are no
locks, no doors. And a garage -- but the garage floor isn't concrete or paved
-- it's just sand and rocks. And this outside wall, which I took for marble
or granite -- it's just old loose, cracked, unpainted stucco. The yard is a
complete wreck -- all concrete and razor-wire, nothing alive. Who's that strange
man prowling around?  Why was I attracted to this place?  Why do I still find
it alluring, despite everything that I know about it?"

Later, we all went for a drive in the mountains. It was cold and the roads were
completely covered with snow and almost impassable. We arrived too late for the
party. "Let's all meet at the Unitarian church," one of the other guests said.
"I'm going to kill me a chicken," said another.

Title: Insects, Drugs, Science Fiction
Date: February 08, 2010

In the course of their long evolution our insect friends solved the problem of
adolescence.While we humans grow ever so awkwardly from childhood to sexual
maturity, your efficient, clever insect larva merely sequesters himself for a
few weeks or months and then emerges as a completely fledged adult. No whining,
no rebellion, no pimples, no door-slamming -- one day a child, and then, presto,
a full member of society. There's not a beetle on what Antigonus called "the
whole dungy earth" who ever had to "find himself."

I wish that my own pupa-hood had been so quick and painless, but in fact, it
was a commonplace mix of anxious folly and meaningless alienation. My most
successful strategy for coping with the mess was to escape into the imagination.
Not my own imagination, of course, for I had little or none, but into other
people's. In my pupal stage, I was an indiscriminate reader of the genre known
as fantasy and science fiction. Inhabiting, as I did, the wrong body, and having
been birthed in the wrong time and place, I preferred fantastic alternative
universes to so-called "real life." I subscribed to a bunch of pulp mags and I
also gobbled the extensive collections of sci-fi in the local public library.
Not everyone will recognize the writers who were then my literary heroes,
but for me they were names as familiar as Koufax and Drysdale or, for that
matter, Truman and Eisenhower. Does anyone out there remember these folks:
Robert Heinlein, James Blish, L. Sprague de Camp, Richard Matheson, Isaac
Asimov, Robert Sheckley, Arthur C. Clarke, William Tenn, Poul Anderson, Fredric
Brown, Fritz Leiber, Theodore Sturgeon, Clifford D. Simak, Fletcher Pratt, Ray
Bradbury?  Names to conjure with, so to speak.

Here's a paradox. While I vividly recall the names of these authors, I can
remember almost nothing of what they wrote. I was fully immersed in the genre
and yet it's evaporated from my memory -- leaving less of a mark than does
the grub that becomes a butterfly. I seem to recall a novel or story about a
planet in which the trees were murderous -- they would send their roots through
ventilating ducts and strangle people in their beds. I have a hazy recollection
of a story about a society in which overconsumption was the norm and in which to
take a sofa and a set of chairs off the hands of newlyweds was an act of love.
I recall some precocious evil children endowed with supernatural powers. Do I
remember, or do I just imagine that I much admired a story about human beings
shrunk to infinitesimal size who had to go mano-a-flagellum with paramecia. I'm
certain that I encountered a superfluity of post-apocalyptic stories: after
the A-bomb, after the plague, after the invasion from another planet -- all
such fictions obvious symptoms of cold-war paranoia. Why in the world should
an adolescent earthling have consoled himself with stories of extragalactic
invaders spaceshipping to our green earth to exploit, or colonize, or enslave,
or, occasionally, to butcher and stew us? In the 1950s, aliens were always
hostile. None of my authors, as far as I can remember, could envision them
greeting us with the outstretched tentacle of peace.

Although I think that some of the stories were imaginative, most of them were no
more than starwarslike space operas-- Westerns but with death rays instead of
six-shooters.

It's been many a year since I could abide fantasy. The genre is now repugnant to
me.  I can't read Tolkien or Harry Potter, I can't watch movies about ghosts,
or satanic possession, or space travel, or time travel, or about people stuck
in other peoples' bodies. All such nonsense bores the living heck out of me.
Nor is it merely the lowbrow stuff. I can no longer read Spenser or Ariosto
and my least favorite character in Shakespeare is the magician Prospero. Is it
a failure of imagination on my part?  Perhaps. But I don't feel it as a loss.
There's more than enough of the non-fantastic to keep me joyfully occupied. I'm
grateful that sci-fi served my pupal needs, but it's gone forever.

Nowadays I tend to think back to my adolescent reading only when I'm at the
drugstore filling a prescription. The names of the new concoctions devised
by Big Pharma all sound extraterrestrial to me. For example: Cyclessa is the
queen of the distant planet Pulmicort which circles around the star Ativan in
the galaxy called Levaquin. Cyclessa’s evil brother Coumadin, along with his
henchmen the evil twins Zantac and Zocor, have attacked the queen, using their
secret weapons Restoril and Ritalin. They're accompanied by the enchantress
Ambien, aka Zolpidem, who causes her enemies to fall into profound sleep. But
deep in the forest, young Prozac awakens from a spell, mounts the great horse
Oxycontin, and with the aid of his sidekick, the amusing but randy Cialis, who
has escaped from the clutches of the evil witch Prevacid....  Etc., etc.

Title: Some Mondegreens
Date: February 15, 2010

When, In a Canterbury bar many years ago, I ordered a cider, the East Kent
cockney bartender responded with a question that I interpreted as "strong
Boer what knees?" Why would he ask me about the joints of a South African
farmer? I was absolutely befuddled even when he repeated the question several
times. Finally, in frustration, he held up two bottles of cider: the first was
labeled "Strongbow" and the second "Watney's." He was simply asking me if I
preferred Strongbow or Watney's -- but how was I to know?  Some years afterward
I mentioned this incident to an English friend who countered with a story of her
own. On her first visit to New York City, she said, she ordered a sandwich and
the counterman asked her "fur rear oughta go?"

I recalled these events while musing on two moments of childhood linguistic
extremity. The first was when I asked one of my P. S. 217 friends what they did
during Religious Instruction (in the 1950s, Roman Catholic kids were released
from class for two hours a week to study at the local parish church, which in
my neighborhood was St. Rose of Lima -- popularly known as "Roe Salima."  Our
teachers took the opportunity to catch up on the local newspapers while students
twiddled the collective thumb). My friend's answer, "Cat kiss 'em." It was many
years before I understood that the word I had no hope of understanding was
"catechism." I was even more puzzled when a Jewish student, who could not know
that I came from a family that regularly celebrated Yom Kippur with a roast
pork dinner, asked me, "do you put on to fill in?" I construed the question to
be some sort of insult, but after a decade or so I realized that I had been
asked something rather serious: "Do you put on tefillin? -- tefillin being small
leather boxes containing biblical verses donned by observant Jews during morning
prayers.

In my neighborhood, it was common for people to shout "doozie pots" at each
other.  I had no idea what that expression meant, except for a strong feeling
that it wasn't praise. It was not until I studied a little Italian that I
understood that what I heard as "doozie pots" was a Sicilian variant of tu sei
pazzo, "you're crazy."

None of these misunderstandings, strictly speaking, meet the mondegreen
threshold;  let's call them near-mondegreens. (The best-known mondegreen is
"I led the pigeons to the flag" -- a mishearing of "I pledge allegiance to the
flag." The word mondegreen derives from one of the Child ballads: "They hae
slain the Earl of Murray/ And laid him on the green," the second of these lines
misheard as "And Lady Mondegreen"). In my long list of personal mondegreens,
the two that are most vivid in my memory are connected to my incomprehension
of religion.  They are a) the luscious "round young virgin" of Silent Night,
and b) the theologically implausible "The Lord is ice, the Lord is made of ice"
in one of the choruses of The Messiah ("even so in Christ, shall we be made
alive"). Here's another mondegreen from my childhood:  "Who knows what evil
lurks in the hot cement?" March 12:  Last night at dinner, I remarked  that
one of my favorite innovations of the second half of the twentieth century was
"fitted sheets."  A guest said, "You're right;  we didn't used to have feta
cheese."

Title: News from the World of Nose Ornamentation
Date: February 16, 2010

Although youngsters sometimes try to piss off their parents by inserting
into their nose a modest jewel or a gold circlet, we (as a nation or as a
civilization) aren't terribly enthusiastic about decorating the old schnozzola.
While the English language has words for many kinds of jewelry (ring, earring,
brooch, bracelet, necklace, tiara, pectoral), it is vacant of vocabulary
for objects that are affixed to or hang from the nose. Consequently, this
magnificent piece of gold jewelry, crafted in Peru two thousand years ago, which
certainly bore a name in proto-Quecha or whatever was spoken at the time, is now
simply called a "nose ornament."

It's spectacular, isn't it? The four jolly, fat spiders in their intricate
communal web of mesh are truly lovely. We moderns can't compete.  We have
nothing to offer.

Here's another beauty, this one from the area that is now Columbia.

This nose ornament is five inches long from top to bottom, which means that it
would cover the mouth and hang well below the chin. The small gold discs and
the long flattened cylinders are loosely attached, so the ornament was designed
both to catch and reflect the light and to jingle. This one, like the spider
ornament, is glittery, ostentatious, and unapologetic.

I imagine that like most such jewelry, these nose ornaments were designed to
say, "I''m rich, I'm powerful, and I'm sexy. Come mate with me." To me, they
also say, very loudly, "I can endure massive rhinal discomfort." It appears
that these nose ornaments were inserted between the nostrils and attached to
the septum. To wear such an ornament would be painful even if the wearer never
sneezed or blew his nose, but to insert and remove it would be sheer nasal
agony. Those sharp points would dig into the tender flesh. And the object must
have been frequently removed,  because with the ornament in place, drinking
or eating would be impossibly messy. While the nose ornament might get a guy a
date, it would certainly inhibit chat or flirtation, and would also become a
major impediment if he got lucky.

I'm not impressed by the pitifully small nose ornaments worn by modern
teenagers, but I would definitely respect the child who was willing to brandish
something equivalent to these wonders. Especially the one with the spiders.

Title: Shakespeare, Eggcorns
Date: February 20, 2010

In The Second Part of King Henry the Fourth, the Hostess (also known as Nell
or Mistress Quickly) regularly makes fritters of the English language. At one
point in the play, she is beside herself -- apoplectic, in fact -- because she
believes that she has been abused by Falstaff. Reaching for words to equal
her anger, she tries for "homicidal" three consecutive times. First she calls
Falstaff a "honeysuckle villain," then a "honeyseed rogue" and finally she
settles on "hempseed." Although "honeysuckle" and "honeyseed" are amusing
guesses, we feel --or perhaps I should speak only for myself-- I feel just a
bit guilty that I've let Shakespeare amuse me at the expense of an illiterate
woman's linguistic lapses.

I have the same reservations about Charles Dickens's jokes on the unlettered;
the word "apoplexy," for example, appears as "happyplexy."  It makes a second
appearance in Great Expectations, when Jo Gargery, of whom much is made that he
has never learned to read or write, explains that his father died of a "purple
leptic fit."

I think that pillorying linguistic errors is more fun when the perpetrators
are not illiterate but pretentious. Such is the case in Sheridan's The Rivals
(1775), where Mrs. Malaprop, striving for "pinnacle," refers to a character as
"the very pineapple of perfection." The most famous sentence in The Rivals:
"Sure, if I reprehend any thing in this world it is the use of my oracular
tongue, and a nice derangement of epitaphs" (apprehend, vernacular, arrangement,
epithets).

In the last couple of years, there's been an attempt to distinguish a subset
of such malapropisms as "eggcorns." The neologism derives from the unlearned
collapse of "acorn" into "eggcorn" (a substitution which is more intelligible
when the word egg is pronounced as in rural "aig"). An eggcorn is supposed to
be a special variety of malapropism in that "the new phrase makes sense on
some level ('old-timer's disease' for 'Alzheimer's disease'). But what sort
of sense?  Why is "baited breath" for "bated breath" anything more than a
simple spelling error?  For that matter, "honeysuckle villain" and "honeyseed
rogue" also make a kind of sense -- a Shakespearean and psychological sense. The
Hostess unconsciously reveals that she's sweet on Falstaff.

In any case, there's now an eggcorn database on the internet.  A goodly
number of the eggcorns are errors that have appeared time without number on
student essays. I can't guess how often I used to encounter "peak (or peek)
one's curiosity," "leech" for "leach," "peon" for "paean," or "pier" for
"peer";  or how many times students would "pour" over their work. I remember
being stunned the first time that I encountered "morays" for "mores," but I
eventually acclimated to that formidable shock. What can it possibly mean to
"reek" havoc?  Others common student errors: "spade" for "spayed" (sometimes
pluperfectized to "spaded"; "verses" for "versus"; "phase" for "faze"; along
with the exceedingly respectful "sirname." I believe that the amount of space
I enclosed by circling these common errors as they appeared on coffee-stained
student submissions would roughly equal the surface area of Weld County.

The eggcorn database contains some "learned" malapropisms that are new to me.
"Hare's breath" and its funhouse mirror twin "hair-brained"; "beyond approach";
"Cadillac converter"; "garbage shoot"; "wet one's appetite." I can't picture
"well-quaffed hair," but I can certainly visualize a "wind-powered turban." "It
finally donged on me" makes some sense, but "crutch of the matter" is utterly
nonsensical. How laid back is a "mellow drama?" To "give up the goat" may have
meaning in pastoral societies. My absolute favorite: "pus jewel," as in, "his
adolescent face was covered with pus jewels." The avian reference in "one fowl
swoop" (for one fell -- i.e. fatal-- swoop) was well anticipated by Macduff: 
"What, all my pretty chickens and their dam/ In one fell swoop....  O hell-
kite."

And speaking of chickens (and eggs), there's also chocolate "eggclair" and
"eggtopic" pregnancy, both of which are weirdly inventive, but neither worth
(drumroll, maestro!), a pullet surprise.

Title: Rhinestone Cellist
Date: February 22, 2010

The hype and hoopla at sports arenas are truly deplorable, especially to aged
eyes and ears. At a Washington Wizards game in DC a couple of weeks ago, members
of the starting team were introduced not only with spotlights, screeching, and
"music" but also with bursts from a high-powered flame thrower. Even fifty
yards away, I could feel the toasty heat.

Wild over-the-top absurdity and irrelevance, in my opinion. I go to a basketball
game to see a basketball game, not to be danced at, kiss-cammed at, or showered
with gift certificates, free pizza, and t-shirts.

I'm back home in Boulder again, and last night I heard performances of
Prokofiev, Beethoven, and Brahms by the ever-so-formal Escher Quartet. Lord-a-
mercy, did they ever make me long for a little sporty glitz. The Eschers (three
men and a woman, all of whom appeared to be in their 20s) conducted themselves
as if they just woken up from a long day of sleeping in their coffins. They
were utterly joyless. They resolutely avoided looking at each other or at the
audience or betraying the least emotion. The expressions on their faces did
not say, "magnificent music"; they said, "is that curdled milk, or what?" They
plucked and sawed at their instruments with as much enthusiasm as if they were
cleaning out the septic system. Their playing was exact but uninspiring--but
what can you expect from three mortgage brokers and a dental hygienist?  The
Eschers acknowledged the generous applause of the audience as if they were
feudal overlords hearing the petitions of dung beetles.

Whenever I go to chamber music concerts, I feel young. Actually, I am young,
because in the chamber-music crowd, anyone without a walker or an oxygen bottle
is a kid.

The Escher should loosen up a bit -- and perhaps attract a younger and
livelier audience.

Here's the fantasy. Cue spotlight. Cue big-voiced announcer. "And now, on cello,
from Thousand Oaks, California, in his fifth year, out of the Manhattan School
of Music, Andy Janss." Janss runs on to the stage, carrying his cello overhead,
his rhinestones glittering in the lights. He high-fives the other members of
the group, shakes the confetti off his shoulder-length hair, tosses some talcum
powder into the air....etc. etc.  Crowd roars. He plays with enthusiasm. So do
his comrades.

But let us not sacrifice the dignity of classical-music. No flame throwers.

The grand-daughter, age 10, visited here last December.  She showed me her new
cellphone. She was "texting" with a friend.  I asked her how she does it, and
she gave me a lesson, even though she was startled and horrified, I imagine,
to realize that, although an adult, I didn't know that it's one click for a
d, two for an e, and three for an f. Her thumbs flew, mine limped, but I got
the idea -- and then forgot about it until, a couple of days ago, when  was
waiting in the doctor's office without a book and wasn't in the mood for Golf
Magazine. I started to play with my two-month-old entry-level cellphone and
discovered that if you press Menu, and then Messaging and then Send Message and
then Enter Number that you can "text" -- of which I had no idea, my cellphone
skills being usually limited to "what is that noise coming from my pocket I'd
better check."  So I laboriously scribed (or thumbed) my first message to the
grand-daughter: "Thank you for teaching me to send text messages."  And then,
miracle of miracles, a few hours afterward (after fifth grade had been dismissed
for the day, I suspect), I received an answer, which I now reproduce verbatim:
"when ur txting u dont have 2 use full sentences."

Title: Alcohol, Education, Logic
Date: March 01, 2010

A sorority girl fell off the roof of her house last week.  She was, of course,
staggeringly drunk. She messed herself up pretty badly but she will live.
Accidents of this kind happen regularly in our college town. Kids fall off
roofs, kids drive drunk and kill someone or themselves, or kids just binge-drink
themselves to death. It's regrettable that we've become accustomed to such
stories. I think it's the saddest thing: a family raises a child for twenty
years, sends him or her off to college with great hopes -- and two weeks later
the kid has crashed the car, fatally, or choked to death on her own vomit.

As a result of this latest incident, the neighbors have been engaged in an
internet war. One noisy faction insists that it's our policies that are at fault
-- that kids drink themselves to oblivion because alcohol is legally prohibited
until age twenty-one. If alcohol were legal, the argument goes, students would
then do their drinking in a controlled environment, such as an adult-supervised
party or a bar with rules on over-serving, and they wouldn't indulge in private.
It's a paradoxical argument -- alcohol would be safer if it were not prohibited.

After a great deal of back-and-forth and uninformed argumentation, one of the
neighbors, an epidemiologist who has actually studied the problem, presented
some data. That when New Zealand lowered the drinking age from 21 to 18, binge
drinking and accidental deaths increased. That binge drinking is higher in
European countries, some of which allow alcohol at age 16, than in the U.S.
That underage drinking declines, sometimes by as much as 40%, when rules are
enforced. That when alcohol is less available, alcohol consumption decreases,
and conversely, when it is made more available, consumption increases. That
the unformed brains of teen-agers are particularly subject to being addled by
alcohol.

The advocates of lowering the drinking age were unmoved by the evidence. One
resident, whom I will call BB, wrote in to say this: "Surely, had this 20 year
old woman been of legal drinking age, she would have been in the regulated
environment of a drinking establishment and not at an underground party. The
likelihood of her being overserved in that regulated environment and then ending
up drunk on the roof of her sorority would be considerably diminished. Unlike
Dr. F's and others' studies, this is a real life study that happened right down
the street. Let's open our eyes and start to learn from these events."  BB's
takes the position that we can ignore the data, forget the scientific studies,
and replace them with his interpretation of this particular event. BB's is a
good example of what is called "anecdotal thinking." But anecdotes, standing
alone, are not evidence nor can they replace the systematic gathering of
evidence and statistics. Meanwhile, another neighbor of long standing, KW,
answers the evidence with his own simple argument: we all drank when we were
young, there were laws in place then but we ignored them, nothing will ever
change, why make it hard for kids, let them drink at 18. KW is not much more
logical than BB. He argues ahistorically, quite oblivious to the fact that
alcohol is used differently in different cultures and in one culture a different
times in history.

BB says, it's cold today, there can be no such thing as global warming;  KW
says, there's always been weather, and it's always been warm

When I was a teacher, I tried over and over again to explain to my freshmen that
a) you can't build an argument on an anecdote, and b) that the experience of
an individual is not necessarily universal -- that to gather data, to consider
the context, and to apply logic were the hallmarks of the educated individual.
Neither BB and KW, both of whom, I believe, graduated from college, ever took
the first step in their freshman "critical thinking" class. They have their
views, and they're not going to let facts get in their way.

Is it relevant that both BB and KW are Republicans?  I believe it is.

But what should we do about alcohol abuse?  It's an intractable problem we're
not going to solve it immediately, but we have an instructive analogy in the
case of tobacco, where in the U. S, the consumption of tobacco has declined
significantly. We decreased tobacco use by a) prohibiting advertisements that
made smoking glamorous and alluring, b) increasing taxes, c) disseminating
information on lung cancer and low birth weights, etc, and d) by making tobacco
less available. We could try the same with alcohol, where billions are spent
by distilleries and breweries to make make alcohol use seem sophisticated
and ennobling. Instead, we could discuss incarceration rates, fetal alcohol
syndrome, homelessness, domestic violence, puking in the streets and choking in
the bed. We could limit the number of bars and alcohol outlets. We could make
drinking more expensive by raising the taxes to cover the civic cost in police,
judiciary, accidents, and prisons. We could tax wine less and hard liquor more.
We could rigorously enforce existing drinking-age laws. We could also encourage
the use of less dangerous drugs.

In addition, we could try to improve our educational system, so that when the
neighbors came to talk about alcohol abuse, they could conduct their discussion
with respect for fact and logic.

Title: Happy or Else
Date: March 10, 2010

Every week or so there's yet another breakthrough 'scientific' survey to tell
you which city is the healthiest, or the least obese, or the richest, or the
most educated, or whatever.  There's a new one out -- a poll by Gallup-
Healthways that has determined that the "happiest" place in the entire U. S. of
A. is my very own city  B---ld--r, C-l-r-do. I don't have the slightest idea
how the pollsters chose to define happiness, but I do know that the conclusion
drawn by the B--ld-r Camera (a dreadful gray newspaper that could not possibly
add the least dollop of joy to the life of any subscriber of intelligence,
imagination, or self-respect) makes no sense at all.  The Camera suggests
that people who want to be happy should move right here to B--ld-er. Can't
be right: if everyone came, the cheerful and morose alike, we'd immediately
and automatically fall right back to average. Actually, we'd fall even below
average, because of the misery caused by the spike in traffic.

Perhaps we're all dancing on our toes because we've legalized marijuana.

I suppose that the news that I'm happy should make me feel better, but instead
it just makes me anxious. Even though I'm of a moderately equable temperament, I
do have my gloomy spells.  When I'm in a funk, or a brown study, or I'm feeling
the blues  -- tell me, am I failing in my civic duty?  If I'm not pulling my
own happy wagon, am I discomfiting some other poor soul.  Putting a burden on
him to be inordinately cheerful in order to maintain our reputation.

Gosh, living in a happy city is so guilt-provoking.

On the whole, I was a lot more cheerful before I learned about the poll.

Title: Muff and Spot
Date: March 12, 2010

Every once in a while, a mountain lion creeps into the fold and snares a lamb,
a foal, or a German shepherd. At even more infrequent intervals, a mountain
lion attacks a human being (usually a child). Whenever there's a human-lion
interaction, there comes a deluge of letters to the local newspaper demanding
that the authorities exercise “lethal control" over the big cats. Killing
catamounts is neither hard nor dangerous. They were hunted nearly to extinction
in the nineteenth century. Dogs chase the animal up a tree. The brave hunter
takes aim and shoots.

But Is it a good idea to extinguish the mountain lion? In the United States,
there’s an average of one death by mountain lion a year. Here in B--ld-r
county, there’s been one such death in the last hundred years. One is a very
low number, especially when, in the country as a whole, snakes cause a dozen
deaths a year, lightning claims seventy-five, bee and wasp stings a hundred.
Dogs, when they’re not out hunting mountain lions, account for between twelve
to twenty deaths a year –- a couple of hundred a decade-- many of these, it's
sad to say, infants in the crib. Given the numbers, It’s hard to believe that
calls for the extermination of mountain lions aren’t motivated more by fear
than by facts.

Domesticated dogs are responsible not only for a dozen to a score of deaths,
but also for an estimated 4 to 7 million (that’s right, million!) cases of
dog-bite a year, almost 800,000 of which require medical attention. Dog bites
cause 368,000 emergency room visits, or (do the math!) one thousand such visits
a day.  The social cost of dog bites is estimated variously, but the Center for
Disease Control in Atlanta claims that the direct medical costs of dog bites per
year is $165 million, with many more millions in ancillary expenses.

Mountain lions, which are relatively harmless, inspire terror, but dogs, which
are far more dangerous, are our sacred cows -- loved, in my opinion, beyond all
propriety. It’s hard not to cringe when otherwise sensible people –- good
decent people --tell me in all seriousness that Towser is a full member of their
family, or that Fido is about to undergo an expensive hip replacement. The run-
of the-mill doggie in America enjoys a better diet and better medical care than
90% of the human beings on the planet -- a situation which I consider to be a
thoroughly indefensible skewing of resources. Dogs are not human beings, and
it’s immoral sentimentality to treat them as such. It’s embarrassing.

The ancients, following Aristotle, divided their possessions into three
categories: an object was an instrumentum mutum, an animal was an instrumentum
semivocale, and a slave was an instrumentum vocale. By eliding the differences
between humans and animals, the Greeks and the Romans made slavery both easy and
natural.

I used to worry that people who treated animals as humans would be tempted
to treat humans as animals. But it's not true; the people I know who are
sentimental about animals and "animal rights" are extraordinarily sensitive to
human rights -- but then, perhaps my sample is skewed. All of my friends are
sensitive to human rights; if they weren’t, they wouldn’t be my friends.

I wonder whether the love of dangerous dogs and the fear of the cats who are by
and large indifferent to us isn’t an instinct acquired over millions of years.
Our ancestors, armed at best with flint-headed spears, spent countless millennia
at the mercy of feline predators larger, more powerful and more terrifying than
100-pound mountain lions (the extinct European lion, panthera leo fossilis,
was taller, stronger, and and a foot and a half longer that the modern African
lion).  Some 50,000 years ago, an ancient Einstein conceived the idea of
domesticating wolves and selecting their population for useful traits. Humans
and proto-dogs started to cohabit; dwellings and caves came to be littered with
coprolites. Co-evolution began, and over the course of time, dogs and humans
came to be sensitive to each other's traits. Those early dogs were our first
allies on this lonely, hostile planet. They could raise a ruckus when a couple
or three lionesses prowled about the cave door.

We're indebted to dogs and so we tolerate their bad habits.  By the same token,
the over-hasty cry to kill the mountain lions is also an inheritance from our
fearful ancestors.

Date: March 19, 2010

When I was a mere tad, perhaps seven or eight years old but already an
enthusiastic reader, I was given a subscription (by whom?) to a children's
magazine, perhaps Jack and Jill. It arrived once a month and took perhaps ten
minutes to read. It was certainly my older brother (who later owned a large
house that had twice as many mirrors as books, who said, "you still readin'
that thing for babies?" Always susceptible to public criticism, I soon turned
against the publication. Since then, I've subscribed and unsubscribed to dozens
of periodicals, many more than I can remember.  Here are a few: in my pathetic
teens, Mad Magazine, of which I was a serious enthusiast (and had been so since
Mad's Harvey Kurtzman comic book days). Closest I ever came to anarchy. Also,
Sport Magazine -- a precursor of SI.  Pre-steriods, pre-scandal, the athletes
profiled were virtuous, sober, and generous family men who had overcome venomous
small town upbringings and acute physical handicaps to rise to the top of the
mound or sit astride the Derby winner. Also, when I went though my adolescent
fantasy phase, various pulp sci fi mags -- Astounding Science Fiction and Galaxy
Science Fiction and probably others that came and went. I was much enamored
of the stuff, which was monumentally escapist and therefore analogous to my
sports obsessions. In the '60s, I matured to political magazines: The Reporter,
The Nation, and before it went totally and bizarrely wrong, The New Republic.
A decade later, when I had set out to study literature through a social lens,
I subscribed to Local Population Studies, The Journal of Interdisciplinary
History, The Psychohistorical Review, and The History of Childhood Quarterly.
When I became serious about Shakespeare I was an assiduous reader and collector
of the Shakespeare Quarterly and Shakespeare Survey and the Shakespeare
Newsletter and Shakespeare Research and Opportunities and the Shakespeare on
Film Newsletter. Closely related: English Literary Renaissance,  to which I
sent a number of my own contributions, and the George Herbert Journal (of which
I at one time owned every issue). In the '70s or '80s, Organic Gardening (sample
title -- "How We Grew Papayas on our Vermont Hillside Using Organic Methods
and Faith in God"); later, Fine Gardening (sample title: "How We Converted a
Defunct Brick Brewery into an Extremely Expensive Bed-and-Breakfast Complete
with a Replica of an 18th-century Capability Brown Landscape").  At then at
various times: Scientific American, Science News, Bluebirds Across Vermont, the
newsletter of the Southern Vermont Dairy Goat Association, One Two Three Four (a
magazine briefly in existence that concerned itself with the early history of
rock and roll), the Atlantic, The Skeptical Inquirer. Newspapers:  The New York
Times, Valley News, United Opinion (since renamed  the Journal-Opinion), Behind
the Times, the B--ld-r Daily Camera. Nowadays: Harvard Magazine, New Yorker, New
York Review of Books, Northern Forests. A long list, but note: no movie star
mags, no style, no self-improvement, no golf, no detectives, no alternative
healing, no finance, no how-to-pyramid-your-money, no automotive, no weapons. It
appears that I'm a person of narrow but eclectic interests, magazine-wise.

Title: My New Mirror
Date: March 22, 2010

There's been some criticism -- justified, I must admit -- about the dexterity
of my shaving. It appears that my face has become more, what shall I say?
intricate over the last years, and has developed some interesting crannies that
resist the approach of the razor. In order to improve my shaving technique, I
bought one of those circular magnifying mirrors that allows you to view your
face in such great detail that you can hunt down and harvest that last otherwise
inaccessible follicle. The mirror seemed like a good idea, but, dear friends
of a certain age, I do not recommend this purchase. Big mistake.

It had been many years since I studied my face so intently. Things have
happened. While I can still locate the remnants of the scar on my forehead,
where, when I was a boy, I was pushed into a subway pillar, the mark used to
reside just at the hairline. Now, the hairline has migrated a good three
inches to the north of the scar and -- thanks to the new mirror -- I can
clearly detect that the first remaining inch or so of brown-gray hair, which
I had thought to be of a healthy bushiness, consists of no more than a few
well-spaced strands. And what's this cross-hatching on my forehead? Not just
the prominent horizontal furrows but new vertical ones as well -- when did they
appear? And the deep gorges around my eyebrows! And the eyebrows themselves --
when did they become parti-colored? Randomly black and white? And how many
years ago did these long recurved eyebrow hairs begin to sprout? Fie upon it
--'tis an unweeded garden that's gone to seed. Why are the eyebrows themselves
so utterly asymmetrical? and what should I make of the thicket of whiteheads
-- or whatever the heck they are -- at all four corners of my bloodshot eyes? 
Was it always the case that my eyes were set so deeply into those wrinkled
dells? And my nose-- thanks to the new mirror, I can plainly see the scars
where the pre- cancerous lesions were frozen off. What in the world has
happened to the tip of my nose?  Was it always so preternaturally pointy? I
could use it as a letter- opener. When I lift my head just slightly, I see
that my nostrils, which I always took to be a matched pair, have set out on
separate paths. The right one now sits at a 45 degree angle to the left. It's
wandered off-center, like the eye of a flounder. And those nasty black hairs
jutting from my nostrils -- I must attend to them. And look, there are long
hairs coming out of my ears as well. And hanging, floppy earlobes marked with
deep lines. What are these fleshy nobs at the sides of my mouth? Were my lips
always covered with white flakes?  How is it that the left side of my underlip
is so much thicker than the right? And my pearly whites? Cracked and chipped
and not much of a row: sixty or so years of gnawing has given each tooth its
own unique size, shape, color, and identity. And what's this under my chin? A
single off-center hanging wattle? No symmetry even in Wattlelandia? Friends,
this magnifying mirror is a disaster. I should have stopped shaving entirely
and grown a camouflaging beard.

But hold on, there's some good news. It may not be a youthful or symmetrical
face, but It's not unfriendly. There's no sneer, or lip curl, or disdain, or
anger. Puzzlement, certainly. Wryness, perhaps. Curiosity, for sure.

Folks, at least we're not in a wicked-Dorian-Gray-kind-of-situation.

Wear and tear, yes; villainy, no. Things could be worse.

Title: Existence pre- and post-
Date: March 22, 2010

Last night, one of our dinner guests said that at least we no longer have to
worry about "pre-existing conditions." Persnickety about language as always, I
pointed out that the phrase "pre-existing condition" was a ridiculous piece of
jargon. What is meant is "existing conditions?" A condition can't exist before
it exists.

"Aha," said another of my guests, a Lutheran minister,"now you've opened a
theological questions." He was referring to the disputed doctrine that the
existence of Jesus preceded his incarnation in the womb.

But if "pre-existence" is only taken seriously by theologians and by insurance
executives, then I'm going to stand on my claim that the phrase is both
obscurantist or bureaucratic and should be discarded from common use. "Existing"
is sufficient.

Moreover, the notion that insurance should be granted to the healthy but
denied to the ill is a more dangerous travesty than the mystification of "pre-
existence."

Title: Grandpa Tells a Whopper;  Cornell Takes a Shellacking
Date: March 26, 2010

Last night, the grandkids had a little fun with the old guy. Miss T. (b. 1999),
concluded that Grandpa's electronic and computer skills were (her exact words)
"stone age."

Is she correct? Let us review the circumstances. I was here, in B--ld-r, trying
to watch the Cornell-Kentucky sweet-sixteen on streaming video (CBS again gave
the Big Red the back of its network-y hand) while simultaneously following the
Kansas State-Xavier double-overtime epic on Tivo (slightly behind real time so
as to sidestep the mini-dramas on the subjects of beer and deodorant). Miss T
and Mr. O were snuggled in bed with their mom out there near the Pacific shore
and we and they were sending messages back and forth on Facebook chat. Hey, not
exactly a "stone age" situation.

The kiddies were testing my knowledge of IM acronyms, and I was failing badly.
I didn't know ROTFL or JK or TMI or LMAO. Then Mr. O became dissatisfied at
the pace of the conversation, so he started sending me messages ("texting" me
is the jargon) on the cellphone, thereby giving me another device to manage.
Which is when I ran out of hands, and in frustration, told what HF (according to
SLC), also known as MT) calls a "stretcher." I said (or wrote, rather) to Miss
T. and Mr. O., something to the effect of "what do you mean I don't know about
electronic media. I used to IM all the time with my grandparents."

Frankly, they didn't buy it. I can't blame them; they know that my grandparents
didn't have much English.

Meanwhile, the Ivy League fell further and further behind, mostly because
Kentucky was quick enough to step around the screens and stop Cornell's three-
point game. In the other bracket, Kansas State lasted it out.

I know that it's negligent not to enlighten myself about useful chat acronyms.
Nevertheless, I suspect that the o-so-up-to-date grandkids at the other end of
the IM line are also missing something. They probably think that a "whopper" is
a hamburger. They probably don't know what a "shellacking" is. Or shellac, for
that matter. Probably think that it's something that originated in the Stone
Age.

Title: Pretty Poison (1960);  Tuesday Weld (1943-     )
Date: March 27, 2010

Pretty Poison was released in 1960 to excellent notices. I remember adding it to
the must-see list. But I didn't get around to it at the time, probably because
the film wasn't widely distributed. But Pretty Poison stuck in my mind -- or
rather it was the combination of Anthony Perkins and Tuesday Weld that excited
my interest. During the VHS years I made another attempt to see the movie,
but it was apparently stuck in some sort of royalty-and-ownership dispute
and never made it onto tape. And then another twenty years elapsed and I tried
again, this time typing the name into my Netflix queue, and, mirabile dictu,
there it was.  So at last, after fifty years, a cd of Pretty Poison appeared
in the mailbox.

It's a fine film, well worth the wait. I don't know what I would have
thought about it in 1960, but in 2010 it seems like a late variant of
1950s film noir and an important but unacknowledged way station on the road
from Double Indemnity to Body Heat. It offers a dangerous jeune fille fatale
in the high school cheerleader Mary Ann Stepanek, some great plot twists, and a
creepy young man who's not as clever as he thinks (very similar to his lineal
descendant, the fatuous lawyer Ned Racine). The photography, all sunlit and
cheerful, disguises the noirish themes and keeps the audience off balance. The
screenwriter, Lorenzo Semple Jr., was, if I remember correctly, just emerging
from the McCarthy blacklist, which may be why the film stresses cold-war themes
-- spies and sabotage and the like. Can it be accidental that, in the last year
of the Eisenhower administration, a well-meaning but ineffective government
employee as given the name Azenauer?

At the very time Tuesday Weld, scion of an ancient Massachusetts family
performed in this film, I was taking courses in Cambridge, in Weld Hall. How
could anyone not be struck by her great name? Tuesday Weld is linked, in my
mind, not only to the Saltonstalls, Peabodys, and Lodges but also to Billy
Sunday, Rick Monday, Joe Friday, January Jones, Fredric March, May West, June
Jones, August Busch, Susan Sontag, Domenico Scarlatti and Jeudi Garland.

Title: Bronte Notes
Date: March 29, 2010

I have just read, for the first time ever, Agnes Grey (1847) by Anne Bronte,
and what an infinitely sad book it is! Poor Agnes, an impoverished clergyman's
daughter, goes as a governess and is daily humiliated by monstrously spoiled
children and their grotesquely insensitive parents. Her sufferings are
poignantly particularized. The novel is structured as if it were a comedy
(after extended tribulations, Agnes marries a decent young curate) but it is
nevertheless barren, desiccated, and joyless. Even the long-awaited marriage
proposal receives the shortest of shrifts:

"And so now I have overruled your objections. Have you any others. "No --
none."  "You love me then," he said, fervently pressing my hand.  "Yes."

And that's all the romance that this poor downtrodden, passive, beaten-into-the-
dust emotionally-stunted "heroine" is granted.

Nevertheless, my own personal sadness while reading this novel arose not
from Agnes Grey's suffering, but from Anne Bronte's -- there being not a
skin-of-the- teeth space between the bedraggled writer and the bedraggled
protagonist. Agnes's experiences as a governess exactly mirror Anne's --
except there was no saving curate to snatch the wedding chestnuts out of
the fire. Poor Anne returned home defeated, virginal, and alone, to die
at age 28, of tuberculosis. Nor is it simply the doormat heroine or the
downtrodden novelist that is so distressing -- it's the general oppression of
women in the first part of the nineteenth century that must draw a tear from the
stolidest of eyes. Here's a society that offered no decent options for women,
and even Anne Bronte, as talented as she was, hadn't the least ability to
think her way through attitudes toward women that proved to be paralyzing and
ultimately fatal.

I turned to Agnes Grey because I had recently read Anne's older sister
Charlotte's Villette, a novel that perplexed me more than any book I've read in
years. I couldn't make sense of it. I've read my share of nineteenth-century
novels, and I would like to think that I have a general sense of how they're
made, and, after I get a few chapters in, how they must conclude. In Villete,
all the early markers point to the eventuality that young Lucy Snowe, after the
customary and appropriate difficulties and misunderstandings will have been
resolved, will marry the handsome young Dr. John. But somewhere in Book II,
the game changed and the poor reader (me) became confused. Dr. John is allowed
to make some bad choices -- sufficiently wrong that he becomes superfluous and
gradually fades into the background. He metamorphoses from a major character
in the first half of the book to a minor character in Book III. His place as
Lucy Snowe's suitor is taken by a teacher, M. Paul Emanuel, who is nasty and
unattractive when introduced but who becomes more and more acceptable as the
novel proceeds. I couldn't comprehend the seismic shift until I read the truly
excellent biography of CB by Lyndall Gordon (Charlotte Bronte, A Passionate
Life (1994). It turns out the plot of the novel parallels CB's experience
in Brussels. Initially attracted to a young man who lost interest in her,
she fell deeply in love with a teacher at her school. Alas, M. Heger was not
available, either matrimonially or emotionally.

But at least Charlotte, unlike Anne, was willing to take a risk -- which is why,
in Charlotte's greatest novel, witty, forthright, independent Jane Eyre, for
all her weirdness, remains such a striking and refreshing alternative to the
ordinary oppressed nineteenth-century heroine.

Title: Lascivious Wassails
Date: April 06, 2010

In Anthony and Cleopatra, Caesar, who is disciplined and ascetic, both
envies and scorns Anthony. In one of the play's greatest moments, Caesar
apostrophizes his hedonistic, indulgent rival. "Anthony," he begins, "Leave
thy lascivious wassails." "Lascivious wassails" is a most marvelous phrase --
not only because of its serpentine hissing, but because it is so colorful. In
another context, the word "wassails" might signify conviviality, but in this
case it is so contaminated by the wickedness of "lascivious" that it can
only be taken to signify bouts of drunken excess. "Lascivious wassails"
is glancingly oxymoronic and consequently embodies Caesar's confused and
contradictory feelings toward Anthony.

It's an especially pertinent phrase because the speech that follows
celebrates those qualities of Anthony which Caesar most admires (and which he
simultaneously finds most threatening) -- his Spartan, soldierly ability to
put aside luxurious food and drink and to subsist on "the bark of trees," and,
if necessary, to drink from "the gilded puddle that beasts would cough at."

"Lascivious wassails" is brilliant in its freestanding self and without doubt
entirely appropriate to its context. It's one of Shakespeare's all-time-great
encapsulations -- a condensed and beautiful phrase.

Except that it's not Shakespeare's. Or, more precisely, it is probably not
Shakespeare.

The Folio text of Anthony and Cleopatra seems to have been set from a transcript
of Shakespeare's manuscript. It's the only early printing (there are no
Quartos). In the Folio, the line appears this way: "Anthony,/ Leaue thy
lasciuious Vassailes." "Vassailes" was, for the first hundred years of its
existence, understood to mean "vassals." Caesar, it appears, wants Anthony to
take leave of not his cups but his followers. In the fourth Folio of 1683, the
irregular spelling "vassailes" was regularized to "vassals." "Wassails" did not
arrive on the scene until 1724 and was the ingenious, inspired invention of
Alexander Pope. Every single editor since Pope, no doubt taken with the beauty
of the phrase, has printed "wassails."

It's not as though "vassals" doesn't make sense. It's perfectly fine. It's
just the "wassails" is better. In this instance, let's face it, Pope outdid
Shakespeare. If not for Pope, it is highly likely that it would have been
"lascivious vassals" until the end of time. Who beside a great poet would have
thought of "wassails?" Certainly not I.

Editors aim for authenticity -- to print what they believe Shakespeare wrote.
Shakespeare probably wrote "vassals" -- but "wassails" is so clever that editors
cannot help but succumb. They follow the illogic that if it's brilliant, it must
be Shakespeare. And so authenticity gladly yields to beauty.

Date: April 07, 2010

The most famous, I think, must be Itzhak Perlman, who is the earth's most
versatile and distinguished violinist -- and is also father of five next-
generation members of the musical tribe. Almost as widely known but perhaps not
so spectacularly talented, is Rhea Perlman, better known as Carla Tortelli,
mother to many. The most brilliant of the clan, and certainly the most
eccentric, is Grigori Yakovlevich ("Grisha") Perelman, the mathematician who
solved Poincare's conjecture and then refused both the Fields Medal (the
Nobel Prize of mathematics) and the $1 million Clay Millennium Prize. Grisha
demonstrated what most of us simply take for granted: that any closed three-
dimensional manifold where any loop can be contracted to a point is really just
a three-dimensional sphere. There's also Ron Perelman, a consummate and ruthless
corporate raider, once the richest man in America, now, alas,  fallen to 18th
-- nor any longer contracted to nonce-wife #4, Ellen Barkin. The most amusing
of all Pearlmans is surely Brooklynite S. J. Perelman, screenwriter of two
great Marx Brothers vehicles -- Horse Feathers and Monkey Business. The most
reprehensible of the cousinhood is certainly Lou Pearlman, accomplished Ponzi-
artist and the mogul behind the bubble-gummy Backstreet Boys, whom he used and
possibly sexually abused to the tune of $300 million -- and who is now serving
a 25-year term in federal prison. Infinitely more respectable is the composer
and conductor Martin Pearlman, who learned his trade at Cornell and who is a
harpsichordist as well as the founder of the Boston Baroque. Nor should any
Pearlman census overlook Ron Perlman, aka Amoukar the Ulam, who many years ago
quested for fire. Nor sportwriter Jeff Pearlman, pitcher Jon Perlman, writer
Edith Pearlman, film critic Cindy Pearlman; nor the great rhetorician of a prior
generation, Chaim Pearlman.

And also: standing at the top of the heap in the world of fiction is The
Wire's incorruptible Maryland Assistant State Attorney, Rhonda Pearlman.

It's a patache, and George Sand (in The Miller of Angibault [1852]) offers a
detailed account. The patache, it would appear, was a blast from the past even
in the early nineteenth century.

"Madame de Blanchemont left in a simple patache, that respectable relic of
our forefathers' plain tastes, becoming rarer with each passing day. The one
which it was Marcelle's unhappy fate to encounter was of the purest native
construction and an antiquarian would have contemplated it with respect. It was
as long and low as a coffin; no springs of any sort diminished its charms. The
wheels were as tall as the cowl. The cowl itself was made of a sort of wattle
and daub, so that every little bump rained clods of clay down on the travelers'
heads. A thin but ardent little stallion drew this rural carriage quite nimbly,
and the patachon, the driver, seated himself on the car-shaft with his legs
dangling down."

The patache, which seems to be a country cousin of the "springless kibitka"
combined with elements of the basket-carriage, may now be added to the long list
of obsolete horsedrawn carriages.

Title: Strange Flesh
Date: April 13, 2010

Plutarch makes much of Antonius' "hardness in adversity notwithstanding his
fine bringing up." Shakespeare knew these words very well; in fact, his copy of
Plutarch was open to this exact sentence when he mended his quill and began to
compose the famous speech in Anthony and Cleopatra that begins "Anthony, leave
thy lascivious wassails."

Here are Plutarch's words (exactly as they came to Shakespeare through Sir
Thomas North's translation). The passage that particularly stimulated the
playwright appears (thanks to the magic of word processing), in a font of vivid
blue.

"Hirtius and Pansa, then consuls [were sent by Octavius Caesar] to drive
Antonius out of Italy. These two consuls... besieged the city of Modena, and
there overthrew him in battle, but both the consuls were slain there. Antonius,
flying upon this overthrow, fell into great misery all at once, but the chiefest
want of all other, and that pinched him most, was famine. Howbeit, he was of
such a strong nature that by patience he would overcome any adversity, and
the heavier fortune lay upon him, the more constant showed he himself.... And
therefore it was a wonderful example to the soldiers, to see Antonius, that was
brought up in all fineness and superfluity, so easily to drink puddle water, and
eat wild fruits and roots; and moreover it is reported that even as they passed
the Alps, they did eat the bark of trees, and such beasts as man never tasted of
their flesh before.

Shakespeare kept the sense of the passage but put Plutarch's words into the
mouth of Octavius Caesar, who despises, envies, but also fears Anthony,
his absent rival.

Anthony,

Leave thy lascivious wassails.  When thou once

Was beaten from Modena, where thou slew'st

Hirtius and Pansa, consuls, at thy heel

Did famine follow, who thou fought'st against,

(Though daintily brought up) with patience more

Than savages could suffer.  Thou did'st drink

The stale of horses, and the gilded puddle

Which beasts would cough at.  Thy palate then did deign

The roughest berry on the rudest hedge.

Yea, like the stag, when snow the pasture sheets,

The barks of trees thou browsed.  On the Alps,

It is reported thou did'st eat strange flesh,

Which some did die to look on.  And all this

(It wounds thine honor that I speak it now)

Was born so like a soldier, that thy cheek

So much as lanked not.

Plutarch is shocked that high-born Antonius could bring himself to eat "wild
fruits," but Shakespeare, ever willing to push an idea to the limit, makes
Anthony's diet even more crude. "Thy palate then did deign [i.e. find worthy]/
The roughest berry on the rudest hedge" -- that is to say, Anthony eats not
just "wild fruit," but the less palatable "roughest berry." In an even harsher
transformation, Plutarch's "puddle water" becomes "the stale (i.e. urine)
of horses, and the gilded puddle/ Which beasts would cough at."  It may be
stoic to drink "puddle water," but it is a far greater challenge to a dainty
constitution to survive on horse piss. As the passage continues, Anthony's diet
becomes progressively more exotic. Plutarch says that Antonius consumed "beasts
as man never tasted of their flesh before," and seems to imagine Antonius as an
adventurer at the utmost boundary of culinary experience. But when Shakespeare
suggests that Anthony ate "strange flesh/ Which some did die to look upon,"
Anthony becomes not just a soldier/explorer coping with natural adversity but
a demi-god or some other kind of supernatural figure able to triumph over
enchantment or magic -- one who can incorporate fleshly food that would kill at
a glance men with natures less powerful than his own.

Shakespeare characteristically intensifies, exaggerates, or hyperbolizes
Plutarch's already extravagant tale. He raises the rhetorical ante. Whatever
Plutarch proffers, Shakespeare doubles and redoubles.

The animal theme that runs through this series of transformations begins with
the evolution of Plutarch's phrase "by patience he would overcome any adversity"
into Shakespeare's "patience more than savages could suffer." More patience than
savages?  What would that be? Shakespeare provides an answer to an implicit,
unspoken question, which is, What is a more, or worse, or a lower being than
a savage? The answer seems to be "an animal" -- and consequently Shakespeare
employs images of bestiality throughout this speech: the horses whose stale must
be guzzled, the beasts who cough at the gilded puddle, the stag who browses
the bark of trees under sheets of snow, and, climatically, the strange magical
flesh that some -- but not Anthony -- die to look upon. In a characteristically
Shakespearean paradox, as the passage proceeds Anthony becomes both more animal
and more heroic -- at the same time both baser and yet more transcendent.

And what is that strange and magic Alpine flesh?  It's impossible to say, and
Shakespeare offers no clue. Perhaps it's mere hyperbole -- an author carried
away by his own rhetorical power. Does Anthony violate the ultimate food taboo
and become a cannibal?  Some readers have thought so, but the evidence is
lacking.

There is, however, a hint that Octavius himself thinks that the strange flesh
episode is nothing more than a tall tale. "On the  Alps, it is reported.... "

Title: "Cat Got Your Tongue"
Date: April 14, 2010

So it was 1946 and I was in first grade in P. S. 217 and I must have been
throwing my massive seven-year-old weight around because one of the "class
mothers" took me aside and accused me of quote picking on unquote her dear son
Michael who was at least six inches taller than poor poor pitiful skinny me. I
remember that I was astonished and taken aback but that I was still in my own
head poised enough to think, what a jerk Michael must be to tell on me to his
mother -- although frankly I don't know now and didn't know then what I could
have done to earn her enmity or deserve the reproach. I was innocent! What I
remember most clearly is that I was rendered quite speechless when Michael's
mommy asked an explanation or apology from me and especially that she two
or several times demanded of me, scornfully, "what's the matter, cat's got
your tongue? Cat's got your tongue?" I had never heard that expression before
and didn't know what it meant, but it sure added a deal of mystery to the
confrontation. My tongue was still in my mouth and not in the possession of some
feline and I was neither clever enough nor bold enough to stick it out at her.

What does it mean, "Cat's got your tongue." It's still a mystery to me even
today. Interestingly enough, the expression isn't of ancient origin and
apparently dropped to earth only in the late nineteenth century. It's a puzzle,
though. Why a cat?  But then, why "cat's pajamas?" Why "cat o' nine tails?" Why
"cat's meow?"

In any case, I was nonplussed that Michael's mommy spoke to me so obscurely and
Iwas indignant to be accused of misbehavior. In fact, sixty plus years later 'm
Istill indignant.

Is it possible that the cat-and-tongue episode stimulated my interest in
language?

I really don't know why this antique event swam out of the dark backward and
abysm of the past. Just yesterday, when I mentioned it to Mrs Dr. Metablog, she
recalled that one day, also in 1946, when she was in elementary school and she
was not sitting as still as we were then expected to sit, she was accused of
having "ants in her pants."  She's indignant.

so much if I hadn't recently indulged myself with an Edithathon of 25 or 30
long novels, of which "Roman Fever" is a quintessence or distillation. Packed
into a few pages is all you would ever need to know about formal, repressed,
rule-bound upper-class New York society in which no-holds-barred competitiveness
is masked by lifted-pinky manners. The story is so cleverly designed that the
last satisfying sentence more than fulfills a reader's wickedest expectations.

Mrs.  Ansley and Mrs. Slade, both well-tended New York widows who've pretended
to like each other for a lifetime, chat on a Roman balcony. Each is expert at at
one-upmanship. Their apparent friendship masks hatreds and sexual jealousies as
obvious (once the curtain is lifted) and as brutal as those of lions living in

I know of no work of fiction that is at once so polite and so ferocious. And so

Title: Earthquakes - Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc -  King Lear
Date: April 23, 2010

We all remember, and we're all still shocked and amazed that the late,
unlamentable Jerry Falwell proclaimed that the 9/11 attacks on the US were
caused by "the pagans, and the abortionists, and the feminists, and the gays,
and the lesbians." How to understand either the logic or the brain of such a
thinker? We moderns tend to reason in terms of cause and effect, and cause
and effect just doesn't cut it with Falwell. Was he thinking something like,
feminists cause sin (a debatable proposition) and Al-Qaeda wants to cleanse
us, so they run the airplanes into the towers. That would be unbelievable
nonsense, even for Falwell. Here's another attempt to divine his mind:
feminists are dangerous and evil and therefore the good old US of A has become
Sodom/Gomorrah/Ephesus and the Big Guy in the Sky is offended and therefore he
engaged Al-Qaeda to punish the US for its sins by enabling or permitting those
young Saudi jerks to fly planes into the towers in order to persuade us to
repudiate the feminists. Does that make sense? Very little.

Similarly, Pat Robertson deduced that Hurricane Katrina was all about abortion.
In this case, the Ancient of Days didn't even bother to enlist human agents.
Noticing that there were abortions being performed in the US, he let loose the
winds from the caves in which he had confined them and instructed them to bust
up the New Orleans dikes and drown a lot of people.

Jerry and Pat are a pair of idiots, not only because they lack intelligence, but
also because their view of the world is five hundred or a thousand years behind
the times. They'd be mainstream in dark/medieval Europe when Attila the Hun and
Timur (or Tamburlaine) the Great competed for the title of Scourge of God --
the flagellum dei. They pillaged and burned and raped over vast areas of the
world not because they were  imperialists and conquerors but because they were
instruments of god. They wreaked vengeance on our sins. It was orthodoxy. Cause
and effect? Sorry, not part of the picture.

The fallacy post hoc ergo propter hoc  -- "after this therefore because of
this"  -- means that just because B comes after A doesn't mean that A causes
B. Just because an abortion is followed by a hurricane doesn't mean that the
abortion caused the hurricane. Just because someone prays to one or another god
and recovers from illness doesn't mean that the prayer caused the cure. The
volcano isn't quiescent because we sacrificed the maiden. No religion, not a
single one, can bear the light of post hoc. Fully honored, it puts them all out
of business. Along with all the other varieties of magical thinking.

All this hardly bears mentioning except that a couple of days ago, a 'senior
Iranian cleric" Hojatoleslam Kazem Sedighi, pronounced that very soon a massive
earthquake will devastate the city of Teheran and that the earthquake will
be caused by "women who do not dress modestly. [Such women] lead young men
astray, corrupt their chastity and spread adultery in society, which increases
earthquakes." There's a chain of logic for you. A guy catches a glimpse of a
lock of hair, or, god forbid, a bit of bosom, and boom -- earthquake.  But
it's not his fault -- it's that his natural chastity has been compromised by
them there female blandishments. Delilah all over again. Forget the movement of
tectonic plates. The energy released in earthquakes isn't caused by subduction.
It's ankles.The senior Iranian cleric has not correctly grasped the meaning of
the demotic phrase, "the earth moved."

Sedighi is a boob and is even more presumptuous and illogical than Pat and
Jerry. The earthquake hasn't even occurred and he's already blaming it on the
outfits. He's launched a pre-emptive strike on post hoc. His is a fallacy so
monumentally illogical that hasn't yet earned a name.

It's instructive that Shakespeare, writing before the age of reason and before
the scientific revolution, offered a full debate on the subject. In King Lear,
Gloucester takes the traditional view. Eclipses, like hurricanes, are filled
with meaning. Gloucester does not hold with reason or with the logic that he
calls "the wisdom of nature."

"These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no good to us: though the
wisdom of nature can reason it thus and thus, yet nature finds itself scourged
by the sequent effects: love cools, friendship falls off, brothers divide.
In cities, mutinies; in countries, discord; in palaces, treason, and the
bond cracked 'twixt son and father... We have seen the best of our time: 
machinations, hollowness, treachery and all ruinous disorders, follow us
disquietly to our graves."

Gloucester's bastard son Edmund dismisses tradition and argues scientifically
and rationally.

"This is the excellent foppery of the world, that, when we are sick in fortune
-- often the surfeit of our own behavior -- we make guilty of our disasters the
sun, the moon, and the stars: as if we were villains by necessity, fools by
heavenly compulsion; knaves, thieves, and treachers, by spherical predominance,
drunkards, liars, and adulterers, by an enforced obedience of planetary
influence, and all that we are evil in, by a divine thrusting on. An admirable
evasion of whoremaster man, to lay his goatish disposition to the charge of
a star. My father compounded with my mother under the dragon's tail, and my
nativity was under Ursa Major; so that it follows, I am rough and lecherous.
Tut, I should have been that I am, had the maidenliest star in the firmament
twinkled on my bastardizing."

Gloucester is, in our terms, superstitious and simple, but he's also orthodox
and reverent. Edmund is realistic and rational, but he is also as loathsome a
villain as Shakespeare ever created. Shakespeare is a late medieval writer,
which is why he should not necessarily be looked to for moral advice but rather
for great poetry, great stories, and aesthetic bliss.

Meanwhile, the "excellent foppery of the world" has become the province of
fundamentalists of all stripes.

While I admire the highly skilled, I am also much attracted to the guys who do a

I don't mean just baseball. I've been watching the NBA playoffs and I'm now

outside shot is, to say the least, unorthodox. But he works hard on every play
and when he's knocked down, as is frequently the case, he bounces up like some
mythological figure who draws strength from the earth. Plus there's not another
center in the league who's fluent in French and Swedish.

Forward. Paul Pierce. Can't run, can't jump, but is a perennial all-star and
the go-to guy at the end of a close game. I've seen him play hundreds of games
(since he was at Kansas, in fact), and I've never seen him "fill the lane." He
can't get there in time. Great shooter, though, even if you can't figure out how
he does it, year after year.

Forward.  Shawn Marion. He must have the ugliest shot in NBA history. He seems
to hold it out in front of him and push it off with a stiff arm. And yet it goes
in. He couldn't have gone to basketball camp as a youngster. He does everything
"wrong" and yet he's tremendously effective. And he's an outstanding defensive
player.

Guard:  Andre Miller. He's slow, he can't jump, he has no muscles in his arms,
and he can't shoot 3-pointers. But he's intelligent, makes the right decisions,
and throws the best alley-oop pass in the league. He's a marvelous player, way
undervalued.

Guard.  Omigosh, I can't think of another active all-overachiever guard,
so I'm going to go with Mark Jackson, now retired, who's the archetype. Not
particularly athletic, not big, not quick, not a leaper by any means, and yet
third on the all-time assist list. Smart though -- a Brooklyn boy.

Title: Boustrophedon, Rongorongo, and the Phaistos Disc
Date: May 03, 2010

In a previous post, I expressed fascination that writing could go in any
possible direction. I began with Swift, who satirized both "women" and the
English when he described the fanciful Lilliputian script: "their manner of
Writing is very peculiar, being neither from the Left to the Right, like the
Europeans; nor from the Right to the Left, like the Arabians; nor from up to
down, like the Chinese; nor from down to up, like the Cascagians; but aslant
from one Corner of the Paper to the other, like Ladies in England."

To Swift's curious catalog (the Cascagians are of course his own invention), I
added boustrophedon, a system that Swift did not know but one that would surely
have delighted him.

In boustrophedon (a lovely Greekish word that signifies "turn like an ox
plowing"), alternate lines move in opposite directions. Lines one, three, five
and seven and so on proceed from left to right; lines two, four, six, and
eight from right to left. Ancient languages such as Safaitic were written in
boustrophedon; some Etruscan inscriptions, still undeciphered, seem to follow
the same pattern.

Boustrophedon is not unreasonable, but it's certainly awkward for those of us
who have made a fetish of left to right. Here's how Shakespeare transforms
boustrophedonically. The passage takes a bit of effort to read but it's
certainly intelligible.

It is the cause, it is the cause, my soul,—

!srats etsahc uoy, uoy ot ti eman ton em teL

It is the cause. Yet I'll not shed her blood;

,wons naht sreh fo niks retihw taht racs roN

And smooth as monumental alabaster.

.nem erom yarteb ll'ehs esle, eid tsum ehs teY.

Right, left, up, down, aslant, and back and forth might seem to have exhausted
the possible formats. But such is not the case. Rongorongo, the language
of Easter Island, is written in still another style, that of "reverse
boustrophedon." In Lost Languages (2002), Andrew Robinson describes how this
most peculiar system works.

"To read a Rongorongo tablet, one started at the bottom left-hand corner and
read along line 1 to the right-hand corner. Then one turned the tablet through
180 degrees and began reading line 2 from left to right again,  At the end of
line 2, one repeated the 180-degree turn so that the tablet was in the same
orientation as at the beginning, and read line 3 from left to right and so
on....  Every even-number line is written back-to-front and upside-down in
relation to an ordinary English text."

I don't believe that even Jonathan Swift could have invented a manner of
composition so counter-intuitive, so odd.  But then, those Easter Islanders
(or, more properly, Rapanui) danced to a drummer who is uniquely their own. I
don't believe that there's a second reverse boustrophedonesque culture anywhere
on the planet.

Is that all? Are there no other possibilities? Yes indeed, there's also the
phaistos disc, which (according to Andrew Robinson once again), "was discovered
in 1908 by Luigi Pernier in the ruins of a palace at Phaistos in southern Crete.
The archeological context suggests that the date of the disc is 1850-1600 BC.
The disc is 6.5 inches in diameter and .75 inches thick and is made of fine
clay. On both sides is an inscription which consists of characters impressed on
the wet clay with a punch or stamp before it was fired. They are arranged in a
spiral around the center of each side."

The writing begins at the outermost circle and works its roundabout way towards
the center, which means either that the scribe knew exactly how many letters (or
ideographs, or syllables) he intended to use, or that he started at the center
and wrote backwards until he reached the circumference of the disc. Neither
method is particularly convenient or flexible, so it's not surprising that
spiral writing never caught on. It certainly wouldn't do for people like me who
revise heavily.

The phaistos disc cannot be translated.

Novacaine was discovered sometime around the turn of the last century, but it
hadn't reached the backward interior of Brooklyn during my childhood. As a
result, I endured hours of drilling and filling without anaesthetics. It was
horrible.

The local dentist was named Dr. Caress. It would have been more appropriate if
he had been called Dr. Butcher.

There were no high-speed drills. Dr. Caress used a mechanical drill -- a motor
attached to a system of small pulleys, if I remember correctly, at the business
end of which was some sort of bur. It was slow and awkward and It took forever
to drill out a cavity. There was lots of starting and stopping and moaning and
readjusting and rinsing and spitting. I can still remember the pain. It was not
a "discomfort" kind of pain. It was a torture kind of pain.

All this in the office of Dr. Caress.  I can't even imagine what it was like
across Ocean Parkway where the local dentist was named Dr. Yankowitz.

Title: Ditch the Didge!!
Date: May 09, 2010

The downtown mall is home to a motley assemblage of street buskers. Some
are excellent and welcome performers: the occasional string quartet, the
accomplished visiting bluegrass band, a witty gaggle of a cappella singers.
Others are less excellent but still tolerable; the contortionist, the magician
with the rings that divide and rejoin, the sword-swallower, the zip-code
man, the fire-eater, the too-young violin student supervised by his mommy,
the juggler whose act hasn't changed since the days when he was known as a
joculator. And then a step lower still: that inaudible French girl who struggles
with her ukelele. Less welcome are the drummers: bang, bang, bang with no
discernible rhythm, just noise great enough to set off sympathetic vibrations in
your own personal pancreas. But the worst of the worst is the didgeridoo-master.
After decades of practice, all that the didge player can produce is an ugly
drone. One note. It goes on and on, relentlessly, and it's dull, grating and
loud. If you haven't heard it, imagine a big old bagpipe, playing one note
at the bottom of its range, for ever, and ever, and ever. Worse still are
didgeridoo assemblies: didgetets or didgeridoo chamber orchestras.

The didgeridoo comes to us from northern Australia, where it was invented
more that 1500 years ago. Perhaps it hasn't evolved because it's thought to
be sacred. While the rest of the world developed wind instruments that played
a variety of colorful notes, the non-innovative didge people embraced an
unchanging and exceedingly boring drone. They are patient people. One by one,
native Australians said no to the bassoon, the clarinet, the horn, the sax, the
flute, the piccolo, the trumpet, the tuba, the oboe bright and cheerful, and
decided that a branch of a eucalyptus tree, naturally hollowed by termites,
was all that they needed in the way of wind-instruments. In another fit of
imagination, they invented the bull-roarer, an instrument that hasn't yet taken
a bow on the mall, but trust me, it won't be long.

Let's face it;  the didgeridoo is an instrument that hasn't produced a pleasant
sound in many thousands of years. It has no plans to do so. Didgeridooists are
barking up the wrong tree -- it's never going to be music. It's always going to
be noise.

Which brings me to my point, which is that would-be mall performers should
not be permitted to busk until they have passed a performance test and have
been granted a license. The Board of Acceptability would consist of some of
the more traditionalist faculty of both the Music School and the Department of
Theater and Drama. The chairman would be an open-minded but engaged citizen,
such as Me.  Approval must be unanimous. We (the Board) would strictly enforce
standards of artistic excellence. Life would improve.

Title: Mrs. Peixada by "Sidney Luska" (1886)
Date: May 10, 2010

I've just read, and much enjoyed, a novel called Mrs. Peixada, by one Sidney
Luska. The novel was published in 1886 by Cassell & Company, Limited, at 739
Broadway, in New York City. I had it recalled it from the library's archives,
where, from all the evidence, it hadn't been touched for a hundred or so years.
Why did I read this book? Because a) I'm reading stuff from the last two
decades of the nineteenth century, and b) because the novel is listed in the
bibliography of the wonderful anthology Victorian Love Stories (1996) edited and
illuminated by Kate Flint -- an anthology which persuaded me that although I
think of myself as moderately well read in Victorian fiction, there are untold
riches out there of which I am embarrassed to be unaware.

Mrs. Peixada isn't exactly a shower of gold, but it's a revelation. The author
"Sidney Luska" turns out to be a pseudonym for Henry Harland, who is better
known for his second career as an editor of the Yellow Book. I guess that
Mrs. Peixada falls into the broad category, novel of sensation, but it's also
a mystery story laced with occasional touches of social comedy and progressive
social thought.

The plot could be next year's blockbuster movie. Arthur Ripley woos and falls in
love with the mysterious young widow, Ruth Lehmyl, who has recently moved into
an apartment in his Beekman Place neighborhood. We're treated to the details
their sophisticated and modern courtship  -- music, museums, poetry. At the
same time, Ripley, a lawyer, has been engaged to track down a murderess named
Mrs. Peixada, who fled New York after being acquitted on grounds of insanity of
murdering her husband. Ripley tracks her from Vienna to Rome and to London, but
then loses her trail. He marries Mrs. Lehmyl --  only to discover that she and
Mrs. Peixada are one and the same person.

Although there are holes in the plot through which a daumont or shandrydan could
be driven with room to spare, the novel is engaging and intriguing. But then I'm
an easy mark.

Perhaps our screen writers aught to do some looking at the lower tier of
Victorian novels  -- especially if (as it seems) they're interested in making
lower-tier movies.

But for me -- it's time to learn more about Henry Harland.

Title: Crackanthorpe's Wreckage
Date: May 11, 2010

The Crackanthorpe name is not as well known as it should be. The short stories
in Wreckage (1893) are a good sharp antidote to the pieties and sentimentalities
of Victorian fiction.

There must be hundreds of novels which feature a virtuous, long-suffering
heroine, who, however mistreated, turns cheek after cheek until her patience is
rewarded with a beau and an unexpected inheritance. Think Jane Eyre.

Here is Hubert Crackanthorpe's version of this archetype:

"A blind desire to silence [Aunt Lisbet], to stamp the life out of her, swept
over Lilly. Seizing the parasol, which lay on the kitchen table, with all her
strength she Aunt Lisbet across the side of her head.

And over the thought of that blow she lingered, recalling it again and again,
repeating it in her mind with a strange, exquisite pleasure. For into it she had
put the hatred of years.

Aunt Lisbet uttered a low, plaintive moan -- the curious moan of sudden pain --
and fell, dragging with her on to the floor a pile of plates.

The crash sent every nerve in Lilly's body tingling, but when, a moment later,
Aunt Lisbet moved to get up, the blind, murderous desire returned. Another
brutal blow of the parasol, and she knocked her back again."

Hubert Crackanthorpe drowned (perhaps accidentally, perhaps taking his own life)
at age 26. His fiction is sometimes compared to that of de Maupassant, but I
prefer to think of him as the Dostoevsky that England never produced.

At the coffee shop, reading Crackanthorpe and drinking my horrid decaf tea, a
phrase from the conversation of the important-looking business guys at the next
table wafted my way. "We don't have to re-invent the wheel." Wow, I thought to
myself, does anyone still perpetrate that old cliche -- and do so without a
shred of irony or self-awareness?  I listened more closely to them and in less
than five minutes plucked the following flowers of wilted rhetoric:

"From the get-go" -- "chicken-and-egg problem" -- "here's the pressure point" --
"low-hanging fruit" -- "where the rubber meets the road" -- "that's the genie
coming out of the bottle" -- "it's fifty-fifty"  -- "here's my quick pitch."

All useful phrases, I suppose. Shorthand. But, nevertheless, kind of
embarrassingly banal.

If these guys sensed my disapproval, why, they'd probably laugh all the way to
the bank.

My advice to them, and to others similarly situated: when you use cliches, try
to think outside the box and turn it into a win-win situation. You don't have
to knock the ball out of the park, language-wise, but you don't need to throw
anyone under the bus either. It's all water under the bridge that we'll cross
when we get there. Can we agree to disagree?  When you look at this problem
from the 30,000 foot level, then, and only then, can you eat the elephant one
bite at a time. So, let's give it 110%. And, you know, if you fail to plan, you
plan to fail. Are we all on the same page?

Title: Still Another Directional Dyslexic Anxiety
Date: May 21, 2010

One of the awkwardnesses that we dysgeographicoids, or directional dyslexics
(or whatever you want to call us) have to come to grips with is -- being asked
for directions. You might just be walking down a street, more or less aware
of where you are, and a car pulls up next to you and a lady leans out of
the window and asks, how do you get to, let's say, the football stadium. I
don't know about you, but I immediately break into a sweat. Especially if
it's a place that I've been to a hundred times and ought to know like the
back of my hand. The best way to deal with the tension and anxiety generated
by such questions is to pretend complete ignorance: "I'm sorry, I'd like
to help you, but I'm a visitor here." Sure, it's an itsy-bitsy lie, but a
useful one, because the lady in the automobile is going to get much better
instructions from the next person she asks, who will probably be completely
normal, direction-wise.

I remember a particularly tragic instance of direction-giving-panic from my time
in England. I used to walk, once a week, from Charing Cross Station to the
British Museum. The streets were all a-tangle -- not a one of them parallel or
perpendicular. I carried a detailed map but nevertheless, week after week, I
managed to lose myself in the maze. I would have thought that I appeared to be
totally bewildered, but nevertheless, I was several times accosted by tourists
and asked the way to some monument or tube station. Of course I didn't have the
least clue.

Yesterday, walking to the library, a lady in an automobile asked me the
directions to Whole Foods. I  tried not to panic but I could feel the clammy
hand around my heart. "Which Whole Foods," I asked, stalling. "Nearest one."
Well, I've been there a hundred times, so I made an effort. Plus I knew it
was only two right turns. "A few blocks this way," I said, pointing, and then
turn right until 30th Street. Big shopping center on the left."  So the car
drove off and I spent the next ten minutes wondering whether I had given the
right directions. Is it after or before 30th Street? Is there an easier way?
Is the other Whole Foods closer than the one to which I sent her? What would a
directionally-gifted person have said?

But at least I hadn't sent her in the absolute wrong direction. I think.

The 6' 8" Russian oligarch and billionaire Mikhail Dmitrievitch Prokhorov,
chairman of the conglomerate Polylus Gold and president of the Onexim Group has
acquired the New Jersey Nets. The Nets (or as they are sometimes known, the
Swamp Dragons), are moving to Atlantic Yards in Brooklyn year after next, and
Prokhorov wants to change the team's name to something more germane. It's a
monumental challenge to find the correct moniker. After all, what Brooklynite
would be content with Brooklyn Nets, especially when the New Jersey team carries
with a storied history of failure, mismanagement, and dysfunction. Who can
forget the sale, for a few paltry bucks, of Dr. J himself?

Should the Nets be renamed the Brooklyn Dodgers? Too presumptuous by
half. In honor of Prokhorov, how about the Brooklyn Billionaires?  Not fan-

My good friend Otis Jefferson Brown proposes Brooklyn Eagles. I think it's a
brilliant idea. It has history, especially for those who remember the Brooklyn
Eagle (once edited by Walt Whitman -- 5 '11", 200); it has patriotism, it has
style, and it lends itself to headlines -- "Eagles Soar Once Again";  "Eagles
Tear Apart Hawks."

I finally got around to watching In America, a film which won all sorts of
awards in 2002 and which I ordered from Netflix after it appeared on someone's
best films of the decade list. It's a fine movie, especially if you enjoy piping
your eye from dawn to dusk. Always susceptible, I cried a full quart. Samantha
Morton, familiar from her role as Hattie in Sweet and Lowdown, is endowed with
the most expressive face in the history of cinema, and the director of In
America, Jim Sheridan, is smart enough to take advantage of her features.

The story is not unfamiliar -- immigrants in America, culture-clash and
assimilation, poverty and a bit of triumph at the end.  he film skirts
dangerously close to cliche and occasionally falls over the precipice -- I'm
sorry but I've seen too many movies in which an emotionally-stunted hero waits
until the final frame before he breaks into tears.

In America is at heart a drama about replacing the dead child. Johnny and Sarah
Sheridan lost a boy to a brain tumor and they've been off balance ever since. 
They're not going to be whole until they make another baby. Sarah's pregnancy is
precarious and the parturition difficult, and in a contrived piece of hoakum,
the baby doesn't begin to thrive until the suffering soul of a dying friend is
mystically infused into her.

No thought is given (nor should it be) to the poor baby, whose whole life will
be colored by her entrance into the world as savior and redeemer and who will be
freighted with expectations that she will never be able to fulfill.

It had been a while since I last flew Frontier --the airline with the cute furry
anthropomorphic talking mammals on their tails. There have been some changes
-- all of them for the worse. There's now an extra charge for each piece of
luggage. Those free meals are a thing of the remote past. So are the days when
you would get the entire can of ginger ale or tomato juice. It's now a splash of
juice in a cup of ice. No free TV -- you swipe your card, they swipe your cash.
The seats are smaller, too. More rows,less leg room. Wasn't there a time when
air travel was glamorous? Now it's just a big Greyhound in the sky, a warehouse
on wings.

Not only was my seat compressed, but the back didn't recline.  Somehow I had
signed up for a seat that bordered on the emergency exit row. In earlier planes,
such seats used to recline, but I'm guessing that Frontier has gained a few
inches by rendering the backs immobile -- at the cost of my comfort (but not at
reduced cost).

Adding to the insult is an unapologetic sign on the back of the seat in front
of me inscribed with the words NO RECLINE THIS SEAT. I wonder what language
the author of this sign think he is using. Not English, that's for sure. "No
recline this seat" does not even come close to parsing. What would it have cost
Frontier to affix a sign that read "the seats in this row do not recline." Where
do they outsource their signs -- to Mars? No recline this seat!!  Come on,
frontiersmen; you can do better than that. If you have no respect for me, at
least have a little respect for the language. The talking animals speak better
English.

To the chief of sign-makers at Frontier I say, "No hire this job."

There was another sign for me to stare out while I sat there, miserably cramped,
watching the clock. "LIFE VEST UNDER YOUR SEAT."  Is Frontier banging the
frugality drum a little too hard? The sentence might have read, "Life vest
IS under your seat."  How much could a trifling copulative verb cost?  If
Frontier wanted to be truly prodigal, it could even have raised the cash to
provide an indefinite article: "A life vest is under your seat." Wow. A complete
sentence!. What a concept!

Title: Childhood Memory and Prolegomenon to Any Future Epistemology
Date: June 17, 2010

I would have been six or seven years old, so it was 1945 or 1946. I was
visiting the apartment at 334 Eastern Parkway where my grandmother lived
with Aunt Mollie. Mollie and my father were engaged in an earnest conversation
of which I understood not a whit. I suspect that they were speaking the
language of the old country. Very likely they didn't want me to know what they
were saying.

I was on the floor studying what I now realize was some sort of halftone
illustration. Perhaps a magazine illustration -- something from Life or Look or
Collier's. Halftone is a style of reproduction in which a picture is comprised
of a myriad of tiny dots. When halftones are done inexpensively, as in comic
books, the dots are plainly visible. When they're done expertly, they're almost
beyond the perception of the human eye. But they're not invisible to the
inspection of a small child.

I said to my father and to my aunt something to the effect that "if you look
at this picture closely, you can see a lot of dots." I passed the illustration
to my father. He said, "No, there are no dots there." I said, "Look again. I
can see dots."  He looked again and so did Mollie. "Nope, no dots," they both
agreed. They handed back the picture and resumed their discussion. I had been,
in modern terms, totally dissed.

"Who are you going to believe? Me, or your own eyes?" says Chicolini in Duck
Soup.

I was shocked. My father, whom I knew to be correct in all things -- to deny
the existence of something that I could plainly detect. And my aunt as well.
Two adults, neither one who had ever been wrong about anything! What was going
on here? What was a child to think? It was a moment of great revelation, and a
turning point in my worldly experience.

Well, I wasn't about to argue with such formidable figures. But I knew in my
heart that I was right and they were wrong, wrong, wrong.

I also knew that I had to choose between Authority and my own senses. And of
course I chose sensation. The picture was made out of dots, no matter what they
said.

But my infant mind did not rest. At that moment, I knew that I would never ever
put blind trust in authority, never again. If my own father couldn't see the
dots and I could, then how could I believe anything that was contrary to the
evidence of my senses. My infant bosom got its back up, and I became a skeptic
-- and I've remained a skeptic.

It was not until many years later that I realized that the senses themselves
could be untrustworthy.  But by that time, my habits were fixed. In a contest
between authority and the evidence of the senses -- it would be sense all the
way.

There's an article in the current Harvard Magazine on the subject of
caregiving. (I've been thinking about caregiving quite a bit the last while,
because I've been the recipient of a lot of it, having been bedridden for a
couple of weeks with a slipped, or herniated, or ruptured disc). Taking care of
me has been a chore, performed with great grace and generosity by Mrs. Dr. M,
by Dr. M's oldest son, and by his son's wonderful wife.

The article on caregiving begins with a striking, unsettling anecdote.

In 1966, as a visiting medical student at a London teaching hospital, I
interviewed a husband and wife, in their early twenties, who had recently
experienced a truly calamitous health catastrophe. On their wedding night, in
their first experience of sexual intercourse, a malformed blood vessel in the
husband’s brain burst, leaving him with a disabling paralysis of the right
side of his body. Stunned and guilt-ridden, the couple clutched hands and
cried silently as they shared their suffering with me. My job was to get the
neurological examination right and diagnose where the rupture had taken place.

The author's point is that a diagnosis is incomplete in the absence of
compassion, not only in this most dramatic case but in more ordinary occasions.

It has been difficult for me to keep my mind off this traumatized young couple
--- stepping enthusiastically and it would appear naively into a first adventure
in sexual expression only to be overwhelmed by an out-of-the-blue horror. It's
a sorrow beyond ordinary sorrow. I wish that the author had added a paragraph
in which he reported that the young man recovered, that surgery corrected the
defect, and that the couple went on to live a long and satisfying life. I fear
that the absence of such a report means that there was no good news. Starting
with an aneurysm in the brain, it's easy to descend into scenarios of doom.

Ah life! So many potential disasters out there, so many bullets to dodge.

Even while I'm lying here, unable to get around without pain, I know that I've
lived a most fortunate life. No intercourse-related aneurysms, for one thing.

follies, and not a word of commentary?  How can it be, Dr. M? Cat got your
tongue?

Well, dear blogreaders, the fact of the matter is that Dr. M. has been sidelined
with an injury and has been languishing on the disabled list. Ruptured his disc,
he did. L5 if you want to be specific. On his back now these last two weeks,
gulping the oxycodone, enduring a series of trips down there to the regional
hospital. Dependent on family and friends for succor and sustenance

Lying here, solitary for longer periods than is his wont, Dr. M,, who never
had a mind for philosophy, has had an opportunity to meditate on a subject of
particular relevance to his condition. He's been thinking about pain. About
dealing with pain.

Sometimes even Dr. M has to deal with very practical problems.

At the hospital, various "providers" ask me, over and over again, to "put
a number from 1 to 10 on the degree of your discomfort."  "Imagine," they
say, that 10 is the worst pain that you can conceive, what is your number?"
For me, this becomes a very difficult question, and one to which I don't
know how to respond honestly or accurately. For one thing,  I have a rather
vivid imagination, and for another, I've read more than is healthy about
ingenious systems of medieval and "renaissance" torture. It's true that my
back hurts, and the pain is real, but it's nothing compared to the worst that
human beings have endured or can be compelled to endure. I'm sorry to say that
I can imagine pain an order of magnitude beyond what my questioner can begin to
conceptualize.

But if I should say, "one" on a scale of one to ten, they'd throw me out of the
hospital and give my place to a more deserving patient. So I say, "eight and a
half" or "nine" -- not because such a number has the least bit of meaning but
because I think I've given my interrogators the magic number that will allow me
to get the care I need.

I have a friend who had a very painful form of arthritis, but couldn't get the
attention of the medical establishment for many horrible months -- until he
answered the pain question with "I'm going to go out in the backyard and shoot
myself." Then he was diagnosed and put on medication in an hour.

Moreover, I don't know how to measure my pain against another's. My eight
might be someone else's five, or vice versa. I don't want to be theatrical
(I can't bear to be a spectacle), but I also have no desire to be excessively
stoical. A ruptured disc hurts. Ask anyone who's been there. Is it equivalent
to childbirth? I suspect not. I know that burns are supposed to be infinitely
more agonizing. I got to the point of wincing and moaning and feeling faint,
but not to fainting or writhing or screaming. And I could always get relief
from oxycodone, which is not always the case in more serious situations. I even
had some morphine, which, at the time, was surprisingly ineffective. Now I'm on
the road to recovery, I believe, and the pain is very much handled with those
horse- size ibuprofen. But ten days ago it was all narcotics, all the time. And
I was grateful for them. Very much so.

I am reminded once again that pain is isolating. It separates you from your
friends. You live in the pain, and with the pain, and you deal with the pain.
You can't communicate it and you don't want to communicate it.

I fault myself for not having been sufficiently empathetic during my lifetime to
the pain that other people have experienced.

While I've been lying here, I've read two books by daring people who do not
hesitate to court pain. The kind of person who decides to climb an unclimbable
mountain, break his leg and then drags himself miles, freezing, starving,
crippled. The kind of person who leaves warm hearth and happy home to walk to
the South Pole dragging a two hundred kilogram sledge. These folks endure all
sorts of horrors, voluntarily. Then they write books about their pain (whole
paragraphs which I involuntarily skim and skip). When I read these stories, I
feel like a wimp to complain about a ruptured disc. On the other hand, I feel
sane -- not to have deliberately injured myself for the sake of some wild,
inexplicable impulse.

Title: Miss Dusenberry
Date: July 17, 2010

Miss Dusenberry, an English teacher at Erasmus Hall High School, was a
formidable presence.

It was 1954 or 1955 and I was a junior, carrying just sixteen years of
experience on my skinny back. To my shy, inhibited self, Miss Dusenberry (Edna?
Grace?) was perceived as ancient (50s), statuesque (5' 10"), domineering (she
spoke authoritatively on all things literary) and wildly eccentric. She wore
fragrant cosmetics and bedecked herself with so many bracelets and bangles that,
striding imperiously around the room, she jingled atonally and constantly.

My schoolwork did not please her. Miss Dusenberry derailed my educational
career, demoting me from the honors track in English (where the bright students
were grouped and where lessons were taught) to the general track where
classrooms were disorderly, students ranged from noncompliant to sociopathic,
and it was assumed that nothing would be learned, and it wasn't.

Yesterday, on an odd nostalgic impulse, I re-read Hawthorne's Young Goodman
Brown for the first time in close to sixty years. The story is more shocking to
me now than it could possibly have been in the 50s, when I had no background
to understand puritanism or the manichean view of the world. The story is more
alarming in what it takes for granted about American culture than for what it
consciously critiques. Hawthorne's world is not and never has been, my America.

Not only was I distressed by the story, but my mind flew back, or regressed,
to Miss Dusenberry herself, who tried to present the story to unsophisticated,
un- empathetic me back there in the Duke Snider/Joe McCarthy/Sid Caesar
era. No wonder that I flopped in Miss D's class. Good grief, was I ever
unwordly/unPuritan! On my intellectual horizon, the big worry was whether Roy or
Gil might go hitless two days in a row. I had not the merest tad of experience
(or even reading) to bring to bear on the elucidation of a dark allegorical
treatment of severe Calvinist soul-sickness. Didn't, for that matter, know what
Christians were talking about, except that the women and the kids dressed up and
went to mass on Sundays (in our Neapolitan and Sicilian immigrant neighborhood,
men stayed home and washed the car). There were no devils, real, imaginary, or
allegorical in my deep, mysterious forests -- and no forests either, in concrete
Brooklyn. I had no concept of spiritual despair or sin or damnation or salvation
or any such things -- still don't in fact -- not in any personal way.

Anyway, back in Erasmus Hall, Miss Dusenberry led the class through some
stories by Hawthorne. We might even have read The House of Seven Gables --
that other novel, the one with the A-word, would have been far too sexual and
embarrassing. Then came the unit exam and that's when the allegorical world of
Calvinism hit the fan of naive Flatbush literalism. The topic on which we were
assigned to write an in-class essay was -- "Is there balm in Gilead?"

I got to tell you, I was buffaloed.

It's easy to look back now, sixty years later, and translate Miss Dusenberry's
question into "in Hawthorne's view, is there hope for spiritual redemption in
a fallen universe?" An invitation, I must say, to turn the bullshittery up to
eleven. But I didn't know the word "balm" and I had never heard of "Gilead."
I didn't know the hymn and I most certainly didn't know that there was any
such thing as a Book of Jeremiah which contained relevant dark sentences to be
interpreted allegorically or mystically.

So I failed, ignominiously. Not the worst failure of my childhood -- being
thrown out at home plate when I had been sent in as a pinch-runner was a
far greater ignominy. But to tell truth, I've never made my peace with Miss
Dusenberry. Her bangles occasionally rattle my sleep.

Hawthorne? well, I've just kind of set him to one side.

Title: Paternal Wisdom
Date: September 13, 2010

Regular readers of Dr. Metablog know that the good doctor has been flat on his
back for a couple of months.  However, I'm glad to say, the crisis has passed
and I'm upright once again.

While lying there I had an opportunity to think about old times. I began to
recall some things that my father used to say.  I wouldn't say proverbs or
gnomic wisdom or anything so formal -- just sentences that would occasionally,
casually, pass his lips.  Here are a few of them, lightly annotated.

1."Never omit an opportunity to do a someone a favor, and never be embarrassed
to accept a favor." My father would say, "people like to help each other."  My
own experience has confirmed my father's wisdom and I've tried to follow his
example. However, there was a time that I ran into a stone wall with this one, 
I was forced into close dealings with a man whom it was impossible to help --
because whenever I did something for him, he thought that it meant that he had
outwitted me. My favor, offered freely, became his triumph. Needless to say, our
relationship did not prosper.

2.  "Anyone can get rich if he makes it the entire effort of his life."  My father was the least materialistic person I've ever known. He had no possessions and wanted none. Not only did money hold no allure, but he was contemptuous of those who felt the need to acquire it. But was he right? Can "anyone" get rich?  I don't think so. I've known people who tried and have gone down in flames.  But I certainly understand my father's point.

3.  "When the stock market is going up, everyone's a genius." I know that my father owned one stock in his entire life -- because a friend insisted. He would have kept his cash in the mattress if he could have. I think that recent world economic events confirm his sentence and lead to a corollary -- "sometimes the geniuses only seem to be geniuses."

4.  "Never get into an argument with a drunk." He was certainly 100% on target on this one. There's just no odds -- even if you win the argument, the drunk doesn't know it. Plus the jerk is liable to throw the beer bottle at you. (I doubt that my father was drunk a single time in his entire life. I was drunk once, in 1962, and it was enough).

5.  "Try to do the things you're not good at." He said that when he was younger he would say, "I don't like to swim" when the truth of the matter was that he wasn't a good swimmer. (He was a fine athlete.)  He would counsel me -- "do what if you're not good at it. Try it."  I wish I could say that I've honored this precept, but in all honesty, I haven't. Sorry, pop.

6.  "Don't forget to wash behind your ears."

7.  "Always try to appeal to the better side of human nature."  For example, in raising children, you should not punish a child; instead, you should say, "you don't want to be the kind of person who would do such-and--such."  I believe this saying of his to be practical and useful. Needless to say, my father didn't respect  that side of the political/ religious/ social spectrum that considers human beings to be fallen, inherently depraved and selfish creatures. He was basically optimistic -- though his optimism was certainly tempered by the public events of his last decade.

8.  "Never run with the crowd for the sake of being one of the boys."  This saying was central to his view of the world. I believe it came out of some particular experience of his youth but he never shared the details with me. I can certainly say that I've honored this precept -- perhaps to a fault. I could have been more sociable, more "clubbable"

Title: "Scamels from the Rocke"
Date: September 17, 2010

Not only Shakespeare specialists, but lay readers and playgoers are puzzled
by Caliban's mysterious "scamels."

From the context, it's clear that scamels are an easily obtained food. Listen
as Caliban lists some of the items he can gather from his island's prodigious
storehouse:

I prithee let me bring thee where crabs grow;

And I with my long nails will dig thee pig-nuts,

Show thee a jay's nest, and instruct thee how

To snare the nimble marmoset.  I'll bring thee

To clust'ring filberts, and sometimes I'll get thee

Young scamels from the rock.

Alas and alack, there is no such thing as a "scamel."

Caliban's taste in food is catholic, as is to be expected of a hunter-
gatherer. Nevertheless, his is not an appealing diet. "Crabs" could refer
either to crustaceans or to crab-apples. "Pig-nuts" are barely edible tubers. A
"jay's nest" does not sound gourmetish, and even if Caliban means the jays
themselves, he's not chosen a species of bird famous for flavor. The "nimble
marmoset" is a small monkey which a 1613 pamphlet (too late for The Tempest,
written c. 1611) acknowledged to be "good meat". "Filberts"  Shakespeare's
spelling is 'Philbirts') are also called hazelnuts, the North American variety
of which -- the unappetizing beaked hazelnut -- is better browsed by our native
deer than by homines sapientes. But what, prithee, are these peculiar scamels?

Among the older guesses: shamois (young kids); scannel (a kind of hawk); scams
(a dialectical word for limpets, or snails); seamar, or wild trefoil; sarcelle,
the French word for the teal; scallion; seagull.

But modern scholarship has coalesced around "sea-mell." It's now thought (by
90% of those who have studied the question) that Shakespeare knew a manuscript
report about a shipwreck called "A true repertory of the wreck and redemption
of Sir Thomas Gates, Knight, upon and from the islands of the Bermudas...July
15, 1610," which was not printed until 1625 in Purchas his Pilgrimes. Among the
details that Shakespeare found in the "true repertory" was a brief account of
a bird called a "sea-meawe": "a kind of web-footed fowl there is, the bigness
of an English plover... [which] hovering in the air made a strange hollow and
harsh howling.... Our men found a pretty way to take them, which was by standing
on the rocks or sands ... whereof the birds would come flocking to that place
nearer and nearer."

"Sea-meawes"  (a variant of seamell) was the word that Shakespeare encountered
in the manuscript letter.

I believe that he read the second letter of sea-meawe not as an "e" but as a
"c", or, alternatively, Shakespeare's own ms "e" was misread as a "c" by Ralph
Crane, the scrivener who prepared a fair copy of Shakespeare's holograph for
publication --  or perhaps even the compositor  who was assigned to set the
Folio page A5v misread Crane's fair copy. A "scamel," I'm .9 positive, is a
seabird hunted from a rock; it's a sea-mew or sea-mell.

The Tempest is filled with words compounded of the prefix "sea" and a second
element: sea-nymphs, sea-sorrow, sea-change, sea-swallowed, sea-marge. Why would
Shakespeare not have been enchanted by the fortuitous "seamell?" Scamel indeed!

Title: Wood Heat, c. 1611
Date: September 19, 2010

There are many curious ideas and events in Shakespeare's Tempest. Here's a
trivial one that both bothers and amuses me. For what reason does Prospero
keep Caliban in his service and close to home even after he has tried to rape
Miranda? Here's the puzzling explanation offered by the great magus himself: 
"We cannot miss [do without] him.  He does make our fire,/ Fetch in our wood,
and serves in offices/ That profit us."

The very vague "serves in offices/ That profit us" tells us that even
Shakespeare had a hard time justifying Caliban, whose only occupation, it would
seem, is to keep the Prosperian fireplace well stoked. He's certainly not
keeping the books.

My puzzle: Prospero is a great magician. He can raise storms, put people into
trances, devise supernatural banquets and shows, release spirits from cloven
pines, and even (though we don't see it) raise the dead ("Graves at my command/
Have waked their sleepers, oped, and let 'em forth.") If he's so supremely
golldarned powerful why can't he magically gather his own firewood? Come to
think of it, why does he need firewood at all? Instead of using a stove or
fireplace, why does't he just command Ariel to warm things up a bit.

Now I am aware that my concern here is a little on the ridiculous side.
Shakespeare is simply making up an excuse to keep Caliban around because Caliban
is essential to the play. Nevertheless, it's an odd justification -- although
in truth no odder than that Shakespeare feels it necessary to give Caliban a
practical, down-to-earth function in such a wildly unmoored-to-reality play.

(When I was a teacher I would always run aground of the engineering student
who would explain to me that Gregor Samsa's metamorphosis into a beetle was
unrealistic because a beetle of human size couldn't be supported on insect
legs and would be too large to breathe through spirochetes. "It's a story," I
would respond. "A fiction. You have to suspend disbelief. You can't accept the
transformation but boggle at Gregor's breathing.")

Similarly, it is foolish for me to believe, so to speak, in Caliban, and yet to
worry about his log-carrying. Or about the temperature of Prospero's home.

But I think there is a point to be made about Shakespeare. He could imagine
magic but he could not get his mind around practical, down-to-earth post-
Baconian technology. He had no trouble making his characters fly, but he
couldn't imagine a room (or a cave) being heated except by wood, magically
chainsawed and laboriously stacked. In Cymbeline, impatient Imogen, in need of
quick transport to Milford Haven, asks for a horse with wings, not a helicopter.
Shakespeare was not a technological visionary.

Title: Brief Remarks on Fritters and Turnips
Date: September 22, 2010

Shakespeare's The Merry Wives of Windsor is a moderately successful play but
not among Shakespeare's greatest hits. Nevertheless, there are two fragments
of first-class witty dialogue that continue to tickle me even after all these
years. The first is Falstaff's indignation at Parson Evans's Welsh-accented
transformation of the words "cheese" and "butter." EVANS:  Seese is not good to
give putter. Your belly is all putter."  FALSTAFF:  "'Seese' and 'putter.' 
Have I lived to stand at the taunt of one that makes fritters of English."
There's no mystery about the the imaginatively inappropriate word " fritters" --
it simply means chopped meat fried in a batter.  I don't know why "fritters"
amuses me so, but it does. It's off-target and off-kilter and yet so very
concrete and specific.

The second, and even funnier moment, is when Anne Page, one of the few sensible
characters in the play, makes it clear that she won't marry the foolish Dr.
Caius. "Alas," she says, "I had rather be set quick i'th'earth/ And bowled to
death with turnips."  "Set quick" means "buried alive," presumably up to the
neck, but it's the lovely, unexpected "turnips" that produces the laughter,
perhaps because no one before or since has thought to employ the usually
harmless vegetable as a deadly weapon.  I read the police blotters, I should
know.

For the record, Shakespeare never, In the 38+ plays, used either word again. He
knew that he had squeezed meaning enough out of both "fritters" and "turnips."

Title: Somnus Imago Mortis
Date: September 27, 2010

It's an ancient commonplace -- sleep is the image of death.  In some versions,
it's a preparation for death: God has provided us with sleep to get us ready for
our inevitable end.  "Somnus imago mortis" is all over Shakespeare:  "sleep
thou ape of death,"  "death-counterfeiting sleep," etc.

My own personal sleep is so wracked with awakenings and nightmares and night-
sweats and fluff in the lung and a feverish tongue that I can't easily think of
it as a preparation for anything.  For me, sleep is rather a task, an effort,
than a period of oblivion.  I want my tombstone to be inscribed with the motto,
"No more insomnia, forever."

But just six weeks ago, I experienced a pure "somnus imago mortis" moment.  I
was on a gurney, drugged, prepared for surgery.  I was wheeled into a room. 
Time came to a complete halt.  And then several hours later I was awakened.
Nothing -- nothing -- intervened from the time that I was put under until the
moment when I came to. (Perhaps there was an amnesic in the drug cocktail -- I
wouldn't know.)

It was such a profound and eventless sleep that it has, in fact, prepared me for
the sleep of death.  There was not a whisper, not a thought, nothing.  Now, at
last, I know how it will be.

In the hospital, there was a very welcome rebirth.  But why, then, does the
phrase, "I have been half in love with easeful death" continue to resonate in my
brain?

Title: "Beyond Beyond."
Date: September 29, 2010

I sometimes think that I must be the world's number one fan of Shakespeare's
Cymbeline, which I have just re-read twice during the past week. Here's a play
that is seldom performed, infrequently read, rarely referenced, and omitted from
most university courses on Shakespeare. Although it's generally grouped with
the last plays or, as they have come to be called, the romances, surely fifty
people know The Tempest for everyone who is familiar with The Winter's Tale and
ten people know The Winter's Tale for everyone who knows (or has even heard the
name) of Cymbeline. Nevertheless, I love the play; it's perpetually entrancing.

Cymbeline is the most densely plotted of all of Shakespeare's plays and as
a result, it's difficult to follow, especially on the first dozen or score
of readings. It's so dense with plot that, in order to cram everything in,
Shakespeare devised a most elliptical and condensed style of speech. There are
some sentences to which I must still refer to the footnotes for explication --
and sometimes the footnote says, "seems to mean," or "perhaps means, but might
also mean."  Moreover, it's a hard play to read for those who don't come to it
with a deep familiarity with other of Shakespeare plays, because sometimes the
author seems to condense into a phrase or two an idea which he had explored more
fully in an earlier work. For example, in a number of the comedies there is an
opening scene in which characters discuss their unhappiness -- simply in order
to establish a situation in which the play can proceed from sadness to joy. And
frequently there's an early reference to the contrast between private emotion
and public posture.  n terse, economical Cymbeline, Shakespeare gets these
forms out of the way in a flash. An otherwise unknown "Gentleman" begins the
play: "You do not meet a man but frowns. Our bloods/ No more obey the heavens
than our courtiers/ Still seem as does the King."  And we're off and running. 
(Brief translation of the proceeding lines: everyone is sad because they attend
to the King's disposition.) It's a forbidding start -- but it covers an enormous
lot of ground. As it must, because Cymbeline brings on stage a wicked queen and
her doltish son, a physician expert in drugs that cause a person to simulate
death (just as in Romeo), a fair princess later to disguise herself as a page,
two brothers stolen from the court in swaddling clothes who will become military
heroes, an invasion of England by Roman forces, a low-born suitor of great worth
who will suffer exile but eventually return to claim his bride, an Italian
schemer who wagers than he can seduce a princess, and, moreover, the dream-
vision appearance of the hero's dead mother, father and brothers -- and finally
a guest appearance of Jove himself who descends on a machine to intervene
and prophesy. The play spends four and a half acts tying up thick plot-knots
and then a half an act unloosening them. Twenty-four misunderstandings are
clarified in couple of hundred lines. The conclusion is a miracle -- or rather,
a succession of miracles. Cymbeline is as manipulative as manipulative can be,
but I've never been able to read its last lines without dropping real tears.

My favorite scene, just to give an idea of how complicated and outrageous a play
it is, comes when Imogen (or in some modern texts Innogen), the princess, awakes
from drugged sleep to discover the ass Cloten (who "Cannot take two from twenty,
for his heart,/ And leave eighteen) to be dead, his head having been struck off,
but wearing the clothes of her lover Posthumus Leonatus (a long story). Imogen
naturally takes the one for the other, their bodies being apparently of the same
stature. She mourns her headless enemy as though he were her friend. It's a
truly bizarre, grotesque and wonderful scene. It is, as Imogen says in another
context, "beyond beyond."

Cymbeline is a rare treasure -- but it's not for the faint of heart, not for
skimmers.

Title: Beast of a Book
Date: October 03, 2010

I read Anatomy of a Beast by Michael McLeod, cover to cover, but I'm gol-durned
if I know why I did so.  A bad habit, finishing bad books.  And it is a bad
book -- badly written and badly edited.  Well, I'm exaggerating.  It's not all
that bad.  There's enough material in its 222 padded-like-an-old mattress pages
to make a good 2200 word essay.  Why is this book published by the University
of California Press when there are so many serious academic manuscripts unable
to find a publisher.  Anatomy of a Beast has "trade book" written all over it
-- the breathless first-person narrative, the transparently-contrived Quest, the
anecdotal style.

Good golly, Miss Molly, I'm allowing myself to get carried away.

What's it about?  Anatomy of a Beast examines the Bigfoot legend.  Finds it
false, a concoction of fakery and gullibility.  So far so good.  But that's
as far as it goes.  There's no persuasive analysis of the phenomenon and no
serious attempt to relate it to other frauds, conspiracy theories and other
spiritualisms and mass delusions.

Why is the famous Bigfoot film of 1968 still taken seriously years even after
the man who wore the gorilla suit has confessed?   I don't know.  Nor do
I know why crop circles are given tv-time after the man who perpetrated the
fraud described exactly how he did so.  Why are there posters on billboards
all over my town, today,  advertising "A Course in Miracles" to be offered by
a guy whose credential is that he just returned from India having studied with
some revered swami (and this 250 years after Hume's Essay on Miracles)?

Why do people -- apparently sensible people -- ask me if I think that
Shakespeare really wrote the plays?   Why do a majority of Americans not
"believe in" evolution?

Has the Age of Reason been cancelled?

A better, more challenging discussion of Bigfoot and other "cryptozoological"
fantasies might have earned a place in the story.  Not this disappointing book.

Title: A Conversation in Romeo and Juliet
Date: October 04, 2010

The artistry of Romeo and Juliet I.v.30-41 is, I fear, under-appreciated. It's
an utterly revolutionary moment in the history of the drama, but it's so subtle,
so art-that-hides-art, that it easily slips under the radar. Let me quote in
full.

Capulet.  Nay sit, nay sit, good cousin Capulet,

For you and I are past our dancing days.

How long is't now since last yourself and I

Were in a masque?

Cousin Capulet.   By'r Lady, thirty years.

Capulet.  What, man, 'tis not so much, 'tis not so much.

'Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio

Come Pentecost as quickly as it will,

Some five and twenty years: and then we masqu'd.

Cousin Capulet.  "Tis more, 'tis more, his son is elder, sir:

His son is thirty.

Capulet.    Will you tell me that?

His son was but a ward two years ago.

Romeo.  What lady's that which doth enrich the hand

Of yonder knight?

Romeo and Juliet is a play of rhetorical experimentation. In its course,
Shakespeare employs extravagant puns and wordplay, rhyme, prose, embedded
sonnets, stichomythia, two passages of contrived, Petrarchan oxymora, outrageous
bawdy, lament both real and parodic -- everything, in fact, that was in the
garner of a 1590s playwright.

The overlooked conversation between old Capulet and his cousin is an
innovative piece of rhetoric of Shakespeare's own invention. It's simply
everyday, colloquial conversation -- in his time, a complete and utter novelty.

It's two old guys talking the way old guys talk when they're savoring the past.
Repetitions: "'tis not so much, 'tis not so much" and "'tis more, 'tis more";
mock challenge: "will you tell me that"?; references to details known only to
the participants: "Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio..."; homely exaggerations:
"His son was but a ward two years ago." Even though Shakespeare casts the
passage in blank verse, he manages to capture the authentic sound of real
people engaged in real conversation.

But why?  It's all a trick or device to set off the sentence of Romeo's that
follows.

Unlike the Capulet cousins, Romeo is wholly captured by the language
of splendid and hyperbolic love-longing. Shakespeare therefore encourages his
audience to contrast the everyday quality of "His son was but a ward two
years ago" with Romeo's "What lady's that which doth enrich the hand/ Of
yonder knight." Needless to say, there are no knights at this merchant-class
gathering. "Knights" are a creation of Romeo's imagination. So is
the slightly archaic phrase "yonder knight," which is directly out of the
world of romance and clashes magnificently with the context that Shakespeare
has so carefully contrived. So too the inversion "what lady's that" instead of
"who is that lady" and the highly poetical (and supremely beautiful) "enrich
the hand."

Romeo's sentence is at the same time very serious and highly comic -- a triumph

Title: Horse Feathers (1932) /Everyone Says I Love You (1996)
Date: October 06, 2010

Goodness gracious! I should have known that the two films were distant cousins
-- after all, Woody Allen's film (one of his very best, and certainly his most
genial) ends with an extended tribute to Groucho in which everyone wears
phony mustaches and pretends to puff on stogies. But not having taken a look
at Horse Feathers in twenty or thirty years, I failed to realize how much
Woody had borrowed. How could I have forgotten that Everyone Says I Love
You extracts and transforms two songs from Horse Feathers: "I'm Through With
Love" as well as its own title song. And of course it shares its liberated
and episodic series- of-skits structure not only with Groucho but with all
vaudevillians. Not to mention a willingness to throw logic to the winds or under
the bus for the sake of a gag. Everyone Says I Love You is a lovely, gentle
film (much more mild than its raucous unsubtle predecessor).

Its exhilarating choreography is very distinctly not indebted to anything in the
earlier film.

Some ambitious scholar could write an illuminating essay on Woody's Marxism.

Date: October 07, 2010

I had a prescription to fill for amoxicillin.  I noticed that there's a
new pharmacy on Pearl Street;  or at least I thought there is.  It's
called by the very pharmacy-sounding name Boulder Rx.  I walked in: 
very definitely not a pharmacy.  Not when there's a large illustration
of marijuana leaf and a sign that reads "Headies."  And a very thick probably
bullet-proof plate glass window separating customers from clerk.  Sign of the
times.  MMJ (medical marijuana) is now perfectly legal here in Colorado.

I took my prescription elsewhere.

From the Boulder Rx website:  "Menu: Bubba Kush, Tangerine Kush, Sour D,
Chemdog, Godfather, Sour Kush, Purple Cinderella, Mananuska, OG Kush." 
Different strains, not doubt designed to attack different diseases.  I wonder
exactly what is cured by Purple Cinderalla.

Toto, I've a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.

Title: We Are All Frail/  Brooks Conrad
Date: October 14, 2010

Even moderately serious baseball-watchers know that we've just experienced a
disaster of the Mickey Owens-Willie Davis-Bill Buckner variety. Poor Brooks
Conrad, a journeyman infielder, playing for the Atlanta Braves in an important
playoff game, committed three horrible errors. He bobbled a ball, dropped a
popup, and then, with the game on the line, let a routine grounder go right
through his legs. He was nutmegged, as they say in soccer. Game over, Atlanta
eliminated. The hi-def TV camera focussed on him, allowing millions of Americans
to lipread the poor guy's puzzled, exasperated, embarrassed, "What the fuck."
Interviewed after the game, Conrad was more decorous but no less defeated: "I
wanted to dig a hole and go to sleep in it."

Sleep won't do it, because Conrad's errors will be re-played forever and ever
and ever.

The play that lost the game was one that Brooks Conrad has made time and time
again -- at Arizona State, during his ten years in the minors, and during
his three-year (229 at bats, 53 hits) and now completed major league career.
He wouldn't have been in the game -- as a substitute for the injured Martin
Prado -- if he didn't have the ability to put a glove on a pop fly or handle
a ground ball. One of the announcers called it accurately:  "they say you
make errors with the glove but in this case the problem is right between his
ears."  Brooks Conrad somehow lost the ability to do things that should have
been entirely routine  -- which is why I feel so sorry for him, and why I
identify so strongly with him.  It could happen to anybody, anytime. I remember
once driving along on a big four-lane and for a second I forgot which foot
operated the accelerator and which the clutch.  I panicked, momentarily, but I
recovered, and no one ever knew.  didn't have millions of people watching me
and clucking.

I'm glad to say that the next day, when Brooks took the field during warmups (he
was mercifully held out of the game), Atlanta fans gave him a big cheer. "We are
all frail," as Angelo says, and it's not wrong for us to be reminded of it once
in a while. But poor Brooks, condemned to a lifetime of waking up in the middle
of the night, Buster Posey's grounder skidding past his glove and through his
legs, runners endlessly, one after another, in an infinitely loop, crossing home
plate to the deafening roar of the crowd.

Title: Milagro 51, Ciencia 49
Date: October 18, 2010

A Chilean newspaper, El Espectador, has reported the results of a poll of
its readers. When asked about the recent rescue of the thirty-three Copiapo
miners, 49% of readers attributed the success to "ciencia" while 51% judged it
a "milagro." A miracle?  It what universe?  What could they be thinking? The
rescue was all hard work and ingenuity and high speed percussive drilling.
There's nothing the least bit supernatural about such a triumph.

Nor does it do any good to blame those primitive superstitious Chileans.
Americans would have divided  similarly -- with a higher score for "milagro" in
our ultra-benighted South and a somewhat lower score in the only semi-benighted
North. Even on my very own Facebook page, a number of friends of "friends" (not
my own "friends" I'm glad to say), posted exultantly, "This proves that God is
real."  No it doesn't -- it proves only that the true believers have no use for
evidence or reason. Why does the great signifier in the sky get the credit for
the rescue but no blame for the collapse that caused the disaster. And would the
god-enthusiasts have abandoned their belief if the men had died. Not a chance.
They would fallen back on the old bromide, not for us to question the will of
god -- or employed some other kind of trapeze artist illogic.

A miracle! Humbug! If a superman-like hand of god had come down from the heavens
and drilled the hole, I would vote milagro also. Otherwise, ciencia.

What is a miracle, anyway?  I thought that David Hume finished off miracles
a quarter of a millennium ago. Miracles are not "unlikely events," he said.
 "They are events that are contrary to nature." The mine rescue may have been
a long odds situation, but it wasn't unnatural. It was entirely in accord
with what we know about the world and human psychology and the ciencia of
mining. (Hume capped his argument by saying that there can be no such thing as a
miracle, because if it happens, then it's not contrary to nature. It is nature.)

But all of us use the word "miracle" very loosely. I may know, with one part of
my brain, all about eggs and sperm and DNA, but I still feel that it's something
of a miracle whenever a baby is born. Although it's a common miracle -- billions
strong --I'm awed by each and every newborn. As I am by the Chilean miners and
their rescuers. I'm awed, I'm relieved, I'm joyous, I'm dazzled, but most of
all, I'm proud of the compassion, the resilience, and the intelligence of my
fellow human beings --and there you have my understanding of the word "milagro."

Title: Prostituting that Past-Cure Malady
Date: October 24, 2010

i''ve read All's Well that Ends Well many times (thrice just in the last
week), always with puzzlement and  dissatisfaction. It's a confused and
confusing play. My best guess is that Shakespeare got going on some appealing
but intractable material and struggled with it for many years but was never
able to bring it to a satisfactory conclusion.

Until this last reading, I had never paid much attention to the King of France
who is, I think, more of a plot mechanism than a rounded character. Shakespeare
never even bothered to give him a first name -- he's "King" but whether Charles
or Louis or Lothair we're never told. He plays a crucial part in the fable,
because, dying of a "fistula," he is cured by our heroine Helen and in exchange
grants her the husband of her choice (her obsession, actually) -- the handsome
soldier and crass lout Bertram. Later in the play, after Bertram has fled from
the marriage, the King again intervenes to restore him (against his will) to
Helen. The King is short-tempered and highly conscious of his regal status -- as
Kings are in literature -- but he is not particularly eloquent or interesting.

But in my most recent reading, I was struck by some lines that I had not
registered in my salad days. Helen urges the King to allow her to try her
"receipts" (i.e. prescriptions or drugs) on him. He resists, of course, simply
so that Helen may overcome another contrived obstacle. But the King's sentences,
fable apart, are very pertinent, most particularly to those of us who have
staggered to life's endgame:

We thank you, maiden,

But may not be so credulous of cure,

When our most learned doctors leave us and

The congregated college have concluded

That laboring art can never ransom nature

From her inaidable estate. I say we must not

So stain our judgment, or corrupt our hope,

To prostitute our past-cure malady

To empirics, or to dissever so

Our great self and our credit to esteem

A senseless help, when help past sense we deem.

"Empiric" is Shakespearean for "phonies."  The King will not compromise his
rationality or his dignity by indulging himself with the sixteenth-century
version of faith-healers, herbalists, reiki masters, homeopaths, naturists or
any other of the enormous plague of quack-quacks who litter our anti-rational
landscape.

Good for him, I say, even though, as it turns out, he's wrong and the maiden
successfully works her receipts. Shakespeare keeps us out of the sickroom,
so we don't know exactly what she prescribes (just as well), but we do learn
that the credulous bystanders attribute the cure not to science but to divine
intervention. As the very orthodox and conventional Lafeu puts it, "They
say miracles are past, and we have our philosophical persons to make modern
(i.e. routine, everyday) and familiar, things [that are] supernatural and
causeless.  Hence it is that we make trifles of terrors, ensconcing ourselves
into seeming knowledge when we should submit ourselves to an unknown fear
(i.e. fear of the unknown)" -- an interpretation that might made sense in
Shakespeare's scientifically-ignorant late medieval world, but which is no
longer applicable.

Nevertheless, I trust that when my time comes, I will follow the King's good
example and come to terms with reality rather than succumb to irrationality and
"esteem a senseless hope."

Title: Scary News from Longmont, Colorado
Date: October 25, 2010

Sometimes I can't make the slightest sense of what I read in the newspapers. 
Here's an example.  But first some sheep news.

The desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis nelsoni), smaller than the ordinary
bighorn and one of the rarest and most endagered our native mammals, has
been reduced to dry ranges in Nevada and California, near rocky cliffs in
almost waterless environments. "Hunting has been prohibited or controlled
since the early 1900s, but much illegal poaching still occurs.  The subspecies
Ovis canadensis auduboni of the Black Hills and adjacent areas has already
become extinct."

Now the newspaper report.  The Longmont Times-Call celebrates a local
heroine, Ms. Sara Brandenburg.

"At age 15, Brandenburg became the youngest female in the world to the earn the
North American Grand Slam after shooting and killing four different species of
North American wild sheep — a dall, a stone, a Rocky Mountain bighorn and a
desert bighorn.  She shot a 230-pound dall sheep Aug. 17, 2009, in Alaska and
pinned her final animal — a 220-pound stone sheep — in the Yukon Territory
on Aug. 8, four days before her 16th birthday.The previous record-holder was
a 32-year-old, according to the Grand Slam Club/Ovis.When she shot the stone
sheep — the final one for her grand slam — tears poured down her face.
“It’s a big emotional rush when you get it,” she said.  While working
on the record, Brandenburg, who is a sophomore at Longmont Christian School,
missed two months of classes. She ended the year with a 4.0 grade-point average,
in part because she hauled textbooks on hunts. Moments before shooting her
desert bighorn sheep in Mexico’s Baja Desert, she was finishing algebra
homework.  Her father, Rod Brandenburg, taught Sara and her older sister,
Katey, 18, to hunt at an early age, instilling in them the same pioneer spirit
his great-grandfather had when he moved from Germany to homestead in the 1870s
in Westcliffe, Colo. He estimated it cost about $120,000 to arrange for Sara
to kill four sheep. When friends remark about the cost, Brandenburg says it was
worth it.  “I couldn’t afford not to,” he said.  When he watched Sara
shoot her final sheep, a wave of relief, exhilaration and admiration washed
over him, he said.  Last month, she took up archery and hopes to repeat the
grand slam with a bow this time or advance to the Super 10 title, which is
awarded to hunters who shoot and kill 10 North American big-game animals.  In
addition to sheep, Sara Brandenburg also has shot and killed three antelopes,
one white-tailed deer and one black bear, as well as a gemsbok, an eland, a
wildebeest and a zebra during a hunting trip in South Africa."

I don't understand blood sports.  I find them repulsive and inhuman.

Am I missing something?  The Brandenburg family values ($120,000 to kill four
rare sheep) are disgusting, sociopathic, and barbaric.   Are these people
locked into the Stone Age?

Title: Who Is Violenta?  What Is She?
Date: October 27, 2010

Here's a puzzle about a character's name that will interest detectives
or dedicated Shakespeareans -- and perhaps only the most dedicated of
Shakespearean detectives.

As everyone knows, the "heroine" and dominant figure in Twelfth Night is
an audacious, sensitive, and intelligent young lady to whom Shakespeare
gave the name Viola. It is Viola who, shipwrecked on the Illyrian shores,
disguises herself as a man, enlists herself as a servant to Duke (or Count)
Orsino, whom she rapidly comes to admire, and is then dispatched by
Orsino to woo in proxy his beloved, Lady Olivia the recalcitrant. Viola
has the misfortune, while in mannish guise, to provoke Olivia's romantic
interest. The complications that arise from these mistakings take five amusing
acts to resolve. But it's Viola's play, from first to last, and there is no
question about her identity or her name.

Viola first comes on stage in the second scene of the play. The stage
direction in the 1623 Folio is unambiguous. Enter Viola, a Captaine, and
Saylors. In the speech headings throughout the play, Viola regularly appears
as Vio., just as Maria is Mar., Clown is Clo., and Malvolio is Mal. There
is but one exception to this practice -- and here begins the mystery. In
the middle of Act 2, scene 5, Viola comes as ambassador to Olivia but the
stage direction reads, inexplicably, Enter Violenta. Who is Violenta, what is
she? Inasmuch as Viola's name has been and will continue to be Viola, how
did it happen that just this one time she comes to be called by a similar
but very different name? The most likely explanation is that it's a mere
slip -- either an error of the compositor who set the Folio line, or an error
of the scribe who made a fair copy of Shakespeare's manuscript, or of W. S.
himself, nodding over his quill and inkhorn.

But for Shakespeareans, "Violenta" is most interesting name. While the
playwright created no characters named Violenta, there was one time when he
came very close to doing so. The near-Violenta almost appears in  All's
Well That Ends Well, the play that is printed in the Folio just before
Twelfth Night. In All's Well, Helen, who is obsessed with Bertram, pursues
her absconded and disloyal husband to Florence. There she discovers that
Bertram has been wooing a woman called Diana. But Diana was not originally
conceived as Diana. She had a momentary and evanescent pre-existence
as Violenta. Enter old Widdow of Florence, her daughter, Violenta and
Mariana, with other Citizens." So says the stage direction, but in the scene
that the s.d. introduces, there is no Violenta. No person of that name says
a word. In her stead there appears a Diana (or Dia.), whose entrance onto
the stage is unannounced. Diana appears where Violenta was heralded. Clearly
Shakespeare changed his mind.

It is therefore clear that the Folio compositors were working with a holograph
that preserved Shakespeare's first thoughts. Diana, the o-so-pure maid whom
Bertram cannot conquer, was orignally intended to be Violenta, who, it is
reasonable to infer from her name, would have repelled the young seducer's
advances not with virtue but with shrewishness. Later, when Shakespeare
altered his conception, Violenta turned into the mirage or ghost who both is
and is not present in All's Well.

The Violenta of All's Well can therefore be understood as a first pass at
Diana. But what possible explanation is there for the substitution of
Violenta for Viola in Twelfth Night?  It's a hard question, and the
not-entirely- satisfactory but best answer is that the typesetter who worked
on both of these plays (Compositor B, so-called) carried the name from one
play to the other. Let us suppose that he had just set "Enter... Violenta"
in All's Well when he resumed work on Twelfth Night. There he encountered
the abbreviation "VIo." and, the longer name still reverberating in his
mind, expanded Vio. to Violenta.

That's the end of the story. But there's a fascinating postscript. When,
in All's Well, Bertram makes his move on Diana, there's this exchange
(including the introductory stage direction):

Enter Bertram, and the Maide called Diana.

Ber. They told me that your name was Fontybell.

Dia. No, my good Lord, Diana.

Fontybell? Beautiful fountain? It would seem that Diana/Violenta once had
still another name. Or that Shakespeare wants us to think so.

"They told me that your name was Fontybell" is a pure, lovely, and haunting
line of poetry, but it's unrelated to anything else in the play. It's a
free-standing mystery, utterly without explanation.

Title: In Which the Blogger Loses his Cool
Date: November 02, 2010

The Takacs Quartet graces us with six superb concerts a year.  It's true
that they sometimes hanker after strange new composers -- Psathos, Part etc.
-- whose compositions set my teeth on edge like the vile squealings of the
wry-necked fife or like a brazen canstick turned or like the gratings of a dry
wheel on an axletree  -- but mostly they play what distinguished Quartets are
ordained to play, that is, the great central European tradition from Haydn
to Brahms.  But last night, the Takacs, eek and alas, ventured into new
and grim territory.  Horribile dictu, they offered an original, commissioned
Drama that purported to be Serious and Illuminating.  It warn't.  It was
a interminable playlet about Beethoven's last years founded on the composer's
letters and conversation books.  It was barren.  It was predictable,
uninsightful, reductive, shallow, witless, dull, and pretentious.  I started
to squirm (boredom feeding on embarrassment and embarrassment on boredom)
after a couple of minutes, then broke into a sweat, but after a few minutes
resigned myself to my middle-of-the-row captivity and I did what I always do
in such situations -- recited to myself long-ago-memorized poetry.  When the
Drama mercifully ended, I was consoled to hear the woman in front of me (a
member of the music faculty) say to her companion, "Do you think they know how
bad that was?"

Do they?  I hope so.  I hope that the playwright, a tyro named  ------
Morse, recognizes that he's not Tom Stoppard or even Tom Stoppard diluted to
a 1% tincture, and that he takes up a profession that inflicts less pain on
innocent bystanders.

I left dispirited, especially for the actors, who tried to force a marriage
of Shakespearean style of performance to prosaic vocabulary and sentence
structures.  I do not use the word "Shakespearean" in a good way:  I refer
to that highly artificial, unnatural way of speaking and moving that, inherited
and debased from an ancient tradition, has stupefied and narcotized dutiful
culture- hungry audiences at summer festivals all over America.  Shakespeare
himself was clear that he did not want his actors to strut and bellow, but strut
and bellow was what they did last night.  If the actors did not split the
ears of all the groundlings, they certainly split mine.  Why do they speak
in that ridiculous manner when their aim should be "to hold the mirror up to
nature."  It's wrong of me to say so, but I felt that I could look into the
soul of the actor who played Beethoven and see a man who imagined that  he
was playing Lear at the Old Vic, when he was in fact performing in a play that
might, just might, satisfy the requirements for an M.A. in creative writing
at some off-brand college ("he's worked very hard on this so we might as well
pass him"), and that he was going to show "them" how it's done, but instead he
offered us sufferers a copy of a copy of a pale copy.

Egads, I'm breaking into a sweat again just thinking about it.

I pay good money to hear the Takacs -- and concert after concert, I get my
money's worth, and much more.  I want Schubert.  I want Mozart.  If I wanted
amateur theatricals, I would go to he local dinner theater.  Or to the high
school around the corner.

Title: Gamboge-coloured Bluchers
Date: November 08, 2010

I have, on occasion, noted that modern readers of the great classic novels of
the previous era are unaware of the social significance of horses and horse-
drawn vehicles.  As I wrote, right here on this blague a couple of months ago,
"no, I'm not obsessed, it's just that I have this little bee in my bonnet about
the fact that we gasoline-era moderns understand exactly what is meant when
our hero arrives in a jeep, Jaguar, Jetta, or jalopy, but we are utterly
clueless as to the valence of barouche, basket carriage, berlin, britchka,
brougham, buckboard, buggy, cabriolet, caleche, cariole, carryall, chaise,
chariot, clarence, concord wagon, coupe, croydon, curricle, cutter, daumont,
dearborn, dennet, diligence, dog-cart, fiacre, fly, four-wheeler, gig, go-cart,
governess cart, hansom, herdic, jaunty car, jersey-wagon, kibitka, landau,
phaeton, post-chaise, rockaway, shandrydan, shay, spider-phaeton, spring-van,
stanhope, sulky, surrey, T-cart, telyezhka, tilbury, tarantass, trap, troika,
victoria, vis-a-vis, wagonette, or wurt."

I'm not the only person who has taken note of the variety of horse-drawn
vehicles.  In an early essay (one of the Sketches by Boz), Charles Dickens
reported that the road to Greenwich Fair was "in a state of perpetual bustle. 
Cabs, hackney-coaches, "shay" carts, coal-waggons, stages, omnibuses, sociables,
gigs, donkey-chaises -- all crammed with people... roll along at their utmost
speed."  What, pray tell, is a "sociable?"

In another of Dickens' sketches, a newborn is taken to be christened in
a "glass-carriage." It can't be made of glass;  it must be windowed.

On an "assembly night", "a 'double-fly' was ordered to be at the door of Oak
Lodge at nine o'clock precisely."  A "double-fly" would appear to be twice as
large as your run-of-the-mill fly.  Twice as long?  Twice as wide?

As little as I know about vehicles, it appears that I know less about
nineteenth-century clothes for men.  What does it mean that one of
Dickens' characters wears "cordury knee-smalls?"  Fashionable or ridiculous? 
What about "spotless inexplicables?"  "Black knee-shorts?"  "A black-glazed
stock?"  "Cloudy Berlins?"  "Drab shorts and continuations?"   "Knee-cords
and tops?" What does it mean that a man had "various particles of sawdust,
looking like so many inverted commas, on his inexpressibles."  And what,
finally, are "gamboge-coloured Bluchers?"  I can't even begin to imagine. 
Help!  I need an annotated Boz.

Title: All About Antres
Date: November 14, 2010

"Antres" is among the rarest of rare words. Shakespeare's Othello speaks of
"antres vast and deserts idle" in the magnificent oration in which he takes
issue with the Venetian bigotry that claimed that he was only able to win
white Desdemona by employing drugs and witchcraft. No, it wasn't because he
was a sorcerer; it was because he was accomplished, heroic, romantic. "Antres"
is one of the exotic words that defines the great African general as a
non-Venetian -- an outlander, an "erring barbarian," an "extravagant and
wheeling stranger."

Shakespeare coined "antres" just for the occasion, deriving it from Latin
antrum, a cave. He never used "antres" again, nor did anyone else until
Keats fleetingly revived the word two centuries afterward. "Antres" never
domesticated into English and remains curious and remote, eternally in need
of an explanatory footnote. It is unlikely that Shakespeare expected that a
popular or even a courtly audience would grasp "antres" at first hearing. It's
a risky word, but Shakespeare didn't become Shakespeare without taking risks.

The playwright coupled the neologism "antres" to another shiny new Latinism
to produce "antres vast," a phrase which translates into the language
of 2017 as "really big caves." Yet no translation can do justice to
the spacious resonance of "antres vast." The caverns to which Othello
refers are monstrously huge -- grown grander and even more inaccessible
because Shakespeare ingeniously placed the modifier after rather than before
the noun. "Antres vast" are a hundredfold more mysterious -- darker, more
echoic, more glinty with stalactites and stalagmites -- than "vast antres."

"Antres vast" occurs in tandem with a second and equally remarkable noun-
adjective combination: "deserts idle." Othello reports that before he came to
Venice, he had not only traversed "rough quarries, rocks, and hills whose
heads touch heaven" but had also dwelt among "antres vast and deserts
idle." Strictly speaking, deserts cannot be "idle," but they can be vacant
or useless. "Deserts idle" reinforces and augments "antres vast." Taken
together, the two phrases are infinitely more evocative than either alone.

As a structure of sound, "antres vast and deserts idle" pivots on the "d"
of "and" and the "d" of "deserts" and it positions "antres" and "idle"
in symmetrical opposition. The two key words are dissimilar yet cleverly
interlinked, each comprised of an open vowel (Antres, Idle), a dental (anTres,
iDle), and a liquid (antRes, idLe). It is not by accident that "antres vast
and deserts idle" is such a euphonious and mouth-filling phrase.

Shakespeare not only invented "antres" for Othello's oration but also took
care to surround it with other linguistic novelties. For example: Othello
claims to have encountered "cannibals that each other eat/ The anthropophagi."
"Cannibal" is now a commonplace noun, but in 1604 it was a newcomer to the
language. "Cannibal" derives from "Carib," the name of a recently-encountered
people-- reputed to be man-eaters --who gave their appellation to the sea in
which they lived. "Cannibal" was sufficiently strange--it had only made harbor
in England (arriving by way of Spain) in the 1550s--that Shakespeare felt a
need to define it, which he did once in English ("that each other eat") and
once in Greek ("anthropophagi"). "Anthropophagi," a word that had originated
with Herodotus, was as new to English--and as seldom employed--as "cannibal."

"Antres vast," "deserts idle," "cannibals" and "anthropophagi" play crucial
parts in Othello's stirring autobiographical fragment.

I spake of most disastrous chances,

Of moving accidents by flood and field,

Of hair-breadth scapes i'th'imminent deadly breach,

Of being taken by the insolent foe

And sold to slavery;  of my redemption thence,

And portance in my travel's history:

Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle,

Rough quarries, rocks, and hills whose heads touch heaven,

It was my hint to speak -- such was the process.

And of the cannibals that each other eat,

The anthropophagi, and men whose heads

Do grow beneath their shoulders.

It's an astonishing story, each element more incredible than the one that
precedes it. Hair-breadth escapes?  Every hero can boast of them. Redemption
from slavery? A bit less likely. Hills whose heads touch heaven? A pardonable
hyperbole. Cannibals?  Surely, less believable still. The Othello landscape
then crosses the border from exotic to fabulous when it adduces "men whose
heads/ Do grow beneath their shoulders." These headless men are the
blemmyae -- Nubian or sometimes Ethiopian -- who were a feature of 
pseudo-anthropological folklore from Pliny to Sir Walter Raleigh. The skepticism
that these monstrous creatures ought to provoke is diluted because the road to
the blemmyes passes through "antres vast and deserts idle." If audiences
had not been lulled and seduced by "antres," they might dismiss Othello as a
mere braggart soldier-- rather than admire him for the near-magician that he
becomes in his self- dramatization.

Shakespeare had yet another purpose for "antres vast." In the sentence that
treads on the heels of the "men whose heads/ Do grow beneath their shoulders,"
Othello abruptly turned his attention to Desdemona. His language dulls. "This
(i.e. his exotic narrative) to hear would Desdemona seriously incline,/ But
still the house affairs would draw her hence." Shakespeare strategically
contrasts Othello's vocabulary to Desdemona's when he juxtaposes "antres
vast" to "house affairs." Only the tinnest of ears can fail to be struck
by the difference between the two phrases. Antres vast--house affairs; house
affairs-- antres vast. The gap between these two most pregnant phrases is small
enough to allow the electric impulses of sex and romance to spark, but is too
wide to allow genuine understanding or empathy to shoot the gap. The tragedy
of Desdemona and Othello arises out of the unbridgeable space between "antres
vast" and "house affairs."

Shakespeare therefore knew exactly what he was about when he invented the word
"antres."

If he had been in a more antic mood, less determined
to characterize Othello's massive dignity, he might have coined a word from
another Latin word for cave, e.g. spelunca.  But "spelunkies vast" --
or even "spelunkies splendid" -- could not possibly do the work of "antres
vast."

Title: Antres, Antrees, Antars
Date: November 19, 2010

One of my loyal readers (see "Comments" to previous post) wants to know how the
word "antres" was pronounced. It's a reasonable inquiry but like many questions
about Shakespeare, its answer is not easy.

I myself pronounce "antres" just as I would "antlers," but without the "l".
If I were to guess at an Elizabethan pronounciation (and it would be a guess,
even though I've stumbled through the volumes on Shakespearean pronunciation by
Kokeritz and Cercignani), I would say the word with a more open initial vowel: 
"ahnters." But can we ever be certain how words were pronounced four hundred
years ago?  Especially nonce-words like antres?

Moreover, Shakespeare did not spell antres, "antres.'  Antres is a brilliant
editorial intervention that made its initial appearance in Lewis Theobald's The
Works of Shakespeare in 1733.

The first time that Othello saw print, in the 1622 quarto, antres was
"Antrees." The second time, in the first Folio of 1623, antres was "Antars." 
Are either one of these spellings, each of which yields a different
pronounciation, authoritative?  It is impossible to know. With some plays, it's
clear that F was set from Q, and that therefore any divergences are likely to be
errors. But in the case of Othello, Q and F descend independently from a lost
original (and it's been suggested that Q reveals evidence of the interpolations
and misunderstandings of actors). Neither "Anteers" or "Antars" is definitive.
Either pronunciation can therefore be justified.

Perhaps Shakespeare changed his mind. Perhaps a scribe or a typesetter,
struggling with a unique and unfamiliar work, took a guess. The rest is silence.

Title: First Week in the West, August 1969
Date: November 20, 2010

Our final stop on the road westward was Gothenburg, Nebraska.  We set up the
old canvas tent in a park in the heart of town and slept to the screeching of
cicadas (a sound new to me).  (In those days we couldn't possibly have afforded
the $10 or $15 for a motel.)  By noon the next day we had reached Crook,
Colorado (population 128 in 2000 but considerably more in 1969 -- the town was
then large enough to support a restaurant and a gas station). We ate lunch but
when we got back into the green Dodge station wagon, purchased ($2500) for
our new life in the Rockies, we discovered that something had gone terribly
wrong with the gears and that the car would only go backwards. I worried that
we were going to be stuck in Crook with two boys under four years old while
we waited for a transmission part to be trucked in from Detroit. Filled with
financial trepidation, I backed the car around the block (there was only one
block, fortunately) to the town's lone mechanic. He said he'd "take a look." He
did, got himself a great big screwdriver and banged away under the hood for a
few minutes. "Fixed it." When he charged me $1.00 for the service, I began to
think well of Colorado. We piled back into the car and continued with the last
150 miles of the trip, gazing at the mountains in the distance and the arid
steppes, populated only by the occasional cow -- with nary a human being in
view.

We made it to Boulder sometime in that  same afternoon. It took a while to find
the house we had rented by mail. We missed it on the first pass and drove by
the old Pioneer Cemetery, which became our first landmark. We had no idea that
we had rented a cute small 1915 arts and crafts bungalow with the original fir
woodwork still intact -- what a change from our Manhattan apartment overlooking
Broadway. Our few sticks of furniture were delayed in transit (and would be for
three weeks), so we all slept on air mattresses for the while.

The Daughter (at whose request I am writing this reminiscence), was conceived
before the furniture arrived.

Our landlord and next-door neighbor was Jack David Angus Ogilvy, a rangy cowboy
and professor of Anglo-Saxon who was, contrary to all expectations, a distant
relative of the queen of England.  (Was it 1969 or the next year that I met
Jack's cousin, a pimply English boy named Angus, known across the sea as Lord
Ogilvy)?  That was a surprise. Another surprise:  the alley behind our house
was bordered with a huge crop of wild plums. The boys discovered the plums very
soon after our arrival.

I was taken by surprise by the Colorado light.   had always lived in the
cloudy east, and that bright western sun was a complete surprise. High altitude,
no humidity, and very big sky. I'm still not quite used to it.

Boulder was not the sophosticated, foodie, high-tech, trendy town it has become.
It was all white bread, the downtown unMalled and still dominated by banks, car
dealerships, Valentine's Hardware, Smith's Shoes, a big old Woolworth's and
wide empty streets. There were only a few restaurants -- I remember the Harbin
Inn, a mediocre Chinese joint, and the Gondolier ditto but Italian (still in
business but much changed). And our favorite, the Aristocrat, a breakfast place
with portions that could remedy in a single sitting those dangerous drops in
cholesterol.

On our first day in town, we drove by Boulder High School. Mrs. Dr. M. said,
"That's where I want to teach when I go back to teaching." Which she did, a few
years later and then for many years.

Title: Dentists I Have Known
Date: November 23, 2010

When I was a child, there were two neighborhood dentists.  One was named
Caress and the other was named Yankowitz.  My parents chose Nathan Caress,
possibly for onomastic reasons, but they might have made a mistake;  Nathan
Caress should have been called Nathan Butcher.  Dentistry sixty years ago was
much inferior to dentistry today, especially in our dark corner of the universe.
 There was no anaesthetics, no novacaine.  Baby teeth that developed cavities
were summarily yankowitzed with a pair of what looked like industrial pliers.
 Adult teeth that needed repair were excavated with a low-speed mechanical
drill, then sterilized with carbolic acid, and filled with a mercury compound
that has over the years not doubt lowered my IQ by dozens or scores of points.
Dentistry was painful. No, it wasn't painful, it was torture.  Dr. Caress,
whose office was in the living room of his house on Rugby Road, had a big black
ugly mole on his left cheek. I studied that mole for many too many hours.

Sometime in my early teens I was sent to an orthodontist, Irving Pollack,
who had a very official suite of rooms in a high-rise on Joralemon Street, a
subway ride away.  I am grateful to him because, although he made a miserable
adolescence even more miserable, his "appliances" helped keep my mismatched,
askew anthology of teeth in my head.  In fact, I have all but one of them to
this day.

No thanks to my next dentist, T. Gorfein of Cambridge, Massachusetts, a genuine
criminal who asserted that I had twenty-two cavities and set out to fill them. I
left him after a couple of weeks, not because I was wise enough to suspect that
he was  a cheat, but because while he was working on me, he called over his
assistant and said -- genuine historical quote coming here -- "Would you look
at that sucker bleed."  At the university clinic, the dentist to whom I was
assigned could find only two cavities, which she (my first female practitioner)
painlessly filled. I must have had other dental experiences before Colorado's
Amiot and Johnson, both of whom were competent but both of whom insisted on
talking Republican nonsense to defenseless me while my mouth was filled with
equipment and fat fingers. Johnson left a crown too high, causing enormous pain;
searching for an alternative for his ham-handedness, I remembered that I had
bus-commuted with a dental student who seemed intelligent. She became a dentista
of high regard for many years until she took very early retirement from the
trade -- I never knew why. She sold her practice to another competent woman who
charges outrageous sky high prices for her services, but keeps me healthy.

So the score as we head into overtime:  one fake tooth, two root canal jobs,
a couple of tender spots, two unerupted wisdom teeth waiting to cause trouble,
but unabated ability to eat and enjoy corn on the cob. Nevertheless, lots of
residual Caress-caused nervousness every time I need to see someone in the tooth
business.

Title: My Swiss Cheese Brain
Date: December 03, 2010

As a youth, I could memorize poetry with great ease.  Nowadays, with a toe
into the water of my eighth decade, what was once a snap has become a
frustration.  But inasmuch as the authorities continually remind us geezers
that we need to keep the intelligence well-lubricated, I persist.  Yet it now
takes two or three hard weeks to memorize a speech in one of Shakespeare's
plays that, fifty years ago, I might have learned in less than an hour.

I've been trying to commit to the old brain Othello's magnificent speech about
wooing Desdemona -- the one with "antres vast and deserts idle" -- about which
I reported last week.   Instead of memorizing fluently and quickly, my swiss
cheese brain continually generates gaps, fissures and holes.  For example,
take this passage.

This to hear would Desdemona seriously incline

But still the house affairs would draw her thence

Which ever as she could with haste dispatch

She'd come again, and with a greedy ear

Devour up my discourse.

There's no reason why this sentence shouldn't be easy enough.  I read and
study it, but when I shut the book and try to recite, it comes up this way:

She'd come again and with a  greedy [empty space]

Devour up my discourse.

The word "ear" has evaporated, or rather fallen into the black hole of memory,
or gotten stuck in the synaptic link between two nerve cells.

I peer into the book once again and take a second crack.

She'd come again and with a greedy ear

Devour up my [empty space].

Ear appears, discourse disappears.  And so on through the thirty-two line
passages.  Nouns sink beneath the waves and then bob to the surface.  And
these lacunae occur again and again. And again.

It is fascinating to me that I retain the rhythm of the pentameter line and
that I always know that I am missing a two-syllable noun.  Nevertheless, the
precise word will not emerge -- at least at the moment that I need it.  But
it's there, coated with polysaccharides, lurking in an obscure empty space
behind a neuron.  It's astonishing that the words that disappear are almost
always nouns.  I have very little trouble with other parts of speech.  But
then noun- loss is a recognized characteristic of your "mature" brain.

Because it has taken so long to memorize, I have become extremely well-
acquainted with the speech.  Slow motion has its advantages.  Othello
tells us that Desdemona would come "with greedy ear [to] devour up [his]
discourse."  It wasn't until I had gone over that sentence a hundred
times that I realized that Shakespeare used "devour" to connect with the
"cannibals that do each other eat" in the earlier part of the speech.  It's
a purposeful comparison: while wandering and errant Othello encountered
anthropophagi, domestic Desdemona, confined to house affairs, was only able to
eat words.

Clever fellow, that Will S.

Title: Trains, Planes and Buses
Date: December 05, 2010

My first railroad (not subway) trip was in 1945 -- a New York Central train
from NYC to Glens Falls, New York.  I was dazzled but queasy;  it was
a coal-burning engine and the smoke was both visible and smellable.  I
spent my infant time looking out the window and studying the adjacent set
of tracks as they combined and separated -- a most vivid memory.  I was
born into a sedentary family and have no further recollection of being in
a train again until 1952 when Aunt Mollie took me to Washington. We ate
dinner on the train, a marvelous luxury.  in 1956, testing my adolescent
independence, I voyaged to Ithaca on the old Lehigh Valley R. R. (the
"Leaky V.), then in its dotage and quite seedy.  During the late 1950s,  I
occasionally rode up to Utica NY on the NY Central.  The round-trip fare
was an astonishingly steep $20.50, or half a week's work.  But afterwards
it was almost all automobiles.  I don't know that I was on a train again
until 1975-76, when I commuted weekly from Canterbury (second class with the
accompaniment of Cadbury chocolates) to Charing Cross station.  Calais
to Paris, 1976. I can remember also Lugano to Florence to Rome, c. 1990,
and Stockholm to Copenhagen a decade later.  NYC to DC, on Amtrak, many
times around the turn of the new millenium.  Not a great deal of train
travel, but then, as we all know, the railroads are a glorious but dying
institution, at least in the US.  Nor adventuresome either:  no Orient
Express or Trans-Siberian.  Planes?  My first trip was from NYC to Ithaca,
on a 12 seat Mohawk -- perhaps to this day my smallest plane and bumpiest
flight.  Many, many trips from Boston to NYC (Eastern Airlines), from Logan
to LaGuardia and back.  A dozen or so jumps across the water to Europe,
all of them accompanied with headaches and disorientation.  My longest so
far:  Denver to Port Elizabeth, South Africa.  To Hawaii and back. To San
Jose, Costa Rica.  Innumerable, far too many,  domestic flights from Denver
to NYC, Denver to Oakland, Denver to DC -- all highly routinized.  At first,
decades ago, flying was romantic;  dinner was served;  people dressed up for
the experience.  Now it's being sardined into a grudging Greyhound in the
sky, with bodyscans and shoe checks to boot.  And waste:  all that time and
money thrown into the sea looking for plastic explosives secreted in  my
retired-teacher/ grandpa orifices.

The word Greyhound reminds me those horrible 1950s trips (midnight to 8am)
from the Port Authority on 34th and 8th to Ithaca with "rest stops" in
East Stroudsburg and Scranton at 3am, with no food available except rancid
sandwiches from the slot machines.  I cannot shake the memory of the awful
smell of spoiled tuna, gas fumes, eructations and flatulence on those filthy
cramped buses.  Nor of the degenerate displaying his private parts in the
men's room in Hackettstown, New Jersey one slushy night.

But put me in a car on a two-lane anywhere west of the Mississippi, with no
particular place to go, and I'm one happy guy.

Cherry pie in Hannibal, Missouri or breakfast at the Jesse James Cafe in Casey,
Iowa.  Bliss!

Title: Modern Biography
Date: December 06, 2010

It's been a Charles Dickens revival here.  The Dickens formula -- "make them
laugh, make them cry, make them wait" -- works as well for me now as it did
fifty years ago.

I was curious to fill in the gaps in my knowledge, so I trotted over to
the library and found a newish biography of Dickens.  It looked eminently
respectable:  St. Martin's Press and its author a "Professor of English
Studies" at the University of Stirling.

But youch, what a travesty the new "biography" turned out to be.

Here follow some sentences (none of which I've altered in the least) from
a book which has the temerity to call itself Charles Dickens, A Literary
Life.  Prepare yourself for pretention, bathos, meandering metaphors and
syntactic peculiarities marinated in post-modern obfuscation.  Savor these
monstrosities.

"'Dickens,' a convenient and perhaps unavoidable label, masks a range of
Dickenses, which, taken together, constitute a highly complex whole."

"In short, this book will attempt to separate out at least some of the
contextual forces that flowed through Dickens's pen along with the ink at the
moment when he sat down to the ostensibly solitary and private process of making
that series of black marks on white paper that we call novels."

"Suffering is a crucial part of the artistic process and the artist is seen as
quite different from the ordinary run of people through his possession of a
creative power akin to that of God in His creation of the world."

"This aspect of his career can be explored in a number of ways, in his deep
respect for his own activity as a novelist as well as in an intense concern
to extract his full pound of flesh financially from publishers and also, in a
sense, from the public."

"A dramatic opening and an exciting climax are desirable features of any
narrative, but the desire to impose them on historical narratives may distort
the flow that is an inherent aspect of historical process."

"But the facts and arguments of this chapter show that the point at which
Pickwick Papers came into being was one of turbulence in publishing which
carried with it, as periods of turbulence always do, possibilities of movement
in a variety of directions."

"The serial violates the decorum appropriate to high art and the imagery of the
passage embodies a distate of profusion which could be likened to a class-based
disdain for the crowded urban environment and dislike of such new-fangled
phenomena as the railway."

"Public school meant the classics and, in England, university spelled Oxford or
Cambridge, 'advantages' which Dickens conspicuously lacked."

I could wisecrack about each of the above sentences, but I'm in a more-in-
sorrow-than-in-anger frame of mind.   Why oh why do academics feel they have
to write this way?  Such woeful prose and trumpeting obviousness compromise
the reputations of sober scholars and teachers.

Does the author of this book realize that he's bamboozling himself?    Does
he know how ridiculous he is?

Date: December 08, 2010

In the summer of 1963, we were somewhere in southern Illinios on our first
cross-country adventure (the first of many).  I was not an experienced
driver and the Nash Rambler was not a superb-handling car.  We were driving
a two-lane, and it was raining hard , and something happened (can't remember
what) that caused me to brake much too hard. The car spun out of control,
first swinging into the oncoming lane (empty, thank you very much) and then
rotating into a three or four foot ditch on the right side of the road.

I was grateful to be alive but I knew that I was in a predicament.  How to
get the Rambler back on the road?

Within a minute, a small truck pulled up behind me.  A hale-fellow Elks-Lions-
Rotary-Presbyterian kind of guy stepped out, assessed the situation, hitched a
cable to the Rambler and winched us out of the ditch.  Took him two minutes
max.  He said, "you OK?" and drove off.

Many thanks to that man.

In 1984, I had to fly from Lebanon, New Hampshire to Salt Lake City through
Boston.  We were fogged in at Lebanon and I didn't arrive at Logan until a few
minutes before my next leg was about to leave.  Logan consisted then (probably
still does) of half-a-dozen separate terminals linked by a bus line.  I
went up to a man in a uniform and I asked him where, in the jumble, would
I find Continental.  I told him that I had less than twenty minutes to
board.  He said, "wait right here.  I'll get you there on time."  He was
not a policeman, as I thought, but a uniformed chauffeur to some Rich Person. 
After a few minutes he returned, having launched his employer.  He took me
to his extra-long Cadillac limousine and speeded me to my terminal.

Many thanks to that man

And to all the other anonymous people who have helped me with life's travels
and travails.

Am I becoming sentimental?

Title: Favorite Garments,  A Lifetime List
Date: December 10, 2010

Sometime in the early 1950s I was given a great gift: a hand-knitted gray-and-
white Norwegian sweater. It may have been a bit too large for me, but I wore it
almost every day through high school and college and for many years thereafter.
True, it became a little ratty around the waist, but my mother-in-law, a skilled
knitter, was able to repair it, and did so, more than once. The leather elbow
patches were my own contribution, and if they were not exactly symmetrically
placed, so what?  I disagreed with those who felt that the beauty of the
garment was compromised by the vivid mustard stain on the right sleeve. I was
still wearing the sweater in the 1980s, when my daughter begged it. Of course
I gave it to her, but I now believe that she was in surreptitious league with
other members of my family to get the sweater out of my hands and off my back.
I've never seen her wear it.

It was in the 1970s that I received another gift of an important garment -- a
Guatemalan shirt -- a camisa -- of the sort worn in Todos Santos: a multicolored
embroidered --  or is it brocaded -- piece of fabric attached to a blue-and-
white striped shift that hung down to mid-thigh -- very convenient for use as
towel or hot cloth. I loved that shirt and wore it even to work. It's possible
that some people dismissed me as an eccentric or that others presumed that I
was making an anti-colonial statement, but in fact I just thought the shirt was
comfortable and handsome. I remember overhearing  a student -- one of the
brainless ones -- who hated college, hated literature, and hated me -- mumble
under his breath (in those days I could still hear), "Well, at least he's not a
dull dresser." I don't know what became of the camisa. I suspect that it was
desaparecida.

Another favorite garment was a yellow leather shirt jacket which I wore until
it shredded. This jacket ran into trouble on a cross-country trip when it was
packed on top of the car, under a canvas. It lay too close to a dyed leather
coat (not mine) and during a flash Nebraska rainstorm was thoroughly  soaked
and acquired a large purple stain. I didn't mind, because the stain was in
the back, but I bowed to social pressure and gave it up, which was a shame,
because I didn't get more than twenty years use out of it.  And then there
was that lovely orange-brown corduroy jacket that I bought at the Presbyterian
thrift store for $2.00. That was real beauty.  So was the tailored denim suit
coat which I have vainly tried to replace -- they just don't make them like
that any more.

Still another memorable garment: a green hooded cotton sweatshirt that, after I
had worn it for a decade or so, was nicely broken in. It had lots of wear left
in it, but I made the dreadful error of mentioning to  my daughter-in-law
that, wearing it, I had twice been taken for a homeless person. She snatched
the sweatshirt away from me and threw it into the garbage (I rescued it for
rags). She then immediately went out and bought me a perfectly lovely new
Carhartt hooded sweatshirt, very high quality, with a zipper and everything,
which I have worn every day during the cold months for two seasons and which
will, within a dozen or so years, no doubt become quite comfortable.

Title: Nineteenth-Century Vehicles Yet One More Time
Date: December 13, 2010

In order to illustrate the precarious social standing of Mr. Smouch, who takes
Pickwick into custody for debt, Dickens described his carriage as neither one
thing or another.

"The vehicle was not exactly a gig, neither was it a stanhope.  It was not what
is currently denominated a dog-cart, neither was it a taxed-cart, nor a chaise-
cart, nor a guillotined cabriolet;  and yet it had something of the character
of each and every of these machines.  It was painted a bright yellow, with
the shafts and wheels picked out in black, and the driver sat, in the orthodox
sporting style, on cushions piled about two feet above the rail.  The horse was
a bay, a well-looking animal enough;  but with something of the flash and dog-
fighting air about him, nevertheless, which accorded both the vehicle and his
master."

The original readers of Pickwick Papers would have known exactly what is meant
by a "guillotined cabriolet."  I suspect that there's a joke there, but the
joke has perished.  I certainly don't get it.

Is there also joke in "bright yellow?"  What is the usual color of a gig or
stanhope?

There might be all kinds of jokes in the following list of socially-
crepuscular horsedrawn vehicles, none of which precipitate hilarity, but
of which the sum amuses me greatly:  barouche, basket carriage, berlin,
britchka, brougham, buckboard, buggy, cabriolet, caleche, cariole, carryall,
chaise, chariot, clarence, concord wagon, coupe, croydon, curricle, cutter,
daumont, dearborn, dennet, diligence, dog-cart, fiacre, fly, fourgon,
four-wheeler, gig, go-cart, governess cart, hansom, herdic, jaunty car,
jersey-wagon, kibitka, landau, patache, phaeton, pill-box, post-chaise,
rockaway, shandrydan, shay, sociable, spider-phaeton, spring-van, stanhope,
sulky, surrey, T-cart, telyezhka, tilbury, tarantass, trap, troika, victoria,
vis-a-vis, wagonette, and wurt.

Title: What We Watched in the Fifties:  Rebel Without a Cause (1955)
Date: December 20, 2010

I watched Rebel Without A Cause last night in a state of constant twitching
puzzlement.  Why has this film become a cult classic?  How can we account
for the iconic appeal of James Dean, who moves me not the least bit?  How did
thirty-five-year-olds manage to pass for high school kids in 50s movies?  Why,
in those ancient days, did every male seem to wear a tie and jacket round the
clock?

The movie seemed like a period piece, dug up from some archive  --  which
is odd, because I was 16 and a high school student in 1955 when Rebel
Without a Cause was released.  It should have spoken to me then, or now.  But
didn't and doesn't, not a bit.

The Eisenhower decade was the great age of suburban "juvenile delinquency,"
so- called.  What do these kids want?  They all have their expensive cars and
the war is over.  The teen-agers, all of them, are utterly inarticulate. 
They're also shockingly unfeeling.  When Buzz Gunderson dies in the "chickie
run," he is not mourned, even for a femtosecond, and within a few hours, his
girlfriend Judy has fallen in love with Buzz's rival, Jim Stark.

Nor, in this film, is the adult generation is any more admirable -- the wives
and mothers are shrews, the men grotesquely henpecked.  The film has a strong
gay subtext throughout -- most apparent in the Jim Stark-Plato relationship. 
I'm sure that I wouldn't have noticed it in 1955, but it kind of jumps at you
nowadays.

1950s juvenile delinquents came in two categories:  urban deprived and rich
suburban alienated.  I was of neither one class nor the other.  True that we
had to be constantly on our toes to keep clear of the one group, but the other
(those depicted in this film) might just as well have been living on another
planet.

A dangerous planet, as it turned out, for the makers of Rebel Without a Cause. 
James Dean was already dead when the film was released, having been killed in an
automobile accident.  Sal Mineo was murdered in 1976.  Natalie Wood, drunk,
drowned in 1981.  Nick Adams died of a drug overdose in 1968.  The film's
talented director, Nicholas Ray, discovered his wife, Gloria Grahame, in bed
with his thirteen-year-old son, whom she later married.  Ray died prematurely
of drugs and alcohol.

Title: Every Directional Dyslexic's Worst Nightmare
Date: December 21, 2010

In Pickwick Papers, Pickwick checks into the Great White Horse Inn in
Ipswich, is shown to his room by a chamber-maid only to discover that he's
left his watch downstairs.  He retrieves it but then cannot find his way back
to his room.  He's utterly, hopelessly lost. "Rows of doors... branched off
in every possible direction.  A dozen times did he softly turn the handle of
some bed- room door which resembled his own, when a gruff cry from within of
"Who the devil's that" caused him to steal away....  He was reduced to the
verge of despair when an open door attracted his attention.  He peeped in....
There were the two beds, whose situation he perfectly remembered."  Pickwick
steps inside and has removed his clothes when another person enters the room. 
He conceals himself.  Bad turns to worse.  "Mr. Pickwick almost fainted with
horror and dismay.  Standing before the dressing-glass was a middle-aged woman
in yellow curl-papers, busily engaged in brushing her hair....    'I never
met with anything so awful as this,' thought Mr. Pickwick, 'what a dreadful
thing.'  Uncertain how to proceed, Pickwick 'ha-hums.'  "Gracious Heaven!"
said the middle-aged lady, "what's that?"  "It's -- it's -- only a gentleman,
ma'am."  "A gentleman!" said the lady, with a terrific scream.  "It's all
over!" thought Mr. Pickwick."

The expected complications ensue.  At last, Pickwick flees, carrying his
clothes and dropping his shoes.  But the nightmare continues because he still
can't locate his assigned chamber.  Fortunately, he runs into his servant, Mr.
Samuel Weller, who escorts him back home.

Clearly, Mr. Pickwick is directionally disabled.

Am I the only directionally-challenged person for whom Pickwick's story is a
horrible fear.  I've had repeated nightmares of exactly this complexion.  In
fact, I've dreamed this very dream dozens, perhaps scores of times.  I check
into a hotel, go for a walk in a strange city and then, for some reason, the
elevator doesn't go to my floor, or the staircase comes to a sudden end, or the
room numbers go from 401 to 405 when I know that my room is 403.  I wander
endlessly until I wake up in a sweat, heart pounding.

And now I have to admit that I once narrowly dodged this embarrassment.  In
real life.  I was staying at a bed-and-breakfast somewhere in the west of
Ireland.  There was no private bathroom -- the facilities were down the hall
and a half a flight downstairs.  In the middle of the night, after obeying a
call of nature, attempting to return to my room, I stepped into a room that
was not mine.  I was just about to get into bed with a strange party when I
realized my predicament.  Fortunately, I was able to escape without waking
anyone.  I found my own room (good thing there were only two to a floor) but I
was in quite a state for an hour or so.

As I'm writing this, I'm guessing that most of my readers will harrumph their
feelings of superiority.  "Couldn't happen to me." My directionally dyslexic
friends, however, will understand.  And they will also know why I sympathize
and empathize with poor Pickwick.

Title: Secession Nostalgia
Date: December 22, 2010

The Sons of Confederate Veterans celebrated themselves with a $100-per-person
Secession Ball on Dec. 20 in Gaillard Municipal Auditorium in Charleston. 
The event centered on a play highlighting key moments from the signing of
South Carolina’s Ordinance of Secession 150 years ago.  Jeff Antley, who
organized the event, said that the Secession Ball honors South Carolinians who
stood up for their rights.  “The secession movement in South Carolina was a
demonstration of freedom,” said Antley. “What I’m doing is honoring the
men from this state who stood up for their self-government and their rights
under law."

Is the act of secesion a "demonstration of freedom?"  What sort of freedom? 
Let us now read from South Carolina's Articles of Secession, which asserts that
the federal government has impinged upon states' rights.

"The right of property in slaves was recognized [under the Constitution] by
giving to free persons distinct political rights, by giving them the right to
represent, and burthening them with direct taxes for three-fifths of their
slaves; by authorizing the importation of slaves for twenty years; and by
stipulating for the rendition of fugitives from labor. We affirm that these ends
for which this Government was instituted have been defeated, and the Government
itself has been made destructive of them by the action of the non-slaveholding
States. Those States have assumed the right of deciding upon the propriety of
our domestic institutions; and have denied the rights of property established in
fifteen of the States and recognized by the Constitution; they have denounced
as sinful the institution of slavery; they have permitted open establishment
among them of societies, whose avowed object is to disturb the peace and to
eloign the property of the citizens of other States. They have encouraged and
assisted thousands of our slaves to leave their homes; and those who remain,
have been incited by emissaries, books and pictures to servile insurrection. For
twenty- five years this agitation has been steadily increasing, until it has now
secured to its aid the power of the common Government. Observing the forms of
the Constitution, a sectional party has found within that Article establishing
the Executive Department, the means of subverting the Constitution itself. A
geographical line has been drawn across the Union, and all the States north of
that line have united in the election of a man to the high office of President
of the United States, whose opinions and purposes are hostile to slavery. He is
to be entrusted with the administration of the common Government, because he has
declared that that "Government cannot endure permanently half slave, half free,"
and that the public mind must rest in the belief that slavery is in the course
of ultimate extinction. This sectional combination for the submersion of the
Constitution, has been aided in some of the States by elevating to citizenship,
persons who, by the supreme law of the land, are incapable of becoming citizens;
and their votes have been used to inaugurate a new policy, hostile to the South,
and destructive of its beliefs and safety."

Yes, it's true.  Citizens of some states have not captured fugitive slaves or
returned them to their owners, have denounced slavery as sinful, have elected
a president who is hostile to the "peculiar institution," and have (horror of
horrors! even granted citizenship to former slaves.

The South Carolina document is extraordinarily clear.  Can anyone fairly doubt
that there would have been no secession and therefore no need for a Secession
Ball except in defense of slavery?  The "demonstration of freedom" is nothing
more than a celebration of the  freedom of one person to own another.

Nowadays, when slavery is no longer defensible, "conservative" South Carolinians
are reduced to protecting their guaranteed right to make life difficult
for gays and immigrants.  And keep women in their places.  A far cry from
their glorious past.

But they continue to nurture that nostalgia for the great old antebellum
days.

Title: What Have We Come To?
Date: December 31, 2010

Just back from the post office, where I mailed the granddaughter her gift, a
zester. What is a zester, you ask?  It's a kitchen device designed to remove
the "zest," that is, the outermost skin of a citrus fruit.  The granddaughter's
zester is an inch and a half wide and thirteen inches long, including its five
inch handle. Essentially, it's a hand-held grater, very useful if you're a
cooking enthusiast. And why, you ask, would I venture out in 15F, snowy weather
to mail the zester to California, when the grand-daughter could have put it in
her backpack when she returned home? Because, I was creditably advised, the
zester would certainly be confiscated by airport security.

What have we come to, when, rightly or wrongly, we seriously entertain the
idea that an eleven-year-old child could hijack an airplane armed only with a
zester?  What would she do, abrade the pilot to death?

Title: "Rio Grande" (1950) Then and Now
Date: January 03, 2011

Last night, on the big HDTV, with the collaboration of Netflix, and peering
through our toes, we watched the John Ford cavalry movie "Rio Grande." I
first saw this film in the year of its release (I was eleven years old) at the
Leader Theater on Coney Island Avenue.

In days of yore, it was the custom for the neighborhood urchins to take in a
double bill on a rainy Saturday afternoon.  It was a good way for our harried
mothers to dispose of us for four hours -- and on the cheap, inasmuch as the
price of admission was only fourteen cents.

"Rio Grande" was a perfect kind of urchin movie. Good guys (cavalry) versus bad
guys (Indians), lots of action, no overt sex. It offered much too much singing,
but the slow periods would have been enlivened by hoots, whistles, popcorn-
throwing, banging the head of the kid in the seat in front of you with the heel
of your hand, primitive pre-flirting, and chasing in the aisles.

In 1950, Maureen O'Hara (John Wayne's estranged wife), was puzzling if not
inexplicable  -- merely an impediment to the action. Sixty years later, she is
beautiful, dignified, even majestic. The poor Apaches, who for me and for my
heedless comrades were nothing other than targets for cavalry bullets, are now
unutterably tragic. John Wayne was then an immensely heroic figure, but with the
passing of years. he has become a rigid incompetent dope.

The West, in those days, was part Monument Valley, part myth;  now I live in a
West that has nothing to do with Coney Island Avenue, even less with John Ford.

I've been inspecting the entrails of slaughtered oxen and also observing the

can now announce my predictions for the coming year.

1)  there will be unusual weather patterns in North America;

2)  a famous Hollywood actress will sue for divorce;  moreover, another (or
possibly the same) Hollywood star will become pregnant; another (or possibly the
same) actress will gain and/or lose a great deal of weight;

3)  a well-known athlete will be accused of taking drugs;

4)  a politician will be involved in a sex scandal;

5)  questions will be raised about America's food supply;

6)  there will be either a monsoon, an airplane crash, or a capsized ferry in
Asia--perhaps all three;

7)  there will be fluctuations in the stock market;

8)  there will be turmoil in the Middle East;

9)  a religious leader will be involved in either a financial or a sexual
scandal (perhaps both);

10) the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq will not end.

You read it here first.  Not for nothing that I've acquired the reputation of
an inspired mystic, or shaman, or something.  Nostradamus redux.

This reminiscence will not mean much to anyone but my born-and-bred-in-Brooklyn
readers.

One of my smart schoolyard buddies, Jimmy Nolan, won a scholarship to Columbia.
He was a year or two older than I, and the first of our gang/crowd to venture
out of the neighborhood. The summer after his first college year, we were
sitting in front of the candy store, drinking egg creams and practicing our
spitting, when someone asked Jimmy "what's it like up there." "Up there" was the
far north, Morningside Heights, in Manhattan, where Columbia was located -- the
end of the earth, kind of. Jimmy said, "You might not believe this, but up there
they pronounce "hua," "hor."

Title: Amnesia in Film:  The Crooked Way (1949)
Date: January 16, 2011

Eddie Rice has served in World War II, won a silver star, but lost his memory
to a piece of shrapnel buried in this brain (the x-ray is flashed onto the
screen). It's an "organic" rather than "psychological" amnesia and therefore
incurable. Released from a hospital, Eddie returns home to L. A. to find that
he was once Eddie Riccardi and that he was a no-good, double-crossing hood,
hated by both police and former gang members and also distrusted by his ex-wife.
Eddie Rice is a Dr. Jekyll, but his pre-amnesia self was a Mr. Hyde. It's a
curious and unexplained transformation -- from evil to good. There is almost no
psychological continuity between his ante- and post-trauma personality. Eddie
the amnesiac is utterly untroubled to discover that he was once a monster. He
extricates himself from the mob, jettisons his past, and starts a new life. His
amnesia is a thing apart.

The direction (by Robert Florey) and the noir cinematography are splendid.
John Payne, a fine, underappreciated actor, (as Rice/Riccardi) cannot possibly
convey the psychological complexity that should have been, but wasn't, written
into the script.

Title: Is Sarah Palin Jewish?
Date: January 19, 2011

Certainly not either by inheritance or conversion or moral stance. Yet Sarah
Palin seems to imagine that she's Jewish -- in a peculiar, one-dimensional way.
It's not always easy to guess at what's going on in that soup of a brain, but is
it possible to determine what Sarah means when she claims to be a victim of a
"blood libel?"

The actual targets of the "blood libel," it is no secret, are not overpaid Foxy
commentators but ordinary Jews who, according to pious medieval preachers, Henry
Ford, Nazi propagandists, and contemporary Syrian statesmen, make it a practice
to drain innocent babes of their blood, which they then bake into matzos.

Here are the exact words in which Sarah invokes this hideous accusation:
"journalists and pundits should not manufacture a blood libel that serves only
to incite the very hatred and violence that they purport to condemn.” It's
a confusing sentence, hard to explicate. Can we be confident that Sarah is
learned enough to know that "blood libel" is a phrase with a long and agonizing
history?  Are the "hatred and violence," which she claims are visited upon
her, designed to recall the pogroms (and worse) that have been precipitated by
the "blood libel"?  If her sentence is to be taken seriously, Sarah believes
that she is the victim of an attack analogous to the worst kind of anti-Semitic
ravings. Just as Jews are accused of killing Christian children, so has Sarah
herself been unjustly accused of killing Representative Gabrielle Giffords. In
her scenario, in her analogy, she herself, Sarah Palin, is the Jew.

In her daily deeds, Sarah Palin does not seem to understand or embrace aspects
of Jewish tradition such as compassion, the centrality of community, a deep
reverence for education and learning, fierce and informed intellectuality,
and robust philanthropy. Pure and simple, she sees herself as a victim -- a
condition or state of mind, which, in my opinion, is not only incorrect but
dangerous to the polity and to her own self-regard.

In short, she's scammed herself.

Title: Muff and Spot, Once Again
Date: January 25, 2011

Every little once in a while, a mountain lion creeps into the fold and snares
a lamb, a calf, or a German shepherd. At even more infrequent intervals, a
mountain lion attacks a human being (usually a child).  Whenever there's a
human-lion interaction, there comes a deluge of letters to the local newspaper
demanding that the authorities exercise “lethal control" over the big cats.
Killing catamounts is neither hard nor dangerous. They were hunted nearly to
extinction in the nineteenth century. Dogs chase the animal up a tree. The brave
hunter takes aim and fires.

But Is it a good idea to extirpate the mountain lion? In the United States,
there’s an average of one death by mountain lion a year. Here in our county,
there’s been one such death in the last hundred years. One is a very low
number, especially when, in the country as a whole, snakes cause a dozen deaths
each year, lightning claims seventy-five, bee and wasp stings a hundred. Dogs,
when they’re not out hunting mountain lions, account for between twelve to
twenty deaths a year – a couple of hundred a decade-- many of these, it's sad
to say, infants in the crib. Given the numbers, It’s hard to believe that
calls for the extermination of mountain lions aren’t motivated less by facts
than by fear.

Domesticated dogs are responsible not only for a dozen to a score of deaths,
but also for an estimated 4 to 7 million (that’s right, million!) cases of
dog-bite a year, almost 800,000 of which require medical attention. Dog bites
cause 368,000 emergency room visits, or (do the math!) one thousand such visits
a day.  The social cost of dog bites is estimated variously, but the Center for
Disease Control in Atlanta claims that the direct medical costs of dog bites per
year is $165 million, with many more millions in ancillary expenses.

Mountain lions, which are relatively harmless, inspire terror, but dogs, which
are far more dangerous, are our sacred cows -- loved, in my opinion, beyond
all propriety. It’s hard not to cringe when otherwise sensible people –
good decent people --tell me in all seriousness that Towser is a full member
of their family, or that Fido is about to undergo surgery to replace a hip --
an operation the cost of which is more than the annual medical budget of whole
villages in Africa or Asia. The run-of the-mill doggie in America enjoys a
better diet and better medical care than half of the human beings on the planet
-- a thoroughly indefensible skewing of resources. Dogs are not human beings,
and it’s immoral sentimentality to treat them as such. It’s embarrassing.

The ancients, following Aristotle, divided their possessions into three
categories: an object was an instrumentum mutum, an animal was an instrumentum
semivocale, and a slave was an instrumentum vocale.  By eliding the differences
between humans and animals, the Greeks and the Romans made slavery both easy and
natural. Aristotle's notion underlay serfdom.

I used to worry that people who treated animals as humans would be tempted to
treat humans as animals. But it's not so; the people I know who are sentimental
about animals and "animal rights" are extraordinarily sensitive to human rights
-- but then, perhaps my sample is skewed. All of my friends are sensitive to
human rights; if they weren’t, they wouldn’t be my friends.

I wonder whether the love of dangerous dogs and the fear of the cats who are
by and large indifferent to us isn’t an instinct acquired slowly over the
last half million years. Our ancestors, armed, at best, with flint-headed
spears, spent countless millennia at the mercy of feline predators larger, more
powerful and more terrifying than 100-pound mountain lions (the extinct European
lion, panthera leo fossilis, was taller, stronger, and and a foot and a half
longer than the modern African lion). It was only some 50,000 years ago that
an ancient Einstein conceived the idea of domesticating wolves and selecting
their population for useful traits. Humans and proto-dogs started to cohabit;
dwellings and caves came to be littered with coprolites. Co-evolution began, and
over the course of time, dogs and humans came to be sensitive to each other's
traits. Those early dogs were our first allies on this lonely, hostile planet.
They could raise a ruckus when a couple or three lionesses prowled about the
entrance to the cave.

We're indebted to dogs and so we tolerate their bad habits.  By the same token,
we have inherited from our ancestors a primordial fear. Hence the over-hasty cry
to exterminate the mountain lion.

Date: January 28, 2011

Yesterday we watched and heard Puccini's La Fanciulla del West imported
digitally from the big apple's Metropolitan Opera. It was shown on the enormous
screen at our local Century Theater. I was overwhelmed. I usually watch opera
from the nosebleed seats, which are expensive enough. With the new technology,
and with the telescopic close-ups, I could look right up Deborah Voight's
nostrils and into her mouth. I swear I saw her well-trained uvula vibrating.

The Girl of the Golden West is a fascinating cultural stew.  t's set in the
gold-rush California of the dime novels. The play on which it's based was
written by David Belasco, a London-born Sephardic Jew. The "West" is not real
but mythological -- replete with gunslingers, a big-time bar room brawl, poker
cheats, a cringe-making Indian squaw and papoose, a tough, mustachioed sheriff
and a Calamity Jane-style heroine. Yet it's sung (sung!) in Italian. "Dick
Johnson," the romantic lead, was performed by Marcello Giordani, a chubby
tenor from  Augusta, Sicily.  Interviewed during one of the far-too-long
intermissions, Giordani was asked if he had any trouble playing a last-century
horseback westerner. "Not at all.  I grew up watching John Wayne movies." I
admit to giggling at his answer, even though giggling is always inappropriate
in Grand Opera. Giordani also claimed that he tried to walk like Wayne.  He
didn't  -- he sashayed.

John Wayne himself didn't walk the John Wayne walk until Raoul Walsh and John
Ford transformed him from Marion Morrison, a furniture mover from Winterset,
Iowa, into a mythological figure.

Nothing in La Fanciulla del West actually touches ground. Or touches any ground
that I recognize.

Except that there are people who don't know it's a myth. Witness the recent
events in Tombstone -- I mean Tucson -- Arizona. At this very moment, the Utah
legislature is about to select its state weapon. The 1911 Browning pistol seems
to be the gun of choice. In neighboring Arizona, it would probably be the Glock
9mm 30-round semi-automatic.

Title: Amnesia in Films: The Bourne Identity
Date: January 30, 2011

Jason Bourne has contracted the worst case of amnesia in movie history and it's
going to last for at least four long films (three of them already released).
Bourne's type of amnesia is very convenient for plotting because he doesn't
know who he is but yet retains an astonishing range of martial and intellectual
skills. He's a born-again innocent (a murderer with a newly minted heart of
gold) who is shocked to discover that before he lost the marbles of memory, he
was a professional murderer. He's rather charming in an idiot-savant-assassin
way, but I suspect that his particular variety of amnesia is not very well known
to non-Hollywood neurologists.

It's a curious idea -- that an individual can be cleansed of his previous sins
by losing his memory. And yet The Bourne Identity doesn't make much of this
interesting moral question. "Who am I" is not investigated in the vocabulary of
tragedy, as in Lear's "Who is it who can tell me who I am" but as in "what's my
name, what's my address, what's my phone number." Pertinent questions, surely,
but not profound ones.

On the other hand, King Lear never climbed down the outside of a building,
handholds in the cracks between blocks of marble, nor, as far as I can remember,
did he plummet his Fiat down a series of flights of stone stairs while being
chased by a posse of sirening motorcyclists .

Title: More Noir: Otto Preminger's Laura (1944)
Date: February 01, 2011

Laura is a stylish noir mystery that maintains its fascination even after the
passage of sixty years. It is cleverly written and handsomely cinematographed
but it also comes with some murky psychological baggage. At the heart of the
enigma lies Waldo Lydecker (played by Clifton Webb). He's so head-over-heels in
love and so ferociously jealous of Laura (the ingenue Gene Tierney) that he'll
resort to anything, even murder, to keep her from other men. The premise is good
whodunit fare, but it would make more obvious sense if Lydecker weren't both old
and gay.

Clifton Webb was fifty-five when the picture was made, but he looks and acts
ten or fifteen years older. He may be a bachelor, but he's not an eligible one.
There's a story that Webb had a clause in his contract with Twentieth-Century
Fox that barred the company from alluding to his homosexuality, but the
prohibition, if it existed, didn't stop him from playing Lydecker with a
pronounced gay affect. He's fussy, he's bitchy, he's a queen -- in short a
stage homosexual in every aspect except that he's not obviously interested in
men. Well, not overtly;  but it is a surprise that he exposes himself to the
detective Mark McPherson [Dana Andrews] when he steps out of a bathtub and asks
McPherson to throw him a robe.)

A clue to Lydecker's character occurs in the film's first scene. He spies on
Detective McPherson, who's wandering around Lydecker's apartment, browsing an
extensive collection of fragile objets d'art. McPherson goes to pick up a piece
of glass and Lydecker calls out "Careful, that's very valuable" (I'm quoting
from memory). From this incident we learn two things:  that Lydecker is a
collector of beautiful works of art, and that he's willing to let people look
but not touch. These same two traits control Lydecker's relations to Laura: he
cherishes her beauty and molds her in a Pygmalion-like way, but he's hyper-
protective. For him, she becomes an untouchable work of art (the portrait of
Laura, on which the camera focuses so obsessively, is the metaphorical signifier
of her place in his mental world).  His cool sexuality (he's perfectly content
with twice-a-week dinners) and his age (he's more interested in fathering Laura
than in making love to her) are less powerful than his pygmalionism.

By transforming Laura into a work of art, Lydecker attempts to preserve her
virginity. He therefore shoos away her potential lovers. He destroys the career
of Jacoby, the painter, by writing a vitriolic attack on him; he collects
revealing information about the southern gigolo Carpenter (Vincent Price). He
competes with McPherson.  t's a neat turn that to do so he becomes a detective
himself -- loitering in the snow outside Laura's apartment, eavesdropping behind
a post in a night club, etc.  Eventually he comes to understand that he can't
preserve Laura's "purity"; it's then that the film turns to violence. After all
is lost, he gives away the game when he says to McPherson, with visceral horror,
"I suppose you'll have a disgustingly earthy relationship" [i.e. with Laura].

It's fascinating that McPherson, though he has all the outward marks of the
macho gumshoe, is himself tepid about sexuality. He lacks charisma, emotion,
lust. The film allows him and Laura only one slight awkward peck of a kiss. The
detective is not a creature of passion, but he may be, like Lydecker, a lover of
art;  it's revealed, climactically, that Laura's portrait will be auctioned and
that McPherson has put in a bid on it.

Title: Life with Dickens
Date: February 03, 2011

Charles Dickens and I are intimate friends and have been so since 1952,
when, delighted and astonished, I zoomed through David Copperfield -- the
first of ten or a dozen readings. At this very moment, I'm renewing our
long asymmetrical friendship by re-reading the fifteen novels (fourteen and
a half, actually, inasmuch as Dickens collapsed while Drood was still in
process). It's my third pilgrimage through the collected works; first in
the summer of 1969, again sometime in the early 1980s, and now once again
(no doubt the last). I know a couple of the novels almost word for word --
Great Expectations, for example, -- but others, such as Barnaby Rudge  --
gosh, I don't think that I could say any more about it than that it's a
historical novel and that it contains both riots and a conspicuous cherry
ribbon. I don't know any more about Barnaby Rudge than your average man on
the street. Despite these blank spots, my relationship with Dickens has been
enduring and satisfying. Troubled, some of the time, but always rich and
complex.

He's the best of novelists; he's the worst of novelists. Dickens' formula is
"make 'em laugh, make' em cry, make 'em wait." Waiting must have come easier in
previous centuries. It's a good thing that I'm a patient person, because these
800-pagers can wear a reader down. There are times in almost every one of the
novels in which I would be happier if there was a trifle less waiting. On the
other hand, laughing and crying have remained a splendid part of the Dickens
experience. No matter how much I steel myself against the obvious tearjerker
death or disaster looming at chapter's end, I still fall into the Dickens trap
and besprinkle my Penguin with hot tears -- not as plentiful, I think, as those
that I let fall when poor David's mother died in 1952, but no less genuine. And
when Aunt Betsey threatens to tread on Miss Murdstone's bonnet or when Trabb's
boy lashes himself with his empty blue bag -- well, even after all these years,
I can't help but break into loud laughter. When he goes after Chadband and
Creakle and Podsnap, he's unequalled. No one can equal Dickens for comedy.

I am convinced that the finest moment in all of nineteenth-century literature
occurs just in Bleak House, just after the death of poor Jo the crossing
sweeper, when Dickens stops the novel right in its tracks and directs the full 
force of his indignation at his own indifferent country: "Dead, your Majesty.
Dead, my lords and gentlemen. Dead, Right Reverends and Wrong Reverends of every
order. Dead, men and women, born with Heavenly compassion in your hearts. And
dying thus around us every day."  There has never been another writer who had
the magnificent effrontery, the bravura daring, to so attack his readers, high
and low. Dickens is a force of nature, not to be judged by ordinary canons of
literary excellence.

But Dickens can also be awful -- sentimental, gooey, repetitive,
obsessive. Sometimes the satire is ill-aimed. Why is it so ridiculous to
be concerned with the victims of imperialism?  Perhaps the denizens of
Borrioboola- Gha, on the left bank of the NIger, need all the help they can
get. Why should Mr. Guppy or young John Chivery to be so pilloried, just
because they dare to love above their stations?  Why does Dickens have so
much trouble with ambitious or wronged women?  Don't Miss Dartle and Miss
Wade have a right to be angry? And what about Dickens' Jewish problem? His
bigotry disfigures the page and makes the philosemitic Mr. Riah even more
offensive than horrid old Fagin. And then there are all those monsters of
goodness: the weak-tea Brownlows and Clennams. Dickens is sometimes faulted
for his caricatures, but his grotesques are a thousand times more realistic and
more interesting than his faultless, blameless, bowel-less goody-goodies. And
there are moments of high stupidity, such as Mr. Krook's death by spontaneous
combustion. Goodness gracious -- the greatest of hearts supported by the most
ordinary of brains.

Up next in my final passage through the novels, already two-thirds of the way to
the finish line: Dombey and Son,  where I'm going to cry at Paul's death, be
offended by perfect Walter Gay, giggle at Mr. Toots, marvel at Edith Grainger,
and spend far too much time transfixed by Carker's teeth.

Title: Ducks/ Bad Corporate Names
Date: February 23, 2011

It is possible that in the entire history of capitalism in America, the
silliest name that has ever been devised for a business is "Lady Footlocker."
I understand the reasoning behind the name: "Footlocker" was a successful
athletic goods store for men and the geniuses in charge wanted to hive off a
parallel enterprise for women. How to do so? Well, right here, in our state,
as all basketball enthusiasts know, we have the Colorado Buffs and the Lady
Buffs; why not, by analogy, Lady Footlocker -- except for the intractable fact
that footlockers don't exhibit gender. A female footlocker? Goodness gracious.
Not that the name "Lady Buffs" is at all is satisfactory -- although inasmuch
as a female buffalo is properly a cow -- well, things could be worse. Which
inevitably calls up the question of what to call the distaff version of Oregon's
famous Ducks. Lady Ducks? The obstacle here is that "duck" is already female
("drake" the male "duck"), so Lady Ducks would be excessively hyperfeminine.
The finest solution to this onomastic puzzle would be to change the men's team
to Drakes -- and then the female version would be immediately obvious. But what
about the related question: what to do for a mascot for Drake University of Des
Moines, Iowa. My choice would be Drake Monks, but I would accept Drake Drakes.
No such luck; in defiance of all mascot logic, they're the Drake Bulldogs --
and I'm going to guess that the women's team is called the Lady Bulldogs, but
I don't know for sure. It's a horrid moniker, but still orders of magnitude
superior to Lady Footlocker.

But is Lady Footlocker the worst corporate name, as I've asserted? I can offer
two other nominees. The first is Unisys (formerly Sperry-Rand); "siss" is
a syllable that should never be found in any corporation's name (except in
conjunction with -tem) especially if it expects to be taken seriously. My
other nominee:  a cleaning product that I use, which is called "Mr. Leather."
Entirely too S & M for my taste.

The question of worst corporate name is the kind of  topic for which the
internet is designed. If you google "worse corporate names," you find several
lists. Here follow some of my favorites: Casket Basement; Chainsaw Cottage;
Hung Fat Lingerie; Stiff Nipples Air Conditioning (you think that  I'm making
this up; check here; Blood's Seafood and Caterer; B. S. Liquidators;  Dodo
Mortuary; Cramps Liquors; Beaver Cleaners; Lynch Tree; PMS Firearms; Master Bait
and Tackle; Knobs and Knockers. There are dozens more, but none, I think, quite
so quintessentially absurd as Lady Footlocker.

Title: An Old Lesson Learned Once Again
Date: February 24, 2011

A good friend, a distinguished biologist, asked me to read his cancer
manuscript.

When I read science books (popularizations, for the most part), I usually do
so with only half a brain. I'm lazy; I skip the hard parts. But because I was
being asked for a serious opinion, I read this book closely. In all honesty, 
It hurt my head. The hardest chapters were those on the workings of the cell. I
last studied cells in high school biology class with Miss Goetschius.  It was
1957, before there was anything known about DNA.  We copied elementary pictures
of cells from the textbook. "You don't know how to stipple," Miss Goetschius
complained. There's a thousand times more known about cells than back then in
the dark ages, and I haven't gotten any smarter.

Cells are spectacularly complicated  -- no wonder it took billions of years for
them to evolve. Once the single cell had achieved a level of efficiency, the
rest of evolution -- even including us -- was piece of cake.

Reading about the lives of cells and about cancer (which is what happens when
cells go wrong) confirmed and strengthened my ideas about life and death. 
Life,our life, is almost entirely an accident. It's an accident that cells
incorporated pieces of bacteria to form mitochondria; it's an accident that they
agglutinated in the way that they did to form multicellular creatures; it's an
accident that we're here. But more than that: the success and the deterioriation
of the cells that make us are part of the same process. The end of life is
implicit in its inception. Cancer is exactly as natural as breathing.

It's trivial;  t's what everyone knows, it's what we've always known. It's a
cliche: "death is a natural part of life." And yet it's strangely comforting.
Whatever comes next -- cancer, heart disease, Alzheimer's -- is perfectly
natural. Of course it will lead to death. But it's also life.

Title: Conversation With Our Congressman
Date: February 26, 2011

I went to a forum, sponsored by local Dems, with our congressman. Fifty or
sixty of my friends and neighbors were in attendance. Our congressman is a
good person -- smart, informed, energetic, and progressive. He described the
situation in the House of Representatives -- the difficulty of serving in the
minority, especially when so many members of the majority side aren't serious
about governing. The audience was sympathetic but there was an undercurrent of
impatience. Why can't the Dems make it clear that cutting taxes and cutting the
deficit are incompatible goals?  Why do the Dems always lose the messaging
wars? Our congressman's answers were not always satisfactory to his liberal
constituents.

I understand his plight;  i's easy to stand outside and criticize. But I also
felt that he didn't appreciate how damn dangerous these right-wing Republicans
and tea-partiers have become. The gap between rich and poor is becoming larger
and less ameliorable. We could lose our democracy to the corporations.

Afterwards, I asked him, semi-privately, if the new Republican congressman can
be educated. Will they ever come to realize that governing is a hard job that
can't be done with slogans and a simplistic ideology.  He didn't think much of
my question and didn't answer it.

I was filled with foreboding when I left for the forum. I returned home even
more pessimistic about the future.

Title: Amnesia in Films:  Random Harvest (1942)
Date: March 04, 2011

In Mervyn LeRoy's Random Harvest (1942), amnesia is not merely a plot gimmick.
The amnesia of Charles Rainier, a shell-shocked World War I veteran, is the
principal subject of the film. Rainier (Ronald Colman) begins in Condition A
(amnesiac but solid citizen and loving husband) but is hit by a cab in Liverpool
and transitions to Condition B (aristocratic, efficient, but passionless, and
with no knowledge of the three years between the war and the cab). Will he
remember the lost years and reintegrate the two parts of his hstory?  Well,
yes, he does, but only with the decades-long assistance of his patient-Griselda
wife Paula/Margaret (excellently played by the ageless Greer Garson).

It's kind of a soap-opera-y film and I'm embarrassed to confess that it moved
me. The last scene, in which Rainier finally remembers that he had long ago
loved and married Margaret under her real name Paula, is a curious kind of
anagnorisis. Although they've known each other for decades, true recognition
comes suddenly and joyfully. And I bought it, much against my will. Dropped a
reluctant tear.

Because of the amnesia, Charles has two different lives, but he doesn't, as
in other films, have two different personalities. He's kindly, steadfast, and
rather boring in both states. The film offers little in the way of a theory
of amnesia. "As one door opens, another closes" says a friendly but passive
psychiatrist, whose expertise is validated only by his middle-European accent.

In most films, diseases resemble their manifestations in real life. Amnesia,
on the other hand, can be anything the screenwriter says it it is. It's a
mighty elastic phenomenon, unmoored to medical experience or knowledge. However
imagined, the total amnesia of characters in films is a great plot device.
The audience is always in the know and therefore feels superior to the poor
character/actor who stumbles toward an understanding of his own self. It's hard
to believe that Shakespeare was able to write forty plays without ever resorting
to amnesia.

At a social event a few days ago I met a psychologist who works at the AFB in
Colorado Springs with veterans of Afghanistan and Iraq. I asked her if she
had ever encountered a case of amnesia. She said that many injured personnel
can't remember the moments just before they were wounded, but that she'd never
enountered a case of movie-style amnesia. Or heard of one. And, she added, trust
me, I've dealt with many kinds of mental disturbances.

Title: How Long Has This Been Going On?
Date: March 06, 2011

I have a favorite moment in Diner (1982), the first of Barry Levinson's quartet
of Baltimore movies, and it's not the scene in which I made my silver-screen
debut. It's when two of the working-class guys who hang out at the Fells Point
hamburger joint find themselves taking a drive in the Maryland countryside. They
happen upon a rich, well-tended young blonde woman riding an elegant horse (in
her own spacious meadow). They stop the car try to chat her up but she's clearly
out of their league. When she gallops off, one of the guys says to the other:
"Do you ever get the feeling that there's something going on that we don't know
about?"

I was thinking about that scene when I read that Moammar Ghaddafi's son Seif
threw himself a birthday party at some spectacular resort in the West Indies and
paid the pop singer Mariah Carey $1,000,000 smackerootis to sing four songs. You
read it right -- one millions bucks. The article didin't say whether she had to
pay for her own motel and continental breakfast and transportation but I'm going
to guess that expenses were extra.

I tried to calculate whether I had earned $1M in my working life. I can't
remember and I don't have the records, but I know that I started at $3600 and 
by 1966 I was already pulling down $7800. I think that in my first decade of
employment I earned well under $100,000. Yeah, I know, them was different
dollars -- but still.

A working guy who makes $40,000 would take 25 years to earn what Mariah Carey
took home for twenty minutes of effort.

But it's not what she earned so much as what he paid. The Ghaddafi clan of
brutes, lunatics, oil-bloated twits, and kleptocrats has been looting the
Libyans for forty years. No wonder that the family is willing to commit mass
murder to hold on to their hoard. (In his defence, Seif claimed that it wasn't
him; it was his brother Muatassim.) Here's a question: how many years does it
take your run-of-the-mill Libyan to earn $1M?

I think that the average Libyan would understand the point of view of the diner
guys. There's something going on out there, and it ain't all good.

Title: Sticker Shock
Date: March 14, 2011

In the old days, when I'd whip up a big batch of spaghetti sauce, I'd add a
pound or so of ground beef and a generous portion of hot Italian sausage. But
that was B. C. (before cholesterol). Nowadays, it's all vegetarian. Not nearly
as tasty, but acceptable -- and appropriate, in its blandness, to these latter
days.  To enrich the meatless mixture, I add a couple of cuisinarted carrots
and a grated zucchini or two.

At our local food market, a 6" zucchini costs $1.00. An entire buck. I'm not
usually one to complain about the price of things. It's not helpful or cheerful
to do so.  I pay the freight and and I'm glad to be able to do so.  I don't
grieve about the cost of cars or insurance or potatoes. Nevertheless, I'm
appalled when I plunk down that dollar for a short, skinny zucchini.

The zucchini is an abundant fruit.  Production is measured in cornucopias. In
August and September, at harvest time, it's impossible to keep up with them. 
Just two small hills and there are so many zucchinis that we can't possibly eat
them, can't give them away, and have to get out the backhoe and dig a trench to
dispose of them. (In our part of Vermont, there's a local saying that in late
summer you must keep the door of your car locked or someone will open it up and
throw in a zucchini.)  And then there's always the hidden zuke that, hiding
under an enormous leaf, has grown to the size of a three-year-old child, only
heavier.

I know that it shouldn't be so, but that dollar for a measly little zucchini
irks me.

Title: Phallophagia
Date: March 16, 2011

I was informed that the granddaughter had become interested in Egyptian
mythology, so I decided to buy her a book on the topic. It's hard to know what
to put in the hands of a young lady whose reading level is astonishing but who
is just eight years old. I visited the "young adult" quarters at our local
library and withdrew four books on the subject. Which one to buy?

The first book that I looked at was clearly inappropriate. It read as though it
had been condensed out of the 11th edition of the Encyclopedia Brittanica. Hard
words, unelucidated, and a patronizing, paleocolonialist point of view. The next
book was too simple -- all pictures and treacle. The third book, a retelling of
the story of Isis and Osiris, was moving along nicely until Seth tore the body
of Osiris into fourteen pieces and scattered them all over the landscape. "When
Isis heard this, she paddled over the swamps in a little boat looking for the
fragments of Osiris to put them back together again and make them whole. After
much searching she found all the parts of Osiris except his phallus which had
been swallowed by a fish." Can this story be recommended for eight-year-olds.
Would it be appropriate for Sesame Street or Mr. Rogers?

Call me squeamish if you must. Diagnose me with an advanced case of castration
anxiety. Stigmatize me as indifferent to the profound Jungian significance of
this gruesome story. Say what you will -- I do not want to explain phallophagia
to the young lady. Frankly, I don't even want to explain "phallus."

Book number four seemed to be acceptable and I have purchased a copy of it.
I hope I made a good decision. Book number four is about Egyptian religion,
not Egyptian mythology ("mythology" is an unquestionably loaded and derogatory
word).

The book might be a little hard for the granddaughter and it might be a little
too detailed. I'm hoping that she skims or skips the section of the book that
describes Egyptian embalming techniques. "Inner organs were usually dried after
removal and placed in special containers called canopic jars. The embalmer's
tools included a spirally curved copper hook for breaking the ethmoid bone in
the back of the nose to remove the brain, which was then discarded."

Eeew, as they say nowadays.

Perhaps I am just a tad squeamish.

Title: Haircuts: A Lifetime of Sweating in the Chair
Date: March 25, 2011

When I was a child, haircuts were perpetrated at Joe's Barber Shop on Coney
Island Avenue. It was a pleasant place: there were wall-to-wall mirrors on
either side of Joe Montuori's shop, and a boy sitting in the chair could lose
himself in the series of infinitely-regressing images. Joe always had a friend
or two in the shop with whom he spoke incomprehensible rapid-fire Italian. The
haircutting itself was an ordeal. Joe charged 75 cents a head, but my mother had
driven a bargain: three haircuts (myself and my two brothers) for $1.80. Joe
revenged himself on me by a) working the electric buzzer as rapidly as possible,
and b) frequently re-arranging the angle of my head with a blow from the heel
of his hand. Back home, my mother would sigh and say, "Turn around. Let's see
what he did to you this time."

I'm not big on personal adornment, and, perhaps because of my early hair-
chopping experiences, I've never been comfortable in the barber's seat. As soon
as the cloth is fastened around my neck I feel hogtied and hopeless. "What
are they going to do to me today?" Once, on the west side of Manhattan,
in the late 1960s, when my hair was rather long (it seems absurd that you
could signal your opposition to the war in Vietnam by letting your hair
grow, but such was the case), I walked into a shop and asked the barber to
"leave it long." He immediately transformed me into a rabid supporter of
carpet-bombing. Also in New York: when I naively wandered into a shop with a
specialized clientele, a hair technician employing a razor and a variety of
gels and lotions turned me into someone whose hair was giving off signals with
which the rest of his body was not in accord. In Hanover, New Hampshire, in
an upstairs 'salon,' the barber suddenly stopped work, drew back, studied me
for fifteen or twenty seconds, and asked, "Are you Jewish." I mumbled something
about not really wanting to discuss my ethnicity with him, whereupon he launched
into a disquisition of which I understood not much and remember less, except
that that it involved prophecy, the Book of Isaiah, and The Hatching of the Egg.
He hauled out his heavily annotated King James Version and pointed me to various
passages underlined in coded colors. As it happens, I'm more conversant than
most people with scripture, and so I can assert with moderate authority that his
reading of the Bible was -- how shall I say -- original. It took me an hour to
extricate myself from his insistent and wayward scholarship: fifteen minutes of
hair-cutting and forty-five minutes of exegetical enthusiasm.

For a decade or so, when our finances were perilous, my wife cut my hair. There
were some benefits (a guy could cop a feel while being ministered to) but I
must admit that although my good woman was earnest and effective, she never
fully mastered tonsorial technique. She had the habit of yanking upwards on the
strands with the scissors, with the result that each snip produced a stab of
pain -- although nothing more intense than might have been alleviated by the
injection of a dozen or score shots of novocaine directly into the scalp. And
then there were the ear nicks.

After a while, I returned hair responsibility to the world of commerce. I
had success for many years with Liz of Chicago Hair across town. Liz was
good at her work and respected my multiple cowlicks. But then she started to
raise her prices. When she reached $20, I would just hand her the Visa and ask
her not to tell me what she charged. When she went to $30, I retaliated by
spacing the haircuts further and further apart in order to keep my annual cost
constant. But when she broached the $40 barrier, the puritan in me rebelled. I
started to patronize the cheap ($14) barbershop across the street from the
college. There's a rotating staff and it's hit-and-miss: sometimes the results
are acceptable, sometimes disastrous.

When I come home from the expedition, my wife says, "Let's see what they've done
to you today."

And then she sighs.

Title: What We Read in the Forties:  The Story of Ferdinand
Date: April 02, 2011

Yesterday's NYTimes reports that it's the 75th anniversary of the first
publication of The Story of Ferdinand by Munro Leaf.  This brief novel about
a pacific bull was the first book that I knew and loved. It was The Book of
my first few years on earth and I've probably read it, to myself and to my
children, twenty times more than I've read King Lear and Hamlet combined. I've
never tested myself, but I might be able to recite it from beginning to end with
only an occasional prompt. I believe that several leaves from my 1942 codex are
still the the family archives (and by archives, I mean those plastic boxes in
the basement),

I did not know that "Ferdimam" (as the kids call it) was thought by many to
be a subversive, unpatriotic allegory and that it had been banned by Franco
and burned by Hitler. As a child, it never occured to me that Ferdinand was
a pacifist -- I thought he was sensible.Why be killed in a bullfight when you
can sit and smell the flowers?

It was the book's language that engaged me, especially the one sentence that
was my first taste of pure, immortal, transcendent poetry: "Flags were flying,
bands were playing... and all the lovely ladies had flowers in their hair." 
Not even Shakespeare ever composed a more glorious succession of iambs.

he'd say, 'whatever happens, happens.  You're old, enjoy the day.' Finally
he retired. He took a job as a dance instructor on a cruise ship. I'm not
kidding. He leads exercises or something. So I went to a younger doctor. He
listens to me breathe, pokes around a bit, puts me in the hospital, and now I
have three stents."

Title: A Very Distressing Memory
Date: April 08, 2011

There's been a re-birth of nativism in the "give me your tired, your poor" land
that I love. The right-wingers, who need someone to hate, have decided that
anti-Hispanic and anti-Muslim noise-making is just what our beleaguered country
needs right now.

All of which brought to mind a painful memory. Sometime in the 1970s, I was
sitting in a coffee room at the U. -- a rare event for me -- and a group of
people were recalling happy moments from their various childhoods. One of the
participants was a grey-haired woman perhaps 15 years older than I. She was a
secretary or administrative assistant at not mine but some other department. She
was a kindly, competent, unpretentious woman with whom I occasionally exhanged a
few words of greeting or business.

I can't remember exactly what the other participants ibn the discussion
remembered from their early days -- probably hunting trips with dad, hitting
the winning single in a softball game, a romp with the family dog -- but I will
never forget what Masako recalled: "When I was in the internment camp in Utah,
one day Marian Anderson came to sing for us."

Title: Lola's Language at Eighteen Months
Date: April 09, 2011

Her language consists mostly of nouns: "baby" -- both herself and her beloved
doll; "wawa" (water);  "mommy";  "daddy"; "ayi" (Chinese for aunt);  "didi"
(Chinese jiějie, older sister); "paopao" (Chinese, grandmother); "pock"
(pocket); "book"; "ball": "eye"; "nose" etc.  Her words are occasionally less
specified than they will soon become; for example, "duck" seems to mean "bird."
At the zoo, she identified an emu as a duck. Similarly, "gogo" (Chinese for
dog), means mammal, even including the zoo's llama. "Up" can mean either up or
down; it seems to signify a change of position. "No" occasionallly means "yes";
she seems to conceive it as a response to a question. There is, however, no
ambiguity to her very definitive "mine."

When she slid down the slide in the park, her audience exclaimed "whee."  Lola
responded, "I do whee," understanding "whee" to be the name of the action rather
than an exclamation of pleasure.

Title: How to Harvest Me
Date: April 12, 2011

Yesterday I renewed my expired driver's license. I was worried about the eye
exam because of the cataracts, but I passed easily. Believe me, the bar for
visual acuity is not set very high.

On my previous license, "hair" was "brown";  this time, it's "gray."

The clerk asked, "Are you willing to be an organ donor?"  "Sure," I answered,
"but I don't know whether  anyone would want my organs."

Surely no one would want my myopic, be-cataracted eyes. Nor my ears (although
they would be  supplemented with an expensive set of hearing aids at no extra
charge). My heart?  Well, if it came with a "Use at Own Risk" label and a whole
library of erratic ECG printouts. Certainly not my spine, which was a "second"
or "factory reject" right from the womb. I would not recommend it even at a
severe markdown. My liver -- I think I can recommend my liver. It's barely been
used and should command a premium. My prostate -- now there's a bargain in the
making. A prostate is supposed to be the size of a walnut, but mine is more like
a potato, perhaps a Yukon Gold -- and yet as far as I know it is cancer free. It
could be chopped up and transplanted into three or four men.

My best organ, if it's an organ, is definitely my knees, both right and left. 
I'm at the age where knee-replacement is commonplace, but I have the knees of a
twenty-five year old: flexible, functioning, pain-free, even if somewhat prone
to hyperextension. Some linebacker who's abused his own would be overjoyed to
extend his career with a perfectly wonderful set of knees. Or a basketball
player, preferably someone who wants to regain his "hops." Maybe, in someone
else's body, my knees could finally win the trophies and renown that they
deserve.

Title: The Most Obscene Word in the English Language
Date: April 14, 2011

The foulest, most obscene word in the English language, at least as far as
sound is concerned, is, by all odds, "kumquat."  It's hard to say whether
it's the "kum" or the "quat" that is more reprehensible, but the two together,
o my goodness gracious! "Kum" is linked to Fr. "con" and ME (Middle English)
"queynte" as well as to the common colloquialism for sexual climax. "Quat"
recalls Shakespeare's "quatch buttock" and also "quatch" in its exceedingly
vulgar modern urban signification. Readers attentive to language will also hear
in "quat" an echo of Robert Browning's famous "twat." (PG-13 rated note: Having
encountered in an anonymous 1660 poem the couplet "They talk'd of his having
a Cardinall's Hat; /They'd send him as soon an Old Nun's Twat," Browning took
"twat" to refer to article of clothing and so composed the following: "Then owls
and bats/ Cowls and twats/ Monks and nuns in a cloister's moods/ Adjourn to the
oak-stump pantry."  It would appear that Browning was insufficiently alert to
obscenity.)

"Kumquat" should properly be used in formulations such as "why don't you shove
it up your kumquat?" or "eat my kumquat," or "your mother is a kumquat."

If only Kobe Bryant hadn't called the referee a "fucking f-gg-t" but had called
him a "fucking kumquat" instead. He would not been fined $100,000 and he would
have enjoyed a far more satisfactory vituperative experience.

Incidentally, one of the most popular varieties of kumquat is the "fukushu."
Honest.

Title: Book Report:  G. Willow Wilson's The Butterfly Mosque
Date: April 25, 2011

It's bad enough to be born into and involuntarily indoctrinated into a
religion, but if a person has the good fortune to be born into a family of
non-believers, why should he or she regress to dogma and doctrine and fantasies
of the afterlife?

But then, I'm tone deaf and colorblind to religion.

Nevertheless (you can trust me here, dear blog-reader), I've read more than my
share of the kind of autobiography called the "conversion narrative" in which
the writer describes how he or she came to locate and embrace some particular
god or creed. "Conversion narratives" generally take one of two shapes. In
some of them, the subject experiences a sudden blinding insight (after the
style Saul/Paul on the road to Damascus); in others, the author endures
a long dark night of the soul that is painfully and gradually superseded
with "enlightenment" (Newman's Apologia is the archetype).

G. Willow Wilson's memoir The Butterfly Mosque (New York, 2010) describes a
conversion of a sort that I've never before encountered -- it lacks not only
a voice from the clouds and but also a scalding of the heart. Wilson simply
sets out with a desire to convert and then hunts for an appropriate religion
-- a most odd and unusual  procedure. In college, Wilson reports, she was "in
the market for a philosophy." Soon after, she became a Muslim -- essentially
because she wanted to be something and couldn't think of anything better.

Here's the key paragraph: "I discovered I was a monotheist....  That rules
out polytheism.  I also have a problem with authority, which rules out any
religion with a priesthood.... And I cannot believe that having given us these
bodies, God thinks we should be virgins unless we desperately feel a need to
reproduce. That rules out any religion that is against family planning or sex
for fun....  Islam is antiauthoritarian, sex-positive monotheism."

It's a series of reasons so quirky that it's hard to take seriously.  If
I were G. Willow's spiritual counselor, and she came to me with such a
shallow argument, I would have said, "go home, young lady, take a couple of
years and try to think more deeply."

"I discovered I was a monotheist"? Mere mysticism, no more more persuasive
than "I discovered I believed in only one angel." Islam has no priesthood? 
Depends on how you define priest, doesn't it. No Roman-style priest who acts
as an intermediary to God, but a heck of a priestly establishment nonetheless
-- boatloads of imans and mullahs and ayatollahs all laying claim to special
forms of knowledge. Is Islam sex-friendly?  Perhaps in theory, but in practice
it's hard to find a more misogynist or homophobic operation out there in
monotheismland -- and I suspect that sex is more cheerful when it's shared by
equal partners.

On the whole, Islam does not meet Wilson's three criteria nearly as well as the
Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, which is monotheist to a overcooked
fault, supports not a single priest (only a website), and as far as I know,
expresses not the slightest antagonism to sex in any form or coloration.

The Butterfly Mosque offers its readers some very sensitive insights into
Egyptian society and especially into American-Muslim relations. It's also a fine
little love story -- a young American woman finds a sweet young man in Cairo
and tactfully negotiates the profound cultural barriers that might have divided
them. Sometimes it seems a little like Romeo and Juliet gone all sentimental
and gooey -- as though the young lady would be secretly happier if her marriage
had caused a Montague-Capulet feud. It doesn't because both Omar's family and
G. Willow's parents are urbane, sophisticated, open, loving, practical and non-
ideological  and offer no resistance whatsoever to the exogamous marriage. And
Wilson is honest enough to admit it.

I worry about the stability of this conversion.  When a new religion is
embraced for such superficial reasons, it can be shucked equally as easily.  It
wouldn't surprise me if G. Willow returns, some day, to the steady rationality
of her parents. Let's hope so.

Title: "See the Ball, Hit the Ball"
Date: April 28, 2011

When Manny Ramirez visited George Washington High School, his former baseball
coach, Steve Mandl, asked hm to say something to his players about the art of
hittiing.  Ramirez, one of the most spectacular batters of all time (555
home runs, .585 slugging, .313 batting average), thought for a few moments and
then pronounced "see the ball, hit the ball."  From which we can derive that
he is not looking at a post-retirement career as a hitting coach.  He may be
the idiot savant of hitting.

Good thing the coach didn't ask him about fielding.  "See the ball, fumble the
ball."

"See the ball, hit the ball" is universal  wisdom that transcends its baseball
context -- like Wayne Gretzky's famous "skate to where the puck is going to be,
not where it is."

I've heard the masterful sentence ascribed also to Pete Rose.  But it's more
far more appropriate to Manny.

Title: Carving by Paul Gaugin
Date: May 02, 2011

I visited the quirky but impressive Gauguin exhibition at the National Gallery.

Some of the Tahitian paintings are genuinely "iconic" but certainly worth
viewing in real life, where they're a ton more wonderful than in the familiar
reproductions.

In my great ignorance, I had not a shred of knowledge of Gauguin's carvings,
and was frankly, dazzled by their beauty. Illustrations do scant justice. Even
more than the paintings, the sculptures need to be seen. (They also need to be
handled, but art galleries don't exactly encourage tactile familiarity. I hate
the nasty beeper that goes off when you I bring my near-sighted eyes close to
the object.)

"Soyez amoureuses," one of Gauguin's most interesting carvings, is made of
painted linden wood.  It's a hefty 97cm x 75cm. Here's what the artist said of
it:

I have been working for 2 months on a large (painted wood) carving and I'm bold
enough to believe it's the best thing I've done up to now as far as strength
and balance are concerned (although the literary side of it seems crazy to many
people. A monster, who looks like me, is holding a naked woman by the hand --
that's the main subject.  The spaces are filled by smaller figures.) At the
top there's a town, some sort of Babylon, and at the bottom the countryside with
a few imaginary flowers (a desolate old woman) and a fox, the prophetic animal
of perversity among the Indians... Despite the inscription, the people look sad,
in contradiction to the title.

Like Blake and Yeats, Gauguin had developed his own private mythology.

The sculpture was exhibited in Brussels in 1891 and provoked a "critical storm"
-- but what sort of tempest my catalog don't say.

This carving was lent to the National Gallery by the Museum of Fine Arts in
Boston which apparently has other Gauguin sculptures.

Now I have an incentive for another visit to New England.

Title: News from the "Hair Industry"
Date: May 02, 2011

While indulging a long, pleasant walk this morning, I happened upon a shop I
had never before noticed.  It's called Juno's Studio of Contemporary Hair
Artistry.  I ws curious as to whether a "hair artistry studio" was what we
called in the old days a "barber shop" or a "beauty shop." I tried to peek
inside the shop but the situation was a tad too "architectooralooral" (in
Mr. Joe Gargery's phrase) for me to feel  comfortable doing so. Nevertheless,
I was sufficiently intrigued about "contemporary hair artistry" to
visit Juno's website. I am now prepared to "share" with my readership what I
have learned. The following paragraph comes to you absolutely verbatim.

"Jules Juno’s passion for the hair industry pulses through her life and work
at every turn and every look, as her creative spirit is continuously fueled by
the rhythms, themes and movements of the subtle and deep rich nuances of the
world around her - from the street to the flora, feathers and fur of nature,
to the lines of fashion and art in all its forms. Aligned closely with the
powerful totem of Raven and ready to celebrate newness in light of every full
moon, she dwells in the magic of change and transformation. Often called the
“Hair Shaman” and “Keeper of the Hair” by her devoted clients, Jules
believes in the sacredness of being trusted to work her creative magic on the
high chakra space of one’s head."

I can tell you one person whose brilliant (though graying) mane Juno's not
going work her creative magic upon (even though the hair industry pulses
through every deep rich nuance of its rhythms, themes and movements). Mine,
that's who's. Keep your ever-loving hands off my high chakra space, Hair
Shaman!!

Upon further investigation, Juno (her real name?) turns out to be a disciple
of Minnesotan Horst Rechelbacher -- under whose tutelage she taught "for a
triune of years before adventuring her creative genius as a platform artist." 
In our town, she plans to "keep the fires of inspiration burning and push the
edges of hair design."

And while here, she will also "push the edges" of New Age Bullshit.

By the way, what the heck is a "platform artist?"  And what distinguishes a
"triune of years" from "three years?"

Title: "Holbein" Rugs
Date: May 04, 2011

What is this remarkable object? It's a seventeenth-century Turkish rug that
now resides in the Philadelphia Museum of Art. It's of a type called a
"Holbein."  And just why, pray tell, should a class of rugs be named after
a sixteenth- century German painter? Was Holbein a closet weaver? Or
an importer of rugs?  No. The answer is that rugs of this sort appear
prominently in paintings by Holbein, and, inasmuch as textiles deteriorate
more rapidly than oil paintings, much more is known about early Turkish rugs
from their representation in European art than from the bits and fragments that
have managed to survive. Hence "Holbein."

It may be not be easy to see in the picture (rugs need to be seen and handled
in person) but on closer inspection, it's clear that there's a repeating
geometric pattern in the field within the rug's borders.  That pattern is the
hallmark of the "Holbein" rug.

Look again at Holbein's best-known picture, "The Ambassadors."

The canvas is loaded with realistic and iconographic detail, and,
moreover, it's easy to be transfixed by the floating magic-realism-ish
anamorphic death's head that dominates the bottom quarter of the canvas. But
look, on the table, under the very up-to-date scientific instruments, a Turkish
rug!  Look again.

The rug that's depicted is comprised a series of squares of which the right
side of one and the left side of the other are clearly visible.  It's a very
handsome "Holbein."

There's an even clearer example in Holbein's "Darmstadt Madonna." There it
is, in its full anachronistic glory -- a lovely example of a "Turkey carpet"
enriching the very  bottom of the picture.  The repeating geometric pattern
is fully revealed.  It's not the same rug as the one in the "Ambassadors"
portrait, but it's clearly in the same style.

"Holbein" rugs don't just appear in Holbeins.  There's a great example
in Andrea del Verrocchio's "Madonna with john the Baptist and Donatus" (c.
1480).

A sixteenth-century Turkish rug right at the feet of the madonna and child    .
Anachronisticissimus                                                           .

I pause here for a bit of autobiography. in the summer of 1968, Mrs. Dr.
Metablog, struck by a sudden infatuation, bid for and won at a country auction
in rural Vermont a small geometric ( 4' x 5') rug. It's been with us now these
forty years and  has been a constant source of visual pleasure. No, it's not
a Holbein, but it's in the same phylum. it's a Konakghend prayer rug, perhaps
dating from the late nineteenth century, and like many Kuba or Shirvan rugs,
it's geometrical (rather than swirly or floral) in design. Something like a
"Holbein" but not quite. I would love to have a "Holbein" on one of my otherwise
blank walls. There's something mighty intriguing and suggestive about their
cross-cultural links. But in the matter of antique rugs (as in other areas of
art), my taste is infinitely in advance of my wallet. Instead of purchasing,
we gratify our enthusiasm for rugs by going to exhibits, visiting the museums
(including the almost unknown Textile Museum in DC), wandering into the better
rug stores (NOT the ones that are declaring bankruptcy and in which EVERYTHING
is now 70-80% off) where we pretend to be wealthy, and we study the rug books.
Let me testify: "oriental" rugs are one of the great, great, great art forms.

Are genuine "Holbeins" still available?  (I mean old Turkish ones, not new
sweatshop or machine made jobbies from India or China.)  Here's one that was
recently sold on Ebay.

It's a mid-nineteenth-century beauty and, to judge from the picture, in
remarkably fine shape for its age. It's described as a "Yuntdag," which is a
region in West Anatolia. If I had the cash or even the credit, I'd jump on it.
And then I would let a photographer take my picture while I pose in front of it,
and by doing so connect myself to Holbein and Verrocchio-- to the aesthetic part
of the tradition, that is, not to the Virgin part.

Title: Why We Hate Wells Fargo
Date: May 13, 2011

The New York Times says that former employees of Wells Fargo admit that
they "systematically singled out blacks in Baltimore and suburban Maryland
for high- interest subprime mortgages."  "These loans," Baltimore officials
have claimed in a federal lawsuit against Wells Fargo, "tipped hundreds of
homeowners into foreclosure and cost the city tens of millions of dollars in
taxes and city services."  Why did the bank act with such malice?  Because
Wells Fargo "saw the black community as fertile ground for subprime mortgages,
as working-class blacks were hungry to be a part of the nation’s home-owning
mania. Loan officers pushed customers who could have qualified for prime loans
into subprime mortgages. Wells Fargo employees picturesquely identified these
transactions as "ghetto loans" made to “mud people.”

The city of Baltimore has filed a suit against Wells Fargo.  "The toll taken
by such policies, Baltimore officials argue, "is terrible. Data released by the
city as part of the suit show that more than half the properties subject to
foreclosure on a Wells Fargo loan from 2005 to 2008 now stand vacant. And 71
percent of those are in predominantly black neighborhoods."

It's called reverse redlining -- systematically marketing the most expensive and
onerous loans to black customers.

So here's the deal.  The city of Baltimore loses, the neighborhoods lose,
individual families are financially crippled for a lifetime, and the CEO of
Wells Fargo gets a 50% raise to $21,000,000 a year. What a deal!

What's going to happen to the suit?  It was filed in January, 2008.  Three
years later, after a predictable spate of legal wrangling, a federal judge
has allowed the suit to go forward, but not before Wells Fargo "succeeded in
limiting the pretrial discovery the city has been able to get and in limiting
the allegations and damages the city could claim if the case makes it to trial."
A bank spokeswoman said Wells Fargo will “continue to defend ourselves
vigorously.”

Here's what's going to happen. The bank, which has far greater resources
that the city,  will assign a couple of hundred lawyers to the case and wear
down Baltimore with various hair-splitting motions.  Judges will retire
and/or die. The case will be in the courts for an unknown number of Jarndyce and
Jarndyce units of time. After a generation or so, when most of the aggrieved
will have long since left the earth, Wells Fargo will settle for a slap on the
wrist and pay a nominal fine, but admit to no guilt. The bank will trumpet its
vindication. Justice will not be served.  It will be bought.

Can we possibly imagine what will have happened to the many thousandes of no-
longer-occupied houses and to their one time oh-so hopeful purchasers?  Nothing
good, trust me.

Title: Erasmus Hall in All about Eve
Date: May 15, 2011

"Phoebe," she calls herself, but in the script she's just
"girl." It's the last scene of Joseph L. Mankiewicz's (Stuyvesant '24) All
about Eve. "Phoebe" has sneaked into Eve Harrington's hotel room and has
pretended to fall asleep. Eve accosts her and is about to call the police
when the intruderess proclaims herself a fan of the actress. Here's their
conversation:

"GIRL You know the Eve Harrington clubs - that they've got in most of the
girls' high schools?EVE I've heard of them.GIRL Ours was one of the first.
Erasmus Hall. I'm the president.EVE Erasmus Hall. That's in Brooklyn, isn't
it?GIRL Lots of actresses come from Brooklyn. Barbara Stanwyck, Susan Hayward -
of course, they're just movie stars."Phoebe might also have mentioned that both
Barbara Stanwyck (Ruby Stevens) and Susan Hayward (Edythe Marrener) were not
only from Brooklyn, but also from Erasmus Hall High School. Why doesn't she say
so? Or is being a native of Brooklyn disability enough?

Phoebe might have added to her list and mentioned that Mae West was also an
alumna of the same high school. Cheers to Erasmus Hall, mother of actresses --
even though Erasmus's Barbra Streisand '59 was still in braces and still in
P. S. something or other when All about Eve was being exhibited at the Leader
Theater on Coney Island Avenue.

Supposed Erasmian "Phoebe" was played by the young Barbara Bates, who was highly
credible as an upwardly mobile Brooklynite. Her small part includes an iconic
moment when, in the film's last scene, she appears in full narcissistic glory,
preening in front of a triptych of mirrors as she tries on Eve's clothes. She
is reflected in multiple, infinitely regressing fragments. Bates, a native of
Denver, Colorado, did not, alas, live up to her early promise, but soon after
the completion of this film fell into bouts of insanity that came to an end only
when she took her own life in 1959.

But why Erasmus?  Because its graduates had achieved a reputation for fierce
ambition? Perhaps, but also because Erasmus (as Mankiewicz would well have
known) was even more provincial -- as only the outer boroughs of New York can
be provincial -- than Eve Harrington's childhood Wisconsin. "Phoebe" is another
Eve and equally naive and countrified. She's a doppelganger on deck, a secret
sharer in ovo, a Mr Hyde in the making; she's also defensive, megalomaniacal,
unsophisticated, slightly loony, and ruthless. And so it was an excellent
decision to root her in EHHS, where at least 20% of the students, if I remember
correctly, had almost exactly the same traits of character.

Title: Amnesia in Film: Shattered (1991)
Date: May 20, 2011

The "neo-noir" film Shattered (1991) was directed by Wolfgang Petersen, who
elicited a mumble-mouth performance by Tom Berenger and an incoherent one from
Greta Scacchi. It's another in the endless parade of amnesia movies. In
this variant, the central character, Dan Merrick, goes over the cliff in his
Mercedes and emerges not only disfigured but, it seems, without the least
knowledge of his own person or past. The film clearly demonstrates that movie
amnesia can be just as flexible as a tricky plot demands. Amnesia in Shattered
has nothing to do with the real human brain and its gesture to the facts of
existence  is mighty perfunctory.

DOCTOR (authoritative, bearded): "We call it psychogenic amnesia. Patient
doesn't know his name, his family, his personal history. Everything else he
remembers. The year, who's president. He can drive a car, he can function
professionally, but anything personal is out of reach."

And now the gimmick (major spoiler coming up, so if you plan to see the movie
[which I cannot recommend], please avert your innocent eyes). Not only does
Dan Merrick not remember anything of his pre-accident past, he's not even Dan
Merrick!  He's Judth Merrick's lover, Jack Stanton, transformed by plastic
surgery into a simulacrum of Dan. And he doesn't have the least clue that he's
someone else.

There's a exceedingly complicated plot which involves voluntary and involuntary
impersonations, a private investigator out of Cliche Central, two murders and
three car crashes. The incredible upshot is that the villain (the temptress-
wife) is killed and that Jack permanently assumes the role of Dan.

Jack's amnesia is cured in the last scene, but not before it has been
mysteriously promulgated among  his friends, acquaintances, and business
associates, all of whom are utterly deceived by the plastic surgery and
seem not to notice that there have also been changes to his voice, his
walk, his manner, and his personality. These poor folks suffer from a
devastating manifestation of Hollywoodish forgetfulness. It could be called
"contact amnesia." An absurd idea, but not more absurd than the plot of
Shattered.

Title: Reposted:  Antimylarmonofilamentarianism
Date: May 23, 2011

In 1895, my wise and courageous grandparents left the abysmal, backward Ukraine
and struck out for the new world. Nine years later, my father was born in a
cold-water flat in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn. The date of his
birth: December 22, 1904, exactly at the winter solstice. "And they called his
name, Emanuel, God with us." If he had been born in the old country, before the
Russian authorities imposed legal cognomina upon us, he would have been named
Emanuel ben Isaiah -- his father's name appended to his own as a patronymic.

Despite his traditional moniker and his commitment to the essence of Judaism,
my father was fiercely hostile to the irrationalities of religion. His view --
and my grandfather Isaiah's even more strongly -- was that for a thousand years
our lineage had been kept in poverty and darkness not just by the czars and the
Cossacks but also by the rabbis. In politics my father and grandfather began
as socialists and became New Dealers; in philosophy, they rejected theological
doctrine and were among the children of the Enlightenment whom Moses Mendelssohn
had led to the promised land of evidence and reason. I doubt that any of my
ancestors knew Karl Marx's sentence that "the criticism of religion is the
beginning of all criticism," but they spoke and acted as though such wisdom
had been absorbed from the cradle. My brothers and I were taught to resist
the exclusivity, superstition, and ceremony and especially the triumphalism of
religion.

We now have a religious controversy in our peaceful, progressive, and largely
secular western town. A group of orthodox Jews have petitioned the city council
for permission to construct an eruv. What is an eruv? It’s a “symbolic
boundary that allows orthodox Jews to carry things, including their own
children, outside their home during the Sabbath." (Carrying is considered work,
and orthodoxy's strict interpretation of religious law prohibits sabbatical
labor.) A latter-day eruv is constructed out of fishing line that is strung on
utility poles; curiously, it may incorporate functioning electric and telephone
wires. If you're within the lines, you're "in" your home.

I know that my forbears detested eruvim and similar expressions of
irrational piety. I myself am not enraged by these useless but harmless
superstitions. Constructing an eruv does not endanger our species; it's not
like opposing contraception or prohibiting stem-cell research. An eruv consoles
the believers and doesn't much bother the rest of us. Yet if there is a spirit
in the sky, which I very much doubt, I would hope that he would not be so small-
minded as to issue ukases about carrying infants on Saturdays; infants should
be carried as much as they want, which is just about everywhere and always.
And if the god of Abraham and Isaac has become so narrow as to promulgate an
inside/outside-the-home rule, I would also hope that he would be intelligent
enough not to be flummoxed by such transparent trickery as hanging mylar
filament on poles.

I have no intuitive conception of god, but I think that the orthodox trivialize
our human and shared longing for transcendence when they sanctify such petty
practices. It would be far more pious for the orthodox to take every nickel
spent to appease the Ancient of Days and bestow it on a poor Jewish family from
Tashkent. If the eruvim-makers can't locate eligible Jews, there are Hondurans
and Sudanese a-plenty who deserve their attention. When the believers re-direct
their enthusiasm and their resources toward truly charitable enterprises, they
will honor the universal immigrant experience and they will also practice the
very worthy Jewish virtue of compassion. The effort spent to construct an eruv
is a foolish waste of time.

Here's my father's view:  "It took us hundreds of years to fight our way out of
the ghetto and they want to put themselves back in jail. If the rabbis had their
way," he would say, "Mahler and Bernstein and Gershwin would play accordion in a
klezmer band in Bialystok, Einstein would balance the books for a caftan maker
in Kiev, and a hundred and fifty Jewish Nobel Prize winners would squander their
intelligence davening in a dismal Vilna synagogue."

I think it’s in a Wallace Markfield novel that an old Jewish guy confronts
a group of twenty-something Jewish hippies/slackers in Miami Beach. After
a heated discussion, he admonishes them:  "And don't ever be ashamed that
you’re Jewish. It’s enough that I’m ashamed that you’re Jewish."

Which is pretty much how I feel about the eruvistas.  Well, not exactly
ashamed.  Embarrassed, perhaps, by their superstitious infatuation with the
"dark backward and abysm of time."

Title: Reposted: Philip Roth's Pseudo-Pastoral
Date: May 25, 2011

A couple of years ago, when I had journeyed through roughly half of his
writings, I made some preliminary observations about the fictional world
invented by Philip Roth. In the course of discussion, I advanced two hypotheses.
The first was that Roth hated children, whom he regarded as encumbrances to male
freedom and pleasure. The second is that although Roth had invented a boatload
of adult male narcissists, he had not created a single mensch -- a caring,
responsible, mature man. In Roth's vision of the world, I suggested, "only a
schmuck would be a mensch."

After a pause for rest and rehabilitation, I've now resumed my upriver voyage to
the heart of the Rothworld. I've just finished reading American Pastoral (1997),
a novel set during the difficult, still-controversial Vietnam war. I must boast
that my hypotheses about children and menschdom are fully confirmed by the new
evidence provided by American Pastoral. In this novel, children are indeed
hateful, and the mensch who has at last made an appearance is nothing more than
a schmeggegy. Roth has given us Seymour "Swede" Levov, an archetypal mensch, and
behold, what a poor naive schmuck is he! Levov nurtures everyone he encounters,
but Roth works it so that his virtue leads directly to his downfall. Poor Swede
owns and manages an exemplary factory but he is betrayed by his workers; he's
loyal to Newark, so Newark riots and pillages; he loves and supports his fragile
wife only to discover that she's sleeping with his friend. Most of all, he
adores his daughter, unamusingly called Merry, who turns out to be, just as we
might expect, a devil child. She screams unaccountably from the moment of birth
and stutters through her awkward childhood (Roth seems to think that colic and
speech impediments are signs of inherent viciousness). At adolescence, Merry
transforms into an unhandsome Patty Hearst clone who participates in several
senseless but deadly political bombings. She then goes underground, only to
return secretly in Newark to haunt Levov all the more. Under this succession of
attacks, Swede Levov's carefully-crafted menschdom is little-by-little exposed
as naive schmuckhood. If only Levov had taken the Zuckerman route: love only
thyself, fuck 'em and forget 'em; abort when all else fails.

And now, for the benefit of younger readers, I pause for a few refresher
sentences about the historiography of the Vietnamese catastrophe. The
significance of this period is highly contested. For those on the left, the
war was a foolish attempt to block a peasant uprising against neo-colonialist
overlords. The Bundys and Lyndonites and Kissingers squandered fifty thousand
American and two million Vietnamese lives (plus moral authority and treasure
uncountable). Nevertheless, as the left sees it, the war provided an
opportunity for heroism: for the first time in human history, a free and
patriotic people, making use of peaceful assemblies, petitions, political
activism, boycotts, and resistance to the draft, succeeded in turning an erring
government from its mistaken path. On the other hand, the right wing knows an
entirely different Vietnam war. For conservatives, the war against communism
was lost because squishy liberals lost their nerve. Conservatives remember only
the excesses of the anti-war movement: the culture of drugs, the sexual freedom,
the violence, and of course, the bombings.

American Pastoral is firmly of the right-hand file. Roth has performed a
amazing piece of legerdemain.  He has written about the period of Vietnam,
but he has omitted (or suppressed) both the atrocities of the war and the
organized, largely peaceful opposition to it. In American Pastoral, resistance
is not political but personal. It's embodied in Swede's daughter Merry Levov,
who is vacant, violent, angry and disgusting. By stripping the novel of its
historical context and coloration, Roth reduces the opposition to the war to
an oedipal conflict between a demon child and her well-meaning but ineffectual
father.The novel lacks even the decent ambiguity that Roth might have created if
he had given Levov other and perhaps more reasonable children. But it's a good
guess that in a novel by Philip Roth, more children would have led not to a
widening of focus or to a richer novel, but only to more tsouris.

It's a shame that so skillful an artist (and one who is not generally a right-
winger) has written a novel that's only inches away from neocon propaganda.

Title: Re-reading Drood
Date: May 25, 2011

I can't remember when I last read The Mystery of Edwin Drood, but I'm certain
that it was before 1997.  It was in that year that I passed the age that
Dickens had attained when he left our planet, leaving Drood undone.

This time, I read Drood with a sense of Impending Doom. I think it's because
Dickens died far too young -- in the prime of his age.  Not, however, in
the prime of his genius  -- although one never knows what he would have
produced if he had lived to his allotted three score and ten. The novel struck
me as a tired and eneravated performance.  Too many of the characters are
recycled from the Dickens repertory company, the humor is too strenuous, the
clues and the red-herrings too obviously contrived.  It's only very near the
moment of truncation, when the splendid Mrs. Billicken makes her appearance,
that the novel feels inspired in the old Dickens way.

I also read in sadness. When we commit to reading a long, densely plotted
novel, we take it for granted that all its mysteries will eventually be
resolved.  Such is the bargain that the novelist makes with his readers. But
this novel is different, because Dickens didn't make it to the end. And so, we
read it always tentatively, knowing that its mysteries will remain mysteries
forever and ever. So this time, alas, Drood was a memento mori -- and goodness
gracious, I already have enough of those.

Title: My New Campaign for City Council
Date: May 30, 2011

It's election season once again. I'm thinking of making a run for city council
in our progressive western town. Here's my revised platform, voters.

1.  NO LEAF BLOWERS.  Rationale: it's a horrible noisy unecological machine that can easily be replaced with a broom. And everyone knows that single-stroke engines are major polluters.

2.  ALL MALL PERFORMERS MUST BE JURIED. Rationale: no more off-key singing. No more bad juggling.  No more ugly balloon animals. No more noisy drummers or whining didgeredoos.

3.  EVERY RESTAURANT MUST KEEP A PIG. Rationale: a perfect, ecologically-sound solution to the waste food problem. Come to think of it, let's require a piggery of all institutions with lunchrooms, such as high schools and hospitals. Let's fatten up those porkers, turn them into bacon and savory spare ribs.

4.  NO "HOLIDAY" LIGHTS. Rationale: waste of electricity and other scarce resources. Global warming. Bad taste. Bad theology. Bauble-olatry.

5.  NEW ANNUAL HOLIDAY: Charles Darwin's birthday, February 12. Rationale: uncontroversial celebration of a great thinker. (I reject out of hand those extremists who propose to celebrate Darwin's birthday on December 25. I'm a uniter, not a divider.)

6.  NO MUSIC WRITTEN AFTER 1897. Rationale: obvious. Why 1897?  Death of Johannes Brahms. Also, no amplified music of any kind in an automobile that is audible outside the vehicle. Higher fines and jail terms hip hop and for excessively patriotic "country."

7.  NO SMOKERS.  Rationale:  lung cancer, heart attacks, emphysema, ashes, disgusting odor, cigarette litter on the sidewalk. Note: not "no smoking"-- "no smokers." No going outside of city limits to light up and then re-entering.

8.  NO VISIBLE TATTOOS. Why only "visible "tattoos?  Because whole-body inspections might be considered intrusive by squishy civil libertarians. Also, no nose rings, navel rings, or other bodily piercings. Except earrings. I rather like earrings. But no more than one per ear.

9.  ANNUAL JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL PRAIRIE DOG SHOOT AND BARBECUE. Let them kids exercise their Second Amendment rights; eliminate them pesky varmints;  learn to cook. One platform position, three social benefits.

10. NO DOGS PERMITTED WITHIN CITY LIMITS. Rationale: fatal dog attacks, dog bites, barking dogs, squealing dogs, ubiquitous dog "waste," dogs carrying on in parks and open space, the goopy indulgence of dog "guardians," the ecological disaster of dog food. But what about seeing-eye dogs, you ask?  Well, that's a slippery slope, ain't it. Sorry folks, no dogs (except for purposes of vivisection).

11.  NO MORE COLLEGE FOOTBALL. Rationale: I don't like college football.

12.  NO "FACILITATORS" WITH WHITEBOARDS OR FLIPCHARTS AT MEETINGS. Goodness gracious, am I ever tired of those things.

That's about it. I feel that I have my finger on the pulse of the
electorate. It's going to be a landslide. Tell me that life won't be better as
soon as we enact these new laws

Title: The Next Three Days (2011)
Date: May 31, 2011

We watched The Next Three Days because we admired Paul Haggis's two previous
films -- Crash and In the Valley of Elah. This one is not quite as
innovative, but it's worth watching and is definitely the second-best English
teacher movie ever made in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (Wonder Boys, based on the
Michael Chabon novel, is more engaging and original).  The story, in brief,
is that a woman is erroneously convicted of murder, her appeals fail, she's in
for life, but her husband breaks her out of jail.

The plot is hard to swallow, and is told with so much intercutting of pursuers
and pursued, red-herring clues, and car chases that it sometime seems like a
Bourne adventure. But it's also an endearing family values film -- husband
and wife and kid all cocooned up in the last scene.  Elizabeth Banks is
beautiful and expressionless and Russell Crowe is merely expressionless, but
they're sweetly devoted to one another. I fell for it, perhaps because I just
don't see all that many togetherness thrillers.

In Hollywoodland, 90% of English teachers are rigid, authoritarian jerks
who don't appreciate the brilliance of their eccentric students (who will
grow up to become successful script-writers), and exactly 9% are charismatic
and inspiring but a bit dangerous (Jean Brodie for example). Rare indeed
is the English teacher who outwits the cops, kills a couple of the bad
guys who get in his way, and makes it safely to Venezuela. Cop # 1 (with
admiration): "This guy's a teacher?"  Cop # 2:  "Yeah, at a community
college."

In the mandatory theme-enhancing classroom scene, our hero lectures
on Don Quixote.  As in quixotic. Get it?

Title: Act of Violence (1948)
Date: June 01, 2011

Act of Violence (1948) says as much about the immediate post-war years (and
my own first decade of life) as any film I know. In it, an ex-army-officer
who survived a German POW camp has acquired a pretty wife and a sunny suburban
California home, but he is guilt-ridden because while in the camp he
betrayed his fellow prisoners. He's pursued by a revenge-obsessed former
comrade. The film is not, for once, a melodrama.  Good and evil, innocence and
experience intermingle in the main characters, and, most rewardingly, in the
smaller parts. Mary Astor (otherwise Brigid O'Shaughnessy in The Maltese
Falcon) turns in a brilliant performance as a tired, opportunistic but
ultimately decent prostitute. In fact, women in this film (in addition to
Mary Astor, Janet Leigh and Phyllis Thaxter) are for once as complex and
cliche-free as the male leads (Van Heflin and the always pitch-perfect Robert
Ryan).

The story-telling is flawless and economical, the mood is sombre and
intense. The unsettling themes are the burden of the past, the menace of the
future, trepidation at the unknown, and the expiation of guilt.

Robert L. Richards, who wrote the spare screenplay, was fingered as a leftist
and blacklisted. He lost his promising career, became a carpenter, and
died, embittered, in exile. is it necessary to note that Act of Violence
is a not the least bit subversive?  It's a genuinely patriotic film. Fred
Zinnemann, the director, escaped from the Nazis but left both his parents
behind. They were murdered in the camps. Zinnemann was therefore
superbly positioned to bring to the screen an exploration of the "guilt of the
survivor."

I don't like gore. I’m the kind of person who won’t recklessly channel-surf
for fear that the changer gizmo will maliciously lock onto our 24/7 surgery
channel, where some poor soul's innards will be on garish hi-def display, And
yet, despite my squeamishness, I steeled myself and read right through Katrina
Firlik's Another Day in the Frontal Lobe,  which is a young neurosurgeon’s
bildungs-autobiography. Of course, I allowed myself the indulgence of zooming
through some of the more gruesome parts. How much does a guy need to know about
maggot infestations in the living brain?

I’m grateful to Firlik for her vivid stories, for the occasional moment of
black humor and also for offering a forthright glimpse into an alternative
world. Nevertheless, I'm sorry to report, Another Day is not a good book. It's
too transparently a package shaped by agent and editor for short-term commercial
appeal. The author is so anxious to be cute and to be loved –- she must have
been one of those front-row, admiring-eyes-glued-to-the-professor straight-A
pupils -- that whenever she comes up against a controversial topic, such as
the irrational funding of our medical system or the egomania of surgeons
or the morality of expensive, hopeless last-minute-before-dying surgical
interventions, she hints at concern but then swerves and punts. She doesn't
want to offend a single potential buyer.

Not a courageous writer, she is not an admirable being either: what can one say
about a highly-skilled professional who turns down job after job in the American
hinterland and elects to live in New Canaan, Connecticut, because, she admits,
it would be impossible to find a good Japanese restaurant in the sticks?, and
who in one sentence notes that her rich town has more neurosurgeons than all of
sub-Sahara Africa and in another reveals that she works on spines rather than
brains nowadays because spines are more lucrative.

Hey, Katrina, the next time you publish something, sacrifice some of that
royalty money and write directly from your heart (even though it's one cold and
stony organ).

Readers of this blague will not be surprised to learn that Dr. M. was much
intrigued by the book's medical vocabulary. Another Day serves up a feast of
beautiful and exotic words: venous infarct, dura, spicule, rongeur, neuroma,
glioma, glioblastoma (you don’t want one!), bone dust, debulk, pachygyria. The
ugliest of all: intubated.  My personal favorite, and a word that I've now put
in the running for Word of the Year: bezoar.

How could I have lived all these years without knowing the wonderful word
bezoar?  Could there be a surer index of my ignorance of medicine? A bezoar,
as everyone but me seems to know, is a concretion of indigestible stuff stuck
somewhere in the digestive tract – hairballs, medicines, bits of food.
Sometimes they can be dissolved, but on occasions they can only be removed by
surgery. A bezoar was formerly thought to be a magical antidote for poisons
–- so score another couple of strikes against our ignorant superstitious
ancestors. The most common kind of bezoar is the phytobezoar, which is a
collection of lignin, cellulose, or tannin of food fibers. Common sources
are celery, grapes, raisins, prunes, and pumpkins, all of which, if you’re
like me, you’ve probably unwittingly eaten without having given a thought
to their bezoar-potential and therefore neglected a splendid opportunity for
hypochondria.

A bezoar caused by eating persimmons (an especially dangerous fruit,
bezoarwise), earns its very own word-- diospyrobezoar -- an odd amalgam of
Greek and Persian linguistic roots and a word which, just as soon as a suitable
opening arises, I intend to enthusiastically insinuate into the conversation.

(which, by the way, has now been rebranded as "late antiquity"). Or the early
medieval period.

Not to say that nothing is known about the brain. There have been advances.

To bring myself up-to-date, I read The Tell-Tale Brain by V. S. Ramachandran,
a book which has been making a stir in pop-science circles. Ramachandran's
sensible thesis is that there are structures in the human brain that are either
undeveloped or that simply don't exist in the brains of apes. To posit so
is simply common sense. Human beings do things that apes don't: they study
themselves in the mirror, they compose and play piano sonatas, and they think
about their place in the universe.

Ramachandran is an ingenious experimenter but he gets beyond his depth when he
waxes philosophical -- which he does far too often. Here's an example of the
kind of thinking that rubs me wrong.

"I get chills," says Ramachandran, "whenever I hear Macbeth's immortal
soliloquy 'Out out, brief candle!/Life's but a walking shadow, a poor
player/ That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,/ And then is heard no
more. It is a tale/ Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,/ Signifying
nothing.'"  He says that "these  words are one of the most profound and deeply
moving remarks about life that anyone has ever made!"

I don't question Ramachandran's chills, which are his own business, but I'm
bothered by his unthinking Bardolatry ("immortal solilquy"; "profound";  "that
anyone has ever made").  Poor Will doesn't need any more reverent cliches to
be shoveled upon him. He's already buried under heaps of them.

Bardolatry such as Ramachandran's obstructs thinking. What does it mean to say
that Macbeth's soliloquy is "profound... about life?"  Let's go to the tape.

When Macbeth says these words, he's under the spell of the witches, who are
"instruments of darkness."  At their suggestion, he's murdered his king,
murdered his closest friend Banquo and Banquo's son Fleance, and he's "savagely
slaughtered" Macduff's wife and children ("All my pretty ones...  All my
pretty chickens and their dam/ At one fell swoop"). Moreover, he's committed
uncatalogued atrocities innumerable: "Each new morn/ New widows howl, new
orphans cry." His brain is "filled with scorpions" and just before he utters
the soliloquy that gives Ramachandran the goosebumps, he learns that his wife,
burdened with guilt, has done herself in. Macbeth is not in a good way.

Macbeth is not a role-model and his philosophical ruminations are neither
insightful or profound. Quite the opposite. Though Macbeth is undeniably
eloquent, he's become a shallow nihilist. Life, in fact, is not "a tale told by
an idiot" and in Shakespeare's late-medieval religious universe, only someone
in the throes of the deepest despair, and certain that he is damned for all
eternity, would think so. Macbeth has learned exactly the wrong lesson. So,
apparently, has Ramachandran.

Gosh, great literature can sometimes be dangerous, can't it?

It's no secret that the universe with its billions and billions of galaxies
will go on very well without us.  Shakespeare, like everyone else, knew that
when looked at from the strictly scientific point of view, human beings are no
more than "many a thousand grains/ That issue out of dust."  But just because
we're tiny and it's enormous, we're not compelled to admire the despairing and
empty philosphy to which Macbeth subscribes.

Not while there are red wheelbarrows, winter love in dark corners, and "little
nameless, unremembered acts/ Of kindness and of love."

Title: My Teachers, 1944-1956
Date: June 15, 2011

My first twelve years of formal schooling were pretty much a bust. I blame my
underachieving, unserious self. I was much more interested in punchball,
the Dodgers, comic books, and radio serials than in the lessons, which were
unchallenging and drab. At school I learned reading, writing and 'rithmetic,
for which I'm grateful, and also a little Latin. I was an autodidact, not a
student, right out of the gate. I liked to read and fortunately the Avenue J
branch of the Brooklyn Public Library (though only a storefront) was within
walking distance; so was the McDonald Avenue branch where, during high school,
I worked for 75 cents an hour shelving books. I was an omnivorous reader and
although I did not have a strong understanding or much of an imagination, I had
an excellent memory. Reading saved me. Reading rescued me. "If it hadn't been
for reading, we'd have been entirely at the mercy of sex."

I don't blame my teachers. A few had thrown in the towel, but most of them
tried their best. They were overworked, underprepared, unsupported, and in
occasional cases prodigiously ignorant even of the subjects they taught. The
conditions under which they worked were not propitious. At P. S. 217 classrooms
were designed (!!!) for 48 students (pupils, we were called in those days) but
on high-attendance days, there were always a few unenthusiastic kids lolling
in improvised seats by the window. In most classes, lessons were taught; but
in others, especially at Erasmus Hall High School, there was only disorder and
hubbub -- and sometimes a tad of danger.

My first grade teacher, Mrs. Callery was a diminutive gloomy woman. I remember
telling my mother, "Mrs. Callery doesn't like me." My mother said, "You must be
kind to her. She lost four of her boys in the war" (it was 1944). I remember
that I construed "lost" to mean "misplaced" and was therefore dumbfounded by
Mrs. Callery's forgetfulness. White-haired Mrs. Sherwood, in third grade, left
no impression except for her extreme old age (possibly 55), but Mrs. Cares
(Sarah Cares!!, great name for a teacher) was quite kind. Mrs. Finsmith in
fifth was a cipher, but Mrs. Donnelly, whose white hair was dyed a radiant
blue, made it her business to make life as miserable as possible for me, and
succeeded. My favorite teacher in those early years was extra-strict Mrs.
McNulty, who insisted that we memorize fractions, decimals, and percentages,
and taught us how to format a "friendly letter." In seventh grade, we went
"departmental." I remember Mr. Harry Shapiro ('the bald headed hero") who spoke
of "we scientists"; Mrs. Georgia Kieselbach, an aloof music teacher who had a
trained operatic mezzo; Mr. Maxwell Proshan, a pathetic incompetent, and the
twin (as I remember them) art teachers, Mrs. Nellis and Mrs. Ennis. At Erasmus
Hall, I had good instruction in Latin from old Miss Beulah Withee and even older
Mr. Gabriel Cussen (who I now realize must have been an ex-priest) but bad
lazy non-teaching from Harry Wedeck, a pretentious fake. Miss Edna Goetschius,
a biology teacher, complained to me more than once that I didn't know how
to stipple. Mr. Lindlar, an ineffectual physics teacher, would mysteriously
disappear between classes and return reeking of alcohol. My mathematics
teachers were competent (Mr. Ebersman), angry as all shit (Mrs. Altschul), or
suicidal (Mrs. Bonime). An English teacher who was well-read and competent,
Mrs. Harriet Felder, was an "Oxfordian" caught up in the conspiracy theory
that Shakespeare wasn't Shakespeare. Walter Balletto, who whiled away our time
teaching "Discussion English," was more interested in his own theatricality than
in any instruction he might have rendered. I later learned that he lived with
his mother and collected Kirsten Flagstad records, information which my 1950s
self could not even begin to assimilate. I remember also an art teacher, Mrs.
Schauben, who kept her protruding ears in check with a thin rubber band; perhaps
we weren't supposed to notice, but I've never forgotten. The gym teachers were
simple- minded jokesters, although I remember thinking even then that the
martinet Mr. Eis would have been more at home in the SS than at EHHS.

It was, in retrospect, quite a zoo. But I know that some of my coevals, who were
smart enough to choose their teachers wisely and take it all seriously, managed
to get themselves a decent education. I didn't; my only success was to get out
alive and then move on.

Here's a good picture of Erasmus Hall High School in the old days. A Gothic
pile.

Title: Why We Love Macbeth: Two More Reasons
Date: June 18, 2011

Pound for pound, Macbeth is of all Shakespeare's plays the most unrelenting and
horrifying.

One of its greatest moments occurs when Macbeth, seeking additional guidance,
pays a second call on the witches. "How now," he demands, "you secret, black,
and midnight hags!/ What is't you do?" The witches' response to his question,
though exceedingly laconic, is far scarier than anything the most computer-
aided-pixelbending horror movie could produce. They simply say: "A deed
without a name." Every member of the audience, and every reader, knows that
the witches are up to no good, but do they know how bad it is?  No. The
audience now learns that what the witches are doing is so loathsome that
there's not even a  word for it in the English language (and Shakespeare, of
all people, had English to spare). What could they possibly mean by "a deed
without a name?" Such a deed must be superlatively evil, worse than anything
that the most depraved reader or listener could possibly guess. The immensely
suggestive phrase "A deed without a name" pushes the limits both of imagination
and language.

Another magnificent moment comes when Macbeth imagines that Banquo, whom
he knows to have been murdered, has taken a seat at his feast. Macbeth
is startled and frightened, but he is also indignant -- so indignant that his
outrage becomes almost comic. He lapses into a reverie.

Blood hath been shed ere now, i' the olden time, Ere human statute purged the
gentle weal; Ay, and since too, murders have been perform'd Too terrible for
the ear: the times has been, That, when the brains were out, the man would die,
And there an end; but now they rise again, With twenty mortal murders on their
crowns, And push us from our stools: this is more strange Than such a murder is.

Macbeth asserts that it used to be the case, both in olden times, before
Scotland became civilized, and even into recent days, that there was a natural
order to things. If you killed a man ("when the brains were out"), that person
had the decency to stay dead ("the man would die/ And there an end"). But
now, in these degenerate times, murdered men return and "push us from our
stools." Macbeth, who is under the spell of demons and who has committed
atrocity after atrocity, claims to be more "natural" than the spectre of
Banquo, who is "unnatural." In his eyes, killing people is the new normal,
and it goes against the grain when you kill a guy and he doesn't stay
killed. It's odd and lovely that Macbeth believes that he has a sincere
grievance with the world, especially when he's the one who has thrown things
completely out of whack. His exasperated complaint shapes itself into a weird,
ironic, perverse nostalgia for better days. We almost -- but not quite
-- feel for him.

Title: The Pazyryk Rug
Date: June 23, 2011

I've been reading about rugs. I'm ignorant, but fortunately, there are dozens
of eaily-available and learned books, and I'm happy to say that our local
university library is going to keep me busy until my enthusiasm flags.

Everyone interested in rugs knows that the Pazyryk carpet (which I didn't
know about until a month ago) is the oldest known rug and about three thousand
years older than the next contender. It was discovered in 1949 near the
Mongolia-China border, in a Scythian tomb that had been flooded and frozen since
about 2500 BCE. It's magnificent and it's mind-expanding. It's been a long time
since something has created in me such a reverent sense of gaga-hood and wowage.

Although older than old, it's anything but primitive. Centuries, perhaps
millenia, of experimentation, learning, intelligence, craft, and effort
preceded its making. First our ancestors had to domesticate sheep, which,
I've learned, had to be selectively bred to become wooly rather than merely
hairy. Then came the invention of spinning and weaving. And dyeing, which is
a sophisticated and complicated art all of itself. Moreover, it's obvious that
the Pazyryk rug did not spring whole out of someone's brain --it's the climax
of a long artistic tradition. While some scholars detect Persian influences,
others think it wholly a creation of the steppes. The red dye, it's recently
been discovered, is Polish cochineal. How did the dye get to Mongolia?  I've
not read anything about the blue, but it looks like indigo, and if it is, the
process of getting wool to take indigo is extremely complicated.

The detail, though faded (fifty-five hundred years of refrigeration take
its toll) is worthy of the closest study: mounted horsemen, saddle blankets
and trappings, even the decorated manes of the horses, are rendered, knot by
knot, with great power.

And then there are the happy moose (or possibly elk, or some ungulate that I
don't know).

The rug now resides at the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg.  I intend to
visit it some day, but if the museum should want to put it out on permanent
loan to my living room, I would promise to treat it with the utmost respect and
appreciation.

Title: Lessons from Neolithic Malta
Date: June 24, 2011

Neolithic Malta presents an exemplum and a warning. The island received
its first human inhabitants, who probably arrived from Sicily, some time
around 5000 BC. After about 3600 BC, trade and other links with  the outside
world waned. Over the next thousand years or so, the people of Mlata built
seventeen monumental stone temples unlike any elsewhere in the Mediterranean.

These are the remains of one of the seventeen.

Here's a view of another: There's something truly remarkable about these
megalithic temples, but it's troubling that a marginal and isolated culture
would make such a huge and economically unproductive investment. Indeed,
starting about 2300 BC, this native Maltese culture went into
precipitous decline. A major cause seems to have been the extreme
deforestation and soil loss when the population increased and resources were
overused. The best guess is that the Maltese experienced an economic and
spiritual crisis.

They did not, alas, confront the environmental problem; instead, the evidence
suggests that the people, probably led by an oppressive priestly caste,
continued to make greater and greater investments in religious worship, no
doubt hoping that their gods would rescue them from their predicament. "In
the end their expectations were not met and crisis ensued from which it took
centuries to recover" (Barry Cunliffe, Europe Between the Oceans, [Yale, 2008],
p. 172.) The population disappeared, the culture was extinguished and Malta
was deserted until the arrival of Bronze Age peoples around 2000 BC.

Let's go over this ground and make sure that we understand. The
neolithic inhabitants of Malta temporarily increased their population at
the expense of massive enviromental degradation, and then, as the standard of
living dropped, decided that the best way to deal with the crisis was to make
mammoth investments in priests and temples (rather than, say, birth control
and sustainable forestry and agriculture).

Is there a moral here.  We report, you decide. But I believe that I can hear
the debate. "We've already built fifteen temples and it hasn't worked. Perhaps
we should try something new, like planting trees."  "Nonesense, young
radical. We must look to faith. Faith will reward us. One more temple, this
one really huge. More stones over here!"

Title: Some Carter Family Favorites
Date: June 27, 2011

"Wildwood Flower," of course. The tune would have made Bach proud, the
story is classic, and the diction and metaphor absolutely perfect: "You've
gone and neglected your pale wildwood flower." "Single Girl, Married Girl,"
which I can never hear without tearing up (or coming very close -- depends
on my mood). No one has ever written a lyric that is more succinct or
more straightforward: "Single girl, single girl, she goes to the store and
buys,/ Married girl, married girl, she rocks the cradle and cries."  "Keep on
the Sunny Side," which is perfectly cheerful until it goes all faux-religious in
the last verse. If, on the other hand, you're looking for heartfelt religion,
there's "No Hiding Place Down Here," which was later and better realized by
Dorothy Love Coates and the Gospel Harmonettes. And also the very wistful and
lovely "Oh, I'm thinking tonight of my blue eyes/ Who is sailing far over the
sea/ I'm thinking tonight of my blue eyes/ And I wonder if he ever thinks of
me." But my favorite, nowadays, is, "Will You Miss Me When I'm Gone." The
lyrics are Victorian/goopy, written (by A. P.) in a highly artificial off-the-
wall literary and poetical style -- but yet, when accompanied by guitar
and autoharp, and song by Mother Maybelle, against all odds it comes out
quintessentially beautiful. "Will You Miss Me" taps into the common fantasy
of observing our own funeral. Her'e's the lyric:  Stanza 1: "When death shall
close these eyelids,/ And this heart shall cease to beat,/And they lay me down
to rest/ In some ?flowery ?boundary ?tree (the words are unintelligible).
(2) Perhaps you'll plant a flower/ By my poor unworthy grave;/ Come and sit
along beside me/ Where the roses nod and wave. (3) One sweet thought my soul
shall cherish/When this fleeting life has flown/ This sweet thought will cheer
when dying/ Will you miss me when I'm gone?  (4) When these lips shall never
more/Press a kiss upon my brow,/ But lie cold and still in death/ Will you miss
me then as now?" Chorus (after every stanza): "Will you miss me,/ Will you miss
me when I'm gone?" In its lugubriousitude, "Will You Miss me" is very like the
great Londonderry air, "Danny Boy."

There's something luxurious about a good gloomy wallow.

Title: Words New to Me
Date: June 29, 2011

Regular readers of this blague know that Dr. M. is easily taken with odd and
unusual words. Well, the poor doctor has been enchanted again.

Here follows a wordhoard excavated from Barry Cunliffe's big book on
European archaeology. Perhaps some doctormetablogians know one or two of these
words, but I doubt anyone knows all of them, and I confess that each one is
absolutely new to me.

I'm embarrassed but it's the awful truth.

Dillisk,which sounds like a disk or circular form of dill, is in actual fact
a kind of sea lettuce or creatnach, an edible algae, much consumed during
the Neolithic. Carragheen, nowadays defined as "a family of linear sulfated
polysaccharides" was at one time the name of a food derived from red algae
-- apparently an ancient snackfood. Melitot is an alternative name for sweet
clover. Vetchlings are sweet peas. An ard is a early plough -- no more than a
spike that is dragged through the soil, most commonly by oxen. A lynchet -as
I'm sure everyone knows, is not a minor vigilante hanging but rather a "ridge
or terrace seen on the slopes of the Chalk,Oölitic, and Liassic escarpments in
various parts of England, especially in Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire, Wiltshire,
and Somerset." It's now public knowledge: Dr. M knows zilch about Oolitic
escarpments. A leister is a breed of sheep. A lur is not a way to catch fish,
but is an ancient bronze horn, precursor of the trumpet (though stopless). 
Here are a pair of lurs.

They look like high-end showerheads. I can't imagine what they sound like. A
cist is not a cyst. It is a small stone coffin or ossuary. An orthostat
is an upright stone used as a member of a larger structure (as opposed to
a menhir, which usually stands alone). Cob or cobb (or sometimes clom)
is a building material comprised of clay,sand, straw, water, and soil,
something like clench. A nuraghe is a megalithic structure found in ancient
Sardinia. Eight thousand nuraghi (mirabile dictu!) are still in existence.
Here's one:

A corbel is a stone that juts out of a wall to support a weight. If
it's not stone, but wood, it's called a "tassel" or a "bragger." A
currach is of course a kind of Irish boat, once constructed out of animal
hides, but now out of canvas. It is much smaller than a penteconter, an
ancient Greek galley which is the ancestor of the warlike trireme and the
fabled quinquireme. Strakes are the planks that compose the hull of a wooden
ship. Callais is a green stone used for bead-making in the early part of the
Bronze Age. Skeumorphism, my very favorite of all these exciting new words,
is "an element of design or structure that serves little or no purpose in the
artifact fashioned from the new material but was essential to the object made
from the original material." Archeologists apparently use the term in a more
restricted sense, as for example in the case of a bronze vessel which retains
and imitates features of an antecedent clay pot. Or, to take a wikipedian
example, "decorative stone features of Greek temples such as mutules, guttae,
and modillions that are derived from earlier wooden temples." What are mutules,
guttae, and modillions? I don't know, but they sure do set the logo-curious
mind all a-twitter.

Title: Songs My Mother Sang
Date: July 08, 2011

My mother had a pretty fair soprano and as a young adult performed in amateur
musicals. She sang in that high, quavering style that I associate with artists
of the 1920s and 1930s, such as Ruth Etting ("America's Radio Sweetheart").
I remember that sometimes, when she wasn't busy putting the laundry through
the wringer or scrubbing the sink or dusting under the beds, she'd sit at
the old Hardman piano and sing the songs of her youth. She sang tin pan alley
songs, Gilbert and Sullivan ballads, so-called "Negro spirituals," and
also what I now know to be Victorian parlor songs. Her taste was formed in
the earlier part of the century (she was born in 1905) and had as far as I can
tell ceased to change after about 1935 with the arrival of my older brother and
diapers. My mother sang, for example, 1919's "Look for the Silver Lining": "A
heart, full of joy and gladness,/ Will always banish sadness and strife./So
always look for the silver lining,/ And try to find the sunny side of life."
She sang "I've been Working on the Railroad" (first published in 1894) with the
refrain "Someone's in the kitchen with Dinah/ Someone's in the kitchen I know/
Someone's in the kitchen with Dinah/Strummin' on the old banjo."  Neither
she nor I knew that "Dinah" was a generic name for a female slave, nor did we
speculate about what the heck was going on in that kitchen. She sang "Oh, the
old gray mare, she ain't what she used to be,/Many long years ago."  She sang
a version of what I can now identify as Ed Haley's 1894 hit, "The Fountain in
the Park", with the familiar lyric "While strolling in the park one day,/ In
the merry, merry month of May,/ I was taken by surprise/ by a pair of roguish
eyes..."  Sorry, but I can't remember the rest. She sang, "Shine on harvest
moon/ Up in the sky."  And also "Aint She Sweet." And "Home Sweet Home" ("Mid
pleasures and palaces though we may roam,/ Be it ever so humble, there's no
place like home").

But the song that stands most vividly in my memory was "Bill" from
Showboat. It's a lovely song, but I took it wrong. When my mother sang "I used
to think that I would discover/ The perfect lover some day," I  decided that
she was finding fault with my father, to whom I was most loyal. In my mind, my
father was noble and manly and intelligent, and I resented her singing about
"Bill, who's not the type at all/ You'd meet him on the street and never notice
him." The refrain was particularly painful to my seven-year-old self: "And I
can't explain,/ It's surely not his brain that makes me thrill./ I love him
because he's I don't know,/Because he's just my Bill."

I've since learned about fiction, and make-believe.  I can forgive her.

Title: Amnesia on Film:  Mister Buddwing
Date: July 10, 2011

This 1966 black-and-white oddity boasts a distinguished director (Delbert Mann,
celebrated for Marty) and a group of excellent actresses (Jean Simmons,
Katherine Ross, Angela Lansbury and Suzanne Pleshette). It's ambitious and
sometimes imaginative. But frankly, even more than your run-of-the-mill amnesia
movie, it's a mess.

The amnesiac in this case is a young and puzzled James Garner, who comes to
consciousness in Central Park (there are good historical shots of 1960s NYC
throughout) and takes the nom d'oubli Sam Buddwing. We're not told how he
found his way to a park bench but movie amnesia is so commonplace and so
flexible that the audience has no difficulty going along for the ride. The rest
of the film tracks Buddwing through various encounters until he recovers his
memory with no more fuss than he lost it.

Amnesia is merely a plot device and not the film's true focus. The theme
seems to be "identity," which, if I remember, was a subject much in vogue in
the 1960s. Buddwing says, more than once, "I don't know who I am." But
so did all of us say the same thing, in those ancient days, even without
the provocation of amnesia. Buddwing's specific problem, as it gradually
reveals itself, is that he has made a series of "inauthentic" (as we used to
say) choices. He should have composed the octet rather than have gone for
the commercial money. He shouldn't have encouraged his wife to abort the
baby. And he certainly should have prevented both himself and Grace (note
signficant moniker!!) from drifting into infidelity and alcohol.

More "don'ts." The writer and director shouldn't have tried to imitate
Ingmar Bergman (the excrescent scene with the beggar who thinks he's God is
embarrassingly derivative). And they shouldn't have indulged all the Bergman-
derived religiosity. When a prayer "O God, let her live" is followed
immediately by a resurrection, it's not a film -- it's propaganda. Come to
think of it, the creative team should also have put some distance between
themselves and the Kafkaeque surreal. Moreover, they should not have allowed
the film to slide into an easy, superficial allegorizing. Buddwing may say
"I'm not everyman" -- but the film desperately hopes that he will be taken as
such.

Amnesia, it would appear, has the power to soften the brain of both writer and
director.

Title: More New Words
Date: July 11, 2011

I've been reading about rugs and therefore learning all sorts of new words. For
example, a yastik is a small rug or bag for designed to be sat upon and
therefore serves a different purpose than a mafrash, which is bag for
transporting small objects.  Here's a mafrash:

I have discovered that many of the terms used to describe the patterns of
"oriental" carpets are derived from architecture. Moreover, it turns out that
many of these words are entirely unfamiliar to me. For example, an ogive is
"the roundly tapered end of a object" such as an arch. It's a peculiar word
whose etymology is anybody's guess. The adjectival form is "ogival." "Ogival"
forms are common on Turkish rugs.

A merlon on a medieval castle is "the solid part of a parapet." I think a
picture is called for here. Merlons:

Such forms, like giant teeth, frequently appear in the borders of rugs. A
crenelle is a notch or open space between two merlons. So in the picture above
it's merlon, crenelle, merlon, crenelle, etc. Merlon Crenelle sounds like
the name of linebacker at Tulane or Louisiana State.  An even odder word is
squinch, which doesn't seem as though it could possibly describe a part of a
rug, but does. It sounds like a palatalized variant of squint (or Shakespeare's
squiny), or some sort of exotic citrus (would you mind passing me a couple of
those squinches?), but it is in fact "a piece of construction used for filling
in the upper angles of a square room so as to form a proper base to receive an
octagonal or spherical dome." It's a filler of sorts, and as such is occasional
knotted into a complex carpet, though I rather doubt that the women who wove the
rugs thought squinchwise.

A spandrel is a space above an arch -- as illustrated here:

There are four blue spandrels in this fancy silk Heriz carpet:

Kufesque is another word used to describe rug patterns, but it derives not
from architecture but from writing. Arabic was anciently written in Kufic,
an angular, upright script. Illiterate weavers copied and recopied Kufic
inscriptions until they became meaningless but still remained beautiful. Many
rugs have kufesque borders.

Strange to say, I had recent occasion to employ the word "kufic" in
conversation. It was my annual visit to the opthamologist. "Read the next
line," I was told. "Looks like Kufic to me." I believe the eye guy understood
that I couldn't read the line, but I rather doubt that he fully appreciated my
inspired and accurate answer.

Title: Lady Stallions!!!
Date: July 17, 2011

Lady Stallions!?! Not only a New Jersey soccer team, but an oxymoron of
Shakespearean achievement. Not a simple oxymoron either, like Romeo's "cold
fire, sick health," but a figure of speech on the far frontier of Oxymoronia,
along with such classics as Utah Jazz and Christian Science. What, pray tell,
is a Lady Stallion?  Even in an age of gender fluidity, it's hard to get a
grasp on this one. Oh, I understand the principle -- the men's team is the
Stallions, and therefore it follows as night the day that the distaff team
acquires the same name, prefixed with Lady. In the same way, we have, out here,
the Buffs and the Lady Buffs. I would offer not the slightest demurral if the
men's team was called the New Jersey Horses and women's team was the New Jersey
Lady Horses. It's awkward but logical. Lady Horses may not be either a poetical
or an intimidating moniker, but it doesn't boggle the grammatical mind. But
a stallion is archetypically male, the snorting captain of his harem-herd of
equine odalisques, groupies, wives, mistresses, and girlfriends. Against all
challenges, he bites and kicks and if necessary injects himself with steroids
and horse growth hormone in order to maintain his macho primacy. A lady stallion
is therefore utterly impossible both emotionally and linguistically. The term
is a travesty. Better to call them the New Jersey Mares, which makes linguistic
sense. Or even better, the New Jersey Geldings (which are, in an odd  kind of a
way, no-longer-male stallions).

Although I myself would reserve the name Geldings for institutions named after
gentleman who have made the sacrifice and earned the right: the Origen Divinity
School Geldings or the St. Abelard Preparatory School Geldings. But that's a
horse of another color.

Although particularly egregious, Lady Stallions do not stand solitary in their
linguistic purgatory. Also competing are the Lady Rams (suggested alternative:
Sheep), the Lady Bucks, and the Lady Bulls (alternative: Cows). No teams named
the Goats. No Lady Boars (or Pigs either, for that matter). In defiance of
all logic, there are the Oregon Lady Ducks, which is truly an impossibility,
because properly, the men's team should be the Drakes, the women's the Ducks
(or Lady Drakes). There are no teams, as far as I'm aware, named either the
Geese or the Lady Ganders; yes, there are the South Carolina Gamecocks, but I'm
going to guess that the distaff side is not named the Lady Gamecocks. Wait,
I'll google it. OK, the South Carolina women's softball team is named ... the
Gamecocks, which is bad enough, but could have been worse, because in my world
of propriety, "lady" and "cocks" should never inhabit the same sentence.

Dogs are a problem. No one calls their team the Dogs. But there are some breeds
who are allowed to play. Bulldogs and Mastiffs and Greyhounds are in, Poodles
are out. The University of Georgia proffers the Lady Bulldogs, but not one
college, high school, or club has thought to give us either the Lady Dogs, or
whatever is that word by which female dogs are denominated.

A:  "What's that stand of trees that are down there by the brook?"

Dr. M:  "Cottonwoods.  I planted one of them must be thirty-five years ago.
The big one. They reproduce like aspens, underground runners. Turned into a nice
stand."

A:  "When I was working the sawmill, sometimes the locals would bring in a tree
they called "barmagillion" or "bahmagillion." I could never figure out what it
was. I looked in all the tree books. Never found it. We treated it just like
poplar."

Dr. M:  "Was it a poplar?. Cottonwoods are poplars."

A:  "It took me twenty years to figure out what 'barmagillion' was. Actually,
I didn't figure it out. Neill was here with one of those telephones that does
everything. He looked it up. It's actually "balm of Gilead."

(I looked it up also. "Balm of Gilead" is another name for what most people
around here call "balsam poplar."  It's not uncommon but not plentiful either,
at least in these parts. I didn't know that the buds are covered with sticky
resin used by bees to plug holes in their nests and by humans as a kind of
perfume).

"Barmagillion" is distantly related to "folk etymology," as for example when
arthritis is called "Arthur Wright."

Title: Another GPS Tale
Date: July 25, 2011

Hackett Hill Road is two twisty, depopulated, uphill-and-down miles long. It
is unpaved and seriously washboarded. If you didn't know for sure that it was
a public thoroughfare, you might think that you had accidentally turned into
someone's long driveway.

Most of our guests arrive from the South Road side of things, which is an easier
passage. We're just .2 from South Roadm a much easier ride than the long route,
off of Route 25. The GPS, which most people use nowadays, takes people the long
way.

Directly adjacent to the graveyard, which is the only obvious remnant of the
old community of West Bradford, lies our narrow driveway. It's inconspicuous
and steep, but we've posted a wooden sign with our street number. The number is
an innovation;  we didn't have one until 9/11 -- nor did we need one, because
there's no mail delivery on Hackett Hill. (We go to town to pick up mail; Muriel
at the post office takes good care of our occasional packages and flyers and
medical bills.)

Some friends, new to rural Vermont, traveling from Denver with their two teenage
daughters, came to visit us the other day. They were a bit intimidated and
possibly a little anxious as a consequence of their slow passage along Hackett
Hill Road. Although they were carefully following Sheila, which is what they've
named their GPS (ours is Dorcas) they missed our sign and overshot their mark.
Sheila, the idiot-savant, nevertheless announced, "You have arrived at your
destination, on left." On the left, of course, was only the cemetery with its
lichen-encrusted marble gravestones. They were surprised and amused --their
vehicle, I'm told, filled with hilarity -- but were poised enough to continue to
the end of the road, make a U, and initiate a most pleasant visit.

Dr. M.:  "The John Deere guy was over here the other day and he told us a story
about a fellow who had a 450 just like ours. He had the forks on the tractor,
the kind you use for picking up the round bales. He was working in his woods,
trying to bring down a big hemlock. He notched and cut it, but left a hinge and
the tree got hung up and wouldn't go over, so he tried to push the tree over
with his forks. Somehow or other, he got the forks on either side of the tree.
The hemlock came over, picked up his tractor, spun it 180 in the air, knocked
off the canopy, drove the upright right into his chest, killed him on the spot."

Big Al:  "I knew the guy. It was Howard Beck up in North Monroe. He was a low
wattage kind of guy. It's amazing he lived as long as he did."

Lola and I brought some windfall apples to the horses. The horses are Morgans,

one side of the gate, the horses trotted up to the other side as soon as we
announced our presence. They like to lean over the fence and look in our pockets
for apples.

Lola said, and I quote, "Back Mommy." I contrued this opaque construction to
mean "I believe that I would now like to rejoin my mother back at the house as
quickly as possible."

Lola is succinct, but she sure knows how to make herself understood.

Title: Things I'll Miss
Date: August 10, 2011

I'm reconciled to the idea that death comes to all, but nevertheless, there are
a few earthly things that I'm genuinely going to miss.

Is there anything more wonderful, when you've been out early in the morning
in the rain or in a heavy dew, and your feet are wet and cold, than returning
home and putting on clean, dry socks, especially those excellent white cotton
ones that they sell at Costco?  Definitely a moment that makes life worth
living. And also: purchasing, opening and playing a new music cd -- preferably
one that you've thought about acquiring for a long time. Another: watching
young healthy athletic people run down the street, especially women with
long ponytails a-bobbing. Also: the perennially pleasurably sound of a bat
(wooden, not aluminum) connecting with a high, hard one. Rum raisin ice cream.
A well- made glazed donut. The sight of the first soft, red peony of the year
just as it breaks the ground. The waxy pink flower of the tamarack, always a
surprise. My Swiss Felco #2 hand pruner (which our cousins across the sea
call it a secateur), a friend for many seasons, which fits my hand perfectly
and which if you give it an occasional oiling and sharpening, cuts absolutely
true. The sound of rain on an uninsulated metal roof -- and also like the
clickety-clack and pinging of the roof on a cloudy day when the sun comes in and
out and the roof alternately expands and contracts -- it's an all-percussion
symphony. The old downtown of an old city that I'm visiting for the first time.
A one-year-old boy or girl learning to walk, at the stage when the strides
are of unequal and inconsistent length, the child hovered over by admiring
young parents, she with a hand outstretched, he recording the moment on tape;
the child the center of the universe, thoroughly doted upon, as is exactly
appropriate. A deep, luxurious weekend afternoon nap, so profound that when you
wake up you don't know, for five seconds, where you are or what day it is. A
sleep so deep that somnus imago mortis kicks in;  nothing more satisfying: the
kind of thing that makes a guy want to live a few more years.

Title: In Which God Speaks Directly to Me
Date: August 13, 2011

The number of Republicans who are waiting for a signal from God about whether
or not to run for president  of the USA continues to grow. They're waiting and
waiting and waiting.

And meanwhile, surprising is it may seem, God the Father revealed himself to me
-- me! --just last night. He woke me out of a sound sleep (which is a kind
of miracle in itself because I had taken a double dose of Ambien). I have no
idea why I was chosen as the Vessel of His Wisdom, but, you know, God moves in
mysterious ways. I swear as I hope to go to Heaven that it was the one true God
Who spoke to me.

God said, and this is a direct, verbatim quote, "I do not want Rick Perry to
run for President." I asked Him why, in His Infinite Majesty, he was so
opposed to a Perry candidacy. He said (and here His Voice became so strong,
so 'out-of-a- whirlwind', that it actually rattled our windows --but they're
old windows and the points and putty could stand replacing), "because he's
a doofus, and also because of he could only earn a "D" in the Shakespeare
course at Texas A & M. Imagine that. A "D" in Shakespeare?" God was clearly
outraged. "You are aware," he intoned, "that according to Victor Hugo, 'after
God, Shakespeare has created the most?'"

It was interesting to me that God didn't look the way He does in the inspired
Michelangelo ceiling, which is what I would have expected. He looked more
like Shazam in the old Captain Marvel comic books. Old and bald, and kind of
indistinct. But it was definitely God. I could feel it in my gut. Trust me.

I asked Him if He had any other preferences in the upcoming
election. He sighed. "I don't want either Bachmann or
Palin either. They're doofae."  I wasn't surprised that God was so
adamantine about B and P, because of their shallow religiosity and deficient
knowledge of history, but I was truly shocked that God called them by the
faux-Latin feminine plural "doofae." I mean, doofus isn't even a real Latin
word, despite its -us ending, and so there's no singular feminine "doofa."  I
would have thought that God would have a better command of His Latinity. I was
so taken aback that I forgot to ask Him how he felt about Newt, whom I myself
would definitely prefer to be the Republican candidate. He's so adorable.

But the grammar of the Godhead is beside the point. The absolute true fact
is that He has spoken quite plainly. We mortals need to know no more but
simply to walk humbly in His ways, which means that Perry and the two ladies
should take heed of this authentic Divine Intervention and decline to pursue
elected office. For them to continue to press forward, at this juncture and
with this revelation, would be nothing short of blasphemy.

Title: Downtown Bradford
Date: August 24, 2011

When we arrived in Bradford, Vermont in 1967 (during the troubled waning years
of the LBJ presidency), I remarked to Mrs. Dr. M., "this "downtown" looks like
it hasn't changed a bit since the 1920s." The downtown was one block long then;
it's no more extensive now, forty-four years later. And not much different.

We sat in the window of the Local Buzz, one of our newer enterprises (real
coffee comes to Bradford, at last!) and watched the folks go by. Couples, the
guy way too skinny and the lady way too fat. Young blonde guys, tattooed, trying
desperately to grow their scruffy beards. An occasional suit -- a lawyer or
insurance agent. Tourists in campers, looking mighty skeptical. An occasional
gaggle of bicyclists, coming from somewhere, going elsewhere, all a-helmeted and
bespandexed. But very few guys in "farmer greens."

Nor have there been any new buildings to compromise the 1920s time-capsule.
Stores have changed owners and purposes, of course. Gove (pronounced as in rove,
not as in glove) and Bancroft was an independent pharmacy (the kind of place
that had big old colored bottles in the window) that disappeared must be a
quarter of a century ago and has been superseded by the new Kinney's out at the
four corners (where also resides Orange County's only four-way traffic light).
Similarly, Gove and Morrill, an independent hardware store, has been replaced
with a shiny new Aubuchon (a northeastern chain). The old Gove and Morrill,
three decades dead, was a great place of a young fellow to purchase his hardware
needs. Lester Wakefield and Bart Morrill knew everything and gladly would they
teach. They also had a bit of a machine shop in the basement and would drill
out that rusted part for you, no charge. Their shop was a shrine of Yankee
frugality. The Aubuchon employs what looks like minimum wage help -- the kids
know how to run the Visa through the slot, but they know little else, so you're
pretty much on your own. I'm sure that Kinney's and Aubuchon make a better
profit than the stores that they replaced.

And speaking of chains, we now have a Subway, which, I must be the most
impoverished looking Subway in existence. Other eateries: Chan's House (the
poorest, least authentic Chinese restaurant in the entire occident).  And
another house, the House of Pizza, which replaced, many years ago, The Chimes
(a semi-glorified diner). In between the Chimes and the pizza place, there was
for a few controversial years at that corner location a breakfast shop that was
run by very very young, robotic Stepford girls, reputed to be members of the
harem of some charismatic off-brand far right Christian cultist. The food was
marvelously inexpensive but the place was o so creepy.

There's a second-hand bookshop, Booked Solid, that is loaded with romances
and "genre" paperbacks; trade books that find their way to the shelves are
accidental tourists.

Two banks where there used to be just one.

The Paradise Cafe, Bradford's first venture into culinary artistry, lasted a
year or two but then devolved into the Richardson Insurance Agency, though it is
my impression that Kermit Richardson himself has long since collected on his
policy. Taylor-Palmer insurance is  still in the same white clapboard house
that it inhabited half a century ago, and Hod Palmer, after a brief foray into
gourmet cooking, has been restored to the world of his fathers. The Colatina,
an out-of-the-can red-sauce Italian restaurant, is still in business, still
enticing those Dartmouth boys to drive half an hour for some north of Hanover
pizza. Perry Oil, which dominates its side of the street, is still going strong,
still filling those propane tanks, and still run by genuine Perrys. Hill's, a
kind of old-fashioned notion shop, like a Woolworth's  -- how come it hasn't
been obliterated by a Target or a K-Mart? The Bradford Public Library, now
reroofed, is a handsome Victorian Gothic building, but lacks books.

"All is flux," Heraclitus used to say. But then he'd never been to downtown
Bradford.

Title: Advice for Married Folk
Date: August 27, 2011

Reposted from January, 2007, and just as pertinent now as it was then:

High on the list of The New York Times' "most e-mailed articles" is one that's
catchily titled "What Shamu Taught Me About a Happy Marriage," by a writer named
Amy Sutherland. Apparently it's a well-regarded, influential essay. I think
it's misleading and wrong-headed, and I think that couples who heed its advice
will soon find themselves not in a happy marriage but in one that's sterile and
empty.

Amy's column is at this address, and will be available unless and until the
strapped and greedy Times decides to put it behind a paid wall. A summary: poor
Amy is perpetually annoyed by Scott, her husband of twelve years. He loses his
keys and asks her help finding them; he keeps her waiting at restaurants; he
"hovers around her in the kitchen asking if she has read this or that piece in
the New Yorker." She's tried nagging, but it doesn't work. As it happens, Amy
is writing a book on animal training and she's watched people "do the seemingly
impossible," such as 'teaching baboons to skateboard" and "hyenas to pirouette
on command." She decides to adopt the animal model and "train" her husband. "If
he threw one dirty shirt into the hamper, I'd thank him. If he threw in two, I'd
kiss him." She rewards "approximations." She uses "least reinforcing syndrome"
in which the trainer doesn't respond in any way when an animal does something
wrong -- just stands and stares. When Scott loses his keys, she ignores his
pleas for help, and eventually he finds them by himself. By the end of the
article, Scott has changed. "After two years of exotic animal training, my
marriage is far smoother, my husband much easier to love."

What's so awful about this advice? Let's take the shirts-on-the-floor crisis.
Amy can imagine only two methods to deal with this problem. There's nagging,
which she now rejects, and there's re-training. But there are other responses.
The first is for Amy to gain a bit of perspective. Marriage isn't about whether
the dirty shirts are in the hamper or on the floor. People have had long and
happy marriages without resolving such issues. Amy seems to assume that getting
her way about the shirts is crucial. But when she and Scott married, they agreed
to love, honor, and respect each other; they didn't agree that every single
shirt would immediately find its way into a hamper. Perhaps Amy should re-think
her priorities and try to keep the larger picture in view. Secondly, Amy can't
seem to imagine any ground between nagging and animal training. But there is --
there's an enormous territory. There's discussion, negotiation, and compromise.
Amy: "It bothers me that you expect me to pick up your shirts." Scott: "I'll try
not to drop them. I'll pick them up myself." Amy: "And I'll try not to make such
a big deal out of it."

When Scott comes into the kitchen and wants to read to her from a New Yorker
article, Amy could say, if she had any imagination, "Oh, good. Scott wants to
involve me in his intellectual life. He wants to talk to me." But she doesn't
see it that way; she wants him out of the room so she can "concentrate on the
simmering pans." But what's important about marriage, or about life? Is it the
pans, or is it the conversation? Once again, Amy has it all wrong. She cares
about her cooking, and getting the soup exactly right, more than she cares
about the marriage. It shouldn't be beyond her ability to stir and to listen
at the same time; it's been known to happen. Amy is, let's face it, a bit of a
narcissist. She wants to make Scott into an extension of herself; she wants to
subordinate the marriage to her own convenience.

Readers and friends, here's my opinion. If your spouse comes to you and says,
"I've lost my keys, I'm distressed," you should stop whatever you're doing and
you should start searching. When you do so, you're treating your spouse with
respect and you're taking your marriage seriously. And if you happen to misplace
your own keys, it's perfectly fair to ask your spouse to help find them. Because
sometimes finding keys is a team activity. I'll go even further: sometimes it's
less important to find the lost keys than it is to search for them together.

But you should engage yourself with the problem of the keys, or the shirts, only
if you want a relationship of equals. If you think that it's so important to
train your spouse to stay out of your damn kitchen, then go ahead and follow
Amy's advice. But you might wind up with not with a husband or wife, but with a
pirouetting hyena or a skateboarding baboon.

Amy and Scott: here's some valuable advice. It comes to you courtesy of Mr.
Hart, who lived a couple of houses down from us. He died at age 90, in the same
month as his equally aged wife. The Harts had been married for 60 or so years.
"What's the secret of a long, happy marriage," he was asked. He said, "find out
what your wife wants and make sure that it happens." Which is, if you think
about it for a moment, only a variation of the traditional golden rule and of
its even more practical cousin: "do unto others as they want to be done unto."

Here's a sad childhood memory.

Just around the corner from us, on Ditmas Avenue, there lived the ugliest man
I've ever seen in my entire life. He was a small, always solitary old man. He
was not deformed, just plain ugly. His nose and mouth stuck way out, but his
chin receded; he had very long canine teeth and the world's saddest eyes. He
walked the ugliest little dog.

I confess that when we passed in the street, I looked away, even though I was
fascinated enough by his repulsiveness to steal a surreptitious backward glance.
I imagine that everyone else whom he passed averted their eyes as well, and that
the poor fellow lived in a world not only without friends, but even without eye
contact.

Later I learned that he made his living my exhibiting himself nightly at a Coney
Island freak show. He was the "Dog-Faced Man."

This was in the late 1940s or early 1950s. I hope that freak shows are a thing
of the past.

Title: Trollope on the Kindle
Date: September 16, 2011

My first purchase for the new Kindle was a "set" of fifty novels by Anthony
Trollope for $4.95 -- or ten cents for each spacious, digressive, leisurely
book, many of which I have read in the past as three-volume baggy monsters.
Initiating a 21st-century electronic device with classic Victorian novels
tickles me.

The Kindle fits nicely with my latter-day anti-clutter neurosis. No need to buy
a new bookcase. No need, even, to dust the volumes.

It's a new way of reading, but whether for better or worse I can't yet say. The
Kindle is portable and easy on the wrist. There's a built-in light for cloudy
days and the middles of nights. But I'm used to knowing where I am in a novel.
How many pages I've read, how many to go are elements crucial to the experience.
I miss, frankly, the heft of the book, the gratification of accumulating all
those turned pages. (The Kindle notes the percentage of the book that you've
read, which is helpful but not satisfying. And when you buy fifty novels in a
bundle, the K tells you only that you started The Eustace Diamonds at, say, 26%
and finished at 29% -- information which is utterly useless.)

Can You Believe Her? clearly signaled that it was coming to an end, but Phineas
Finn, this time through, came to a conclusion that seemed to be far more
hasty than in previous readings. I was surprised that Trollope left so much
unresolved. But then, perhaps he had a sequel already in mind.

I need to remind myself that the first readers of these novels didn't read
them in book form. They read them as periodic installments in magazines. The
experience of reading a novel in the course of a year or eighteen months was
profoundly different from zooming through 800 pages in a few days. While
there's  nothing "authentic" about "kindling," the kind of Trollope-reading at
which I've had a lifetime of practice is  equally artificial.

Title: "Mr. Kripke"
Date: September 27, 2011

When I was in graduate school (fifty years ago, believe it or not), I enrolled
for a course called "Modern American Poetry." In the unthrilling days of
yesteryear, "modern" still meant the generation of Eliot and Pound. This
particular course, however, was so up-to-the moment that it might have been
called "last month's American poetry." Some of the poets whom we studied
turned out to be mere flashes in the pan, and none of them, I think, ever came
close to Yeats or Frost. Nevertheless, it was good to know about Olson and
Hall and Bly and Snodgrass and Levertov. There were major omissions to the
curriculum: Sylvia Plath had not yet flashed across the horizon, and Ginsberg,
Ferlinghetti, Corso and Duncan were far too rude to have been invited to this
particular party.

Our instructor was a genial man named John Lincoln Sweeney. Although he was not
a bristling-with-bibliography kind of academic celebrity, he knew everything
about the subject and was famous as a supporter of poets and artists. I knew
that he was "different" -- even my callow unsophisticated eye noticed the
elegant bespoke suits and the aristocratic mien. At the Woodberry Poetry Library
in Lamont, Sweeney was listed as "curator" but I have not doubt that he was also
patron. Woodberry collected not only books but also records and audiotapes and
films of poetry readings. It was a spectacular resource. There was a rumor that
there were poetry gatherings at Sweeney's mansion on Beacon Street, across the
river, but I was never invited. Why would I have been?

Here's a photograph of Jack and Maire Sweeney:

Sweeney's letters are now housed in the Trinity College, Dublin Library.
"Correspondents include Conrad Aiken, William Alfred, Padraic Colum, e.e.
cummings, Richard Eberhart, Leon Edel, T.S. Eliot, Robert Fitzgerald, Seamus
Heaney, Ted Hughes and Sylvia Plath, Thomas Kinsella, Philip Larkin, Marianne
Moore, Edwin and Willa Muir, Wallace Stevens, and Richard Wilbur." The
paintings (Picasso, Modigliani, Matisse) were bequeathed to the National
Gallery of Ireland.

There were about twenty students in "Modern American Poetry." Nineteen of them
were regular; one was irregular. Whenever "Mr. Kripke," whom I remember as an
exceedingly scruffy young fellow, signaled that he wanted to participate in the
conversation, time stopped. Both the instructor and my classmates treated Mr.
Kripke, who spoke in halting, awkward, and oracular tones, with extraordinary
deference. "What's the deal?" I asked, privately. "He's supposed to be very
smart," I was told. I myself didn't understand a word that Mr. Kripke said
during the entire semester. Not a single word. When I don't understand, it's
hard for me to tell whether the speaker is spouting hot air, or I'm just not
smart enough.

"Mr. Kripke" dropped from my consciousness. But just the other day, I noticed
an advertisement in the NYRB for a colloquium honoring the achievement of Saul
Kripke, Distinguished Professor at Princeton and at the CUNY Graduate Center.

Here's the scoop: according to wikipedia, "a recent poll conducted among
philosophers ranked Saul Kripke among the top ten most important philosophers of
the past 200 years." Top ten?  This is no trivial praise. No wonder everyone
stopped to listen. It was like having Michael Jordan in your gym class.

Kripke was apparently a prodigy who made important contributions to modal
logic, whatever that is, while still in his teens. For example:

A Kripke model is a triple , where is a Kripke frame, and is a relation between
nodes of W and modal formulas, such that:

Which. frankly  I never doubted.

Mr. Kripke had a couple of branches of logic (and mathematics) named after him
before he entered college. No wonder I didn't understand (and still wouldn't)
what he was struggling to say. The most recent philosopher I can understand is
John Locke, and then only the easy parts.

In retrospect, that class in poetry had more drama than I gave it credit for.
Here was John Sweeney, civilized and be-boutonniered, acquaintance of Yeats,
friend to every important poet in America. And there was Saul Kripke, not
only a mathematical and philosophical genius but also the son of "the only
conservative rabbi in Omaha, Nebraska."

And then there was me.

Title: On "Cults"
Date: October 09, 2011

Megachurch Baptist pastor Robert Jeffress, an enthusiast for Governor Rick Perry
(the Texax governor for people who think that George Bush was way too bookish)
has labelled Mitt Romney's church (Latter-Day Saints) a "cult." Jeffress made
the charge while addressing a convention of right-wing "value voters."  (The
particular value which Jefress himself exemplifies is "smugness.")

According to Jeffress, Perry's church is a "religion" and Romney's is a
"cult."  By which he means, I suppose, that a "religion" is good and true and
"cult" is bad and false.

But to an outsider, like myself, it appears otherwise. It appears that
the one is older and the other newer.  The origins of Christianity (not
the Baptist part, but the religion generally) are decently obscured by the
mists of antiquity. The origins of Mormonism are o so transparent and
so unpersuasive. But on any rational scale, the religion (virgin birth,
bread-into- wine, three-in-one) and the cult (golden tablets, magic underwear)
are equally incredible. There's nothing that would allow one to claim
superiority to the other.

A cult is a new religion; a religion is an old cult. How does a cult get to be a
religion?  It absorbs a whole lot of converts. It becomes wealthy.  It asserts
authority -- such as the power to stigmatize newer religions as cults.

Similarly, a "myth" is an old but dead religion. A "superstition" is someone
else's religion.

Here's a related question:  what's the difference between a language and a
dialect?  The standard answer among linguists: "a language has a bigger navy."

Title: The Famous First Sentences of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, This Time with Bodies.
Date: October 10, 2011

It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a
good fortune must be in want of a wife, or at least a mistress, especially
if he does not wish to indulge with ladies of easy virtue, of which the
neighborhood enjoyed an ample stock.

However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first
entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the
surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some one
or other of their pining, inhibited, and frustrated daughters.

``My dear Mr. Bennet,'' said his lady to him one day, `have you heard that
Netherfield Park is let at last?'' As usual, Mrs Bennet's stomach was
distempered with wind, which caused frequent eructations and annoying
flatulence.

Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.

``But it is,'' returned she; ``for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told
me all about it.''

Mr. Bennet made no answer.

``Do not you want to know who has taken it?'' cried his wife impatiently.

``You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.''  Mr. Bennet
was customarily cranky and irritable, perhaps because he had not enjoyed his
lady for the last fourteen years, or ever since the birth of his youngest
daughter, when Mrs. Bennet had declared that five pregnancies were sufficient.
He frequently retired to his room, where, pretending interest in his extensive
library, he surrendered to self-abuse.

This was invitation enough.

``Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a
young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on
Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it
that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before
Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next
week.''

``What is his name?''

``"Bingley.''

``Is he married or single?''

``Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five
thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!''  He must be in the pink of
youthful vitality, and if we can only bridle his natural impulses until he has
been entranced by Jane or Lizzie, we might capture a prize.  Perhaps out of
excitement, Mrs. Bennet let fly an enormous, resonant fart.

``How so? how can it affect them?'' replied Mr. Bennet, pretending not to notice
that the air was rent with the sound and savor of the explosion.

``My dear," replied his wife, ``how can you be so tiresome! You must know that
I am thinking of his marrying one of them. He'll be so blinded by youthful lust
that he'll surely imagine himself to be in love.

Title: What's the Deal with the Necklaces that Baseball Players are Wearing?
Date: October 11, 2011

What are those beads with which half of the players now accesorize?  Why,
they're magic titanium necklaces. "The necklaces... work by stabilizing the
electric flow that nerves use to communicate actions to the body. All of the
messages in your body travel through electricity, so if you’re tired or just
pitched nine innings, the electricity isn’t flowing as smoothly as it can,”
said Joe Furuhata, a Phiten (Phiten is the company that manufactures the beads)
spokesman. “Our products smooth out those signals.” Persuasive as all get
out, isn't he?  Nothing like smooth-flowing electric signals, though whether AC
or DC he doesn't specify. Here's some more science from the website: "Titanium
Necklace Benefits have been proven to be many. Some of these benefits include
alleviation from discomfort in your shoulders and neck, and it helps the whole
body to relax as well. Titanium necklaces are known to ease pains and aches of
the upper back, and also enhance the circulation of blood from the upper body to
the brain and other major organs. Included in the titanium necklace benefits are
that they have anti-radiation and anti-fatigue properties."  So it's not just
electricity: it's also pain relief and improved circulation, plus the beads ward
off radiation (a major problem in ballparks nowadays).

Gotta love the use of the passive voice: "Titanium necklace benefits have been
proven to be many."  Proven by whom?  Here I am searching for a citation, an
experiment, a demonstration, a study, even a minuscule perfunctory footnote.
But there's nothing. Not a whisper of evidence. Nor could there be: what sort
of double-blind experiment would it take to prove the efficacy of the beads. I
guess I'm a non-believer, once again. So is the chief of sports medicine at NYU,
who says, "it's all superstition."

OK, so baseball players are superstitious. No news there. But what are we
to think when Ron Washington, the manager of the Texas team, sports a magic
necklace?  Here he is:

Can you see the beads: trust me, they're not ordinary; they're genuine
"titanium-infused plastic."

Does "Wash" think that his beads improve the performance of managers, whose job
is of the brain rather than of the body?  "Wow, I never would have thought to
call for that double steal if I hadn't been wearing my magic beads!"

Altogether, the ubiquitous necklaces lead me into further despair about the
quality of American education.

Title: About "About Schmidt"
Date: October 16, 2011

I borrowed About Schmidt from our local library because I had seen and enjoyed
the Alexander Payne movie, even though it starred Jack Nicholson, who was once
again -- yet once more -- still another time -- reprising J. J. Gittes Redux.
There was however only the most marginal connection between novel and film.
In the film, Warren Schmidt is a insurance executive in Omaha whose nasty
wife has recently died and whose Denver daughter is about to be married to an
asbestos salesman. In the novel, Albert Schmidt.  an upper-class Harvard/New
York/Hamptons lawyer for a white shoe firm, has recently retired, and has lost
his beloved, talented and patient wife to a brain tumor. He fusses endlessly
about money, of which he has a more-than-ample supply. His major problem is
that he don't much like Jews, and that his daughter is about to marry one (a
young partner in his law firm). She (the daughter) teases her father with the
possibility that she's going to convert to Judaism. Schmidt has a nasty streak
but he's a good man underneath it all and one who can return blow-for-blow
and flirt for flirt. It appears that redemption from his narrowness will come
through an affair with a twenty-year-old Boriquena who doesn't much care about
money and who introduces him to a new world of modern sexuality. Just when
the novel seems unable to conclude, Schmidt receives a large enabling bequest
from his father's second wife and all his financial problems are solved.
Thesaurus ex machina, so to speak. Inasmuch as the novel seems to look askance
at Schmidt's money worries, it seems odd that it should end with a triumphant,
and I suppose comic, infusion of additional cash. I didn't find the conclusion
to be satisfying.

The relationship between Schmidt and his daughter is stressful and painful and
rings true -- it's the best thing in the book. It's a wonder that the movie
version neglected such rich material. My suspicion (I have no evidence to offer)
is that the perpetrators re-shaped the novel into a vehicle for Jack N. I hope
that Louis Begley, the author of this urbane tale, was amply rewarded for the
use of the novel's title, because the movie made almost nothing of the plot, or
the characters, or the dialogue, or the ambience.

It's a good book -- and  certainly intriguing enough to send me scurrying back
to the library for other novels by Louis Begley.

Yesterday's post was disrespectful of slugs. I'm chagrined to have been so
benighted and bigoted. After all, slugs have mothers too. In a comment, Mrs.
KKP --formerly Miss KKH -- (a food safety specialist) reports that many people
happily eat slugs, which are a great source of protein and surely taste just
like chicken when fried, or blended into a stew. They will no doubt serve
equally well in a fricassee or a ragout.

In my defense, I can only say that I've not enjoyed a good relationship with
slugs, so far. I remember my first encounter with the slimy tribe -- as a young,
innocent boy, in my father's garden on East 9th Street, where six-inch long
fat gruesome creatures violated the precious daylilies with trails of goo.
Slugs were unlike anything I had previously encountered and seemed to me to be
either extra-terrestrial or transplanted from a horror movie. "Just pick them up
and throw them into the bucket," my father said, optimistically. Squeamish, I
declined.

And then there were the foot-long slugs crawling up the outsides of the windows
on Mackinack Island and California's horrid banana slugs. They're all dreadful
and voracious beings.

Title: Reposted: Duke, Duke, Duke
Date: October 23, 2011

Ain't it shocking that Gene Chandler's excellent song is now almost half a
century old?  Seems like just yesterday.

This be the verse in its full splendor.

Duke, Duke, Duke, Duke of Earl Duke, Duke, Duke of Earl Duke, Duke, Duke of Earl

Duke, Duke, Duke of Earl Duke, Duke, Duke of Earl Duke, Duke, Duke of Earl Duke,
Duke, Dukeof Earl

As I walk through this world Nothing can stop the Duke of Earl And you, you are
my girl And no one can hurt you, oh no Yes, I'm gonna love you Come on let me
hold you darlin' 'Cause I'm the Duke of Earl.

And when I hold you You will be my Duchess, Duchess of Earl We'll walk through
my dukedom And the paradise we will share.

Yes, oh, I I'm gonna love you Nothing can stop me now 'Cause I'm the Duke of
Earl.

Duke, Duke, Duke of Earl Duke, Duke, Duke of Earl Duke, Duke, Duke of Earl

I'm gonna love you Nothing can stop me now 'Cause I'm the Duke of Earl.

1)  "Duke of Earl" is classic, though late, doo-wop. Therefore it's lineally
descended from songs in which a supporting male quartet sang meaningless
syllables: doo wop, wop, wop. In this revisiting of the genre, nonsense doo doo
doo de wop has been superseded by words that carry meaning of a sort: duke duke
duke of earl. Return we now to the pages of history: in their turn, doo wop
quartets were themselves secular offspring of gospel quartets, where a reverent
foursome would sing do lord do lord, do lordy lord (a good example: the unnamed
backup quartet supporting Georgia Peach in "Do Lord Send Me").

2)  It's a fascinating process: Gene Chandler's replacement of doo doo with
duke duke is in fact a return to the roots, except that the previous and
inherent religious content has undergone secularization. "Lord" has become
"Duke," while the heaven of gospel has transformed into the "dukedom" of doo-
wop.

3.  It's easy to deride the naive faux-aristocratic title "Duke of Earl";  but would the song preserve its meaning if it were "Duke of  Buckingham?" "Earl" may sound silly, but because it's a generic title  rather than a specific one it carries allegorical significance. "Duke of  Earl" is no one and therefore everyone.

4.  It's entirely likely that the word "earl" was chosen because of  it echoes "lord": liquids "r" and 'l" and unemphatic vowel.

5.  The first line of the lyric --"As I walk through this world"--  introduces a secularized religious motif (an inheritance from the song's  gospel forbears). Some will notice the echo of the initial phrase of the  most famous of all religious allegories, Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress (1672):  "As I walked through the wilderness of this world." Gene Chandler,  walking through this world, is reborn just as Christian was reborn in  the classic allegory. Not religiously, but in a worldly way. He is not  saved; he is duked.

6.  Why the aggressive "nothing can stop me  now?" What obstacles stopped the Duke of Earl in the past, before his  duking? The triumphalist language is highly developed but the obstacles  remain vague and unarticulated. Audiences find their own meaning in  the lacuna, but indignities historically suffered by the black  underclass lurk only slightly below the surface of the lyric.

7.  The transformation from a previous but unknown and unarticulated  existence to an aristocratic, unstoppable Duke of Earl takes place  offstage, nor is any explanation offered for the metamorphosis.  It's  entirely magical.

8.  Because it's magic, it's pure fantasy. Pastoral fantasy in fact,  which, curiously, is simultaneously primitive ("paradise") and  sophisticated ("dukedom").

9. But it's a shared paradise: the duke along with his duchess. The  retreat to domesticity is almost Victorian: "ah love, let us be true/  To one another...."  This particular Duke does not know that "Two  paradises were in one/ To live in paradise alone."

10.  The Duke retreats to domesticity and yet he seems to stake  out ("nothing can stop me now") new territory to conquer, in which  regard the spacious lyric seems to embody contradictory or even  incoherent vectors of thought. However, the enthusiasm of the singing  obliterates the ambiguity of the lyric; in sum, the song is remarkably  optimistic -- which is just one of many reasons for its continued popularity.

Title: Edward Gibbon -- Replacement Child
Date: October 28, 2011

By strict definition, a replacement child is one who is conceived because
an older sibling has died. According to the theory, such a child is at
psychological risk, especially if the dead child has not been adequately
mourned.

Because he was an oldest son, Edward Gibbon, the greatest of all modern
historians and the most brilliant prose stylist in the English language, would
not seem to qualify as a replacement -- except that in his own curious manner
of thinking, Gibbon “replaced” children who were born subsequent to him.

Gibbon preened himself on his status in the family. “From my birth,” he
said in his famous Memoir, “I have enjoyed the rights of primogeniture.”
But primogeniture was not so much a chronological fact as it was a pinnacle to
be defended. As he conceived it, Gibbon triumphed over would-be competitors to
his supremacy. “I was succeeded by five brothers and one sister, all of whom
were snatched away in their infancy.” Toward his dead siblings, and toward the
parents who endured the heart-breaking death of six of their seven children,
Gibbon was unnaturally cold and mercenary. “I shall not pretend to lament”
the loss of those who would “oppress my inheritance.” Gibbon lacked empathy
in part because he felt, with some justice, that his younger siblings were
favored over him by his father. How could this be?

The Memoir supplies an explanation. In an age of high infant mortality, Gibbon
was a very sickly child. His life was at risk while other, later-born children
seemed to be born healthier. As Gibbon himself puts it, “so feeble was my
constitution, so precarious my life, that, in the baptism of each of my brothers
my father’s prudence successively repeated my Christian name of Edward, that,
in case of the departure of the eldest son, this patronymic appellation might
be still perpetuated in the family.” This is odd indeed. In five separate
instances, according to the future historian, a male child saw the light, and
each time the child was named Edward. In one case after another, the outcome was
the same. The infant who might have “oppressed his inheritance” succumbed
and the heroic oldest son beat back the challenge. The first Edward therefore
“replaced,” so to speak, a series of subsequent Edwards who might have
superseded him. It's not hard to imagine that a sickly child, pursued by a
series of infants each christened with his very own name, would feel threatened
and might rejoice rather than mourn at their funerals.

Although Gibbon attributes the pattern of naming to his father’s
“prudence,” it is obvious that the phrase "my father's prudence” is an
irony that masks a true fury. Was it prudence or was it his father's hope that
the sickly child would be succeeded by a healthy one?  Hostility also shines
through Gibbon's jealous account of his mother: "to preserve and to rear so
frail a being [as himself], the most tender assiduity was scarcely sufficient;
and my mother’s attention was somewhat diverted by her frequent pregnancies,
by an exclusive passion for her husband, and by the dissipation of the world,
in which his taste and authority obliged her to mingle.” The irony of this
beautiful Augustan sentence conceals infantine rage: to translate into more
forthright English, Gibbon objects that his mother conceived other children,
claims that she should have preferred him to her husband, and asserts that she
should have withdrawn from society to nurse him.

To what degree Gibbon’s suppressed and ironic but still obvious anger toward
his parents contributed to his peculiar temperament is difficult to say, but
it is a fact that the bulk of his career was spent not only in tracing the
decline and fall of Rome, the father of all European civilizations, but also in
displacing an established patriarchal religion from its position of supremacy.
The irony that he directed against his parents in his Memoir is the exact
weapon that he learned to deploy against Roman failures and against triumphant
Christianity.

In addition, there's an untidy psychological wrinkle. Gibbon’s claim that
the male children who succeeded him were all named Edward is a crucial part of
his indictment of his parents. But it's an assertion that is not true and is
not substantiated by parish records. There was no endless series of Edwards.
Apparently, one succeeding child was so named but the rest enjoyed various
different appellations. The most scrupulous of historians either invented or
misremembered the dreadful slight that so wounded him. What psychological
mechanism caused Gibbon to yearn to be even more of a replacement child than in
fact he was?

Title: Another Replacement Child -- Peter Sellers
Date: November 07, 2011

A "replacement child," narrowly defined, is a person who is intentionally
conceived because an older sibling has recently died. Such substitutes must
endure the lifetime burden of competing with a lost and often idealized
child. Because it is almost impossible for such persons to please their
parents, they easily become confused and frustrated, and in worst-case
scenarios, pathological.

One of the ways in which the "replacement child syndrome" manifests itself
concerns the matter of self-identity. An adult "replacement child" might
wonder, Who am I exactly?  He might find himself, especially if he has been
raised from his earliest days as if he were someone else, uncertain of his own
boundaries.

The great comic actor Peter Sellers, was a classic replacement child. At birth,
Sellers was named Richard Henry, but his parents, curiously, always called
him Peter, after an older stillborn brother. And Peter he remained. Why would
his parents do such a thing?  Would it not effect a child to be called not by
his own name but by the name of a missing brother?

Sellers is famous for his ability to subsume his identity into the role he
played.  He said that "If you ask me to play myself, I will not know what to
do. I do not know who or what I am" -- because even when not acting, he was
always Richard Henry playing the part of Peter.

To confuse him all the more, Sellers' father, who was Anglican, and his mother,
who was Jewish, sent him to Roman Catholic schools.

Let us understand what Lola (the exemplary two-year-old granddaughter) meant
when she cryptically observed, "Nay, no ba."

Nay --perhaps better spelled  neigh -- means horse or horses. "Ba" are of
course sheep. Lola watched them last summer when the two grazing animals shared
the same Vermont pasture. But when her father took her to a Virginia farm, she
noticed that there were no sheep among the horses. Hence her succinct formula:
"nay, no ba."

Title: "Paradise" in Measure for Measure
Date: November 14, 2011

The word to watch in a most riveting speech in Measure for Measure is
"paradise."

Young Claudio. whose head is scheduled to be lopped off tomorrow morning, is the
speaker. He panics -- and why shouldn't he? After all, his only slip is that
he has impregnated his ladylove Juliet. A venial sin, yet in newly-puritanical
Vienna, the act of love has led directly to the executioner with his ax and his
big black block. Although everyone, certainly including Shakespeare himself,
knew that there were many things far worse than to depart this vale of trouble
and tears, Claudio is so terrified by his imminent execution that he goes off
the philosophical rails. He argues the extreme position (and here comes the
speech and the crucial word) that "The weariest and most loathed worldly life/
That age, ache, penury and imprisonment/ Can lay on nature is a paradise/ To
what we fear of death." A "paradise?" Goodness gracious!

Although everyone can sympathize, no one should agree with
Claudio. Neverthless, the three-and-a-half lines of verse that contain the
climactic  word "paradise" (and indeed the long speech in which these lines
reside) are so brilliant and colorful that they almost persuade us to do so. One
of the reasons the sentence is so wonderful is because Shakespeare brings to
bear one of his favorite and most useful figures of speech. To depict Claudio's
hysteria, Shakespeare employs a full-throttle hyperbole.

The most transparently hyperbolical words are the grammatical superlatives
"weariest" and "most loathed." The hyperbole that resides in the word "paradise"
is less obvious but more potent. "Paradise" is the climax -- the word that any
good actor or reader must hit hard when he recites or reads the passage. An
hyperbolist less gifted than Shakespeare might have written "The weariest and
most loathed life is pretty darn good compared to dying," but our author pulls
out all the rhetorical stops. To lie in poverty, in pain, in prison is, Claudio
asserts, compared to death, a "paradise."

If, dear attentive and intelligent reader, you will now return to quotation, and
read Claudio's lines again, you will feel the hyperbolical power of "paradise."
Try it, please. And when you recite the sentence, you will also notice that the
initial "p" in climactic "paradise" is prepared for by the plosives in the words
that precede it -- "penury" and "imprisonment."

And if you are following instructions and reading aloud, you should be aware
that in Shakespeare's time, "ache" was pronounced "aitch" -- a pronunciation
that produces a strong and ingenious contrast between the affricates (age,
aitch) and the plosives (penury, imprisonment, paradise).

Claudio's hyperbolical lines bring to conclusion a speech which is querulous at
the start and panicky at the end.  Here they are in context.

Ay, but to die, and go we know not where.

To lie in cold obstruction, and to rot;

This sensible warm motion to become

A kneaded clod, and the delighted spirit

To bath in fiery floods, or to reside

In thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice;

To be imprison'd in the viewless winds

And blown with restless violence round about

The pendent world; or to be worse than worst

Of those that lawless and incertain thought

Imagine howling.  'Tis too horrible.

The weariest and most loathed worldly life

That age, ache, penury and imprisonment

Can lay on nature, is a paradise

To what we fear of death.

("Cold obstruction" means that the body no longer moves -- as opposed to
"sensible" (i.e capable of sensation or feeling) "warm motion".  A "kneaded
clod" is what a "warm motion" is compressed or compressible into by death. A
"delighted spirit" is generally glossed as "formerly capable of delight" but is
better understood as "darkened" -- that is, de-lighted. "Viewless" means simply
"invisible.")

Shakespeare does not feel obliged to distinguish or judge between these
painful visions of an afterlife; instead, he prefers simply to heap together
naturalistic, Christian, pagan and "lawless" ideas.

Students of hyperbole will take note of the inventive phrase "worse than worst,"
where, it seems, "worst" is insufficiently superlative. Here Shakespeare pushes
against the limits of grammar. Bad, worse, worst suffices for most writers, but
Shakespeare invents a new adjectival category -- a comparative superlative.

Shakespeare's interest in the worstness of things will reappear in King Lear 
when Edgar, encountering his blinded father, realizes that he has not yet
touched bottom: "O Gods. Who is't can say "I am at the worst?'/ I am worse than
e'er I was." And then an worser insight comes to him: "And worse I may be
yet: the worst is not/ So long as we can say 'This is the worst.'" For Edgar,
of course, death, that so frightens Claudio, is understood to be a relief and a
liberation. Edgar's father dies "smilingly."

Title: Fermat's Room;  Goldbach's Conjecture.
Date: November 16, 2011

I reached my peak with numbers when I was a child at P. S. 217 (under the
tutelage of Mrs. McNulty).  Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division --
that's my area of expertise. Geometry, algebra, trig -- way too abstract for my
pedestrian brain. Calculus and up -- not the least chance.

Arithmetic yes, mathematics no.

Sometimes I try to read popularizations of mathematical theory, but I rarely
make it beyond the first few sentences. Once symbols start to appear, I'm done.
Especially Greek letters (in parentheses).

The consolation prize is that I'm better than most people at mental arithmetic .
I can do sums and approximations and other stuff in my head                    .

Last night, we watched Fermat's Room. It's the kind of movie that is often
called an "ingenious thriller."  It's also a member of a very small group of
films that concern mathematics or mathematicians:  Good Will Hunting, Stand and
Deliver, Antonia's Line, Straw Dogs.

Fermat's Room focuses on a possible proof of Christian Goldbach's Conjecture.
I suppose that I should have known about Herr Goldbach and his guess, but I
confess to ignorance. Goldbach's conjecture dates to 1742 and is apparently one
of the oldest unsolved problems in number theory. In brief, Goldbach theorized
that every even integer greater than 2 can be written as the sum of two prime
numbers. For example, 10 is equal to 3 plus 7, 20 to 17 plus 3 (or 13 plus
7), and 100 resolves into 47 plus 53. Although no one has found a number that
doesn't work, the conjecture can't be proved -- or, at least, hasn't been proved
because there are some very large numbers out there. In Fermat's Room, two of
the characters claim to have proved the conjecture. And they are consequently at
odds.

I had always thought of prime numbers as a kind of novelty or curiosity. But
if primes are a component of all even numbers -- well, that's something. 
Goldbach's idea raises the stature of primes in my perennially naive eyes -- in
exactly the same way that the Fibonacci series became more important to me when
I learned that the chambered nautilis is structured Fibonacci-wise.

While watching the movie (which is a good one), I ran through the even numbers
from 10 to 70.  Everything was in order. But why?

Later in the evening, I read that every even number can also be resolved into
the sum of a semi-prime (which is the product of two primes) and a prime. So 100
equals 77 (7 time 11) and 23. I spent a restless  night summing, in my bed,
semi-primes and primes from 10 to 100. All in order, once again.

Why should it be so?

Whether it should be, or not, it is.  I remember that I used to answer my

Goldbach's Conjecture is a fact, not a why.

It's like gravity. I understand that the apple falls to the ground and that

Title: Landau versus Gottlieb
Date: December 02, 2011

While in the Bay Area, I visited SF's Museum of Asian Art,  where this
grotesque, beautiful piece of maximum conspicuous consumption was on display.

It's a silver Landau made for the Maharaja of Bhavnagar around the turn of
the last century.  Needless to say, I was utterly appalled by the waste and
extravagance though dazzled by the workmanship.

Afterward, I took a trip to Alameda's Pinball Museum. Here's a bank of classic
50's Gottliebs.

I played this magnificent piece of craftsmanship

and, still a master of the flipper, won three (3) free games.

I can't remember whether the silver coach was owned by this couple of dandies
(also in the Asian Art Museum) or one of their cousins,

but no one who looked like either a maharaja or maharani was playing with
Gottlieb's silver balls.  I didn't spy anyone at the pinball museum who was
nearly so well accoutered.

Title: Newt
Date: December 03, 2011

William Blake asks us to beware "venomous Newt" -- venomous because the skin
of this lizard-like creature contains the extraordinarily dangerous poison
tetrodotoxin  which it secretes through its granular skin glands. It is unwise
to befriend or embrace a Newt and they should never be swallowed. Tetrodotoxin
blocks sodium channels and can therefore cause heart arrhythmia or heart arrest.

Shakespeare did not love the Newt; among the ingredients in the witches' potion
in Macbeth, along with the fenny snake, toe of frog, wool of bat, tongue of dog
and owlet's wing is "eye of Newt."

In Timon of Athens, a list of "abhorred births" includes the "black toad and
adder blue" along with the  "gilded Newt." "Gilded," for Shakespeare, could
mean "gilt" but also "guilty" and sometimes even  "false."

In Monty Python and the Holy Grail, Second Villager claims that a witch has
transformed him into the most loathsome of critters: "She turned me into a
Newt." He then withdraws the charge: "I got better."

It's definitely better not to be a Newt -- or even to get too close to one.

Title: Amnesia on Film: Blind Horizon
Date: December 05, 2011

For the record, Blind Horizon (2003) may be the most confusing, confused, and
derivative film ever perpetrated. It's a failed memory-assassinate the president
movie, a genre of which The Manchurian Candidate stands as head and font.

Blind Horizon offers one picturesque moment -- when a giant tanker truck
decorated with a Confederate flag and carrying a load of gasoline spills
across the highway and blows up. The truck could have driven through the
monstrous holes in the plot with room to spare. In fact, it would have been more
appropriate if the truck had been carrying a load of red herrings.

Once again, amnesia is whatever Hollywood says it is. In this case, the amnesiac
remembers that there's going to be an attempt on the president's life, but he
doesn't remember his own name, his occupation, or his fiancee -- an unlikely
scenario. He has flashes of memory that are copied, almost exactly, from the
Bourne series, which we must now anoint as the movie amnesia template of the
future.

Val Kilmer is wasted as the - wait, is he the would-be asssassin or is he the
Federal agent trying to prevent the assassination? I never did quite figure it
out. Neve Campbell is dark and mysterious and Amy Smart is blonde and perky --
that's the way women are packaged in this expensive turkey. If the writers (F.
Paul Benz, Steve Tomlin) were allowed to choose between remembering this film,
or amnesia, they should definitely go for the latter.

Hypothesis: the amnesia mcguffin liberates the screenwriter from any allegiance
to probability.

Title: Being "Occupied"
Date: December 10, 2011

Here in peaceful, progrressive Boulder, two commissioners' seats are coming open
next election. Commissioners are important officers: they directly govern the
half of our citizens who live in unincorporated areas of the county, they employ
1800 people and administer a $300 million budget, they manage all the social
services, and they set policy on land use, open space, transportation, etc. They
also put out fires.

Even though we're six months away from the primary, campaigning is well under
way. And should be. Deciding on he right county officer is important. We're a
functioning democracy.

This afternoon there was a forum to allow the six candidates to answer questions
and state their views.  But just as the meeting was called to order, we were
"occupied."

About fifty or sixty people filed into the room, took up places around the
perimeter, interrupted the moderator and announced that they had a statement to
make, which they did in a peculiar and theatrical manner. Their leader read a
few words, and then the rest of the folks repeated the same phrase, in chorus.
Their demands were well known: control the big banks, put an end to corporate
dominance, stop the foreclosures, support the homeless, reduce pollution,
prohibit fracking, end uranium mining, and prevent any GMO crops from being
grown in Boulder County.

Then they left. Just vanished.

And so we got back to work.

What was so odd is that every single one of the candidates stated positions that
were at least as far to the left, and sometimes further to the left, than the
Occupiers -- which makes me wonder whether these very sincere folks wouldn't be
doing more good by helping us stuff the envelopes and do the lit drops and help
with the GOTV. To tell the exact truth, I found it just a little offensive to be
hectored so dramatically by political novices.

At very least, the "Occupiers" should give up the choral speaking, which sounds
not like thoughtfulness but rather like authoritarian groupspeak. A little
dictatorial.

As the political philosopher and social critic Doll Tearsheet long ago remarked,
"the word occupy... was an excellent good word before it was ill sorted."

Title: Trollope's Old Old Man
Date: December 10, 2011

Having just read the posthumously published An Old Man's Love (1884), I believe
I can now claim to have read every single one of Anthony Trollope's forty-seven
novels. Who would have guessed, when I encountered The Warden and Barchester
Towers back in 1958, that it would have taken fifty-three years to complete the
marathon?

I'm glad that I saved An Old Man's Love for last. It's very much a valediction
to love and to life.

William Whittlestaff, the "old man," is fifty years in age, which, to my
occluded septuagenarian eyes, seems barely beyond adolescence. He falls in love
with his ward, Mary Lawrie, who is a generation younger than he. She agrees to
marry him, but then her first love, John Gordon, returns from Kimberley, where
colonial diamonds have conveniently cured his poverty. Eventually, Whittlestaff
ungraciously concedes the bride to the younger man. Self-abnegation does not
come easy.

My interest focused on Mary Lawrie, who is so paralyzed by notions of duty and
honor that she cannot lift a finger in her own interest. It would be wrong,
in her conception (and in Trollope's), for her to imply, however slightly,
that her commitment to Whittlestaff ought to be re-assessed. In fact, to avoid
becoming the much-dreaded "jilt," she has to argue with herself against her own
inclinations. Gordon and Whittlestaff are allowed to be active in working out
their interests; Miss Lawrie remains entirely passive and therefore virtuous.

As is always the case in Trollope's novels, courting couples are not allowed to
engage in forthright conversation until after matters are settled.

Even after completing the forty-seven novels, I cannot help but marvel at this
strange Victorian ethic.

It's unfortunate that Trollope doesn't conclude by granting Whittlestaff an
avuncular or grandparental role toward the new couple and their putative
children. What would it have hurt him to have imagined a scene in which
Whittlestaff, a white-haired gentleman, walks the balmy Barset woods with nine-
year-old John and seven-year-old Mary Gordon?  No such event takes place, and
Whittlestaff therefore retains his gloom right to the end. Charles Dickens,
always warm-hearted, would have been more generous.

Title: Onagers
Date: December 12, 2011

It's absolutely astonishing that I've lived all these years in total ignorance
of onagers. And would have presisted in abysmal onagerian oblivion hadn't read
David Anthony's fascinating monograph, The Horse, the Wheel, and Language
(2007). Anthony's thesis is that "proto-Indo-European" -- from which the Slavic,
Celtic, Germanic, Romance, and Indic languages, among others, are descended,
originated in the steppes north of the Black and Caspian seas. The inhabitants
of these areas domesticated horses and invented or adopted the wheel and the
wagon, which gave them the technological advantage to spread their culture
and language across the steppes eastward as far as China and westward to the
Atlantic. This same people also invented  the chariot -- a horse-drawn single-
axle vehicle, which, manned by a warrior armed with bronze-headed javelins, was
the principal engine of war for the thousand years that began about 1700 BCE and
ended about 700 BCE. It's a lovely hypothesis, bristling with the evidence of
hundreds of archeological digs.

Pre-proto-Indo-European speakers ate horses long before they domesticated them
and rode them before they learned to harness them to chariots and wagons.
However, horses weren't the only equid in the neighborhood.  There were also
onagers.

But all they could do with onagers was feast on them. The evidence lies in
the thousands of midden heaps that are loaded with onager bones. Here are two
onagers:

Onagers are half the size, or less, than the horses with which we are familiar.
They are apparently untamable, like zebras, but, uniike zebras, edible. (So
tasty, in fact, that fewer than a thousand of them survive in the wild.)

Anthony doesn't say so, but if there had been only onagers, and not those noble
and cooperative horses, we would certainly not be speaking and writing an Indo-
European language -- and, for that matter, we might still be trundling across
the wide Missouri in oxcarts.

From the Bronze Age down to the second decade of the nineteenth century, the
horse was the fastest and most reliable way to travel, the quickest way to
convey information, the backbone of armies, and the most conspicuous index of
wealth and status.

Horses are handsome and intelligent. Onagers are ugly, awkward, and stubborn,
and could never have taken part in the creation of complex civilizations. Poets
have celebrated "fiery Pegasus"  for millenia; no one, to the best of my
knowledge, has ever rhapsodized the onager.

Title: Silly Dreams
Date: December 16, 2011

In last night's dream, I was back in college anxiously sitting a final exam
in a literature course. I remember that the exam was titanically difficult
and unnerving but I can recall only one specific question. "Discuss Ernest
Hemingway's father's Buddhist leanings." I must say that my dreamatorium was
working overtime to come up with that one. Also on the exam: I was presented
with pictures and was asked to supply their literary significance. The one
I remember was a photograph of a generic urban street with five unoccupied
parking spaces. My answer to the question was this: "These spaces were left open
when Ernest Hemingway and four of his friends left for the bar in order to get
themselves soused." I remember thinking that my answer was pretty damn clever
and should get me full marks. I also dreamed a short-answer quiz. In this case I
can't recall the questions, but only that I gave as one of my answers the word
"praestorium." I have no idea what "praestorium" means, except that it sounds
like a portmanteau of the names of two ancient Roman officials (praetor and
quaestor) with an attached (and redundant) noun suffix.

It's sad that fifty years after the fact I'm still dreaming about examinations.
I'm thankful these recent dreams were foolish rather than nightmarish.
Nevertheless, I think it's time to read up on Hemingway, a writer to whom I've
clearly paid too little attention this last half-century. You never know when
someone's going to ask a hard question about Hemingway or his father.

Title: "War on Christmas"
Date: December 18, 2011

If the profoundly Christian seventeenth-century founders of our country had
a single favorite Biblical passage, it might be the one in which the Lord
(speaking through His minor prophet Amos) severely condemned the empty vanity
of holidays. "I hate," said the Lord, "I despise your feast days, and I will
not smell in your solemn assemblies." The Lord of Hosts specifically enjoined
against the attempt to placate him by sacrificing animals (a matter of topical
concern in Amos' time). "Though ye offer me burnt offerings and your meat
offerings, I will not accept them; neither will I regard the peace offerings of
your fat beasts." Nor did He rest with these easy-to-follow injunctions, but
He went on to condemn all musical tributes as well. Not for him any chants,
glees or carols: "Take thou away from me the noise of thy songs; for I will not
hear the melody of thy viols." Our Puritan forefathers interpreted these lines
correctly and enthusiastically; they recognized that the Lord opposed not only
ritual sacrifice and music but all formal observance and rote piety. The Ancient
of Days made it abundantly clear that what moved him was not empty ceremony
but genuine morality. HIs solution: "let justice run down as the waters, and
righteousness as a mighty stream." Taking these uncompromising sentences
as their guide, our founders dug in their heels against the ostentatious
celebration of all holidays, especially Christmas. Instead, they did as they
were enjoined: they looked into their hearts.

Would they not have been reduced to angry and impotent sobs by the grotesque
consumerism -- the burnt offerings and squeaking timbrels  -- that once again
this Christmas season displace justice and righteousness?  Could there be
anything more loathsome either to Amos or to our devout ancestors than "Silent
Night" amidst shopping-mall tinsel and gimcrackery? Or than the attempt to gin
up conflict or to gain a partisan political advantage by inventing a mythical
"war on Christmas"?

Further observations on the "holiday season" can be found here.

Title: Birthday Gift Suggestions
Date: December 20, 2011

I've been studying (or more exactly being dazzled by) the illustrations in a
magnificent four-pound coffee-table extravaganza called The Horse From Cave
Paintings to Modern Art. It was first published in France (Cheval dans l'art)
in 2008 and came to me through the Abbeville Press on Varick Street in NYC and
also through the generosity of our local public library (it's too expensive to
purchase). The history of the horse in art begins with the Chauvet Cave and
includes thousands of years of wonders. But I don't write merely to extol the
book, however great it be.

I call it to your attention because I have a birthday coming up soon and
any number of my friends and relatives and readers of this blague have been
asking me what I would like as a gift. This book has given me a few ideas. At
the outset I'd like to say that I'm not really interested in the monumental
paintings that fill most of the pages of the book: battle scenes, hunting
scenes, royal processions. Not my cup of tea. Besides the fact that they are
too large for the condo, most of them are a little on the pretentious side, and
frankly. I don't think they'd work with our understated decor.

However, I'd like to suggest that friends, relatives and constant readers might
want to pool their pennies and present me with one of the smaller, more discreet
objects.

My first choice:

It's known as the Chariot of the Sun sculpture. It's bronze with a little bit
of gold leaf and was found a hundred years ago in a Danish bog, where it had
apparently sat for about 3500 years. It might be a little the worse for wear but
I don't mind. At three feet long and two feet high it would sit nicely on the
dining room table. No longer bog-bound, it presently resides in the National
Museet in Copenhagen but I'm sure the museum would entertain a reasonable
offer. I think you can assume that unlike the callous Danes, I would treat the
sculpture right and not stick it in a swamp somewhere.

If the Chariot of the Sun is unavailable, or the Museet (the phone number for
the "butikken" is 33 47 38 30) proves to be sticky to deal with, I have another
suggestion. It's not as good, but good enough.

It's Charlemagne.  A ninth-century bronze equestrian statuette. The picture is
misleading because the statuette is only nine inches tall, which makes it just
right for a window sill or the top of one of the stereo speakers. The rendering
of the emperor himself is a little stiff, and the sword that should be in his
right hand is missing, but the horse, imitating Roman models, is pretty damn
good. Charlemagne and his horsey are in the Louvre just waiting for an offer.
The statuette is so small that it shouldn't cost much.

And please, friends, no tacky reproductions.

Title: New Horsey Words
Date: December 22, 2011

I'm sure that everyone but I knows these excellent words, but each one is an
absolute novelty to me.

A quadriga is a chariot drawn by four abreast horses. They must have been quite
a trick to control. Wide chariot, I guess, or skinny horses. Quadriga racing
was the nascar of the classical world. The "ga" in quadriga is from iuga, or
yoke, hence the biga, a word of predictable meaning that I would probably have
known if I did crossword puzzles or played scrabble. The ancient Greeks called
a quadriga a tethrippon, which was their privilege. I haven't encountered the
word, but I bet that there's also a triga, and if there is a triga, I imagine
that it's linked, somehow or other, to troika.

A cataphract was a heavily-armed horseman.  Here's an c. 440 CE Chinese statue
of a cataprhact.

I don't believe that horses had legs so stout in those days.  I suspect that
the medium (terracotta) required them.

Schabraque appeared in my horse book as an English noun, and perhaps it is, but
the only definition that I could find was in a French dictionary: nom feminin
singulier: 1  ancienne couverture de cheval de cavalerie 2  femme laide
ou sotte. I don't have the slightest idea how the two meanings are related,
but I'm glad to know them. And the next time that I encounter une femme sotte,
which isn't very often, I'm going to try to insinuate "schabraque" into the
conversation.

I'll try not to use the word quiff, which is a horse's forelock, especially one
hanging over the eyes, but which might easily be misunderstood by guys from my
old neighborhood.

And finally, the piaffe is a dressage movement in which a horse essentially
trots in place. A ridiculous word for a ridiculous performance. I don't know the
origin of the word and I doubt that it's related to French piaf, which, I think
I remember, is a demotic or slang word for sparrow.

Title: Polanski and The Ghost Writer
Date: December 30, 2011

The Ghost Writer, which I saw last night, is a very good "thriller." It's co-
written and directed by Roman Polanski and therefore inevitably dwells upon the
menace that lurks beneath quotidian events. Once again, Polanski offers us a
naif  who gradually comes to realize that the world is under the control of
dark, implacable, omnipresent forces of evil. In The Ghost Writer, it's the CIA
-- a most convenient bugbear.  Just as soon as the unnamed ghost writer cracks
the mystery, he's run down and killed in the street by a mysteriously summoned
agency vehicle. Ewan McGregor is convincing as the naive ghost, Jim Broadbent
is wonderfully malevolent as the string-puller behind the scenes, and Olivia
Williams steals the show as the intelligent angry betrayed wife the English PM.
But it's pure Polanski from start to finish.

In Shakespeare's Macbeth, the reign of the usurping tyrant is preceded and
succeeded by the benign and holy kings Duncan and Malcolm. In Polanski's 1977
Macbeth (in my opinion one of the few great Shakespeare movies), there's an
appended anti-Shakespearean coda: Donalbain (Malcolm's younger brother) goes off
to engage the witches. Polanski suggests that evil is not anomalous to the reign
of Macbeth but eternal and, so to speak, normal. The witches who control men's
fates are the medieval Scotland analogues of the CIA.

In Polanski's best film, Chinatown, J. J. Gittes is the naif who gradually
comes to discover that villainous Noah Cross controls all of Los Angeles.
Semi-demonic Noah takes bullet but like the witches and the CIA, he can't be
killed. In the original Robert Towne screenplay, Evelyn Mulwray had escaped with
her daughter/sister, but Polanski altered the ending to emphasize Noah Cross's
unassailable power.

And then there's Rosemary's Baby (witches) and The Pianist (Nazis).

Polanski's point of view cannot be a surprise to anyone who is familiar with the
story of his life.

Title: Nugget-Watching
Date: January 02, 2012

This year's Nuggets are now at 3-2 and each game has been worth watching.
Because there are no superstars, there's a different plot every game. The ball
moves and doesn't stop as when, in the old day, it came into the hands of
Carmelo, or, even worse, The Answer. Everyone plays defense; everyone runs,
almost everyone gets into the game. Arron Affalo is the key, I think, because
he sets the example of constant effort. As soon as he gets into better shape,
and his three starts to fall, he'll be even better. Lawson is fearless and
swift as an arrow and he's become adept at pocket-picking. Andre Miller is a
player to identify with: he can't run, can't jump, has no range, has no weight-
room/steroid muscles and his mid-range is more of a leaner than a jumper, but
he's smart, resourceful, tricky, and throws a better alley-oop than anyone in
the league. He's the kind of steadyEddie you want to be in there for the last
five minutes. Al Harrington, who was injured and out of shape last year, has
come back strong and is now a classic sixth-man-scorer-off-the-bench-instant-
offense-go-to-guy. The Birdman is as erratic as all get out but he remembers
to swat a couple away every game. Unfortunately, he's mutilated his body to
the point that any person of aesthetic sensibility must fast-forward through
his foul shots. The furriners give the team great balance (and because they're
untattooed, provide a welcome relief for the eyes.) Gallinari, the Italian,
shows great promise, especially when he goes to the rim with two-handed
authority. When Nene, from Brazil, plays up to his ability, he's sensational,
and the more time he gets at PF the happier he'll be, which is why it's crucial
that Timofey Mozgov, the massive Russian center. learns to move his feet and
avoid the fouls. Mozgov will improve as the season progresses. Rudy Fernandez,
the lone Spaniard, plays good man D., but won't make a real contribution until
the outside shots start to fall. And then there's the half-Greek 7-footer, Kosta
Koufos, who plays with great enthusiasm.

Not to mention Kenneth Faried, college rebounding sensation, who's chomping at
the bit, waiting for one of the regulars to go down.

Other reasons to watch the Nugs: no J. R. Smith (a most talented nutcase),
no Kenyon Martin (effective on D but always borderline thuggish, and with
the ugliest no-spin set shot ever); no Carmelo playing matador. Addition by
subtraction.

It's a short long season, ths year. Stay healthy, guys.

Title: Bird, Bigbird, and Little
Date: January 05, 2012

One high noon, many years ago, when I was myself barely fledged, and was an
undergraduate at a "large Eastern university,"  I spotted three well-known
members of the humanities faculty on the hunt for lunch. They were Ephim
Fogel, David Grossvogel, and Don Kleine. An unforgettable assemblage!  Fogel,
Grossvogel and Kleine, I thought -- sounds like the name of a law firm invented
by Tom Pynchon.

I had not reflected on this  -- to me  -- amusing incident until this week,
when I was reading the bird book that I mentioned in a previous post. There I
discovered that the largest known bird was the recently extinct elephant bird,
a distant Madagascan cousin of the ostrich, which stood 10 feet tall and tipped
the scale at 880 pounds. Its eggs were 3 feet in circumference and would have
provided three chicken-size egg omelets for about 55 people. I also learned that
the smallest bird is the bee hummingbird which the calipers says is two inches
long and which weighs .06 of an ounce. Its egg is the size of a pea, which means
than it would take a small flock of hummingbirds many days to make me a decent
breakfast.

Here's a bee hummingbird:

Title: Cymbeline at the Barrow Street Theatre
Date: January 19, 2012

I have a sour relationship with "the stage" -- and especially with staged
Shakespeare plays. The theatre and I just don't get along. I think it's because
my expectations are too grand. When I go to the theatre, I want to be ravished,
but more often I'm bored, or worse than bored, embarrassed. I long to laugh, to
cry, to be transported --but instead, I find myself to be entirely too conscious
of the efforts and the contrivances of directors and designers and actors.
Moreover, how am I supposed to achieve ecstasy when the guy in the next seat is
snuffling and fidgeting and making inappropriate sounds at the wrong moments.
And besides, I probably know more about the Shakespeare play that I'm watching
than my comrades in the audience and I have opinions about what the play is
supposed to mean and how it should be performed, and so I become intolerant
and over-critical. And when one is busy criticizing, and one misses one's
inexplicably-deleted favorite lines, one has strayed from the path that leads to
rapture. When I sit still and concentrate on the book, I can achieve moments of
private transcendence. When I'm at the theatre, the theatre gets in my way.

Despite all, I went to see ("hear," Elizabethans would say) Cymbeline at the
Barrrow Street Theatre and, I joyfully confess, had a good time. Cymbeline isn't
performed much and I had never seen it done (except for the pedestrian BBC-TV
version, which doesn't count). I was in doubt whether such a long, complex,
plot-heavy play could be performed. But the young Barrow Street people were
earnest and enthusiastic and pretty and well-rehearsed. Their Cymbeline was
swiftly-paced and offered some delightful moments. I was genuinely impressed.

But I was not satisfied. I was not transported.

Was it a problem with the delivery, or was it the fault of the listeners, that
when Imogen learns that her husband/lover Posthumus Leonatus is at Milford
Haven, and cries out, "O for a horse with wings," the audience laughed. Oh,
please, audience, don't laugh, and please, actors, don't play it for laughs.
Imogen's imaginative expression is designed to capture her frustrated yearning
for the mate from whom she has been forcibly separated and to express all the
sexual longing of vibrant youth. She's head over heels in love and she's not
making a joke of it.  A "horse with wings" is not a piece of grotesquerie, as
the audience and the actors seemed to assume -- it's simply the fastest means of
transport that anyone could imagine until 200 years after Cymbeline was written,
when engineers started to play with the idea of a steam-driven engine. I so much
wanted  last night's Imogen to express, with that line, the kind of emotion
that brings me to tears in my study. But alas.

And similarly, when Imogen and Posthumus are reconciled at last, and they
embrace (an act that the  the audience has been anticipating for hours),
Posthumus is given the most poetically resonant line in the play. "Hang there,"
he says, "like fruit, my soul,/ Til the tree die." The line, compact of images,
is just outside our easy comprehension, but we know at a minimum that trees take
a very long time to die and that Posthumus and Imogen are now linked into one
soul and that Imogen is like "fruit" in the sense of sweetness and juiciness and
fertility -- indeed the ramifying plot has found its way to fruition. And so has
the chain of imagery that began in the first moments of the play, when Imogen
told us that her father, "like the tyrannous breathing of the north/ Shakes
all our buds from growing." It took five acts, but those blighted buds finally
ripened. I'm sorry to say that in the Barrow Street version, this touchstone
of poetry was not emphasized but swallowed; if you weren't waiting for the
line, you would have missed it entirely. Another moment of potential ecstasy
surrendered.

But in all honesty, I must admit that if the players had paused to underline
the sentence, I would probably be complaining that they treated the poetry too
"poetically" and too portentously. Shakespeare is hard to play, and I'm hard to
please.

But I'm not principally concerned that the Barrow boys and girls misread or
neglected a line here or there. I'm concerned about their big compromise.

While enjoying the first four acts, I could not help but wonder how six
performers on a rudimentary stage were going to deal with the theophany in the
fifth act, when Jupiter himself descends from above on the back of an eagle
and tells the audience not to worry, that everything is going to work out just
fine. The scene is the most important in the play and it's what distinguishes
Cymbeline from Shakespeare's earlier and easier and more-easily-performed
comedies. But the theophany is hard, and hard to explain, and also, I'm sure,
expensive. In my view, Barrow Street should have pulled the goalie and thrown a
hail Mary downfield; lay it all out there. But instead, they took an intentional
pass. O my gosh! they took a razor to the entire business. No Jupiter, no
eagle, no wondrous, mystical, symbolic appearance of Posthumus's lost family,
no soothsayer, no riddle, and therefore, I'm sorry to say, no enchantment and
no miracle. No miracle, no Cymbeline, at least no Cymbeline as it is known and
loved by such as I.

Here's what I think happens in Cymbeline. For four and a half acts, human
beings make a mess of things. The king is blinded by uxoriousness, the queen
is a machiavellia, Posthumus is vain, Cloten is simply stupid. The characters
tie themselves into plot knots and everyone is deceived in part or in whole
(although Shakespeare witholds nothing from the audience). Cymbeline thinks his
sons are lost, Posthumus thinks Imogen is dead, Lucius Brutus thinks Imogen is
a boy, Imogen thinks that Posthumus has been beheaded, and so on. Everyone is
wrong; no one knows the whole truth.

And then comes the miracle. Jupiter descends, and 20, or 21, or 22 (depending on
who's counting) mistakings are unravelled in five amazing, astounding minutes.
Cymbeline is a tragedy for four and half acts and a comedy at the end. And
should be played so. Take away Jupiter and take away the miracle. A play about
human folly and divine intervention becomes nothing more than Twelfth Night or
As You Like It. which is not a bad thing to be, but not what Shakespeare was
doing in 1610. It's like scissoring Marina's magical virginity out of Pericles,
or Hermione's rebirth out of The Winter's Tale, or Prospero's magic out of The
Tempest. It's not right. It undervalues a most thrilling, most remarkable piece
of writing. Even those of us who don't believe in miracles want to believe in
Shakespeare's miracles.

But -- the Barrow Street guys and gals inspired me to re-read Cymbeline, and,
all alone, just me and my Kindle, I once again indulged my ecstasy. So thank
you.

Next summer's vegetable seeds have arrived in the mail. Hard choices; the
gardening will is infinite and the execution confined; which is to say that
there just isn't enough room to grow all the varieties we'd want. But in
addition to the old reliables, we try to make room for some exotics and
antiques. This year:   two kinds of heirloom tomatoes. Rose (an Amish
favorite), and Black Giant. Pasillo Bajio (an intense black hot pepper, for
the pepper- lovers in the family). Ma-Zu Purple Chinese Eggplant, supposedly
a favorite of Taiwanese gardeners. Black Beauty Zucchini. Suyo Long Cucumbers
("very mild and sweet"). Romanesco Italia Broccoli ("spiralling apple-green
heads"). Ching Chong Bok Choy, an early, cold-weather kind. Russian Red (some
call it Ragged Jack) kale. Two kinds of beets: Albino, a Dutch variety, and
Crapaudine, unfortunately named, but supposedly the oldest beet still in
cultivation. And also carrots, so easy to grow in our rich sandy soil, both a
new variety (Cosmic Purple) and an old one (Jaune Obtuse du Doubs, a French
carrot which dates to 1894).

It's going to be a good summer. We're in the midst of a January snowstorm right
now, but I can imagine myself tilling in a load of manure, raking up, and
setting out the stakes and twine. It's going to be a good summer.

Title: My Mysterious Uncle Max
Date: February 11, 2012

Who knows what crimes or dark deeds my black-sheep Uncle Max had committed that
made made him such a pariah in our o-so-respectable family, but they must have
been something awful. Although he was my father's older brother, his name was
never mentioned except with embarrassment or distaste.

Inasmuch as I'm now the "patriarch," it's time to get the family stuff on the
record for the benefit of the kids, the grandkids, and the extended mishpucha.
So here's all I know about my mysterious uncle. Spoiler alert: it doesn't add up
to villainy.

Max was the oldest of the four (Sol, Mollie, and Mannie succeeded him). He would
have been born about 1895, just about the time the family escaped the Ukraine
for the Lower East Side. He studied at Albany State Teachers College for a
while, but I don't think he earned a degree. He lived in Paris during the 1920s
and perhaps 1930s. He was invited to but did not attend my parents' wedding. He
was divorced (a source of immeasurable shame in those years). My mother said,
"Uncle Max is very selfish." There was something shady about the way he made his
living, but I don't know the details, except that, for a while, he ghost-wrote
doctoral dissertations. He lived with a woman to whom he wasn't married. He died
of a heart attack during the 1950s.

I met him three times. Once, he came to a family gathering, My father wouldn't
speak to him. Another time he paid a weekday afternoon call to our East 9 Street
home. I found him in the kitchen talking with my mother: "This is your Uncle
Max." And then, when I was thirteen, he called and asked if he could take me to
the finals of the NCAA basketball tournament at Madison Square Garden. After
a lot of discussion and negotiation, I was allowed to meet him at the arena.
Max was a small man, hard of hearing, and very ordinary.  He tried hard to be
congenial. He told me that he had taken "Robert" as a middle name. Frankly, he
seemed no more menacing or odd than any other of my uncle-ry or than other men
of his generation. What else do I remember of that evening?  During the game,
an errant pass hit off a player's head and bounced into the basket.

I never saw Max again.

And yet my father once confessed to me that he told Max that "if he ever did
that again, I'd kill him." My father, mildest of men, threatened someone with
violent death?  Because he did what?  Dad wouldn't say.

Here's a spooky story, and I'm going to tell it exactly the way it happened, no
embroidery or exaggeration. On the night of my father's funeral, my brothers
and I and our wives gathered around the formica kitchen table in the old house.
Uncle Max's name came up. I said, "I know the name of the woman who he lived
with." "What is it?"  "It's Sarah Clyne, spelled with a C and a Y." There was
a Manhattan telephone book (five inches thick and at least two thousand pages).
I picked up the book and it fell open. I put my finger on a name. The name was
Sarah Clyne. "I said, did you see what happened?  I just opened the book at
random and my finger fell on the name Sarah Clyne, Max's lady. It seems like a
sign that I should call her."

But I didn't.

Here's the only picture of Max of which I have knowledge. He's with "little
grandma." The picture is taken in front of 334 Eastern Parkway in Brooklyn.

Title: Mannahatta
Date: February 13, 2012

Eric Sanderson's Mannahatta (New York: Abrams, 2009) reconstructs Manhattan as
it would have appeared to Henry Hudson when he sailed the Half-Moon into the
harbor in 1609. The glory of the book lies in its illustrations.  Here's a
conjectural reconstruction of old Manhattan island:

And here's a clever juxtaposition of ancient and modern:

In 1609, the island of Manhattan was home to between 400 and 1000 Lenape
Indians. They lived on fish, shellfish (leaving behind extensive middens), deer
and other wildlife, on fruits and berries. They practiced some small-scale
farming of corn, squash, and beans. Sanderson estimates that the Lenape had
lived on Manhattan for 10,000 years, or 400 generations.

Why so few people? The land was fertile, the seas abundant, the weather
not particularly harsh. While the Lenape sat still in Manhattan, advanced
civilizations were created by the Mayans, the Aztecs and the Incas. Along the
banks of the Mississippi, the city of Cahokia rose and fell. And yet the Lenape
never domesticated a single animal beside the dog and left behind no pottery,
weaving, or metals. They remained stuck in the paleolithic. Why, I wonder.
Perhaps things were too good.

On the other hand, the Lenape lived in harmony with the island for a very
long time. What are the odds that our present civilization, which has totally
transformed Manhattan in 400 short years, or just 16 generations, will last one
tenth as long?

February 24:  Still curious about the want of population growth or
technological development among the Lenape, I read C. A. Weslager's The Delaware
Indians, A History (1972) (Lenapes were called by their Anglo name, Delaware,
for many years). Wenslager does not suggest that the Lenape ever achieved
larger populations. Nor does he point to any archeological evidence of cultural
achievement. Still, I'm mildly suspicious that there may be more to the story. 
We know that Verrazzano contacted the Lenapes 90 years before Hudson sailed into
the harbor, and no one knows what diseases he might have introduced.

I have to admit that I'm thoroughly taken with the Jeremy Lin story. It's so
wonderfully, ridiculously improbable. Asian-American guy, Harvard!! economics
grad, plays OK with the Erie Bayhawks and the Reno Bighorns but is released by
two not-so-strong NBA teams. A last-resort number 4 point guard on the Knicks,
sleeping on a couch in his brother's apartment, he comes off the bench to lead
the worst team in the league to five straight wins, drops 38 on Kobe and the
Lakers, etc. etc. Tyson Chandler, grumpy all season long, is now smiling. It's
not just Frank Merriwell; it's everyone's secret dream. And a morality play to
boot-- keep trying, persevere, trust your own abilities, take advantage of the
opportunities. An inspiration and a message in the same package.

It can't last. JLin can't keep on averaging 27/8. The Knicks will eventually
lose (though let's hope not tonight against shakey Toronto). One of those top
point-guard defenders, such as Avery Bradley, is going to eat him alive one of
these days. But he's the real deal and if he stays healthy, remains coachable,
works on his three and on his left hand, he could have a great, historic career.

Meanwhile, it's absolutely fascinating. Ama're returns tonight; that should be
easy. The test will come when Carmelo's groin heals. Can Lin and Anthony work
and play well together? I'll be watching.

And congratulations to Tommie Amaker, Lin's Harvard coach; he's got to be one
heck of a proud guy.

Another person who's mighty happy: David Stern, who's been struggling to get a
toehold for the NBA in the world's largest untapped market.

Title: Idiot or Hypocrite? Your Choice.
Date: February 14, 2012

Today it's Santorum, who has staked out positions to the right of the Pope,
where there isn't all that much room. Yesterday it was Gingrich. Before that,
in their turn, Perry, Cain, Bachmann.  Each month brings a new anti-Romney and
just as inevitably, his/her decline.

The extremists who control the Republican party want a candidate who is
strictly, or extremely, or "severely" conservative and who can still appear sane
enough to be elected.

But it can't be done.  It's a hunt that's doomed to come up empty.

The "base," whether fundamentalist or libertarian or drown-the-government-in-
the-bathtub, has established a series of tests which make it impossible for
their candidate to be both sane and sincere. There can be no such animal.

The candidate must reject evolution and profess to believe in some variety of
creationism.

He must believe, or profess to believe, that global warming is a hoax --
a conspiracy theory devised by geologists and meteorologists and climate
historians. The candidate must be profoundly anti-science and anti-rational.

He must believe in some variety of "trickle-down economics," even though several
rounds of tax cuts have benefited the rich at the expense of everyone else. (It
hasn't been trickle down, it's been gush up.) He must believe that any attempt
to remedy the situation is "class warfare." And he must also believe that it's
no problem that the richer are getting out-of-control richer and the poor are
becoming poorer and more numerous.

He must believe that the mortgage crisis and the recession was caused by quasi-
government entities like Fannie and Freddie and not by the speculations and
peculations of de-regulated banks and brokers.

He must believe that the solution to the problem of illegal immigration is to
build a larger, taller wall, even though for every wall there's a ladder and
that there's not a leaf of lettuce that would be harvested or a roof patched in
all of America without undocumented labor.

He must believe that gay people are gay by choice and aren't entitled to equal
status under the law. How do they know? The bible tells them so.

They must profess to believe that the invasion of Iraq, the worst foreign policy
blunder in our history, was a good idea.

And they must believe that Barack Obama fronts a socialist-secular conspiracy,
other members of which are the press, the universities, and the "elite," who
want more than anything else to take away their guns.

Does this sorry bunch of Republican candidates believe all this nonsense, or do
they pander to the base? Are they idiots or are they liars?  Fools or knaves?
We report, you decide.

As a boy, I naturally assumed that Riis Park was named for Harold (Peewee).
Later, I learned that Jacob Riis was a well-known reformer whose 1890 book, How
the Other Half Lives, a chronicle of life in New York's slums, shocked  Gilded
Age complacency. Nowadays, Riis is known more for his pioneering photography
than for his writing.  Here are three of his images:

The young lady on the left is known to history simply as "Katie." When Riis
asked her what she did, she replied, "I scrubs." She was a laundress. She was
nine years old.

I've now read a adulatory life of Jacob Riis by Tom Buk-Swienty. I learned that
one of the worst New York slums, Mulberry Bend, had a population density of
2,047 per acre. Fifty per cent of Mulberry Bend's children died before their
fifth birthday. Every year, about 100 Manhattan infants were found dead in the
streets. In addition, another 500 children were abandoned by their parents. I
also learned that in 1883, when Cornelius Vanderbilt moved into his new chateau
on the corner of Fifth Avenue and 52nd Street, he threw a housewarming ball for
1200 guests. "$155,730 was spent on costumes alone."

Title: De Sternuente, or, Of Sneezing
Date: February 24, 2012

I enjoy fighting off a sneeze. It takes practice and concentration. When the
sneeze urge emerges, without warning, the battle is joined. On the side of
the sneeze -- dust or some other foreign particles passing through the nasal
hairs, reaching  the nasal mucosa, releasing a flood of histamines which
irritate the nerve cells and signal the brain to stimulate the trigeminal
network and activate the pharyngeal and tracheal muscles, producing a noisy,
100-mile-an- hour blast of microbes and snot. On the side of restraint --
nothing but enormous personal discipline and the desire not to surrender to
animal nature. There are some, who are less committed to mind-over-body, who
employ the fingertips to pinch the end of the nose, or, alternatively, who press
a knuckle against the philtrum, the infranasal depression which Shakespeare,
curiously, called "the valley" -- but frankly, when it comes to resisting
sternutation, digital success is only half a loaf. It's far more rewarding to
think one's way to a rare victory in the lifelong sneezomachia. Not to sneeze is
a triumph of the will.

Which is not to assert that a good sneeze gives no pleasure, if a person would
give oneself over to it. It's simply that the sneeze, especially one of the
window-rattling variety, is entirely anarchic and inartistic, which might be
why there is so slight a sneeze literature. Although hard to believe, it's a
fact that Puck is the only character in all of Shakespeare's plays who deigns
to mention the sneeze, but he weakens its disruptive force by employing the
archaism "neeze." The best-known literary sneeze (or, at least, the only one
that now comes to mind) occurs in Pope's Rape of the Lock, when Belinda,
ravished by Sir Plume's "glittering forfex," throws snuff in the baron's nose.
Immediately "with starting tears each eye o'erflows,/ And the high dome re-
echoes to his nose."

Snuff artificially stimulates sneezing, which may or may not be be why Michael,
Tsar of all the Russians, proposed amputating the noses of snuffers. Michael's
contemporary, Pope Urban VIII, merely threatened excommunication. Some say that
the practice of saying "God bless you" to sneezers originated with Pope Gregory
the Great, and has to do with the superstition that the soul leaves the sneezing
body, perhaps nasally.

Why is it that no one ever says "God bless you" to farters, who are as much in
need of divine intervention as sneezers. Society demands that farting, though
shameful (and belching, though comic), should be controlled; sneezing is, except
for the most determined among us, uncontrollable.

Title: Amnesia on Film: Spellbound (1945)
Date: February 25, 2012

In Alfred Hitchcock's Spellbound (1945), man suffers traumatic shock, man loses
memory, man relives experience and regains memory. It's garden-variety Hollywood
amnesia, hortus hollywoodiensis. The amnesia is neither credible nor possible,
but it doesn't matter, because it's the world of film, where the most malleable
of mental afflictions takes whatever form is convenient for the writer or
director or the presiding mogul.

John Ballantine, played by handsome young Gregory Peck is the amnesiac and the
questions the movie poses are, when will he recover his memory, how much help
he will require from luscious psychoanalyst Ingrid Bergman, and how many times
he can he whine "I can't remember" and still get the girl. Bergman has a more
complex problem: how to be a smart and also a real woman (always a problem in
Hitchcock's wonderful world of misogyny). She makes use of that old dodge, a
pair of glasses; when they're off, she's feminine, but when she dons them,
she's intelligent. When did Hollywood decided that eyeglasses were a symbol for
brains?

But if she has brains, why is she attracted to a man who doesn't know who he is
but is convinced that he might be a murderer. It's as though the film itself
doesn't take amnesia seriously and treats it as a plot-device rather than the
distressing disorder that it would be to an actual sufferer.

It's a silly but engaging movie, perhaps too much of an advertisement for
psychoanalysis -- which it endorses without a shred of skepticism. I suspect
that the psychoanalytic themes, which haven't fared at all well these seventy
years, will eventually doom the movie to oblivion.

There are some tense echt-Hitchcock moments when it appears that the amnesiac
might be dangerous, but Peck and Bergman are just too pretty to be killer and
victim.

Title: Fun with Aspirin
Date: February 28, 2012

I like to think that I have a sense of humor, but I just don't get this one-
liner by Rick Santorum's Daddy Warbucks, Foster Friess. "And this contraceptive
thing, my gosh, it's so--it's such--inexpensive, you know, back in my days, they
used Bayer Aspirin for contraception. The gals put it between their knees and it
wasn't that costly." So what's funny here? If the "gals" keep an aspirin between
their knees, they can't have sex and therefore can't get pregnant? Is that it?
Is that The Joke?

First of all, let's all chip in to send FF a copy of the Kama Sutra (or even
an elementary how to do it manual), where he can find some exotic and some
extremely obvious positions in which women can get pregnant and still keep their
knees together.

But why aspirin? Why Bayer aspirin? What do I not understand? Why an aspirin
between the knees rather than, say, a bible?  Or a book by Newt Gingrich? Or a
copy of the The Joy of Sex.

Foster Friess says all this aspirin fun took place "back in my day." I would
like to say that FF is a year younger than I, and that I a) never heard the joke
(if it's a joke) back then, and b) never heard tell of a single woman who used
knee-aspirin as a contraceptive.

I did some internet research on the aspirin-contraceptive connection and
discovered that there's a story going around in high schools that taking three
aspirin and drinking a Coke before intercourse will prevent conception. Advice
to young people: do not bank on it.

Will the Santorum administration, immediately upon taking office in 2013, ban
aspirin?

Title: Youth and Age -- Tennyson's Ulysses
Date: March 09, 2012

It wasn't until I reached college that discovered poetry. My comic-book
super- hero and baseball-infused brain was until then, poetry-wise, an almost
complete tabula rasa. I say "almost" because at eight or nine eight years
old I had memorized two great classics of American literature: "Casey at the
Bat" and also the poem by Grantland Rice about Tinkers, Evers, and Chance. In
additon, I knew the ubiquitous stercoraceous distich the first line of which
is "Here I sit, broken-hearted" and a related gnomic verse that begins, "No
matter how much you wiggle and dance." Then in 1956 I left Flatbush for
higher education and took a course in English Literature. The rest, as they
say, is history. It was sonnets and love poems of any kind, and rich luscious
liquid poems by Marlowe and Keats and Hopkins that entranced me. The more
intellectual poems were too taxing for my immature head. Lycidas, which
I now know to be the best poem in the language, was utterly impenetrable
for at least a decade, although I admit that I immediately responded to its
music: "With nectar pure his oozy locks he laves."

One of my teachers sagely observed that certain poets and certain poems were
for youth, some for maturity, and some for old age. "You may no longer like
then what you like now." Which has come to pass. And as an example of poetry
for the latter years, he adduced Tennyson's "Ulysses." "This poem may not mean
much to you now, but it will some day, if you live long enough." I remember
that I was much taken with the touchstone line "Far on the ringing plains of
windy Troy" but I thought that "Ulysses" was far too much about a really old
guy trying to cheer himself up and I did not see it holding a place in any
future I could envision.

Well, folks, I've now arrived at the so-called golden years, or, more properly,
the endgame, or extra innings (which in some sports is called sudden death) and
guess what? "Ulysses" has returned, front and center, exactly as was predicted
50+ years ago. It's right on target.

Tennyson's Ulysses is Homer's adventurer a generation older, kinging it in
Ithaca, but bored, unchallenged, and unstimulated. "It little profits that an
idle king,/ By this still hearth, among these barren crags,/ Matched with an
aged wife, I mete and dole/ Unequal laws unto a savage race,/ That hoard and
sleep, and feed,/ And know not me."

To put it vulgarly, Ulysses plans to bust out of the old folks home. He's
been a warrior, a hero, and a roving explorer. He "cannot rest from
travel." He needs to search "beyond the utmost bound of human
thought." He leaves Penelope, and he leaves the government of Ithaca to his
bureaucratically-minded  son Telemachus. The last lines of the poem, the
leave-taking, are most stirring:

Come, my friends

"Tis not too late to seek a newer world.

Push off, and sitting well in order smite

The sounding furrows; for my purpose holds

To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths

Of all the western stars, until I die.

It may be that the gulfs will wash us down:

It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles,

And see the great Achilles, whom we knew.

Though much is taken, much abides,

And though we are not now that strength which in old days

Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are;

One equal temper of heroic hearts

Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will

To strive to seek, to find, and not to yield.

Yes, I know -- the diction is a little antiquated and artificial, the urge to
get away a trifle too vehement. But nevertheless I'm moved by the resilience,
the perserverance. Though tear-inducing, the poem is anything but lachrymose.
And it's accepting: "that which we are, we are."

It's lately become the fashion to interpret "Ulysses" as a poem about
capitalism and imperialism. In this reading, Ulysses is just another white male,
off to conquer and colonialize The Alien Other. Or to see it as a poem about
male priviliege: he's a bad husband, abandoning the family. Or to conceive
the poem as a structure of ironies, in which Ulysses doesn't realize that he
undermines his own suppositions. There's a tad of truth in these arguments, as
there always is, because Tennyson was caught up in a Victorian striving that he
didn't fully or consciously assimilate. But frankly, I feel sorry for readers
who can't hear the verve and excitement in Ulysses's expansive view of things.

Moreover, it turns out that Tennyson was absolutely correct to proclaim
that there is a time in life when "not to yield" is an act of daily heroism.

Title: Libraries in My Life
Date: March 16, 2012

I can't remember a time when I wasn't at home in a library. Although very much
a schoolyard urchin, passionate about baseball, trading cards and punchball (or
any kind of game played with a spaldeen), I rarely failed my weekly trip to the
storefront Avenue J branch of the BPL, where there were cases upon half-height
cases of juvenile and later "young adult" books. I read like a hungry larva,
without direction or discrimination. A few years later, when I reached Erasmus
Hall, my after-school employment was to shelve books at 75 cents an hour at
the BPL branch at McDonald Avenue (accumulating the $900 which paid my full
first- year tuition at Cornell). I not only mastered the Dewey Decimal System
but also absorbed everything that the library had to offer in the 612.6 area
of knowledge. At college, I was dazzled by McGraw, my first real library. In
my senior year, I was granted a stack pass, and therefore was able to waste
many hours not only in aimless browsing, but also lolling in long by-passed and
superseded libraries-within-the-library. I doubt that those most pleasant out-
of-the-way nineteenth-century nooks and corners survived modernization, more's
the pity. Later, in Cambridge, it was first Widener (where genuine incunabula
sat unprotected on the shelves), then Houghton, my first experience with rare
books, which, I discovered, are to be savored not only with the eyes, but with
the fingertips and the nose. Thence to Colorado, where, without the resources
of a major library, I dutifully read STC books on microfilm -- which made me
queasy, or on microfiche -- which produced genuine nausea. In 1976-77, I spent
one day a week at the British Library, studying sometimes in the old circular
reading room, where on downpour days buckets were distributed around the room
to deal with the leaks, and at other times in the North Library, where I read
big hunks of the perpetually exciting Thomason Tracts. In the early 80s, I
was able to enjoy the Huntington in San Marino, where the highlight of the
day was lunchtime among the exotic cacti and succulents. Later, at the Folger
Shakespeare Library in Washington, I found not only an unequalled trove of books
and mss., but also camaraderie with similarly-obsessed specialists. There was
always someone who could answer the obscurest of questions, and there were even
a few times when I was able to return the favor. At a cafeteria lunch, once, I
asked (faux-naively) "what do we do with the orts?" and everyone at the table
knew exactly what I meant -- orts the word that Shakespeare used in Troilus and
Cressida to refer to the uneaten portions of a meal.

Now I've come full circle and the Boulder Public is my three-times-a-week
destination. Not great holdings, but through the miracle of an efficient
interlibrary loan system, and supplemented by googlebooks and other electronic
resources, I can find enough to satisfy my unsteady, dilettante brain.

Title: Seventeen Hours of Downton Abbey
Date: March 18, 2012

I've now sometimes zoomed but sometimes plodded through seventeen hours of
Downton Abbey. The series is lovely to look at but also at various times
lugubrious, false, and shamelessly gimmicky -- but apparently I'm easily
seduced. Let me confess: I fell for it, mostly, but always against my better
judgment. Let's face it, the primitive parts of my brain simply overwhelmed
my higher critical faculties. I laughed and cried, even when I knew that I was
being cheated and manipulated.

My favorite parts: Mr. Pamuk and his Nelson Rockefeller departure ("he came,
and went)," which took me totally by surprise, as did Anna's and Lady Grantham's
resourceful disposal of the corpse. Lady Sybil as a nurse, in part because
she was doing useful work for the first time in her pampered life, and in
part because she looked so fetching in the uniform. My favorite performers --
Maggie Smith, reprising her role in Gosford Park (a much superior great house
fiction), and Mr Carson's eyebrows, perpetually raised in shock at modern
shenanigans.

The series is pure, undiluted soap. It is also, as they used to say
in Variety, a "costumer." Query -- would I have spent seventeen hours
watching a television program set in a mansion in Dubuque, Iowa, in 2012 in
which a soldier returns paralyzed from the wars and miraculously regains his
mobility, where terrible culinary disasters occur because the cook almost goes
blind, where granny shows her goodwill by losing a flower show, in which the
family is traumatized when a daughter runs off with the chauffeur, or where a
presumably innocent servant is sentenced to death for the murder of his wayward
wife. I don't think so. I would have said, "cornball soap opera" and clicked
back to the NBA. Or to the advertisements for zirconite jewelry. And yet I went
on. And on. And continued on even after Downton Abbey not only jumped the shark
but vaulted the great white whale, Moby Dick himself, when it introduced into
the plot a bout of supposed amnesia. Amnesia! Is there anything soapier?

Or perhaps my reluctant fascination proves that the traditional formulas
retain their power. Here's a formula of comedy: "artificial difficulties
overcome." In Downton Abbey, Lady Mary and Matthew are destined for one
another, and every viewer knows it, even as steaming piles of artificial
difficulties are strewn and heaped in their path. Shakespeare could slice
through the impediments in two hours traffic on the stage, but here it's
seventeen anguished hours until heir and heiress finally figure it out. And
here's another formula of comedy: always bring it to conclusion with a feast
and a dance. They did, and, sucker that I am, I was elated. Even though I saw
the scam coming a mile down the o-so- picturesque road

Title: Wrapped in Caul Fat?  Don't Tell Me!
Date: March 19, 2012

Our peaceful town, not long ago provincial and off-the-track, has now become
molto trendy. Only a generation ago, we were bland, undistinguished, white-
bread; and now we're America's happiest city, America's slimmest city, America's
healthiest city, and, just recently, America's foodiest city.

I'm not the slimmest, nor the happiest, nor the healthiest, so It's embarrassing
for me to live where I fall so far below the standard. When I'm melancholy, I
feel as though I'm a traitor to the common good. And I confess that never even
heard the word "foody" until I read that we were now "foodiest."

I don't usually frequent the expensive new restaurants -- they're too exotic
for my mac-and-cheese palate. But I was taken to one of our fanciest new places
recently and listened in at a conversation between patrons and waiter at the
next table. I transcribe it exactly as it occurred. Honest to Pete.

Patron A:  "I think I'll start with the julienned watermelon radish. Is that
served with tzitziki?"-

Waiter:  "Just a dollop."

Patron B:  "I'll have the hedgehog mushrooms with panko crumbs. Are your
bulgogi sliders marinated or grilled?"

Waiter:  "Marinated, then lightly grilled. Then dusted with sudachi zest."

Patron: A:  "I think I'll also have the clear gel of agar and turnip puree with
chestnut crumbs. Are your chestnut crumbs domestic or foreign?"

Waiter:  "I believe they're Italian."

Patron B:  "I see that you have coconut tofu cream. Do you serve that
separately, or with the grapefruit curd marscapone?"

Waiter:  "I believe that the chef likes to combine it with the date marmalade
and harissa."

Patron A:  "For a main dish, I'll have the lamb en crepinette. To Patron B
(aside whispering):  "Roasted in caul fat."

Patron B (aside, annoyed):  "I know that. (To the waiter):  I think I'll go
with the squid ink and hot sesame oil soup."

Waiter:  "Excellent choice, madam."

Patron B:  "And then the braised rabbit with lobster knuckles and pil-pil dill.
Is your pil-pil wild or domestic?'

Waiter:  "Wild, certainly."

Patron B:  "And along with that, I'd like a side of pickled ramps and fermented
garlic, with a poached duck egg."

Patron A: "Waiter, may I change my mind. I think I'd prefer the singed octopus
in almond puree. Or maybe the snails with liquified parsley, or just something
simple, like sea urchin served over discs of scallop with a hamachi and farro
salad."

Patron B: "I think I'll change my order as well. I think I'll go with the
espelettes in pistachio yogurt sauce. Or the veal sweetbreads with sheepmilk
dumplings. Or the okroshka with quail eggs."

The conversation went on like this for ever and ever, and I began to feel myself
out of place, so I left and went up to Marie's in North Boulder and ordered
a hamburger en bun with raw oignon and an old favorite of mine, pomme frites
francaises avec sauce de tomate. It was mighty satisfying.

Title: "Look at Me."
Date: March 28, 2012

On our pleasant, prosperous downtown mall, we have entertainers and buskers
of many stripes --everyone  from fire-eaters, magicians, and left-behind 50s
folkie guitarists to Zip Code Man. Some are excellent (the occasional string
quartet or visiting bluegrass band) and some are horrible (the bam-bam-bam
drummers and the pathetic didgedoorists.

We also have a contortionist, whom I personally find difficult to watch.

To me, the contortionist is not so much an entertainer as he is an allegory of
the human condition. He's what they used to call in earlier centuries an emblem.

While other performers try to attract an audience by subtlety and guile, our
contortionist merely shouts, "Look at me. Everybody, look at me" -- which I
take as a metaphor or icon or emblem. When he calls out, "Look at me," he's
simply doing what the rest of us want to do but don't have the courage to do:
call attention to ourselves, ask for praise. We're all saying, "Look at me,"
but, becaused we're civilized and mannerly beings, we strive to do so by being
indirect or ironic or clever.  Not the contortionist. He's honest about himself
and about the true, elemental state of mankind. He shouts, "Look at me" -- and
then he ties himself into knots.

Title: Why are Dog Owners Such Scofflaws?
Date: March 30, 2012

Why are dog owners such horrid scofflaws?  According to our local police-lady,
there are fifty-three signs distributed around the downtown mall that either
say, in clear language, No Pets, or else picture a dog bisected with a diagonal
line. But it's impossible to take a walk without encountering two or three or
half a dozen people obliviously or defiantly parading Rover or Spot.

I think it's reasonable to assume that the owners can read, or if "No Pets" is
too difficult to construe, that they could interpret the icons. It's possible
that they're just unobservant, and don't notice the signs, but I suspect not.
The signs are hard to miss.

I suspect that the dog people just assume that they're above the law. They love
their pooch, love its barking, love its scat, love the way it playfully lunges
at small children, and they can't imagine that anyone in the world would take
exception to their prerogative.

It's the same on the mountain trails. Just because the sign says, All Dogs Must
Be On Leash, doesn't mean that the law applies to Me.

I once said to a dog owner who was walking his big dogs off-leash, "You know
that you're breaking the law." He barked at me: "Get a life." Another time a
bulldog attacked me on the street, and I was warding him off with my briefcase
when the owner called him back. I said, "Dogs are supposed to be on leash." He
said, "What are you, the dog warden?" A friend was knocked off her bicycle by
a large, aggressive dog. The owner, who should have knelt on ground glass in
apology, said only, "He doesn't like bicycles."

And many other such stories, but you get my point.

Title: Book Report:  Chad Harbach's The Art of Fielding
Date: April 05, 2012

I'm sure that I once before read a book called The Art of Fielding, perhaps
in the 1960s, but it wasn't a baseball novel; it was a old-fashioned critical
monograph about Henry Fielding, the author of Shamela, Joseph Andrews, Tom
Jones, Amelia, and Jonathan Wild. (For what it's worth, Chad Harbach, who
contributed this year's The Art of Fielding, though a skillful plotter, doesn't
have the range or the release or the depth to play in Henry F's league.)

I generally stay away from big-selling first novels. I prefer to let them
marinate for a decade or two, check out their staying power, before I make an
eight-hour commitment (not counting naps) to a 400-pager. It's an economy of my
own: there are too many great old things that I haven't gotten around to yet.
But I must say that Harbach's Fielding, highly recommended by friends, kept me
engaged right down to the last sentence. Plot, plot, plot, is the formula, and
there were enough surprises and twists in the story to keep even a skeptic like
myself turning pages enthusiastically. It's a hybrid novel, a genre-crosser,
with baseball books and academic novels (and a touch of Death in Venice) in its
bloodline.

What's best, beside the surprises in the plotting? The characters, most of
whom defy or challenge stereotypes, what a blessing. What's worst? The style:
not a memorable sentence or turn of phrase in the entire bland (ninth-grade
vocabulary, straight-ahead syntax) book. Most disappointing: the killing off
of an important character just when his situation becomes interesting and
troubling. Harbach, in my opinion, punts just  when he should have pulled the
goalie and swung for the fences.

Title: Amnesia on Film: Somewhere in the Night (1946)
Date: April 06, 2012

Somewhere in the Night is an early Joseph Mankiewicz film noir with amnesia at
its center. George Taylor, an injured ex-Marine played monochromatically by John
Hodiak, returns from the South Pacific not knowing who he is are what he was
--  except that he has a clue that he was on the shady side of the law. There's
an involuted, convoluted and confusing plot that pushes all the noirish buttons:
a chanteuse with a heart of gold and also a dame who's nothing but trouble, a
missing briefcase stuffed with 2 million bucks, a funny farm where a witness
to murder is imprisoned, a cynical police lieutenant, and even a polysyllabic
European gangster who derives from both Sidney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre.
Everything is recycled, and so is the amnesia. George Taylor might  just as
well have been a returning veteran with a perfect memory, or been a gumshoe,
or a shamus and the film would have been just as good (or just as bad). It's
surprising that when the money is recovered and the villains are punished,
George gets the girl but, contrary to precedent, doesn't recover his memory. The
film simply forgets his affliction and leaves him hanging. Perhaps it's romantic
-- after all, if you win the love of the lady, what does memory matter?  Or
perhaps the amnesia is so trivial, so perfunctory, so much a gimmick, that it
can be shunted aside.

Although not a good flim, it's partially redeemed by Richard Conte's turn as a
smarmy nightclub owner, Sheldon Leonard's two minutes as a dumb cuckold, and
Harry Morgan's thirty seconds as a bath attendant. Those guys are genuine pros.

Title: Where Sonia Slept
Date: April 15, 2012

In 1904, at the age of 20, my grandmother Sonia Chafetz Uzilewski (later Green)
disembarked at Ellis Island. Because of her age, and because she lived within
an immigrant community, she never acquired much English, and as a result my
conversations with her were strictly utilitarian. I was curious about the old
country (White Russia, now Belarus) but she spoke little about it and what she
did say was difficult for me to construe. Two pieces of information about her
childhood have stayed with me: first, that in the old country, they brought the
cow into the house in the winter "to keep warm" and secondly, that, as a girl,
she "slept over the fireplace."

I was puzzled. All I could imagine was a house like my own pleasant childhood
home, but with a cow on the carpet and a young lady perched precariously on the
narrow mantle over the fireplace (if we had had a fireplace, which we didn't).
Frankly, I couldn't make much sense out of her story.

It wasn't until I happened to find myself in benighted Lithuania in 2003 that
I figured out the cow-in-the-living-room puzzle. I visited one of those large
open-air museums which are not uncommon in eastern Europe, in which traditional
peasant dwellings, along with churches, mills, foundries, etc. have been 
rescued and sprinkled around a landscape. At such sites, a very common form of
low-end dwelling consists of a barn or animal shelter on the dirt ground floor,
with a wooden second floor for human habitation erected just above. I believe
that when grandma said that they brought the cow into the house, she meant that
they stabled the cow down below, and that some of the heat from the animal
disseminated into the living quarters -- as would, incidentally, some of its
pungent effluvia.

So one problem was solved, but the mantle-sleeping remained a mystery. However,
just this past week the New Yorker featured an essay on traditional Russian
cooking in which there was a paragraph on a long-ago-and-far-away kind of stove.
Here's the pertinent section.

"A traditional Russian kitchen starts with a pech, a huge brick oven with many
winding vents designed to retain the heat from a wood fire. A pech was once
the centerpiece of traditional peasant homes; it took up about a quarter of
the available living space. It heated and ventilated the house, it dried food;
children and the elderly slept on ledges built into it."

"Children and the elderly slept on ledges built into it." Mystery solved!

Sonia told me that she slept over the fire, which I interpreted as a fireplace.
But I was wrong. She slept over the stove. For all I know, she might even have
used the world pech, which I couldn't possibly have translated or understood.

Now I know, that like other children at the very bottom of the nineteenth-
century Russian social ladder, she slept on a ledge built into a pech, with the
cow lowing just a few feet below her.

Need I mention once again how glad I am that she decided to pull up stakes and
head for new world.

More on Sonia Green: here.

Title: La Traviata "Updated"
Date: April 16, 2012

I prefer to hear rather than to see grand opera. The cd and the radio are my
preferred media. Stay at home, sit in a comfortable chair, listen carefully, be
ravished.

When you go to the opera, you re-discover that the plot is all silliness, the
characters incomprehensible, and the intermissions interminable.

Nevertheless, there I was, yesterday, at the Met's HD screening of Verdi's
La Traviata, the most melodic and romantic of operas. The orchestra and the
singing were, as expected, glorious. But the staging was all strained novelty
and misguided cleverness.

Can there be an opera less in need of cross-dressing and a gay subtext that La
Traviata?  Why would anyone want to clothe both the male and female choristers
in severe, gray, men's business suits?  If the story is all about boy-girl
romance and sexual intensity and sexual pleasure, why not encourage the men
and gaily-dressed women to dance and flirt and try to get together after the
downright way of generation?

Opera, when I take the trouble to see it, should be as pleasing to my eye as it
is rewarding to my ear.

But this time, officers of the Metropolitan Opera, I was forced to shut my eyes,
and just listen. It was just like staying at home, except that the chair was
less comfortable.

Addendum:  today I read an interview in the April 26 NYRB with the tenor Jonas
Kaufmann. Here's an excerpt:

"You see, the conductor believes that the audience is only coming to hear
the orchestra and is not interested in the story, the sets, the singers. The
director believes it's an all visual thing. So there is this constant fight over
what each person believes is the most  important part. I've seen semi-staged or
concert performances of operas that were more thrilling than staged ones. Why?
Because it's better to have nothing than to have something so disturbing that it
distracts you from enjoying the music and that doesn't allow the music to create
its magic."

Exactly my point.

I imagine that the "pitch" went something like this:

"Ok, we have the star, Dana Carvey, who's hot right now. He's a funny man. He's
going to play a detective who watches The Maltese Falcon on the tv and thinks
he's Humphrey Bogart. And there's a coin that's worth seven million dollars and
a bunch of guys are after it. But here's the gimmick. Carvey has amnesia and he
doesn't know that he has the coin. And then the real kicker -- not only does he
have amnesia, but he has a kind of amnesia that starts over every time he goes
to sleep, so he doesn't even know what he did yesterday.. Ain't that terrific?"

Well, it must have been terrific, because someone decided to put some money into
the film, and someone managed to persuade James Earl Jones and Michael Gambon to
take supporting roles in this bird-brained turkey.

Did anyone say, "Does amnesia work that way? Is there a kind of amnesia that
begins again every morning."

If they did, I know what the answer would have been. "Who cares? This is not
real amnesia, it's movie amnesia"  --which is, once again, the most malleable
of maladies.

So here's a new genre, the amnesiac-gumshoe farce. A small, unpromising genre.

It's an unfunny movie that hovers between D (for dumb) minus and F (phony). I
doubt anyone's ever heard of it, except for hardcore amnesia fans. And even they
were disappointed.

Title: Bringing Ourselves Up to Date on the Subject of Abkhazian Consonants
Date: April 20, 2012

Abkhazian has fifty-eight consonants. By contrast, English, a language which
is not consonant-poor, has twenty-three: the ones for which there are the
alphabetic letters such as b, d, f, etc. plus sh, ch, dz, ng, the occasional
trilled r, and the two sounds that are indicated by th (voiced in 'soothe' and
unvoiced in 'sooth'). Twenty-three consonants can make an infinite number of
words; fifty-eight consonants are more than a mouthful. How can the human speech
apparatus produce so many distinguishable sounds?  "By utilizing all points of
articulation from the lips back to the larynx," says an Abhakazian linguist, and
"by associating with plain consonants such secondary features as labialization,
palatalisation, and pharyngalisation." More simply, everywhere that tongue,
lips, teeth, palate, or throat can either stop the flow of air or allow air to
pass through must be put into play. Moreover, If I understand correctly, a sound
made by vibrating, for instance, the area of the uvular might occur in both
labialized (i.e. rounded lips) and unlabialized variants.

I'm guessing that Abkhazian would be formidably difficult to understand,
especially for those who are acquainted only with Indo-European languages.

Abkhazian is one of the indigenous North West Caucasian languages, distantly
related to Circassian and the now extinct Ubykh. It may be descended from
Hattic, which may have been spoken in the empire of the Hittites. There are
something like a million Abkhazian speakers, half in Abkhazia itself, a country
that borders the Black Sea to the northwest of Georgia, and half in Turkey and
other locations in the Abkhazian diaspora. Written language came only in the
mid-nineteenth century to the wild Caucasus. Abkhazians have been described as
20% Muslim, 80% Christian, and 100% pagan, their religion "a peculiar mosaic of
fragments of religious beliefs" in which "Christian ceremonies, Muslim rites,
and pagan observances are so closely interwoven that it seems impossible to
separate them."

Though the Abkhazian consonant system is daunting, it's a relief to learn that
the language uses only one vowel - ah - and also that both the extinct Ubykh and
a still existing dialect of Abkhazian named Bzyp (pronunciation??) employed "a
minimum of eighty consonants." Is eighty the record?

Title: Book Report:  "Some Hours" by Edward St. Aubyn
Date: April 25, 2012

I've now read the first three of the quintet of the much-praised Patrick Melrose
novels by Edward St. Aubyn, and that's all I'm going to read. It's been a long
time since I've encountered anything so nasty.  Is there a word for a place in
which every single individual is evil, snobbish, vindictive, petty, and cruel.
Kakatopia, perhaps. In St. Aubyn's world, Iago would have been an innocent. True
enough that he was jealous, obsessed, manipulative and murderous, but I doubt
that even Iago would have anally penetrated his five-year-old son.

And moreover: if I were a handsome, rich young woman (or a plain poor one) and
my date asked me to get down on all fours and eat some squashed figs off the
patio floor without benefit of fork or knife, I would run away screaming, slam
the door, and let a few years lapse before resuming social activity. So, I hope,
would everywoman. In the world of St. Aubyn's fiction, reader, she marries him,
and the couple live miserably ever after.

The dilemma that's posed by these novels is that in addition to being richly
kakatopic, they're also amusing, clever, and arch, with dialogue that might have
been written by a jaded Oscar Wilde. So I laughed -- but whenever I laughed I
felt dirty and complicit.

So no more St. Aubyn for me. These novels transcend satire and transmute into
ugly spewing. Not for me, thanks.

Title: A Suppressed Event
Date: May 03, 2012

I've been reading about the early colonization of New York city, a subject that
I've not approached since my days in elementary school in the 1950s, where, in
retrospect, it seemed that we went over the ground quite regularly -- Henry
Hudson, the purchase of Manhattan Island, New Amsterdam, Peter Stuyvesant, and
the English acquisition of the Dutch colonies. As we learned it, it was a sunny
story, untroubled and inevitable -- a path leading from pleasant but primitive
beginnings to its inevitable culmination in the Greatest City in the Greatest
Country on earth. There were large helpings of nationalism and triumphalism --
attitudes that I've come to loathe -- along with the insistence that America was
chosen among all the nations for peace and tolerance.

It appears, however, that there are events recounted in Russell Shorto's The
Island at the Center of the World (New York, 2004) that, if they had been
mentioned, might have diluted our tadpole triumphalism. Kieft's War, for
example, was never discussed.

Willem Kieft was one of the Dutch governors of the new colony, and he was a
pioneer in genocidal racism. A small group of indians had camped at Corlaer's
Hook (now the Lower East Side) and a larger group had settled near what is
now Jersey City in New Jersey. The Indians (Wickquassgeck and Tappan) sought
sanctuary from the Dutch against the Mohawks, to whom they had fallen behind in
their tribute payments. Kieft, for reasons of his own, launched an unprovoked
attack. According to a contemporary chronicler, "infants were torn from their
mother's breasts, and hacked to pieces in the presence of their parents, and the
pieces thrown into the fire and in the water, and other sucklings, being bound
to small boards, were cut, stuck,and pierced and miserably massacred in a manner
to move a heart of stone. Some were thrown into the river, and when the fathers
and mothers endeavored to save them, the soldiers would not let them come on
land but made both parents and children drown.... Some came to our people in the
country with their hands, some with their legs cut off, and some holding their
entrails in their arms....  After this exploit, the soldiers were were rewarded
for their service, and Director Kieft thanked them."

Such atrocities (there were many others) were omitted from the P. S. 217
curriculum.

When I read these stories, I feel as though I was tricked. I'm indignant and
angry.

It's all part of a grand deception in which every child is indoctrinated with
the idea that his own group is wiser, kinder, and better than the others.

If our great country were truly superior, we would have shown it by telling the
truth, the whole truth, not a purged and sanitized half-truth.

Title: Reposted:  The Sculpin, Slimy or Mottled?
Date: May 08, 2012

Knowing little of the finny tribe, I borrowed the Bradford Public Library's
copy of Langdon's introductory Fishes of Vermont (2006). It's an excellent,
informative, helpful guide. With Langdon's help, I can now declare that it's
undeniably the brown bullhead, a species of catfish, that has been multiplying
in our pond. The bullhead, a villainous omnivore, is one of the causes of the
steep decline of our population of frogs. The big, plug-ugly, bebarbelled brute
gobbles frog-egg globules.

Readers of this blague will not be astonished to learn that Dr. M .has fallen
deeply in love with fish names. Take the brown bullhead, for example. It's
also known by such evocative and lunatic denominations as the horned pout, the
mudcat, and the minister. Minister?  To whom, or under what circumstances,
would a brown bullhead minister?

My favorite Vermont fish, nomenclature-wise, is the slimy sculpin, also
performing under such titles as the blob, the chucklehead, the rock cusk, the
stargazer, and the cockatouch. The slimy sculpin should not be confused with its
near cousin, the mottled sculpin -- which can also be addressed as the slowfish
or gudgeon.

Many of the common Vermont fishes have lost their colorful historic names. The
bowfin was once called the John A. Gindle, the stonecat was the doogler, the
lake trout was the togue or longue, the burbot was variously ling or lawyer
(lawyer? minister? why not accountant? or dentist?), the quillback was the
buffalo, and the gar was the needlenose. On the other hand, the blandly-named
pond perch of olden days is trending in the reverse direction: it's now called
the pumpkinseed -- a name which seems curiously vegetarian for a predatory
denizen of the deep.

If I had known that there was a fish called the cisco (known on jolly days as
the tollibee and on prosaic days as the sand herring), I would long ago have
promoted Galen Cisco to my all-time-great Baseball-Fish Team, adding him to such
piscine luminaries as Catfish Hunter, Dizzy Trout, Chico Salmon, Sid Bream,
Bobby Sturgeon, Art "Red" Herring, and Shad Roe.

No Sculpins in MLB that I can recall, but In a more poetic universe, "Slimy"
Sculpin would have been a spitball pitcher, or perhaps even a team owner.

Title: Senior Bowl
Date: May 08, 2012

I was talking on the telephone with a fan of the Washington Nationals and for
some reason neither of us could recall the name of the lanky, scraggly-bearded
shaggy-haired high-salaried power-hitting right fielder who once played for the
Phillies and had a hard time last season but seemed to be starting out well this
year, and whose grandfather played shortstop for the Pirates fifty year or so
years ago.

Inasmuch as I once had near-perfect recall of such trivia, I was frustrated by
the failure of memory. But I decided that this time I wasn't going to google
the Nationals' roster but instead was going to force myself to cough up that
name, no matter how many polysaccharides had clogged my synaptic pathways. I
set my search memory program on full blast, and after about 45 minutes, while
I was scrubbing the sink, out popped the moniker. I called the Washington fan
and whispered into the telephone, triumphantly, these three syllables: Jay Son
Werth.

How does the human brain do that? You can't bring up a word or phrase, and then,
an hour or a day later, there it is! Tiny chemical processes or electrical
impulses chase from synapse to synapse until they just happen to happen upon
the neuron or neurons where "Jayson Werth" is stored? Really? Hard to fathom.
However it's accomplished, it's superbly miraculous.

But o-so-slow compared to the instant recall of my golden olden days.

So now I have this idea for a TV game show, modeled after College Quiz Bowl,
but called Senior Bowl. The format: when a question is asked, competitors start
the clock, which can run for, let's say, a couple of days. And also start the
videotape machine. Competitors go about their business and the first person with
the correct answer wins the round. When the tape is carefully and dramatically
edited, it's perfect reality TV for oldsters.

Announcer: "Congratulations to prizewinner Vivian de St. Vrain, who was able to
correctly identify the singer of "Duke of Earl" in only 17 hours, 12 minutes,
and 43 seconds!"

A major breakthrough in golden-years tv.

And by the way, I can now proclaim to all the waiting world that the name of
Jayson Werth's shortstop grandfather is -- "Ducky" Schofield.

Title: Lord of the Flies;  a 1950s Allegory
Date: May 10, 2012

In my daughter's basement I found a dried-up, stained, pages-hanging-out
1959 paperback edition of William Golding's Lord of the Flies. On the cover:
"Copyright 1954." "Over 4,450,000 copies in print." "Sixty-second impression."
"Now Available For Students And Teachers: the Casebook Edition containing the
full text of the novel, critical essays, notes, and bibliography." Lord of
the Flies leaped into public prominence in the mid-1950s and quickly became a
classroom staple. A quick googling found half a dozen websites designed to help
high school students generate reports on the novel's "symbolism," etc.

I didn't like Lord of the Flies when I read it back then and it's become less
likable-- and less worthy of respect-- over the last half-century. It's a
variation on Robinson Crusoe, except that this time a score of boys land (how?
and not a one of them injured!!) on an uninhabited island in the Pacific. They
very quickly degenerate into savages, murder two of their own number, and are
hunting down the last boy who possesses a modicum of civility when a naval
officer (nauta ex machina?) arrives to take command. Lord of the Flies is a
dyspeptic, dystopian novel; it's also, according to the websites, a story of the
contest between civilization and barbarism and, -- guess what? -- it's barbarism
by a country mile.

Robinson Crusoe himself was no perfect model of psychological health, but
Defoe's story has been admired for centuries (it's the most reprinted novel in
history) at least in part because it asserts that a resourceful human being
can triumph over a bad situation. Crusoe reads his Bible, keeps a calendar and
a diary, domesticates sheep, develops a working agricultural system, learns
pottery, carpentry and other crafts, and builds himself both a summer and a
winter domicile. Lord of the Flies, on the contrary, is entirely pessimistic
about human capabilities: its flat, bookless, unskilled characters devolve
rapidly into war-painted, violent tribesmen. Robinson Crusoe embodied Age of
Reason optimism; Lord of the Flies is a post-Nazi novel in which there is no
culture, government is nothing more than incipient dictatorship, and religion
equals cruel scapegoating.

Why was it imagined that Lord of the Flies had something of value to say about
about human nature?  It's a sure thing that if Golding had written a novel
in which an isolated group of people behave like reborn Crusoes and work
cooperatively to tame the forest and create a communal utopia, he would have
been derided as a simpleton. No room in the Cold War inn or on the best-seller
lists or in high school curricula for optimism!

Golding arranges it so that the descent into barbarism appears to be not
circumstantial but inevitable. He banishes from his island women and therefore
any need for reciprocity in social institutions. (Violence without heterosexual
sex--just what's needed in the high school classroom!). Moreover, the boys
who land on the island are not a representative set of human beings: they're
English public school children who've already internalized poisonous notions of
hierarchy, hazing, power and class. When, at the outset, they choose a chief,
they're really selecting a head boy for whom lesser creatures will "fag." Of the
island's inhabitants, the only one with more brain than earwax is the physically
repulsive Piggy, while the only boy whose instincts are democratic is slow,
tongue-tied, and indecisive. Meanwhile, Jack, to whom Golding grants leadership
abilities, is a slick soulless demagogue. The author may appear to be impartial,
but in fact he's stacked the deck so that the emergence of proto-fascism appears
"natural." Golding, both a student and a teacher in English public schools,
seems to think that adolescents of his own circle somehow represent common
humanity. His analysis of culture is therefore as shallow as a parking-lot
puddle. And because it's so shallow, the novel is a treasure-trove for the
kind of teaching where the identification of "symbols" substitutes for genuine
thought, or emotion, or aesthetic revelation. It's a convenient opportunity
-- a casebook -- for the kind of bad reading that has damaged generations of
students.

Golding's island abounds not in intelligence but in absurdities. Is it credible
that three or four pre-adolescent boys armed only with sharpened sticks could
a) confront a wild boar and b) actually bring down a mature sow, and that the
sow would lie still, or allow herself to be held to the ground while one of
the boys repeatedly stabs and eventually kills the animal with a penknife, and
c) that the same boys, using no other tools than the single penknife, could
quickly skin, butcher and behead the sow, and then d) cut and drive into the
ground a post stout enough on which to mount that head?  Or e) that a few boys
could dislodge and push a rock that is "as big as a tank." Or that f) there
could exist an uninhabited Pacific atoll so small that a group of boys could
systematically search every inch of it like beaters on a hunt, but yet so large
that, without experiencing much in the way of rain, it could have streams and
pools of fresh water and, in addition, g) an inexhaustible supply of wild pigs
(indigenous? feral?). If Lord of the Flies is an allegory, then perhaps such
howlers don't matter. Yet even an allegory should not cause a reader to guffaw
at inappropriate moments.

Title: Vegetable Love
Date: May 12, 2012

As a rule, I'm as fickle as the legendary varying flag, but just now I have made
a firm unwavering commitment. My absolutely most favorite line of poetry -- are
you ready now, readers -- is (drumroll)l: "If you really want my peaches, gotta
shake my tree."

Is that poetry or what? It's teasingly inexplicit yet at the same time very,
very suggestive.

I first encountered the line in a mid-1950s doo-wopper by The Clovers (later
famous for "Love Potion Number Nine") called "Lovey Dovey."

Well, you're the cutest thing that I did ever seeI really love your peaches,
want to shake your tree. Lovey dovey, lovey dovey all the timeLovey dovey, I
can't get you out of my mind.

The line's subversive sexuality penetrated even our twin-bed, Eisenhower-era,
Ozzie-and-Harriet world.

Peaches/trees has a complicated history. Wikipedia tracks it to a song composed
by Irving Berlin in May 1914: “If you don't want my peaches/ You'd better stop
shaking my tree,” but I'd be willing to bet the orchard that Irving did not
invent but borrowed the line, probably from something bluesy. Berlin's peaches
warn us off, but Bessie Smith's 1923 peaches are both active and abundant: "If
you don't like my peaches then let my orchard be." Bessie was the kind of gal
whose peaches would be given away by the basketful. Blind Lemon Jefferson's 1929
peaches, on the other hand, are proprietary: ("you swore nobody’d pick your
fruit but me/ I found three kid men shaking down your peaches free"). Ah yes, we
must all be faithful to just a single source of fruit.

I'd wager that the peaches have appeared in fifty or a hundred songs in the last
century.

The line floats from song to song, but wherever it settles, it's always
suggestive of sexual desires and needs. Even when peaches are forbidden fruit,
they're also ripe and luscious oozers of juice. Shake that tree properly and
they fall into right into your mouth.

Andrew Marvell would have loved "If you really want my peaches, gotta shake my
tree."  Here's his witty mid-seventeenth century version of the trope. It's in
a stanza from his best poem, "The Garden."

What wondrous life is this I lead! Ripe apples drop about my head;The luscious
clusters of the vine Upon my mouth do crush their wine;The nectarine and curious
peach Into my hands themselves do reach;Stumbling on melons as I pass, Insnared
with flowers, I fall on grass.

Marvell's garden is not for strolling and smelling. It's a garden in which
the fruits attack the "speaker" in an active, science-fictiony way. No
nibbling here. Instead, "The luscious clusters of the vine,/Upon my mouth do
crush their wine." "Luscious clusters... crush" is one sensous mouth-filling
phrase. And those fine fruits, "the nectarine and curious (curious =s unusual,
not investigative) peach" require no shaking whatsoever. These fruits are
animatronic.

Marvell's "Garden" is as good a version of pomological love as Irving Berlin's
-- without even taking into account the brilliant and accomplished iambic
tetrameter couplets.

Title: Amnesia on Film: Cowboys & Aliens (2011)
Date: May 14, 2012

I imagine that the writers of Cowboys and Aliens had a grand old time inserting
into their screenplay as many as possible of both Westerns and sci-fi/horror
cliches. They did very well: there's a loner cowboy with cigarillo and fists of
steel, a domineering cattleman and his feckless son, a timid barkeep, a posse on
horseback tracking abducted relatives a la The Searchers, a band of Chiricuara
Apaches fighting for their own survival, innocent distressed maidens, etc.,
etc., and at the end, a hero riding off into the sunset. On the other side of
the ledger, computer graphic aliens resembling the velociraptors in Jurassic
Park (except for the slimy green blood) attacking us poor mortals, multiple
abductions, and o my gosh even a little boy hiding from a creepy creature in a
crevice in the rock, and then our intrepid James Bond-y macho hero sneaking into
the spaceship to free the captives and dynamite the mother ship, my o my what a
bounty.

And to these cliches, the unsatisfied writers added a bonus -- a dollop of movie
amnesia. Why not? Jake Lonergan awakes in the desert not knowing who he is,
why he is wounded, and without a clue as to why he has a futuristic bracelet
soldered to his wrist. Like most movie amnesiacs, he remains fully functional
and unimpaired. He's not the least bit agitated by his loss of memory. But then
comes a truly embarrassing, semi-racist moment. The Indians, who as everyone
knows are noble and in touch with the human soul in a way that we products of
western civilization can never be, treat his amnesia with a frothy brew (perhaps
mescaline, but who can tell?). Memory spontaneously returns; Jake remembers that
he escaped from the mother ship, knows where it has been parked, and also knows
about the secret entrance. And so to work.

Later on, the released abductees are all amnesiac, but they're cured instantly
(the movie is long enough) without Apache influence.

So now we can add alien abduction to the long list of precipitants of movie
amnesia.

This film could have been a gas except that its makers forgot about the comedy
that's inherent in the title and in the conception. Too bad. As it stands, it's
a solemn, noisy, elaborate, expensive, flimsy chimera.

At one point in the quest, the posse comes across an enormous structure that
looks like a paddle-wheeler right there in the middle of the desert. "There's no
river within five hundred miles that can handle that thing." But they continue
along, the boat is never mentioned again and plays no part in the story --
thereby proving that even screenwriters can suffer disabling bouts of amnesia.

Title: A Tumbrilism Revival
Date: May 15, 2012

When rich people betray that they don't have the least clue how ordinary people
live, they might coin a "tumbrilism." The perfect tumbrilism is callous,
contemptuous, supercilious, insulting, and grotesquely ignorant.

The word "tumbrilism" seems to derive from tumbril, the cart that carried
victims to the guillotine during the French Revolution. The mother of all
tumbrilisms is Queen Marie Antoinette, who when told that the peasants had no
bread, is supposed to have replied, "qu'ils mangent de la brioche," usually
translated as  "let them eat cake." This classic trumbrilism derives from
Rousseau and was not assigned to Marie until a couple of generations after she
took her tumble.

Here are two good Congressional tumbrilisms: a) Fred Heinemann (R-North
Carolina): "When I see someone who is making anywhere from $300,000 to $750,000
a year, that's middle class." b) Congressman John Fleming (R, Louisiana): "The
amount that I have to reinvest in my business and feed my family is more like
$600,000 ... and so by the time I feed my family, I have maybe $400,000 left
over." And a gubernatorial tumbrilism: Paul LePage (R, Maine): "Maine's welfare
program is cannibalizing the rest of state government. To all you able-bodied
people out there: "Get off the couch and get yourself a job.'"

Here's a classic tumbrilism from the world of sports, courtesy of Jose Canseco,
who once had a ball bounce off his shoulder and into the stands for a home
run: "You know my life, this financial thing, is a very complicated issue.
Obviously, when you make all that money, people think, 'OK, let's assume it is
$35 million.' People have to understand that $35 million, you're paying the
government 41 percent. That leaves you with about $17 or $18 million, not even.
Then you're taking care of your whole family."

But the modern master of the tumbrilism is Mitt Romney, who, when asked about
his worth, replied, "It’s between $150 and about $200 some-odd million
dollars, I think that’s what the estimates are.”

Other priceless Romney tumbrilisms:

“I’m not concerned about the very poor. We have a safety net there."

"This feels good, being back in Michigan. You know, the trees are the right
height. The streets are just right. I like the fact that most of the cars I see
are Detroit-made automobiles. I drive a Mustang and a Chevy pick-up truck. Ann
drives a couple of Cadillacs, actually."

"I like being able to fire people who provide services to me."

"Even if you have a child 2 years of age, you need to go to work. And people
said, 'Well that's heartless.' And I said, 'No, no, I'm willing to spend more
giving day care to allow those parents to go back to work. It'll cost the state
more providing that daycare, but I want the individuals to have the dignity of
work.'"

Unlike the dubious provenance of "let them eat cake," these tumbrilisms, though
astonishingly naive and self-satisfied, are pure and genuine. Their Mittness is
well-witnessed.

Title: Starfish Metamorphosis
Date: May 22, 2012

I've been reading about the peculiar metamorphosis of the starfish, Luidia
sarsi, which eats shellfish and dwells in the muddy sediment of seashores from
Norway to the Mediterranean. Its diaphanous larvae are bilaterally symmetrical;
the adult form, with its five arms, is radially symmetrical, a most irregular
circumstance. Moreover, the adult emerges from the larva in a different way than
the butterfly from the caterpillar, where the structure dissolves and reforms.
The starfish develops from a cluster of cells lining the internal cavity of the
larva.""Here it grows and matures, an alien existence independent of the larval
body structures, axis, bilateral symmetry, and form, imbued with a complete
disregard for every embodiment of its larval stage."  Eventually, the starfish
emerges, and, most oddly, the larva continues on its way "swimming the pelagic
waters and grazing on its vegetarian diet of algae". Essentially, the starfish
develops from what might be called stem cells that are carried within the larva.
It's all very alien, or perhaps even Alien.

The theory presented in Frank Ryan's The Mysteries of Metamorphosis (White
River Junction, 2011) is that at one time the larva and the starfish were two
different creatures (from two different phyla). Somewhere in the dark backward
and abyss of time, sperm from the one creature encountered an egg of the other
(both creatures eject enormous amounts of reproductive material into the sea)
and cross-phyletic cross-fertilization occurred and the resultant chimera
prospered.

Biologists resist the hypothesis because of the challenge it poses to the
standard view of the evolutionary branching of life. I'm in no position to judge
the theory's truth or falsity, but I'm attracted to the idea because it makes
life forms so much more complex and unpredictable, and because it overturns
conventional thinking.

Title: Life:  Boon or Thorn?
Date: May 26, 2012

The most widely-known as well as the most notorious poem of the second half of
the twentieth century is Philip Larkin's "This Be the Verse."  For those of
you who don't know the poem by heart, here it is in its brief and startling
entirety.

They fuck you up, your mum and dad.

They may not mean to, but they do.

They fill you with the faults they had

And add some extra, just for you.

But they were fucked up in the turn

By fools in old style hats and coats,

Who half the time were soppy-stern,

And half at one another's throats.

Man adds on misery to man.

It deepens like a coastal shelf.

Get out as early as you can,

And don't have any kids yourself.

Pessimistic?  Jaded?  Angry?  Yes, I think it's fair to call it so. And let's
also add, unsubtle with a vengeance.

Larkin is hyperbolically illogical. It can't be true that every generation is
more deranged than the one that preceded it. When were the good times? A few
generations ago? In the Dark Ages? In antiquity?  No, in Larkin's view, it's
been all downhill, all the time. No doubt those early primates were already
fucking up their kids when they came down from the trees and started to walk
upright on the savannah. "There's only one piece of roasted rhinoceros left. You
take it. I don't mind being hungry."

Despite its dyspepsia and illogicality, "This Be the Verse" is a curiously
lovable poem. Whenever I've heard it read or recited, audiences react not
with horror but with amusement. The poem's misanthropy is so absolute and its
language so blunt that it can't help but provoke tittering.

The laughter arises because the poem doesn't earn its pessimism. It's too fluent
and too easy -- unlike, say, King Lear, where the sublunary world is rank with
incest, betrayal, and murder. After three thousand lines and five full horrific
acts, Shakespeare earns the standing to conclude that life is miserable and that
"humanity must perforce/ Prey on itself, like monsters of the deep." So it is
in Oedipus, where the events lend credibility to the difficult apercu that it's
best not to be born at all, next best to die very young.

While Shakespeare and Sophocles are philosophically serious, Larkin is merely
flip. There's a monumental disproportion between his gloom and the light-verse
vessel in which his gloom is contained. And so arises the off-kilter comedy.

It's a whiny poem. "Poor poor pitiful me. I had a difficult mommy."

If "This Be the Verse" is in fact the most popular poem of the last fifty years,
it supersedes Robert Frost's "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening." What a
remarkable devolution! While Frost endures, Larkin abhors.

I doubt whether Larkin had "Stopping by Woods" in mind, but he certainly glosses
Robert Louis Stevenson's "Requiem" -- the poem from which he drew his title.
Stevenson's performance is charming, gentle, self-effacing, and modest.

Under the wide and starry sky,

Dig the grave and let me lie.

Glad did I live and gladly die.

And laid me down with a will.

This be the verse you grave for me:

Here he lies where he longed to be.

Home is the sailor, home from the sea,

And the hunter home from the hill.

Stevenson praises the adventurous life lived well and brought to completion.
Death may end it all but it also closes the circle. There is no completion, no
circles in Larkin, where natural processes are crudely truncated: "don't have
any kids yourself."

"This Be the Verse" is a hilarious and wonderful piece of joking, but its
victimology is unsettling. It's tempting to claim that it satirizes its own
pessimism, but, I'm sorry to say, it does not. Larkin loves to wallow in his own
gloom.

Here's another Victorian variation on the thema Larkiniana.

Is life a thorn?

Then count it not a whit.

Man is well done with it.

As soon as he's born,

He should all means assay

To put the plague away.

Pessimistic, yes. But Colonel Fairfax, even-handed, also entertains the
possibility that life might be a boon (which, as we all know, is true at least
some of the time).

Title: Predators and Prey
Date: June 25, 2012

I was almost asleep but semi-conscious and I heard a noise outside. It could
have been the wind knocking over a chair, but it might also have been a raccoon,
a skunk, or a groundhog. Or even a coyote, a beast that we hear but almost
never encounter. Whatever it was, I was immediately electrified, the "flight or
fight" response fully engaged. Ready to go hand to hand with a groundhog or any
other rodent. But then I thought, hey, I'm an apex predator. Why I am being so
skittish, so fearful? I'm not a prey animal. I can hold my own with anything out
there.

The first hand axes date from about 2.5 million years ago. (A hand axe is
nothing more than a piece of flint or other stone, knapped into a point on one
side, adapted for cutting or throwing). The first spearpoint appears 250,000
years ago. Spears for throwing, or lances for poking are a major breakthrough
for hunting or self defense.

I wonder why it took 2.25 million years for one of my hominid ancestors to think
to mount an axe on a shaft of wood. How hard could it have been? Eventually
the bow and arrow appears in the archeological record, but not until 25,000
years ago. The pace was picking up. My point, however, is that for a couple
of millions of years, my forebears were not predators. They  were prey,
hiding from the European lion (50% larger than the modern African lion), from
the giant hyenas, from the cave bear, from big old snakes, and other extinct
mega- predators. Cowering on the savannah, clutching a hand axe, for millions
of years. It hardwires the brain.

No wonder that a noise in the night makes me fearful. Two million years as
prey doesn't disappear from the DNA just because we've recently eliminated or
neutralized all the major predators.

I think that human beings haven't realized that they are predators and are
almost entirely shaped by the prey experience. As a result, we're afraid of
animals; we're afraid of our shadows; we're afraid of noises in the night. We're
afraid of each other.I doubt that we'll ever grow up and learn to comport
ourselves confidently but not aggressively. As a species, we're just plain
scared. We should be lions, not chickens.

Title: Does Religion Rot the Brain?
Date: September 11, 2012

Unaware that I was choosing a splashy and controversial best-seller, I selected
from the library's new book shelf something called Unorthodox (New York, 2012),
by one Deborah Feldman, and a sadder, more dispiriting book I have rarely read.

Ms. Feldman had the misfortune to be raised in the Satmar branch of the Hasidic
movement -- a sect that, at least as she describes it, is unhappy, puritanical,
finicky, repressive, ferociously anti-rational, patriarchal, and bossy. Boys
study Talmud but girls are not educated past a high school -- what would be
the point, when, as Deborah's grandfather once told her, "girls belong in the
kitchen?" Feldman's memoir is not just dreary, it's ostentatiously lurid. Its
subtitle is "the scandalous rejection of my Hasidic roots" -- and the attention-
mongering scandals that she recounts are mostly sexual in nature.

There is a old story that John Ruskin collapsed in a heap when he discovered,
on his wedding night, that his bride had pubic hair. Feldman out-Victorians
the great Victorian, claiming that she did not know that she had a vagina, an
entrance, an opening, "down there." Is such ignorance possible in this age? 
And then she explores her sexual failings, mostly her vaginismus-induced post-
honeymoon extended virginity -- which she blames on her Satmar upbringing
(although want of curiosity might also be a factor).

Feldman's memoir has upset the Hasidic community and there is at least one
website devoted entirely to attacking its veracity. And in fact the memoir does
contain the commonplace omissions and elisions of autobiography --  none of
which seem to invalidate the whole. However, the defenders of the sect miss the
point (as does Ms. Feldman).

The Satmar movement isn't reprehensible because it dishonors brains and women
and especially women's brains. It's reprehensible because it is erected
on a lie. "We learn in school that God sent Hitler to punish the Jews for
enlightening themselves. He came to clean us up, eliminate all the assimilated
Jews...."  What an absurd and odious doctrine! Are we expected to entertain
the hypothesis that six million Jews died for eating lobster?  "The first and
greatest Satmar rebbe said that if we became model Jews, just like in the olden
days, then something like the Holocaust wouldn't happen again, because God would
be pleased with us." So Hitler and the Nazis and the SS and the camps are a) the
fault of the Jews themselves, and b) God can be placated if all Jewish women
wear thick stockings and wigs and cover themselves from collarbone to wrist and
knee.  It's a brainless argument, and one that, if you think about it for a few
seconds, gives the victory to Hitler. Plus, it's an argument that creates a god
who is even crueler and more idiotic than usual.

Indoctrinated with this criminal bullshit, the survivors of the Shoah and their
descendants voluntarily re-ghettoize themselves and, of their own foolish
accord, imprison themselves into a new dark age of their own invention.

Here's what I learned from this book. Satmar is a check-your-brains-at-the-door
cult that controls 130,000 adherents who manifest all the symptoms of obsessive
compulsive disorder. It's "bad things will happen to me if I step on a crack on
the sidewalk" raised several painful orders of magnitude.

Ms. Feldman may have escaped the cult but she's still in the dark. She's left
Satmar behind because she couldn't read the books she wanted to read or wear the
clothes she wanted to wear and she couldn't locate her own vagina. But it's not
her vagina that readers should worry about;  it's her brain.

Title: Amnesia on Film:  Unknown (2011)
Date: September 21, 2012

Here's a case of double amnesia, in which a second case of the disease is
overlain over the first (as usual, once the amnesia genie is activated,
screenwriters cry havoc and let slip the dogs of anything goes).

Our hero, played by a tired Liam Neeson, awakes from a coma not remembering much
but thinking he's Dr. Martin Harris, a geneticist. He has no identification,
and no one knows him, even his young wife. Turns out, he's not Dr. Harris at
all, but a professional assassin who has somehow forgotten that his alias is
an alias. It takes an innocent new girlfriend and several car chases and
some highly-choreographed fist fights before he comes to his senses. Once he
realizes that he's a professional killer, however, he turns over a new leaf and
becomes a Good Guy. He thwarts the intended assassination and with solemn steps
and slow, begins a new moral life.

Here's the question that occurred to me:  a guy is a long-time, career
assassin. He has an accident and forgets that he was a murderer. Then little
by little he remembers. Is it probable that his personality would change and he
would be reborn to innocence and good citizenship, I only ask because that's
the red herring that Unknown's audience is asked to masticate? I myself don't
buy it.

Neeson asks, over and over, "Who am I?"  In serious works of literature (cf.
Lear's "Who is it that can tell me who I am'), such a question is tragic.  In
amnesia movies, "Who am I" is not tragic but merely mcguffinic.

Title: Goddesses Excellently Bright
Date: September 26, 2012

At the Perfect Pear, our local eatery, dinner was less than ambrosial,
but halfway through the mashed potatoes, the room was suddenly illuminated
by an astonishingly beautiful young woman who arrived (drums, and trumpets,
and more trumpets) with bland boyfriend in tow. She was lambent and glowing
-- so lovely that I felt the urge to get up and whisper in her ear that her
brilliance had refreshed and cheered my entire day.

Of course I did no such thing.  I'm not that kind of guy.

Later, I fell into a reverie and brought to mind the very few magnificently
beautiful women whom I had encountered in my life. Now I don't mean women who
are merely or very attractive, of whom there are, thankfully, many; nor women
upon whom one's youthful self has lavished an intense passing crush. I mean
women who are goddess-beautiful. Women around whose brows flames flicker, and
who, when they walk, do not touch their feet to the ground. Here they are:

In Ithaca, Margaret C., a sylph or naiad. In Cambridge, the young Aphrodite
who sprawled so fetchingly in Widener's periodical room, unconscious of the
attention she garnered. At the pottery, Mariel ----- ("Ariel with an M,"she
said), a psychologist, who, though already greying, was a perfect Juno.
Students: in New York, Ms. ----- Pavony, who glowed for almost an entire silent
semester, right up to the precise moment that she contributed to the discussion
in the squeaky voice and accent of a 1930s M-G-M telephone operator. In Denver,
Ms. {exotic first name] Samuels, who, I'm happy to say, remained silent on the
rare days she deigned to come to class. A Hindu fertility goddess, yes -- but
perhaps also a daughter of Zion. On the airplane: the radiant Denver actress,
who confided to me that her best part "so far" was a Midol commercial. On the
bus: the young lady with the electric green eyes. At the Folger: the luscious
student from France, as lovely as a young woman can possibly be, who said to me,
"Can I ask you a question about Shakespeare? Why do some of the lines stop in
the middle of the page and some go right to the margin?" Oh, would that she had
not asked!

And while I mused over my small handful of goddesses excellently bright, I
remembered that on two separate occasions, forty or fifty years ago, an older
gentleman had approached Mrs. Dr. Metablog to say, in these or equivalent words,
"thank you for being so beautiful."

At the time, I was taken aback, but now, in my pre-dotage, I fully comprehend.

(It stands to reason that I must also have encountered young men of great
beauty, but, try as I will, I can't bring any to mind.)

Title: Tweeblaarkanniedood, or Khurob, or Nyanka, or Anyango, or Whatever You Want to Call It.
Date: September 29, 2012

I read with enthusiasm Richard Fortey's Horseshoe Crabs and Velvet Worms (New
York, 2012), a pop biology book which describes various plants and animals that
originated millenia ago and that survive outwardly unchanged to the present
day. It's a great subject and might have been a great book if Fortey had been
less anecdotal and more informative, and if he not just blathered into the
tape recorder but had paid attention to organization and prose style.

Ever since my summers at Makamah in the 1940s, I've had an affection for
horseshoe crabs. They were abundant then, although scary and definitely not-to-
be-stepped-on, and although I can't say for sure, I wouldn't be surprised to
find that they are very rare now, especially in populated areas like the Sound.
I would not have known that horseshoe crabs date from the pre-hemoglobin
era and that their blood (or blood-equivalent) is based not on iron but on
copper. I did not know anything about velvet worms or the various ancient
slimes with which Fortey is so taken, but I am well-acquainted with horsetails,
which, however primitive they may be, continue to thrive rather wonderfully
around our West Bradford pond.

Of all Fortey's species, my favorite is unquestionably the welwitschia, or,
as it is sometimes called, the tweeblaarkanniedood, or khurob, or nyanka, or
onyango -- a plant which is no less exotic than its various names.

It's the only plant in its order (although it can claim fossil relatives) and
it hangs on in Namibia and Angola. It's a very distant relative of pines and
spruces, having diverged in the late Permian. Welwitschia has an extremely odd
growth habit. It makes only two true leaves in its lifetime, but the leaves,
which might be imagined as very wide ribbons, grow constantly throughout the
long life of the plant. The leaves can be fifteen feet long;  the plant
can live for a thousand and some think even two thousand years.  Here's a
welwitschia: it's not a classically handsome plant, not a garden beauty.

Title: Lyin' Ryan?  We Report, You Decide
Date: September 30, 2012

There's been so much noise about Governor Romney stonewalling calls to release
his tax returns and so much commentary about the one he did release, that the
anomalies in running-mate Paul Ryan's tax returns have been overlooked.

When Ryan made his 2011 taxes public, he had to "amend" what he and his lobbyist
wife had initially reported. It seems that he had "inadvertently" failed
to report $61,122 in income. Now sixty grand might be chicken feed for the
Governor, but it's a big hunk for the Representative. It raises his total income
to $323,416 and bumps up his taxes by $19,917. The sixty-thousand bucks comes
from an income-producing trust that he inherited from his wife's mother, a
successful Oklahoma attorney. Moreover, on June 6 of this year, Ryan amended two
years of financial disclosure reports that he filed with the clerk of the House
of Representatives which show that the trust produced income of between $100,001
and $1 million.

So Ryan "forgot" that he had inherited a small fortune from his
mother-in-law, and he "forgot" to report to the IRS just about 20% of his
income.  Fortunately, he remembered both of these facts when he began to come
under consideration for national office and knew that his finances would be
closely scrutinized.

Ryan is a supposedly a policy wonk, touted for his attention to detail. He's
an expert in taxation and expenditure -- or so we're told.  But he's not,
apparently, attentive to his own affairs.

He's also the person who claimed to have run a sub-five minute marathon and to
have climbed o-so-many of Colorado's mountains.

So, constant reader, here are your choices. Either Paul Ryan (a)
"inadvertently forgot" to include $60,000 worth of income on his 2011 taxes,
or (b) he's a untrustworthy, lying scumbag who suits the facts to the situation,
and who was hoping to get away without paying his fair share and only came
clean when it looked as though someone would notice.

We report;  you decide.

(I'm trying to think, if I were the recipient of a $60,000 a year inheritance,
which I'm not, whether I could possibly "forget" to report it as income. Nope,
can't imagine such a circumstance.)

Title: A Splendid Sentence
Date: October 16, 2012

All that is good and all that is bad about opera is summarized by the following
splendid sentence. It comes from a plot summary of Donizetti's L'Elisir
d'Amore. Prepare to savor.

"At the pre-wedding feast, Adina and Dulcamara entertain the guests with a
barcarole."

Is that genius, or what?

Here's the situation: the plot's a little thin and needs to be padded.
Barcaroles were big in the 1840s. By good fortune, Donizetti just happens to
have one in his drawer, or perhaps he has been thinking about gondoliers since
his last trip to Venice. So let's slip a barcarole in there.

Moreover, the barcarole is beautiful. Perfectly wonderful and enjoyable. It's
as lovely as the excuse for its performance is ridiculous.

That's why we love grand opera -- its inevitable and constant juxtaposition of
glorious and absurd.

Thanks, Metropolitan Opera in HD, for bringing it to our attention. Let's hope
for many more afternoons of such transcendent, splendid silliness.

Ah that in real life we could while away our empty hours with barcaroles.

Title: Amnesia on Film:  Mirage (1965)
Date: October 17, 2012

I was half-way through this neglected Cold War paranoia-mystery-Hitchcocky
black-and-white (and noir all over) amnesia movie when I realized that I was
watching a lineal ancestor of the Jason Bourne films. It's all there: the
trauma, the amnesia, the shadowy organization determined to eliminate the
amnesiac, the assassins, the hair-breadth 'scapes, the chases, the murky
plotting.

David Stillwell (note the encouraging onomastic pun in his surname) played by
the ever-upright Gregory Peck, has accidentally defenestrated his mentor and has
gone into what this film calls "unconscious amnesia." He's got to figure it all
out, which he does via Bourneian flashbacks, even while being pursued by a bunch
of very bad guys, who fortunately, are most amateurish with their pistols.

There's also a dollop of Bond in the mix: a nuclear secret, a threat to world
peace and in addition a possibly helpful, possibly dangerous former mistress.

And there's Walter Matthau as a shambling amateurish detective. Early Walter
Matthau -- taking a few first steps on the road to becoming the real Walter
Matthau.

It was a superior movie during the first mysterious hour, but as the mystery
unravelled, it turned into cliche and incoherence. Too bad, because the noir
atmosphere was splendidly realized and the shots of 1960s Manhattan a genuine
treat.

Mirage is a political movie, but it's hard to track its politics. Howard Fast,
who wrote the novel from which the screenplay is adapted, leaned far left while
the director, Edward Dmytryk, leaned right. The film teeter-totters.

Mirage was remade three years later as Jigsaw, in which an LSD overdose was
substituted for amnesia. Jigsaw doesn't seem to be available on Netflix, but
I'll look for it. "Unconscious amnesia" apparently mutated, during the hippie
years, into "drug amnesia." A new genre

Title: A Man and a Woman
Date: October 23, 2012

I find it utterly fascinating that Romney and Obama, who are so unlike in so
many ways and yet both to the best of our knowledge good "family men," are both
descended from polygamists.

Barack's great-grandfather Obama Opiyo had five wives and his grandfather,
Hussein Onyango, had at least four. Such was the Luo tradition. Barack's
father's bigamy was unlawful rather than traditional -- he left what used to be
called a "grass widow" behind when he escaped Kenya.

Both of Mitt's great-grandfathers, Miles Romney and Helaman Pratt were
polygamists. Miles had four wives and thirty children, Helaman had five
wive and who knows how many offspring. Both families fled the U. S. en masse
when a divine revelation and the enforcement of the Morrill Act ended polygamy
in 1890.

And yet preachers and politicians continue to proclaim that "marriage is between
one man and one woman, and always has been, since the time of Adam and Eve."

It ain't so. Nothing could be more ahistorical or more false. The biblical
patriarchs were all polygamists and King Solomon himself, a model of wisdom,
we are told, collected an astonishing, exhausting household of 300 wives and
700 concubines. Plural marriage was part of Jewish tradition way into the first
millennium. Another Abrahamic religion, Islam, is notably polygynous even as
it is furiously anti-polyandrous. Marriages over the world have taken every
shape imaginable, sometimes formally, sometimes informally. The idea that
marriage is  permanent and unchanging is a canard belied by the immediate and
symmetrical family histories of our two candidates.

Title: Othello/ Otello
Date: October 30, 2012

I prefer my opera to be aural rather than visual. Opera is a form that
is made for listening, not watching -- at least in my view. The music,
Mozart or Verdi, is frequently transcendent and most satisfying. But on those
occasions when I venture to the opera house and I have to deal with the
cultic, cachectic audience and the grand-opera worshippers as well as the
ridiculous plots, the unhandsome singers, the interminable intermissions, the
staginess and artifice and the general all-around silliness -- as well as pay
through the nose for the privilege of doing so, well then, I'm not always a
happy fellow.

I know the sound of Verdi's Otello moderately well, having played the Placido
Domingo version often enough for the laser to have bored holes into the cd.
Moreover, as it happens, I'm moderately familiar with Shakespeare's play). But I
had never seen a performance of Otello until this past Saturday when we betook
ourselves and our bagels and our Granny Smiths to the Century Theatre to watch
the Metropolitan Opera's Live in HD performance. It was, frankly, glorious --
Renee Fleming in the electronic flesh, moving us to tears with the willow song
(along with Verdi's bonus, dubious Ave Maria).

She was superb; so were the orchestra, the costumes, the sets, even the
overacting, villainous Iago, who would have twirled his mustachios, if he had
had them, and the non-acting, expressionless Othello.

Our "guide," a robust, comfortable mezzo whose name I should know but didn't
catch, made the claim that Verdi's Otello improved upon Shakespeare's Othello.
A highly dubious claim, I think, but then, I don't know how to measure the
value of the grand "Othello music," that Shakespeareans so much admire, against
the cellos and the bassoons. Whether for better or worse, however, there's a
heck of a lot in Shakespeare's play that didn't make it across the centuries
and genres and into Verdi's opera. More than can be said in a paragraph or
a blaguepost.

For starters, Shakespeare created a multi-layered society, not just elaborate
sets. His city of Venice has a sense of itself as a successful, orderly,
civilized, and advanced community. Into this world strides Othello, not
only an outlander but an African and a erotic exotic. Although Venice needs
his soldiership, he's still a black man in a racist world who marries a
willful patrician lady who prefers him to  the "wealthy curled darlings of
the nation." It's an unlikely, perilous match: he's "declined into the vale
of years" while she's very very young. He's a soldier who's been around the
world; she's the secluded mistress of the house affairs. He's commanding;
she's naive.

Verdi must have loved Othello, although not necessarily for the right reasons.
How could a play that ends on a bed, with a climactic murder-suicide, not have
excited the instincts of the composer of Aida. Nothing more appropriate for
grand opera than Othello and Desdemona -- and yet o so simple a representation
compared with Shakespeare's rich figures and complex society.

Imagine a Merchant of Venice in which Shylock is not Jewish, or a King Lear in
which Lear is a troubled forty-something and you're well on your way to grasping
an Othello in which melanin is replaced with melodrama.

As a result, even when Verdi brought tears to my eyes, it was because I was
seeing through the opera to the play that lies beneath it.

And sometimes I was crying because I so desperately missed the beauties and the
profundity that Verdi had not seen fit to include.

The Republicans now draw most of their strength from the former "slave states."
Here's the evidence and the map:

In 2012, Republicans won only 55 electoral votes from the free states. Obama

I don't think it's coincidence or merely an association.  I think it's a cause.

In order to support slavery, a person has to deform and distort his brain; he
has to learn to make or accept arguments that are innocent of fact and logic and
fellow-feeling.  He has to damage his intelligence and ruin his morals, and,
apparently, he must pass the consequences on to his children and grand-children.

And so the sins of slavery continue to be visited upon us, yea even unto the

Title: Who's Laughing Now?
Date: November 09, 2012

Many years ago, when I was young and invulnerable, it was most amusing that Mr.
Barkis, the "willin'" carrier in David Copperfield, offered up his shillings
with such agony.

Barkis is bedridden with a cripplingly painful illness. He has a locked box of
coins, and although he has become "near," he has the generous impulse to give
David a guinea. However, to fetch the money costs him a martyrdom. "He endured
unheard-of agonies in crawling out of bed alone, and taking it from that unlucky
box....  We heard him uttering suppressed groans of the most dismal nature.
This procedure racked him in every joint."

Barkis's pain was, once upon a time, comic. Nowadays, alas, I can only imagine
that Barkis has ruptured a disc, and must endure a chronic, unameliorable,
incurable torture that will only end with his death.

And then there's the Fat Boy, in Pickwick Papers, who cannot prevent himself
from falling asleep. What's so funny about chronic fatigue or narcolepsy? At my
present advanced age, I tend to fall asleep every time I lie down with a book,
even if the book is a  wild extravagant wonderful novel by Charles Dickens.
Inopportune sleep by day is almost as unpleasant as insomnia or nightmares (or
insomnia plus nightmares) at night.

I think also of Mr F.'s demented Aunt, in Little Dorrit , who can no longer
follow the conversation, but "after regarding the company for ten minutes with
a malevolent gaze, delivered the following fearful remark:'When we lived at
Henley, Barnes's gander was stole by tinkers.'"'

Is her senility, or as we would now say, her Alzheimer's, so very amusing.

It were, but now it ain't no longer.

Dickens died young, at 58, so there is no way to know whether his sense of humor
would been softened by the ravages of disease and age.

Title: Guns in the Classroom?  Why Not Swords?
Date: December 05, 2012

The ancient Romans did not allow swords to be carried within the pomerium, the
sacred central precincts of their city.

They were able to maintain the prohibition because they did not have a National
Sword Associaion to argue that if swords are banned, only criminals with have
swords; or that swords don't kill, people kill; or that it's a violation of
personal liberty for free men to be forced to check their swords at the city
wall. Nor was there a fanatic Roman electorate ruthless enough to donate to the
campaigns of every soft-brained aedile, quaestor, praetor, or consul willing to
proclaim the sanctity of swordsmen's rights.

Is it the case that swords were also prohibited in the Roman classroom?  I
don't know -- but I suspect as much.

Here at the University of Colorado, in the infant millenium, guns may not be
carried into the sacred precincts of the football stadium. However, they're
sure-as-hell legal in classrooms, and have been ever since a State Supreme Court
ruling forced the U to allow students with Colorado concealed weapon permits to
carry their guns on campus -- even on days when exams and papers are returned to
students by an historically-unarmed faculty.

So what about swords? Why should guns be allowed in class and swords prohibited?
I don't mean the modern rapier, which is so long that their presence would
create, in every classroom, a noisy clatter and might even cause unwary students
to trip and fall. I'm thinking rather of the Roman short sword, the famous
gladius, which can easily be worn, in an unthreatening manner, under the toga or
ski jacket.

Rapier (noisy and prone to cause accidents):

Gladius (inoffensive):

In point of fact, why the pusillanimous resistance to gladii at football
games?  Fifty-thousand spectators, highly-partisan fans, gargantuan quantities
of illegal booze and dope, and short swords -- what could possibly go wrong?

The ol' amnesia gimmick plus "screwball" comedy plus W. S. Van Dyke plus Willam

Workaholic, unfun Larry Wilson gets conked on the head and wakes up as an

same time prior state, Larry/Geoge has to come to terms with Larry's wife Kay,
who wants a divorce from the melancholy cheapskate half of the compound hero.
And yet It comes to pass that Kay  prefers the grifter.

Much forced hilarity ensues.

Once again, amnesia proves to be the most malleable of maladies. Bop on the
head, he's Larry; another boy, he's George. Amnesia is a gas, even to the pont
that Myrna Loy, unhappy with what she's got, picks up a vase to re-transform
William Powell into the way she wants him. Mechanical (not medical) amnesia
anticipates Danny Kaye in The Court Jester: a snap of the finger he's a

Every year, football becomes harder and harder to watch. When the quarterback
is blitzed and has his clock cleaned, or a receiver on a crossing pattern gets
his bell rung, I no longer think, brilliant play. Instead, I think, pain and
concussion.

Not a game goes by but that a lineman leaves the field of sport on a gurney, to
admiring huzzahs and applause from the comfortable spectators.

Have I become more timorous -- or more compassionate?  I still admire the skill
level of the players but I'm distressed because these gladiators have become
permanently injured for my amusement.

There's a Washington Post article about a lineman named Tre Johnson, who left
the game in 2003 after nine seasons in the NFL. Johnson, who earned two degrees
before he was drafted, is now a highly-regarded middle-school social studies
teacher at the private Landon School outside Washington. His is a post-career
success story.

The Post article offers some information about Johnson's present state of
health. He's forty-something years old and for three years has been walking
three miles, twice daily, in order to shed some weight.  More power to him,
he's now under 400 pounds and hoping to get back to his playing weight of 275.
He suffers from diabetes, high cholesterol and elevated blood pressure. He's
already endured nineteen surgeries (seven on his shoulders, seven on his knees,
an elbow, hands and Achilles’ tendon). "He can't sleep more than three hours
at a stretch. There’s not a morning he doesn’t wake up in pain, and it takes
a full hour to get moving in tolerable discomfort." Although when he played, no
one kept track of concussions, Johnson has some sort of brain injury, because he
can't tolerate bright or fluorescent lights. To what degree his banged-around
brain has been seriously disabled will not become clear for a few more years.

Tre Johnson is doing well, but what about other ex-players who are not quite so
healthy?

Title: More on Sex Ed in Victorian England
Date: December 17, 2012

George Drysdale (1823-1904) wrote, anonymously, Physical, Sexual, and Natural
Religion (1854), a pioneering guide to contraception and sexual disease that was
condemned by the pious as "the Bible of the Brothel."

Drysdale arrived at his progressive ideas after an adolescence and young
manhood crippled by sexual ignorance and sexual panic. At the age of fifteen,
he "accidentally'' discovered masturbation and found that the practice offered
an 'easy mode of satisfying his passions, which had long been the source of
unrest and torment to his vivid imagination.' He masturbated, poor Victorian
fellow, two or three times a day and involuntarily endured occasional nighttime
'discharges'. He was overcome with guilt and even more so tortured by the fear
that, as he was instructed by prevailing doctrine, the 'loss' of semen would sap
his strength and inevitably lead him to madness. Hard to believe -- but such
notions were commonplace among our recent, ignorant ancestors.

It gets worse. He was so distressed by his uncontrollable onanism that on trip
to Hungary, he faked a suicide, leaving his clothes and identification beside a
river.

And worse still. While in Hungary, he underwent a series of procedures to deaden
and destroy the nerve endings of the penis "by inserting into the urethra a thin
metal rod coated in a caustic substance. He submitted to this procedure seven or
eight times." It didn't work -- at least in the sense that it didn't diminish
his passion for masturbation. I also suspect that it might have hurt.

It gets better, though. He resurrected himself and came back to his family after
he consulted a doctor who offered the breathtakingly brilliant prescription that
he "try coition." Intercourse with prostitutes, he discovered, quite cured his
urge to masturbate. Holy moley, what a revelation! What a fucking breakthrough!

Drysdale never married but in later life he lived for many years with a woman
named Susannah Spring.

Now, if you were writing a novel about a person who "dies" and returns to life
and you called his mistress or partner or whatever she was by the name Spring,
with its obvious overtones of rebirth, you would be justifiably accused of
moralism or allegorizing or heavy-handedness. Nevertheless, truth is truth to
the end of the chapter and Susannah Spring she was.

I hope George and Susannah were happy together. I hope they frequently and
joyously "tried coition." The poor boy deserved a few good years.

Title: Strigils
Date: December 19, 2012

I doubt that I know any more about strigils than your average man in the street.
I had read about them for years, of course, but I had never seen one with my own
eyes until yesterday, when I took myself down to the Pompeii exhibit in Denver.
There they were, kind of stuck away in the corner -- two bronze beauties.

Strigils were used for cleaning the body, ancient Roman style. Early loofahs.
The one posted below looks a lot like the one I saw yesterday -- a garden-
variety Denver/Pompeii specimen that was retrieved from under 20 feet of
Vesuvian ash:

Here's another strigil, this one a little more elaborate.

They're kind of formidable, aren't they?

If, two thousand years ago, you had been patrician enough to go to the thermae
for your ablutions, you would have left the calida piscina, the warm bath, and
hastened to the destrictarium, which was a room dedicated to strigiling. There
you would have applied a mixture of olive oil and pumice to your skin, and then
one of your slaves, who might be an aliptes, a masseur, or a simple balneator, a
bath attendant, would have strigiled you clean.

But why olive oil and pumice? Greasy and gritty. Why not soap?  Did the
ancients have soap?  Who invented soap?

Fortunately, there's a website devoted to these important questions. Its
forthright, unapologetic url is soaphistory.net.

The first traces of soap appeared among the Babylonians, some 5000 years ago.
The recipe: mix animal fat with wood ash and boil. So soaps were around, but --
mirabile dictu -- they weren't used for personal hygiene. They were used for
cleaning wool and cleaning pots; Pliny, who was there for the explosion of Mt.
Vesuvius, and knew all there was to know, records only that soap was used as a
hair pomade.

The world we have lost was a far dirtier place than we like to imagine. In point
of fact, our familiar cake soaps and their widespread use are an industrial
revolution-nineteenth century invention.

Considering the effectiveness and convenience of modern soaps, I'm not looking
for a strigil revival -- no Mr. Strigil at every streetcorner. Nevertheless,
there's not a brush or a washcloth in the modern world that can match the beauty
of the best of the ancient strigils. Here, for example, is an old Etruscan
strigil with a naked-girl handle (she herself brandishes a mini-strigil). It's
less useful than a cake of Ivory, but -- let's face it--  a heck of a lot more
glamorous.

Title: Maureen Dowd's Theology for the New Millenium
Date: December 31, 2012

Fifty years ago I enjoyed arguing with people of religion about the existence
of god, but nowadays I find it to be a singularly unprofitable exercise. The
believers and the atheists are so entrenched in their positions hat no one ever
convinces anyone of anything. Moreover, the faithful are so damned touchy that
it's no fun to talk to them! They are easily offended, I think, because the
weaker their evidence and logic, the more intense their compensatory passion.

I give thanks that at this my moment in history and geography, the true
believers may be angry with me but they don't have the power to bludgeon me into
obedience. (In general, the less intelligible the religion, the greater its
reliance and economic and corporeal sanctions to compel allegiance.)

These philosophical musings are inspired by a New York Times article that has
received an ungodly amount of attention. Maureen Dowd, who has made a career out
of cracking wise at figures of authority, especially Clintons, has given over
her space this Christmas week to a column on theology (or, as it is sometimes
called, the Subject without an Object). She endorses the argument of a priest-
friend. He (the priest) makes an end run around the classic Problem of Evil --
which is, that inasmuch as the world is very obviously a thoroughfare of woe,
then an omniscient god must be either powerless or malicious. Here's Dowd's
priests's formulation: "If we believe, as we do, that God is all-powerful and
all-knowing, why doesn’t He use this knowledge and power for good in the face
of the evils that touch our lives?"

A very good question indeed and one that believers in a beneficent deity have
failed to resolve yea all these many centuries. Dowd's priest's answer (which is
loaded with a bunch of transparently obvious smuggled assumptions) is that "for
whatever reason, God has chosen to enter the world today through others, through
us....  We are human and mortal. We will suffer and die. But how we are with
one another in that suffering and dying makes all the difference as to whether
God’s presence is felt or not and whether we are comforted or not."

Let me try to understand this argument. This new twenty-first century god, the
"dowdgod" let us call him, has entirely disappeared. He doesn't actually do
anything at all. He's so hidden -- absconditus, in the traditional language of
theology  --  that he permits all kinds of suffering and instead chooses to
manifest himself merely as a comforting presence.

Is that the argument that Dowd thinks is worth a column of valuable newsprint?
Yes, so it seems to be. Astonishing.

Faith," the priest continues, "is lived in family and community, and God is
experienced in family and community. We need one another to be in God’s
presence...." (No god for the solitary, then.) "When my younger brother, Brian,
died suddenly at 44 years old, I was asking “Why?” and I experienced family
and friends as unconditional love in the flesh....  The many ways that people
reached out to me let me know that I was not alone. They really were the
presence of God to me. Suffering isolates us. Loving presence brings us back,
makes us belong." His animating idea: the love of friends is a manifestation of
the deity. Wow. How shallow, how trivial, how wrong!

No one would disagree with the notion that suffering isolates us and that
friends and family console us.  I can't argue with such a proposition. It's
plainly obvious. But what in the world does such an observation have to do
with the existence or the nature of a supernatural being? It's not evidence
for god, it's not proof of god; if anything, it's the contrary of a proof.
Human beings console us, not "god"; the god part, the theology part, is utterly
supererogatory and unnecessary. What Dowd's priest has done is to change the
word "compassion" into the word "god." But we know that compassion is not
supernatural; it's entirely and essentially natural.

So the dowdgod turns out to be no more than a feature of human nature that
"soothes broken hearts." But what does it mean to believe in, or worship, the
dowdgod. Not much.  All a person has to do is to notice that it helps to have
some folks around when you're in pain -- and then to re-label the good feelings
that emanate from friends as god. It's so very easy, so undeniable. And utterly
meaningless.

And what a nice old friendly god it engenders. Whatever happened to Augustine,
Calvin, Luther. Those tough old guys are turning over in their graves. The
dowdgod is a far cry from from Jehovah, from Allah, and certainly from the
demanding Jesus who came to bring not peace but a sword. Those were gods to
reckon with. But now, out with Jupiter Tonans, the thunderer, and in with
Jupiter Manus-tenens, the hand-holder. Or Jupiter Sussurans, the whisperer.

It hardly matters whether one believes or doesn't believe in a god so weak-kneed
and thin-blooded, so positively humane.

Maureen Dowd might say, if she were surrounded by compassionate friends "You
make me feel god." In the same situation, I might might say, "You make me feel
good." The difference is only one minuscule "o" vowel, which, honestly, is very
like a zero. And zero is all that this new theology offers.

Title: Amnesia on Film:  And Now, Ladies and Gentlemen (2002)
Date: January 04, 2013

There can't be a disease in fiction that demands more vigorous suspension of
disbelief than movie amnesia. And Now, Ladies and Gentleman, a latter production
of the great Claud Lelouch, pushes the  disbelievery to the breaking point.
It asks us to accept not one but two identical and fanciful cases of the
affliction. Both Valentin Valentin, played by Jeremy Irons, and Jane Lester,
played by Patricia Kaas suffer from symmetrical "blackout" periods in which
memory evaporates.

What, prithee, are the odds?

Duelling amnesias are mighty unlikely, but such is the premise of the film.
Although I doubt that there's much in the scientific literature about the
romantic potential of mutual amnesia, in this film the disease becomes a mild
erotic stimulant. Why the heck not, I say.

Inasmuch as no one but confirmed amnesiaphiles are ever going to see this film,
let me spoil it at once by saying that both Valentin, a jewel thief, and Jane, a
chantoosie, find themselves in Fez in Morocco. There they are healed, and after
much ado, set out to circumnavigate the earth in a racing boat called Ladies
and Gentlemen (hence the film's odd title). Valentin, a traditionalist, takes
the orthodox medical route and goes to a local surgeon, who shows him and us an
MRI generated picture of his brain disfigured by a great white splotch ("It's
a wonder he can remember anything," says the Doc.) Valentin undergoes radical
surgery but Jane, taking an easier route, is cured by making a pilgrimage to a
local Moroccan saint. How  unjudgmental and egalitarian to equate medicine and
mystery;  and also, by the way, how very nonsensical.

The film is well made --  replete with all kinds of fancy effects and
flashbacks and dream sequences. I love the idea of draining color from the
characters' faces to signify that they have begun another of their symmetrical
"blackouts." But aside from the amnesias, there's not much to wonder at, at
least not if you've seen your share of caper/jewel thief films.

I loved the exotic North African locales. I'm chagrined to report that I didn't
recognize the wondrous Claudia Cardinale, who was 63 when the film was made.
Claudia had been a great friend to my youthful imagination.

The amnesia that afflicts Valentin and Jane is, as far as I know, unique in that
it comes and goes, appears and disappears. Less like an amnesia than an allergy
-- here one moment, then gone. But as a plot device, constant.

Title: Tobacco in My Life
Date: January 06, 2013

My lifetime tobacco consumption consists of one cigarette. Actually, half of
one cigarette. I believe it was a Lucky Strike. Or perhaps an Old Gold. It was
certainly one of these:   It was 1952. My older brother came home from a
summer job in the Poconos with a cigarette tucked into the sleeve, like this. So
cool, so macho:

That's not my brother, but it might have been (although he drove a Dodge). A
pack of Luckies in the shoulder was just about the most glamorous thing I had
ever seen.

So I tried one. I stole one of my brother's coffin nails, hid in the cellar, and
lit up.

It was hideous and I was bilious.

I confessed as much to friends who were already secret smokers. The word of
advice -- "After you do it for a while, you get over feeling sick."  Not a
persuasive argument, at least to me. It seemed stupid.

There were some years there when I faulted myself for not being as adventurous
as my peers. Just another example of my conservatism and caution. But now I
think that not finishing that cigarette may have been the single wisest act of
my otherwise brainless adolescence. If I had smoked that cigarette to the nub,
I'd still be fighting the addiction.

I was, in those days, surrounded by smokers. My father smoked an occasional
cigar but mostly a pipe, filled with Prince Albert tobacco.  It came in a can
something like this one:

He was forever fussing with his pipe -- knocking it, grinding out the remnants
of the previous pipeful, refilling, lighting up. It was quite a ritual. But
stinky nevertheless.

My mother smoked cigarettes, lots of them, until she came down with the ulcers.
I was often sent around the corner to the candy store to buy her a pack of
Chesterfields (no problem selling cancer sticks to children in those benighted
days). Our house always stunk, especially when friends of my folks would visit.
Everyone in their crowd  smoked. Mostly chain-smoked.

No air in our home, just smog.

It's hard to know how tall I would have been, or how intelligent, if I hadn't
been raised in a blue haze.

In college, my roommates all smoked. It didn't like it, but I didn't have
the courage to complain. In those days, the deck was stacked in favor of the
smokers, who had the rightaway. To object was to be fussy, or finicky, or
unmasculine. Some of the professors smoked while teaching -- an act which gave
the students permission to light up as well. It was nasty. Abstainers had no
purchase.

Then things began to change.  We went from this

and this

to this (in 1964):

And then throughout the '70s and '80s, there were the constant revelations
about the fakery and lying of the big tobacco companies, who chose profits and
destroying lives over honesty and public health.

Nowadays, no smoking in anyone's home, no smoking in buses or planes, no smoking
in restaurants, no smoking in government buildings, and no smoking (as of next
month) on the mall.

But I'll tell you what still makes me sick. It's a bunch of teen-agers, hanging
out in front of the coffee shop, puffing theatrically and addicting themselves
-- and subtracting an average of ten years from lives. In the old days, when
doctors smoked Camels, or were reputed to do so, there may have been some excuse
for smoking;  but now, when the evidence is all in, a kid who starts to smoke
is a complete raging fool.

I'm sorry but I have no nostalgia for the great age of cigarettes, though they
were, as a Lorillard executive once said, "the perfect product;  make it for a
penny, sell it for a dollar, and it's addictive as hell."

Title: How Rupert Brooke Died
Date: January 08, 2013

From a mosquito bite to his lip.

Rupert Brooke was an immensely talented young poet, best known today for the
hyper-nationalistic World War I sonnet, "The Soldier." He lived for just twenty-
eight years and his death was a tragedy for letters.

It's easy to be skeptical about the mosquito. I've been in the company of these
insects many times, and I've never been bitten on the lip. Mosquitoes seem to
avoid the mouth area -- at least, they avoid my mouth. But then, I don't know
anything about the habits of eastern Mediterranean mosquitoes.

Brooke was a sub-lieutenant with Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve; the mosquito
attack took place while his ship was anchored in the Aegean. He developed an
abscess and sepsis and as a result was transferred to a French hospital ship,
the Duguay-Trouin. He died at 4:46 pm on 24 April, 1915 and was buried in an
olive grove on the island of Skyros.

An unlikely death-- as odd and irregular as that of Aeschylus (struck on the
head by a tortoise dropped by an eagle), or Isadora Duncan (strangled by a scarf
entangled in the wheels of a motor-car). Or the unfortunate composer Jean-
Baptiste Lully, who, while conducting in the traditional manner by beating time
with staff, accidentally knocked his own foot, causing an abscess which became
gangrenous and fatal. Alas, no antibiotics in 1687.

My guess is that if Brooke had not been bitten and had survived Gallipoli (where
his ship was headed), the "pure and elevated patriotism" displayed in "The
Soldier" might have become less enthusiastic. Brooke  might have evolved in a
direction similar to that of his jaded-about-warfare contemporaries Siegfried
Sassoon, Wilfrid Owen, Isaac Rosenberg, Ivor Gurney, and Edward Thomas. But
we'll never know.

Title: A New Biography of Edward Thomas
Date: January 11, 2013

I've just finished a genuinely wonderful new biography by Matthew Hollis
called Now All Roads Lead to France, a Life of Edward Thomas. I'm dazzled, and
glad to be so. The book is carefully and comprehensively researched, literate,
sensible, and compassionate. Its author is confident enough not to overwhelm the
poor reader with pounds of extraneous detail. I'm not easily rivetted, but this
biography was truly rivetting. Thank you, Matthew Hollis.

I'm a longtime Edward Thomas enthusiast. Thomas learned how to employ the
language really used by men more successfully than some of his highly-regarded
predecessors. I didn't know much about Thomas's life, and therefore hadn't
realized (though I might have guessed had I been more astute) how much Thomas
had learned from Robert Frost. The two became inseparable friends during Frost's
English years and spent hours and hours together, neglecting their wives and
families but talking poetry and poetic language. Clearly, they cross-fertilized.

In fact, if you listen closely, you can hear overtones of Frost in Thomas's
best-known poem.

Yes, I remember Adlestrop -- The name, because one afternoon Of heat the
express-train drew up there Unwontedly. It was late June. The steam hissed.
Someone cleared his throat. No one left and no one came On the bare platform.
What I saw Was Adlestrop -- only the name And willows, willow-herb, and grass,
And meadowsweet, and haycocks dry, No whit less still and lonely fair Than
the high cloudlets in the sky. And for that minute a blackbird sang Close by,
and round him, mistier, Farther and farther, all the birds Of Oxfordshire and
Gloucestershire.

The first line of the poem is so casual and demotic that it sounds like what
later came to be called "found poetry." I'm glad to know that there is an actual
Adlestrop up there in the Cotswolds, though surely Thomas was well aware that
"Adlestrop" sounds as though it were invented by the Ministry of Silly Names.

The poem is a latter-day pastoral which contrasts the hiss of industrial steam
with the with perennial birdsong and cloudlets. A brief ecstatic revelation.

My all-time favorite poem by Thomas is this blank-verse masterpiece:

As the team's head-brass flashed out on the turnThe lovers disappeared into
the wood.I sat among the boughs of the fallen elmThat strewed the angle of the
fallow, andWatched the plough narrowing a yellow squareOf charlock. Every time
the horses turnedInstead of treading me down, the ploughman leanedUpon the
handles to say or ask a word, About the weather, next about the war.Scraping
the share he faced towards the wood, And screwed along the furrow till the
brass flashedOnce more.The blizzard felled the elm whose crestI sat in, by a
woodpecker's round hole, The ploughman said. 'When will they take it away?
''When the war's over.' So the talk began –One minute and an interval of ten,
A minute more and the same interval.'Have you been out? ' 'No.' 'And don't want
to, perhaps? ''If I could only come back again, I should.I could spare an arm,
I shouldn't want to loseA leg. If I should lose my head, why, so, I should want
nothing more...Have many goneFrom here? ' 'Yes.' 'Many lost? ' 'Yes, a good
few.Only two teams work on the farm this year.One of my mates is dead. The
second dayIn France they killed him. It was back in March, The very night of the
blizzard, too. Now ifHe had stayed here we should have moved the tree.''And I
should not have sat here. EverythingWould have been different. For it would have
beenAnother world.' 'Ay, and a better, thoughIf we could see all all might seem
good.' ThenThe lovers came out of the wood again: The horses started and for the
last timeI watched the clods crumble and topple overAfter the ploughshare and
the stumbling team.

Title: Sonnet for My Father
Date: January 12, 2013

I did not know that Edward Thomas sometimes made use of the entries in his
journal as the raw material for his poetry.

His practice is not unique. Ben Jonson boasted that he wrote all his poems in
prose first, then re-wrote them into verse.

So I decided to try an experiment. I took a blog post, written some years ago,
called What My Father Ate. For ease of reference, I reproduce it here.

"Sardines, by the tinful. Herrings, canned, either in wine sauce or in tomato
sauce. Whitefish. Lima beans which came into the house dried but which
were soaked to plump up, then boiled and mashed (but not for me, if I could
possibly avoid them). Potatoes in any form, but usually mashed and buttered.
No chicken or lamb chops, but lots of tongue. (When I left home, I vowed
never to eat tongue again, and I've kept the faith.) Chopped chicken liver.
Steak, when we could afford it. Roast pork with applesauce. Delicatessen
meats -- salami, baloney, corned beef, frankfurters. Baked beans, courtesy of
Heinz. Apples, right down to the stem. Chocolate in any form, but especially
white chocolate. Halvah, a particular favorite. Dates and figs, dried. Black
radishes and onions, covered with gribbinis. Tschav, borsht with huge helpings
of sour cream. Corn on the cob. No alcohol, nary a drop. On hot days,
no beer, but instead iced tea or iced coffee. Cheese, either Velveeta or
swiss. Good bread -- pumpernickel or rye. Crumb cake direct  from Ebinger's
Bakery. Bacon and two eggs, sunnyside up or soft-boiled. Cream o' Wheat.
Swee-Touch-Nee tea. On Sunday morning, bagels and rolls, warm from the oven,
eaten while reading the Times (25 cents) and the Eagle (10 cents). Ice cream,
the more exotic the flavor the better."

And then I turned it into a sonnet, with these results.

Fragrant, oily iridescent sardines,

Herring by the tinful, gefilte fish;

Lima beans, soaked, boiled, mashed and then buttered

Crowding the flesh to the edge of the dish.

Salami, baloney, baked beans, and tongue.

Chopped chicken liver, calf liver with bacon,

Corned beef, frankfurters slathered with mustard

Pastrami -- and anything delicatessen.

Roast pork with applesauce, roasted potatoes.

Black radish, gribbinis, onions, and rye bread,

Cheese -- cream,  Velveeta or Swiss --  on a bagel.

On Sundays, Ebinger’s crumb cake instead.

Apples, core and all, gnawed  down to the stem.

The flesh, the seeds, the skin – all gone just like him.

Doesn't seem to work for me. I guess you have to be a poet, which I obviously am
not. Or perhaps there's a problem with the raw material.

Title: Edward and Edna
Date: January 15, 2013

Edward Thomas died at the battle of Arras, in France, in April of 1917. He was
thirty-nine years old.

In this picture, he looks intense, suspicious, soulful, possibly even poetic,
-- but not the suffering-soul-kind of poet. When he joined the military, he
transformed himself into the stereotype of an officer. The new "look" was not a
success, in my opinion.

Before he went off to the war, Edward Thomas conducted a flirtation and possibly
an affair but more probably what they called in those inhibited days a "romantic
friendship" with Edna Clarke Hall. She was a beautiful, intelligent woman, an
artist. Here she is looking positively post-Pre-Raphaelite.

And here again -- youthful, delicate and glowing.

After Edward died, his wife Helen, herself a gifted, attractive and certainly
long-suffering woman,  wrote to Edna. "Why wasn't I beautiful to Edward? Oh,
I did so long for your beauty not to take it from him, not take but give, to
have hair & eyes & mouth & that something else....  I remember you so clearly
standing for all I longed to have to give him."

I am moved by Helen's grief and also by her generosity.

Edna Clarke Hall died at age 100 in 1979.

Title: Representative Markwayne Mullin
Date: January 15, 2013

I listened to an interview with Markwayne Mullin, a new member of the House of
Representatives, and had a hard time believing my ears. It wasn't that he was
inarticulate or stupid. It was that he was so utterly smug, so absolutely and
entirely certain of himself. He has no doubts. He knows exactly what ails the
country -- too much government -- and he knows how to fix it -- lower taxes,
less regulation, more free untrammeled capitalism. He does not seem to be aware
that the United States of America is a big, complicated, multi-faceted country.
Markwayne Mullin possesses all the arrogance of ignorance, in spades.

Here's some proverbial wisdom: "For every complex problem, there's a simple
solution, and it's wrong."

My father, who was not a military man, always liked to vote for people who had
served in the Army or Navy. "At least," he would say, "they have met people from
other parts of the country. Maybe they've served abroad and seen something of
the world."

Markwayne Mullin hasn't served in the military and there's no evidence on his
website that he's traveled far from his home of Westville (population 1596) in
Adair County in eastern Oklahoma. Here is Main Street, Westville:

He went off to college (Missouri Valley College, which, curiously, doesn't teach
foreign languages) but didn't stay long. His website says he's a successful
businessman, a plumber. More precisely (and I'll let his prose speak for
itself), "Mullin is proud to have turned a family trade into a thriving
business. Mullin Plumbing is most recognized due to its advertising and the
more than 100 employees known for their hallmark red vans visible servicing
Oklahomans across the state. For his part, Markwayne personally promotes the
company through television and radio advertising. One of his favorite jobs is to
produce and host the radio call-in talk show “House Talk.”

His positions are straightforward and clear (and red, red, red) -- an entirely
unoriginal litany of right-wing simplicities and pieties.

We are taxed enough. Cutting spending, not raising taxes, is the answer to
paying down debt.

The 2nd Amendment is crucial to ensuring our freedom.

Excessive government regulations, like those promulgated by the EPA, harm job
growth.

We must restrain an out-of-control bureaucracy.

Life — from the moment of conception to natural death — is sacred. I am a
100 percent pro-life conservative.

Our United States troops must NEVER be under control of the United Nations.

We spend too much on foreign aid. Our challenges here at home must come first.

Private industry creates jobs. The government creates dependency.

Traditional marriage, between one man and one woman, is a sacred institution
that must be preserved. Strong, healthy families are the heartbeat of our
nation.

Parents should have final decision-making authority in the education of their
children, because they know better than Washington, D.C., bureaucrats how to
best educate their children.

ObamaCare must be repealed.

Ensuring access to quality, affordable health care is one of America’s
greatest challenges today. The free market will meet the challenge if the
government will get out of the way. We must cautiously seek comprehensive reform
that protects the solvency of Medicare and Medicaid.

We must protect America’s borders to stop illegal immigration. Amnesty
proposals should be rejected.

Penalties should be strengthened against illegal immigration and law enforcement
given the resources for enforcement.

If it had been one of those call-in radio shows, I would have liked to ask Mr
Mullin a couple of questions, such as, how are we going to get the lettuce
picked and the roof fixed without all those immigrant laborers? How come life
expectancy is lower in the US than in socialist Europe, even though we spend
more on health care? How much do we actually spend on "foreign aid"? Who exactly
wants to put US troops under the control of the United Nations? Are people
like me, retired teachers who worked only for the government, really all that
dependent? and compared to whom? Who's attacking your traditional marriage
that you need to get all in a twist about other people's marriages? How come
when a not-for-profit hospital is taken over by a for-profit hospital, the
mortality rate immediately rises? To whom should we turn when the cantaloupe is
contaminated? Should we worry about global warming? Should we be concerned by
the concentration of wealth among the top 1% of families.What happens when a big
hunking tornado rips through Adair County?

My hope is that Markwayne Mullin, who as he begins his congressional career is
superficial to the very core of his being, will come to Washington, meet some
folks from different parts of the country and from different ethnic backgrounds,
learn a little about the world, come to an appreciation of the complexity of
things, and grow up to be a useful broad-minded compassionate public servant.
It's not impossible, but it's not going to happen until Mullin realizes that
he doesn't know everything about everything, and that the practices that made
Mullin Plumbing such a success may not be the same practices that will promote
the general welfare over all of the US of A.

I'm hopeful, but frankly, I'm not at all optimistic.

Title: Large Mammal News from Boulder, Colorado
Date: January 20, 2013

Mountain lions frequently wander from the foothills right into the heart of
town. It's routine for them to "take" a pet cat or dog. A full-grown mountain
lion can jump over the 8-foot chain link fence behind which you've sequestered
your golden retriever, kill it, and then grab it with its mouth and bound back
over the fence. The young lion pictured above has found itself on someone's back
deck. Good thing that there are no children enjoying themselves on the swings to
its left.

The lion doesn't seem to be fazed by her near-cousinhood to behind-glass-door
domesicated kitty. Stay inside, Muffy! You'll have a better day. .

A few months ago, wildlife officers killed a lion that had followed the deer
downtown and "showed no fear of humans." More commonly, officers shoot the lions
with tranquilizer darts and then banish them deep in the mountains west of town.

Mule deer are totally at home in our city. They're so common that no one pays
them much mind, except when they eat the shrubbery and the early spring flowers.
They're so acclimated to humans that they don't even shy when you come right up
to them. They just stare right back at you and go on eating your tulips.

Black bears are also frequent visitors. They patrol unsecured garbage cans,
especially in the fall when they're fattening up for hibernation. Recently, one
of them became quite a celebrity:

It was shot with a tranquilizer dart and dropped from its perch in a tree on to
a mattress, and was then transported back into bear country.

We have another celebrity animal this week, but the story behind it is not so
felicitous. A bull elk has been hanging out, for the last few years, right at
the western edge of town. He's become a friend, or perhaps a totem, to his human
neighbors. But for some stupid reason, two police officers (one of whom owns
a taxidermy studio) decided to kill it. Which they did, with a shotgun. The
"Mapleton Elk" has been mourned with a candlelight vigil; the police officers
have been charged with "suspicion of forgery, tampering with physical evidence,
attempting to influence a public official as well as unlawful taking of a trophy
elk, conspiracy, killing an elk out of season, unlawful use of an electronic
device to unlawfully take wildlife and first degree official misconduct." I'm
not proud of them.

Our local coyotes have also been in the news. Although we've always known they
were around, they've been discreet. But lately, they've taken to harassing
joggers on the Creek Path.

The plan is to "re-educate" them, but "lethal control" has not been ruled out.

Be sensible, coyotes! Stay out of sight. No nipping at the heels of strollers or
bikers.

Title: Terpen
Date: January 23, 2013

Before there were dikes there were terpen.

I was disgracefully ignorant of terpen until I read Robert Van de Noort's
North Sea Archaeologies: A Maritime Biography, 10,000 BC to AD 1500 (Oxford,
2011). Van de Noort devotes many pages to terpen, which are artificial islands
constructed between 500 BC and 1000 AD in parts of the Netherlands, Denmark,
and Germany. The earliest terpen were simple mounds on which a house was built;
later several or more would be joined together to form small elevated villages
protected against high tides and flooding. They might be as much as forty
feet high. With the coming of dikes (c. 1000-1200 AD), terpen ceased to be
constructed.

Here's a terp, viewed from above.

And here's another, photographed from ground level.

I've been to the lowlands and might have seen these peculiar topographical
features with my own eyes, but I certainly didn't register them. Even if I had,
I might have confused them with the grave barrows or tumuli that are common
in Scythian Bulgaria, or even with drumlins, which have a similar look to the
uneducated eye -- although drumlins are natural rather than man-made.

I love it that "terpen" retains its ancient plural, along with words such as
oxen and brethren. There aren't many such words in the language (children is a
reduplicated plural, the original "-er" plural supplemented by an -en plural --
and some day to be superseded, I predict, by "childrens").

Van de Noort's book is fascinating reading for those who like terpen and bronze-
age sewn plank boats and such. It's rich in detail but might have been even
richer if the author hadn't felt the need to waste space by calling the seashore
a "place of liminality" and shipboard "a heterotopia sailing upon the Deleuzian
ocean" -- and also indulge himself with many unconvincing  speculations
dependent on such peculiar,  modish, transitory vocabulary.

When it comes to odd words, give me the old ones every time. Here are some
satisfying lovely words that were as new to me as terpen: saltern (an area in
fenlands set aside for salt manufacture); cofferdam (a temporary dam), thwart
(a seat in a rowboat), leister (a two-pronged spear for fishing), dromond (a
medieval galley) and broch (a dry-stone tower).

Title: Revisiting Persona: 1967-2013
Date: January 30, 2013

When I saw Ingmar Bergman's Persona in 1967, I was pretty much baffled. Oh, I
understood the translated dialogue, and I understood the general idea that the
two women were similar and possiby melding into one, whatever that might mean,
but I didn't understand what it all signified, or how the "plot" was related to
the repeated abstract collages and to the heavy-handed religious symbolism. It's
hard to recall whether I was intimidated by the film or resented it -- I think
both, alternately and sometimes simultaneously.  Did I mumble under my breath,
"pretentious fraud?"  I can't say for sure.

I saw Persona again last night. I would like to tell you all, faithful readers,
that I have grown and matured into a discerning viewer, and that the once-opaque
film is now transparent. But I can't. It's still just as mysterious as it was
almost fifty years ago.  And I'm just as slow, or insensitive, or unaesthetic.

Even the "self-reflexive" moments -- i.e. when the audience is allowed to see
the camera -- seem obvious and not especially clever. Everyone has always known
that films are films. So what?

Inasmuch as I've seen many more films by Bergman (and many that I admire
tremendously), I am prepared to indulge the auteur. I think Persona is just so
personal to Bergman that it doesn't communicate. Whatever else it might be, it's
astonishingly self-indulgent. I confess that, at heart, I'm still suspicious of
the people who claim to understand and who are eager to explicate.

To the MGM DVD of Persona, an interview with Bibi Andersson, who spoke almost
all the film's dialogue, was appended. Ms. Andersson said that she knows that
some people considered Persona to be Bergman's masterpiece, but that she herself
didn't understand it.

I admire her candor.

Title: Amnesia on Film:  The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes (1970)
Date: February 03, 2013

As far as I can remember, and I've read the stories many times, Conan Doyle's
Sherlock Holmes never had to deal with amnesia, which in those days of reading
and writing had not yet become the most routine of plot devices. The Holmes of
Billy Wilder's movie runs into amnesia straight off the bat, when Gabrielle
Valladon, a handsome though mighty bedraggled woman, appears at 221-B Baker
Street apparently suffering a loss of memory precipitated by both a bump on
the head and a near drowning in the Thames. But there's a gimmick within the
gimmick: Mme. Valladon's amnesia is totally fraudulent. The lady is in "fact" a
German spy pretending loss of memory in order to insinuate herself into Holmes'
sympathies.

The audience falls for it, which is not a surprise, because we watchers have
been indoctrinated to willingly and enthusiastically suspend our disbelief at
the slightest hint of film's most common malady. But that Holmes should succumb
-- well, that's a bit of a disappointment. Fictional Holmes would have been a
lot more discerning, amnesia-wise, than filmic Holmes.

Title: Nineteenth-Century Romance
Date: February 08, 2013

I've several times poked fun at sad instances of Victorian sexual prudery. If,
gentle reader, you doubt that I'm capable of prude-pokery, check here, here and
here.

My mild animosity toward the sexual silliness of our ancestors originated in
my childhood. My father, though in most things a font of good common sense,
was, sexually speaking, very much a old-fashioned dyed-in-the-wool Victorian.
Whenever a discussion of sex or anatomy or reproduction would arise in our
house, he would immediately turn red and stumble out of the room. Early on, I
learned not to ask. On the few occasions when my poor papa mumbled something
before he bolted, his information was always uninformed, frequently wrong, and
occasionally dangerous.

My father inhabited an earlier psychological universe and he couldn't possibly
have imagined how the  invisible worm has turned. If he were alive today, he
couldn't watch movies or TV or read novels. Too much gross language, too much
frankness, too much nudity, too much casual coupling. He would have been aghast
and embarrassed.

Nevertheless, repression has its compensations. It is absolutely clear to me
that people of his generation and earlier experienced pleasures that cannot be
realized now. The brave new libertine world of hooking up and sloppy drunken sex
and XXX sites gratifies the instincts, but at significant cost.

Return we now to the last years of the nineteenth century, when Helen and the
great poet Edward Thomas went a-courting. In their young twenties, a couple of
years into their anguished relationship, they (in Helen's words)

were sitting in the undergrowth of a little copse in a remote part of the
common. Edward had said that he had never seen a woman's body, and I do not
remember quite how it came about, but I quite naturally and simply without any
feeling of shyness, knelt up in our secret bower and undid my clothes, and let
them fall about my knees so that to the knees I was naked.  I knew my body was
pretty, my breasts wre firm and round and neither too small nor too large, and
my neck and shoulders made a pleasant line, and my arms were rounded and white,
and though my hips were small, the line of the waist was lovely.  I was proud
of my body, and took the most innocent pleasure in its lines and health and
strength. So we knelt in the grass and dead leaves of the copse opposite to each
other, he silent and I laughing with joy to feel the air on my skin, and to see
his enraptured gaze. For as he knelt he gazed wonderstruck and almost adoring,
quite still, quite silent, looking now and then in my eyes with a serious
ecstatic look, his eyes full of tenderness and love, searching mine for any sign
of regret or shyness. He did not touch me, but just knelt there letting hie eyes
take their fill of the beauty that was filling his soul with delight. When,
without a word, I lifted my clothes about me, he helping me, he only then said,
'Helen, I did not know there was such beauty.'

Scoff as you will, ungentle readers.

I know -- it's prettified and romanticized. But it's an innocence that cannot
be invented. And I'm not scoffing. I don't think that there's a person on our
continent or in our century as naive as Edward Thomas was in England in 1898.
Nor do I think that there's anyone who could say what he said, and say it with
such bedazzled and wonderful sincerity: "Helen, I did not know there was such
beauty."

It's a world that we have lost.

Title: Ingmar Bergman's The Seventh Seal
Date: February 10, 2013

I remember that my first and until yesterday sole viewing of Bergman's The
Seventh Seal took place in August of 1958 at one of those big old downtown
Brooklyn movie palaces. I was in the company of Leigh Anderson and Alice Bruno,
who might not remember the day -- or remember me, for that matter.

It was a memorable occasion because Bergman mattered, or so it seemed at the
time. Like everyone in my age-cohort, I had grown up on westerns and crime and
horror and musicals. I knew what to expect in a movie theatre. A beginning, a
middle and an end, for one thing. A resolution. But then along came Fellini and
Kurosawa and Bergman and the rules changed. It was exciting and puzzling and
like other observant college kids, I was trying to figure it all out. Movies had
been Saturday entertainment;  I did not know that thee could be "intellectual."

The Seventh Seal took me by surprise in all kinds of ways. It was episodic and
the episodes didn't tie together into a linear narrative. Its emotional range --
from sexy to sordid to brutal to picturesque to ruminative -- was more than I
could fathom or follow. It didn't have a Hollywood plot -- no one ended up with
the money or the girl.  And then there were these long brooding silent shots in
which the point lay in the cinematography (I word I didn't wouldn't learn for
twenty years). I had no vocabulary to help me understand what I saw -- I didn't
even know the word "allegory", or if I did, I didn't connect it with movies.

Last night, The Seventh Seal came around again, this time not in a palace but
right there on the big hdtv.  I was hoping it would still be as magical as
it was in the 1950s, but alas, not so. It seemed, I'm sorry to say, stagey
and contrived and pretentious. The allegory -- the despairing knight's search
for meaning in a godless universe -- came across, last night, as shallow. The
discovery that there ain't a god out there does not shock this born and raised
atheist, although I do feel for Bergman and all those others whom it cost so
dearly to surrender the illusion.

and doesn't force up bad shots. Because he can score fifteen or twenty points a
game without a play being called for him.

Sure, he's occasionally out of place on defense.True, he hasn't yet learned how
to play the pick and roll. His offensive games is limited to putbacks and short
jumpers. And sometimes he has a bad game because the opponent is bigger and
better.

But he's learning. He's coachable.

And because he's the first NBA player to pledge support for gay rights. (Kenneth

Title: Redskins /Injuns/ Native Americans/ Human Beings
Date: March 11, 2013

In the beginning there was Tonto, the "faithful Indian companion" and there were
"renegades" who didn't want to live on the reservation. I was a perfectly naive
urban lad, and of course I bought the whole package.

In my defense, I early developed serious qualms at the Saturday westerns
where buckskinned redskins were regularly drilled by six-shooters to fall
picturesquely from pinnacles or palaminos. My first serious movie, Red River,
featured a memorable and even-then-revolting scene in which redskins were
remorselessly and shockingly slaughtered.

I'm proud to say that early on I started to identify with the underdogs.
Renegades indeed? But some of my sympathy was bought with eroticized stereotypes
of women (such as Debra Paget in Broken Arrow). And then there were Rudy York
and Allie Reynolds, who were real people. How to reconcile the stereotypes to
the facts? Beyond my childhood abilities.

It's astonishing how much of my view of our native cousins was generated by the
movies. And by Fenimore Cooper as well, although at this present moment the
only clear remembrance of the Leatherstocking saga that remains in my mind is a
gruesome scene in which fiendish Mohawk "squaws" torture a white captive.

In school there were maps of territory inhabited by the Navajos and the Iriquois
and the Comanche and the Pawnee. All very exotic but I for one had no concept
that these names signfied people with lives and identities and histories. P. S.
217 textbooks certainly did not use the word "genocide."

In the 1960s, I read perhaps a hundred "captivity narratives."  And also
Theodora Kroeber's very moving biography of Ishi. Exposure to these books opened
my mind.

And since then I've visited the cliff dwellings in Mesa Verde and read about
the vast city of Cahokia. But my knowledge remains literary, rather than
experiential. Although I live in the great west (and just two blocks from
Arapahoe Avenue), I've rarely encountered genuine native Americans -- they're
mighty scarse in these parts. And the few folks whom I've met who claim Indian
"blood" are far blonder than I.

Title: Neanderthal News
Date: March 15, 2013

We were not always the earth's sole hominid. Neanderthals (and Denisovans, and
Homo floresiensis (if they were truly distinct species) overlapped our time. 
Here are two skeletons, one of ours and one of theirs.

The first Neanderthals appeared perhaps a quarter of a million years ago
and certainly by 170,000 years BP. They seem to have supplanted Homo
heidlebergensis, a more distant cousin of ours, and they flourished from Spain
to Israel, as far north as Finland, and possibly as far east as the Altai
mountains in Siberia. In order to live in cold climates, they would have
clothed themselves, though of course not a trace of a garment has survived.
Neanderthals, it's been newly determined, carried a gene associated with pale
skin and red hair. Their brain cases were slightly larger than ours, but shaped
differently --  bulging at the sides and protruding in the back. Their rib
cases flared at the bottom and their pelvises were broad, which meant that their
strides necessarily involved a lot more hip rotation than our straightforward
gait. They were more robust than we, with heavier bones and muscles, and they
were much stronger. They ate more than we did and matured more rapidly -- their
wisdom teeth developed at six years of age. Earlier Neanderthal populations
appear to have been scavengers, but later ones were predators, capable of taking
mammoths and wooly rhinoceroses. The plaque of Neanderthal teeth reveal traces
of phytoliths which occur in the roots and leaves of plants. It's known that
they ate dates, barley and legumes. Both meat and plants were cooked. There is
some fragmentary evidence that they practiced cannibalism, but, I'd prefer to
think, only "survival cannibalism."  Neanderthals lived in bands or perhaps 8
or 10 members. They occasionally buried their dead, but left behind no evidence
of ritual or ceremony. They knapped chert and flint into scrapers and hand axes
and the knew how to bind stone to wooden handles with adhesives and sinew, but
they did not make use of bone tools.

They were gone from the earth about 20,000 years ago, displaced by homines
sapientes and perhaps reduced by changes in the climate or by other destructive
natural events.

Humans of European origin (but not of African or Asian) interbred with
Neanderthals, so that as much of 4% of human DNA is Neanderthal. On ther other
hand, no Homo sapiens DNA has been discovered in Neanderthal populations. No one
knows why the one and not the other.

This report is filched from Ian Tattersall's Masters of the Planet (2012), an
excellent book that brought me up to date on human origins. I recommend it
with genuine enthusiasm. It's learned, clearly written, and sensible. And it
displaces the cartoon history I grew up with in which monkeys lead to apes and
then to Piltdown (!!!) man and then to insurance salesmen in tie and jacket. 
The modern picture is more complicated and far more fascinating and also replete
with unsolved puzzles.

realize that Steve was only a couple of years out of grad school when I met him
(his career started late because of two Navy stints, one in WWII and one in
Korea). He was disarmingly casual, but nevertheless learned and intelligent. In
retrospect, I am stunned that he was able to listen to my adolescent blather
with a straight face. I also remember a dinner at his home where his genial
demeanor was taxed by the ferocity of his then-wife. Of his famous grandfather,I
tried but never got him to say a word. Letters and postcards from him were
appropriately signed, "Affably, SMP.  I remember that he helped me with my
undergraduate thesis, helped me to win a Wilson, and wouldn't let me quit the

I'm sorry to report that it was a bit of a disappointment: not nearly enough
biology and too much undigested "reception history."  Yes, it's true that
hyenas are regarded with almost universal fear and revulsion. perhaps because
they dig up corpses and run off with young children. But I knew that. And
although Brottman mentions the unusual sexual apparatus of female hyenas, which
causes so much difficulty with copulation and childbirth, she neglected to
remind us that hyena males lack a baculum.

Good pictures, however.  Here's one.

Not particularly lovable, I think.

I've seen a lot of stuffed animals in baby's cribs, but I've never seen a cute
stuffed hyena. Merely a sampling error, it turns out. Stuffed hyenas suitable

Shakuntala Devi, who died in India a week or so ago, was an incredible
arithmetician. She once "accurately multiplied two random 13-digit numbers in
a few seconds." "On a visit to this country, an American psychologist set her
two problems: the cube root of 61,629,875, and the seventh root of 170,859,375.
Shakuntala Devi gave the correct answers - 395 and 15 - even before he started
his stopwatch."

No one knows how she did this. No one has even advanced a persuasive theory.

It's difficult for me to remember a thirteen-digit number. I don't think I could
remember two thirteen-digit numbers. It's beyond my imagination to think about
multiplying them (to produce the correct twenty-six digit answer).

I'm wondering whether Devi's abilities seem so astonishing because she's out
there all by herself. If there were a cohort of people who could easily multiply
8, 9, or 12 digit numbers it wouldn't seem so wonderful that she could do 13.
But she's unique.

And intimidating.

But then I'm intimidated by Mozart, whose feats are also beyond imagining.

I wonder whether Ms. Devi carried some sort of genetic mutation. Is remarkable
proficiency at mental arithmetic an inheritable trait?  Which makes me wonder,
when did homines sapientes acquire the ability to learn the times table?  When
did the mutation for that trait first appear?

I telephoned my consultant on such matters, the blogger Political Mammal. He
says that the ordinary brain, yours and mine, does so many calculations just
when we walk down the street and compare this storefront to the one that went
out of business and to the similar one on the next block that, well,  we should
be just as astonished at quotidian events as at mental arithmetic.  I see his
point. Who knows how many synapses are firing now, even as I'm writing this
simplicity-itself post.

But writing a few words is a commonplace miracle;  extracting seventh roots --

Amnesia movies continue to thrive. This latest, The Vow, made a bunch of money
but was widely panned.  And should have been. It's a sad sad day when the
amnesia is more credible than the male lead.

The Vow purports to be based on the story of Krickitt (sic) Pappas, who lost
the memory of eighteen months of her life in a automobile accident. Her husband
re-courted her. and re-won her; they lived happily ever after. They're sticking
to the story that she never regained her memory of those lost months.

i have no particular reason to doubt the tale, improbably though it might seen.
The brain is another country; they do things differently there. And Rachel
McAdams, who plays Krickitt, is the most persuasive amnesia-victim I've yet
encountered. Because she doesn't take the amnesia for granted, Hollywood-wise,
but struggles to figure it all out, she seems to be genuinely afflicted.

Nevertheless, it's incredible that she should be in love with that lump of all
lumps, the lumpish Channing Tatum, who turns his character, Kim Carpenter, into
a affectless lump.  I've encounted talentless actors in my life, but Tatum is
something special.

Nor do I believe that the lovers either met or were reunited at the "Cafe
Mnemonic."

The Vow is pure, unashamed soap opera, although it is more credible about the
disease than most amnesia offerings, perhaps because it offers no cooked-up,
nonce oversimpliication of what's going on in the brain.

Title: Fowles, Snakes, etc.
Date: June 13, 2013

On the whole, Fowles, as befit his name, was a birder rather than a "snaker,"
so I don't know how he stumbled upon Clifford Pope's The Great Snakes. I am
not surprised that the one fact that Fowles gleaned from Pope's herpetological
knowledge that "snakes copulate for hours, sometimes a day at a time."  A very
Fowlesian piece of information.

I am surprised that he also reported in his journal the same snake anecdote that
Dr. Metablog noted right here on this very blog. Back in 2006, Dr. M.  made
mention of the instructions provided to early African missionaries on the proper
response to meeting one of those 25-foot-long,  300-pound reticulated Burmese
pythons. I found it in a book called Man the Hunted. Here's the story:

Remember not to run away; the python can run faster. The thing to do is to lie
flat on the ground on your back with your feet together, arms to the sides
and head well down. The python will then try to push its head under you,
experimenting at every possible point. Keep calm, one wiggle and he will get
under you, wrap his coils round you and crush you to death. After a time the
python will get tired of this and will probably decide to swallow you without
the usual preliminaries. He will very likely begin with one of your feet. Keep
calm. You must let him swallow your foot. It is quite painless and will take a
long time. If you lose your head and struggle he will quickly whip his coils
around you. If you keep calm, he will go on swallowing. Wait patiently until
he has swallowed about up to your knee. Then carefully take out your knife and
insert it into the distended side of his mouth and with a quick rip slit him up.

In 2006, Dr M. wrote:  "Well-meant advice, I'm sure, but perhaps difficult to
follow. Suppose you're just not in the mood to allow the python such liberties
with your person. Suppose you've forgotten to bring your knife; suppose
the python decides to start with your head rather than a foot. Suppose you
involuntarily wiggle just a teensy bit. Suppose you just don't feel that it's a
good day to be engulfed."  Fowles' comment is shorter but equally pertinent. 
He writes:  "And spend the rest of your life in an asylum."

When I realized that Fowles and I had a common interest in giant man-eating
snakes, I decided that the least I could to honor his memory was re-read The
Magus. Which I did, at first with enthusiasm and then with increasing dismay
as the the novel's flaws began to overwhelm its beauties. The Magus is too
contrived, too obvious. Nicholas Urfe, the naif, is so unsuspicious that he is
fooled by Conchis, the magician, over and over again -- many more times than is
remotely credible. The reader (the 2013 reader, that is, not the 1965 reader)
catches to the repeated gimmickry. But then after Urfe realize that he's been
sadistically manipulated, he stockholm-syndromes his tormentors far too rapidly
and cursorily.  It should take as much time to heal as to be harmed. As a
result the book is out of balance -- too long in the middle, too short in the
resolution. And then on top of that there's the heavy-handed Jungstuff and the
grade-school pop Freudianism!! O my gosh. I was embarrassed. And in addtion,
there is the deeply, unliberated Victorian attitudes toward sexuality in a book
that claims to be "advanced."  Anyway, it just did not work this time through.
What a disappoingment.

And I'm disappointed in Fowles as well. I began to read his journals in the hope
that he would be  complex and philosophical and aware, but, no, he was just
like me -- simple, defensive, insecure.

And what a snob: so much and so often worried about his bourgeois background and
so ashamed of his  well-meaning parents.

Most unforgiveable is not that he ran off with his best friend's wife, but that
he wouldn't let Elizabeth keep her daughter. He made her choose between him and
her own child.  In my view, a man should never come between a parent, a mother,
and her offspring. It's a violation of the natural order, if there is such a
thing as the natural order.

Nevertheless, I'm clinging to my most positive memoriesof Fowles The French
Lieutenant's Woman, which I still believe to be a novel that will last.  But
frankly, I'm just a tad frightened to re-read it.

Title: "Colloquial Conversation" in Othello
Date: June 29, 2013

There is an ocean of difference between colloquial conversation in real life and
the dialogue that appears in Shakespeare's works, even when his plays are at
their least artificial and most mimetic.

In its most ordinary use, the word "conversation" means nothing more that the
talk in which real men and women engage in the greater part of their social
lives. These conversations might include formal or semi-formal events such
as oration, debate, interview, negotiation, interrogation, official inquiry,
ceremony , arbitration, sermon, lecture etc. -- all of them linguistic
interactions that are governed by specific although for the most part
unarticulated rules. "Colloquial" conversation, on the other hand, refers
specifically to the wave of informal, unplanned, unregulated and unrehearsed
exchanges that occur over dinner, on the street, by the water-cooler, at the
tavern. Such conversations, although not incapable of eloquence, are on the
whole disorderly, sprawling and haphazard. They are brimful of uncompleted
or suspended thoughts (or thoughts introduced by one interlocutor and then
either completed or re-directed by another), with syntactic collapse and
improvisation, with references to shared experience that may seem to be grand
leaps of logic to an eavesdropper but that are perfectly intelligible to the
participants, with mumbles and grunts, extended pauses (some meaningless, some
momentous), with apparently inexplicable ellipses, with overlaps in which a
number of participants speak simultaneously, with unmediated zigzags from the
profound to the trivial, with repetitions and backtracks, with mis-speakings,
mis-hearings, clarifications, false starts, fragments, non-verbal but sometimes
significant ecphoneses or "response cries" (ooh-ooh), and with a flotilla of
other very ordinary and very natural curiosities. Real colloquial conversation
is spontaneous; it is the activity of two or more intelligences working together
to shape meaning. Real talk is essentially untranscribable, and students of
conversation who have made an effort to set such interactions down on paper have
had perforce to resort to elaborate and imperfect diagrams and codes.

In strong contrast, dialogue in Shakespeare's plays very seldom attempts to
approximate colloquial conversation. And with good reason: Elizabethan dramas
seldom stoop to represent the casual situations in which conversation is likely
to occur. Instead, the circumstances upon which the plays dwell are typically
formal or ceremonial, and the dialogue in which they are enacted consists for
the most part of speeches that delineate an emotion or moral response to a
conflict, of debates over the proper course of action, of reports on past or
distant events, as well as judicial or ritualistic confrontation, soliloquy,
meditation, prayer, boast, threat and counter-threat and various other kinds of
regulated discourse in which the artless and random quality of ordinary talk
would be entirely inappropriate. The dialogue in comedies, though in a different
register, is equally artificial, consisting as it does, of wit-combats, jests,
and the conceits that clownage keeps in pay. Shakespeare's most colloquial
exchanges, unlike real-life conversation, are on the whole orderly, sequential,
composed in intelligible syntax and in complete thoughts. It goes without saying
that dramatic dialogue is, with the exception of the rare improvisational
moment, not spontaneous at all but the studied product of a single controlling
intelligence.

During the first years of his career as a playwright, Shakespeare experimented
with a variety of revolutionary ways to compose dialogue (not generally, but
on propitious occasions) that, although not in any real sense congruent to
actual spoken conversation, nevertheless managed to create the illusion of a
natural and colloquial sound. The employment of dialogue that might pass for
real utterance was not an inheritance from earlier dramatists but was a craft
that Shakespeare had to develop on his own. The fabrication of such dialogue is
an unobtrusive art that does not call attention to itself -- in point of fact,
colloquial conversation is most successful when it is least noticeable. While
the great leviathan examples of Shakespeare's rhetorical mastery have been
subjected to exhaustive analysis, colloquial conversation is so small and so
inconspicuous a fish that it has managed for hundreds of years to slip the nets
of critical analysis.

There is a finely-crafted instance of seemingly-natural colloquial conversation
in Othello.

As Emilia helps Desdemona prepare herself for bed, the two women gingerly feel
their way toward an issue of great sensitivity -- the domination of women by
men. It is a relaxed and intimate conference, all the more obviously so because
it follows in the wake of an anguished and highly-wrought -- and rhetorically
elevated -- scene in which Desdemona has been slandered as an adulterer and as a
daughter of the game.

What techniques does Shakespeare employ to make the exchange between Desdemona
and Emilia appear quite so marvelously natural?

Attempting to console her sorrowful mistress, Emilia offers the opinion that
it would have been better if Desdemona had never known Othello. Desdemona
contradicts her serving-woman:

Des.  So would not I:  my love dost so approve him,

That even his stubbornness, his checks, his frowns

(Prithee unpin me) have grace and favor.

"Prithee unpin me" comes as a genuine surprise because it is syntactically
discontinuous from the sentence in which it is embedded. It's a separate topic.
Dialogue in Elizabethan drama ordinarily deals with issues sequentially rather
than simultaneously, but dialogue begins to sound a bit like conversation when
the interlocutors engage more than one subject at a time. That the two themes
of the discourse are located on different rhetorical levels (the rather formal
series of nouns in parallel -- stubbornness, checks, frowns-- in contraste to
the offhand parenthetical instruction), suggests that something interesting and
different is about to occur.

The progress toward real or realistic-sounding conversation, initiated with
"unpin me here," continues when Emilia's response engages neither Othello's
mysterious anger or Desdemona's unpinning, but introduces a third subject: "I
have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed."  With this sentence Emilia does
more than simply resume a discussion of so ordinary a matter as bedclothes, she
also replicates a common feature of colloquial conversation -- its practice of
referring without overt signal to a past mutual experience -- i.e. "you bade
me."

Now Desdemona drifts off in a direction of her own.

All's one:  good faith, how foolish are our minds?

If I do die before, prithee shroud me

In one of these same sheets.

"All[s one" -- with its variant "all's one for that" is a common Elizabethan
demotic catch phrase: here it serves a meaningless filler. Desdemona's meander
from death to shrouds to sheets is designed to reflect her own private, internal
non-volitional synaptic leaps. Her apology - "how foolish are our minds" -
reflects both Desdemona's and Shakespeare's knowledge that the sentences violate
the habit of dramatic dialogue in that they are ordered not by logic but by
association.

Emilia's mild but polite rebuke ("Come, come, you talk") is followed by a
sentence in which Desdemona introduces the fourth separate and distinct subject
of this unfolding conversation.

My mother had a maid called Barbary.

She was in love, and he she loved proved mad,

And did forsake her.

Desdemona has fallen into a reverie in which she re-lives an experience of
the childhood that Shakespeare has newly and spontaneously invented for her.
In these two-and-a-half lines, Shakespeare audaciously allows Desdemona to
introduce three new but extremely pertinent characters: Desdemona's mother,
hitherto unknown to the audience, her mother's forsaken maid Barbary, and
the maid's lunatic and inconstant lover. The effect of Desdemona's brief but
poignant recollection is to reinforce the illusion that she is an autonomous
speaker, giving shape to her sentences as they precipitate out of her battered
and not-entirely-disciplined consciousness. An astute audience (or readership)
will certainly notice that Desdemona projects her own plight onto these
imaginary meta-beings, and although the psychological ramifications of their
creation are rich indeed, Shakespeare's use of these improvised beings to mimic
the habits of real talk is as fully wonderful.

Desdemona continues:

She (.e. Barbary) had song of willow.

An old thing 'twas, but it expressed her fortune.

And she died singing it. That song tonight,

Will not go from my mind. I have much to do

But to go hang my head all at one side

And sing it like poor Barbary..  Prithee dispatch.

To enforce the quotidian quality of the dialogue, Shakespeare invokes a
phenomenon familiar to every reader or hearer: the tune that seems to repeat
of its own accord in one's mind. The result: Desdemona has been provided with
a memory, and her memory holds a song, and that song is now apparently going
to sing itself independent of the character's own will. But what occurs is not
only the illusion that Desdemona reveals an inner experience; it is also that
these reflections are cast in such courageously monosyllabic language. And just
to assure us that the characters not not float from their dock in the material
universe, Desdemona's instruction to Emilia --"Prithee dispatch" - sustains the
exact colloquial mode initiated by "Prithee unpin me" and anchors both women in
the real present.

Both song and reverie are now shunted aside as the conversation comes to a small
climax. The two ladies continue to imitate the randomness of real talk:

Emelia.  Shall I go fetch your nightgown?

Desdemona.  No, unpin me here.

This Ludovico is a proper man.

Emilia.  A very handsome man.

Desdemona:  He speaks well.

Emilia:  I know a lady in Venice would have walked barefoot to Palestine for a
touch of his nether lip.

Desdemona and Emilia drift from topic to topic: nightgowns leads by some
unarticulated but easy-to-imagine route to Ludovico and his masculine allure,
thence to Ludovico's habits of speech and at last to the very vivid and
memorable 'lady in Venice" -- a colorful personage who springs from Emilia's
fabricated pre-history, and who flashes across the stage in a hyperbole of
brilliant but unstressed beauty (and whose inexplicable passion asserts that
women can prosecute love-longing fully as irrationally as men). And then, just
when it seems as if the maid Barbary has been left in the lurch and forgotten,
the conversation turns back upon itself and Desdemona breaks into the song of
the poor soul who sat sighing by a sycamore tree. To reinforce the apparent
spontaneity of the moment, Shakespeare makes Desdemona repeatedly interrupt (and
even amend) her own singing :  "Lay by these"... "Prithee high thee;  he'll
come anon"... "Nay that's not next.  Hark who is't that knockes."  This broken
series of syntactically independent units, periodically intruded into the song,
are invented for the sole purpose of giving emphasis to the naturalness and
immediacy of the moment.

Shakespeare has therefore created the appearance of spontaneous conversation
by forsaking the straight path of normative dramatic dialogue. Desdemona and
Emilia intertwine present and past, real and fanciful, public and private, high
language and low, song and speech, understatement and exaggeration, syntactic
coherence and syntactic collapse, all within a context of shared knowledge and
almost sisterly intimacy.

The colloquial moment is fleeting, for even before the scene comes to a close,
Shakespeare returns to a more traditional dramatic idiom. Nevertheless, the
episode has done important work: Emilia's great feminist manifesto ("Let
husbands know,/ Their wives have sense like them") which will follow immediately
after this exchange, has been so effectively grounded in a real, earthy, and
contemporary context that it must stir every sensitive intelligence with its
grand appeal to equity.

It has long been acknowledged that the exotic Moor speaks in a highly
particularized, elaborate, and picturesque idiolect of his own - the music that
sweeps in with the icy currents of the Pontic sea and allows the Moor's great
dignity to find its grand expression. Desdemona and Emilia sing a far calmer
but more original song, and their impromptu domestic duet is surely no less and
perhaps even a greater artistic achievement than Othello's stupendous arias.

Title: Translation Conundrum
Date: July 01, 2013

Some years ago, I was doing time at a world-famous research library.  One of
the other inmates posed a problem to the assembled denizens. A Frenchman, he was
translating an American novel into his native tongue and there was a passage
in the book that he could not understand. He thought it might be a joke but he
couldn't make heads nor tails of it. He read us the passage. "Two men are in a
bar. The first man asks, 'What do you do with a giraffe who has three balls on
him.' The second man answers, 'Walk him and pitch to the elephant.'"

As I remember, everyone in the room "got it," but no one could suggest a good
solution to the translation problem. Word-for-word wouldn't do and an equivalent
was impossible to identify. I don't know what the poor fellow decided. Something
elegant, I hope.

Title: A New Much Ado (2012)
Date: July 04, 2013

The new Much Ado is a charming, understated success. The actors are not trained
Shakespeareans; they're tv series folk, and they say the lines conversationally
and casually, paying scant attention to the verse or to the mannered prose
rhythms. It works, on the whole, although some of the great lines are delivered
so unemphatically that they're swallowed and lost. Whoever would imagine that
Benedick's "the world must be peopled' could slip by an audience without e'en a
giggle. The text is judiciously pruned -- the only major omission the nighttime
ceremony for presumably dead Hero -- but that's a scene that has always made
me uncomfortable so I wasn't sorry to see it go. The Dogberry-Verges sequence
is a brilliant deadpan triumph. There's very little added business, thank you,
but what there is, is choice. The actress who plays Beatrice (Amy Acker) has
borrowed so much from Emma Thompson's delivery (in the last filmed Much Ado)
that if you were to close your eyes, you'd think that you'd time-traveled back
to 1993.The director, whom I had never heard of but is apparently famous, is
Joss Whedon. Thanks, Joss.

I've seen many many modern films in which hero and heroine don't get on at first
but little-by-little find themselves in love and in marriage. But Shakespeare
was there first. Beatrice and Benedick are the mom and pop of a half-a-zillion
subsequent comedies. It's good to see them as alive and thriving as they are in
this realization.

Title: "Barefoot to Palestine"
Date: August 30, 2013

I'm enchanted by a sentence in Othello that is spoken by Desdemona's lady-in-
waiting, Emilia. She's helping Desdemona to undress and the two women are
engaged in informal chat. Desdemona, perhaps wondering why she had the
misfortune to fall in love with exotic Othello, allows her mind to wander. It
comes to rest on a countryman of hers, a good-looking man named Ludovico. And
then her interlocutor Emilia praises handsome Ludovico in words that should
compel every sentient being to gasp in astonishment and admiration.

About Ludovico, Emilia makes a remarkable claim: "I know a lady in Venice
would have walked barefoot to Palestine for a touch of his nether lip."

All that needs to be said is, wow! But let me try to explain why the sentence so
transfixes me.

It's hyperbole, but not the ordinary hyperbole of largest or smallest or coolest
or most awesome. It's a hyperbole beyond hyperbole. A lesser writer might have
said, "I know a lady who would have walked a long way to make love to him." Not
Shakespeare. For "a long way," Shakespeare give us "barefoot to Palestine";
for "make love" he offers "a touch of his nether lip." It's extravagant and
wheeling.

A hike, shod, to the holy land, would have been a long and exacting journey.
Barefoot, beyond belief. The evocative word "Palestine" infuses religion and
sanctity into a sentence about sex and desire -- and therefore generates a love-
longing that is as powerful, as silly, and as ill-planned as a crusade. And for
what aim? Not even, for this mythical lady hiker, a big, zonking, mouth-filling
kiss; simply for the merest contact of lips. No, not even lips, just one lip --
the lower one. It's an hyperbole of minimalism.

In the poetry that Shakespeare knew from his childhood, it was men who would
make the vows and undergo the trials to court their beautiful ladies. But this
lovely sentence reverses the convention. It is, so to speak, Sadie Hawkins day
in Venice.

Emilia elsewhere asserts that women have desires as strong as lovers of the
other sex; here she demonstrates that women's love-longing can be as ridiculous
(and as powerful) as men's.

And everyone who knows Othello will hear in the word "Palestine" an intimation
of the violent act that once, many years ago, shook Aleppo.

Title: Yet Another Note on Nineteenth-Century Horsedrawn Vehicles
Date: September 16, 2013

How are we new-millenium readers supposed to grasp the social significance of
nineteenth-century horsedrawn vehicles when even characters in nineteenth-
century novels can be easily baffled?  True enough that Miss Alice Vavasor and
Lady Glencora are both very young ladies, and true also that they've lived
marvelously protected lives, but still -- such appalling ignorance:

" [Alice Vavasor] saw a light stylish-looking cart which she would have called a
Whitechapel had she been properly instructed in such matters, and a little low
open carriage with two beautiful small horses....

"Dear Alice, I'm so glad you've come....  Your maid can go in the dog-cart with
your things!" -- it wasn't a dog-cart, but Lady Glencora knew no better."

A dog-cart was not pulled by dogs. It was an informal vehicle with a recessed
box or cage in which dogs were transported. Trollope lords it over his Lady
Glencora for her ignorance of such plebian matters. And a Whitechapel? There's
no footnote in my edition of Can You Forgive Her and neither google nor
wikipedia hazards a guess (though Wik is well aware of a "deathcore" band of the
same name), so I'll just go with "light stylish cart."

And now add "Whitechapel" to the list: barouche, basket carriage, berlin,
britchka, brougham, buckboard, buggy, cabriolet, caleche, cariole, carryall,
chaise, chariot, clarence, concord wagon, coupe, croydon, curricle, cutter,
daumont, dearborn, dennet, diligence, dog-cart, fiacre, fly, fourgon,
four- wheeler, gig, go-cart, governess cart, hansom, herdic, jaunty car,
jersey-wagon, kibitka, landau, patache, phaeton, pill-box, post-chaise,
rockaway, shandrydan, shay, sociable, spider-phaeton, spring-van, stanhope,
sulky, surrey, T-cart, telyezhka, tilbury, tarantass, trap, troika, victoria,
vis-a-vis, wagonette, and wurt.

Title: Can We Forgive Anthony Trollope?
Date: September 29, 2013

Friends of long standing know that Vivian de St. Vrain, alter ego and nom de
blague, makes two boasts that go a long way toward the establishment of a
substantial worldly identity: a) I've never eaten a McDonald's hamburger,
and b) I've read all forty-seven of Anthony Trollope's novels. Old info for
old friends, but for those internet pilgrims who've just stumbled upon this
website, I know what you're thinking -- what a fascinating personality is Vivian
de St. Vrain!!  What a heady and disorienting combination of discipline and
indulgence and whimsy!!!!  What a guy!!

And not only all of Trollope's novels, but many of them multiple times!!

In fact, I've just now re-read Can You Forgive Her?, the first 800-pager of
the six Palliser novels. This would be either my third or fourth reading -- and
almost certainly, considering my "maturity," my ultimate passage. And what is my
mature judgment, you ask?

I love Lady Glencora more and more. The poor dear was sandbagged into an
arranged marriage but she has spunk and grit. She's attracted to the handsome
sexy guy from the other side of the tracks and she's not going to let him go
easily. Trollope doesn't say so in so many words, and perhaps can't admit it
even to himself,  but she's locked in the classic D. H. Lawrence situation.
She's married to a precious dry article in Planty Pall, a refrigerator of a man
who can't be much fun in bed, no fun at all we think, and she has yearnings. If
it were a Lawrence novel, Lady G. would leave the future Duke and gambol  in
the woods with Burgo Fitzgerald, thread her mound with flowers, live on berries
as long as they lasted, and celebrate her release from prudery in overblown
purple prose. But because it's the middle of the nineteenth century, she is
saved from disgrace -- narrowly -- and learns to renounce her proto-Lawrencian
stirrings. Not without pain.

If there's a miracle in the novel, it's that she gets herself pregnant, and by
her husband. A deus ex machina last-minute rescue! But we readers wonder,
how did it happen?  Plodding Planty Pall doing his duty, meeting his sense of
obligation to his forebears and descendants?  We're surprised that the old
stick had it in him, even though, we're repeatedly told, he's not yet thirty
years old.

Trollope loves his rebellious women, as long as they don't rebel too much, and
as long as they mind that they're subordinate. And also, that they not do much
reading or acquire learning.

And yet I can't help but think how George Eliot would have taken the same
situation and turned it into more than a novel of manners. She would have
transformed it into a critique of the entirety of Victorian culture. Trollope
does not know enough or doesn't care enough to engage the larger issues. But
then, no one, except George Eliot, could do so. Well, there's also Tolstoi.

The novel has its dry spots, but the brilliant parts are absolutely brilliant.
The conversation between Plantagenet and Glencora after the ball, after Lady G.
doesn't run off with Burgo, is utterly scintillating. Trollope is a novelist's
novelist.

He's also good with Alice Vavasor, who like Glencora, goes up to the line but
never crosses it. I think Trollope overdoes it when he turns George into an out-
and-out villain. It's unnecessary and melodramatic. He should have trusted
Alice, and trusted his readership also. We knew that George was a rotter long
before his resort to violence.

And what shall we say about John Grey, Alice's long suffering on-again, off-
again fiance and patient Griseldo. He's just too good for words -- so good
that he becomes otherworldly, almost allegorical. Can a man be so passive and
still be admirable and marriageable, even in an era in which renunciation was
the virtue of all virtues? All in all, John Grey is not credible. Not as a
character, not even as an ideal.

Question of the day for Dr. M?  Should he go on with Phineas Finn and his Irish
friends, or should he stop now?

I think I'll wait and see if I can find someone to tread this path with me. I
don't know that I want to go it alone. Some pleasures should be shared.

I was thirteen years old when Eisenhower-Nixon defeated Adlai Stevenson. I
was of course horrified. In what sort of nation, I thought, could a doddering
simpleton with a dark mccarthyite machiavel at his ear defeat an intelligent,
educated, humorous progressive. Ghastly, ghastly.

Mullling this over this morning, I remembered that while Truman was still in
office, postage stamps would be cancelled (hand-cancelled in those days) with
the inscription, "Twenty-five years of Social Security." But right after the
Eisenhower inauguration, the slogan was altered to "Pray for Peace."

A message about a concrete program that actually helped people suddenly turned
into a meaningless, faux-religious instruction. "Pray for Peace" did not seem
then, nor now, like a viable political position. "Pray for Peace" did not speak
to me.

Sixty years later and the Republicans are still beating the same meaningless
drum, still going backwards.

Not only have the damn Republicans not caught up with the age of reason, but
they're still embracing the dark ages. The hole into which they've inserted
their collective heads is not only deeper but considerably more vacuous.

Title: An Incontrovertible Proof of Evolution

'The placement of the human male genitalia is ridiculous and ill-conceived.
What in the living heck are such sensitive and vulnerable organs doing right
out there -- in front, dramatically positioned to be bumped by furniture or
careless hands, struck by flying objects, or pummeled by grandchildren. In any
intelligently-designed universe, the penis would be entirely retractable, making
its appearance only when summoned. (Nor would it be a dual-purpose organ. Every
engineer knows that dedicated instruments always perform better than devices
that combine functions.

Moreover, the testicles would be buried deep inside the body cavity, as, for
example, the spleen or the ovaries -- not hanging loose, ungirded and swattable.

Freud once remarked that the male organs of generation have not evolved in the
direction of beauty. And therefore not even the crassest male flaunts his stuff
to attract a mate. Or never did, not until the coming of the internet. If the
parts weren't intended to beautiful, then they might as well have been concealed
and protected. But not so.

Why are they where they are?  The culprit, obviously, is evolution --
specifically, the shift to upright posture. Four feet on the ground and the
apparatus is tucked away behind the hind legs, way back there in the anterior.
Protected, inconspicuous, and discreet. Stand up, and there they are just where
they shouldn't be. A three-year-old child with a box of crayons could produce a
better design than frontward-facing genitalia.

Instead, we're left with either another example of divine under-achievement,
or further and supererogatory confirmation that the universe is disorderly,
aleatory, and improvisational.

It was when women joined in standing upright that breasts came into prominence.
There is no other  mammalian species in which the organs of lactation are so
clearly displayed. But female breasts had the good sense to evolve into an
essential part of sexual display.  "Hey, mister, look at these. Look how well I
can nurse your babies."

Now there, at last, is an evolutionary outcome that makes sense.One that a guy
can bring himself to endorse and admire.

On the telephone, The Daughter (as she sometimes calls herself) was fussing
about her teen and tween children. "I'm on the warpath (her metaphor) about the
mess. I'm tired of cleaning up after them. Right now T. has left a pile of her
homework on the kitchen floor. She's at ballet for two hours. What do I do? 
Walk around it or clean it up. Why does she do this?  And O. has left half a
sandwich and piece of apple on the table. I failed to train them when they were
young and now it's hopeless."

Every parent in North America, and perhaps every parent in the known universe,
might make the same complaints.

I tried to console The Daughter. "If you'd like to take ten minutes to vent, I'm
here to listen."

She vented for thirty seconds, then fell silent. Frustrated.

I said, "Here's the way I think of it now. You lose every battle, but you win
the war."

"Explain," she muttered.

"It's obvious. When you and your brothers were growing up, there was some
sort of conflict every day. One of you didn't show up for dinner. Whoever was
supposed to take the garbage out, 'forgot' to do it. Someone would get into a
screaming fit at someone else over nothing significant. Quarters would be stolen
out of pants pockets. Some inches of liquor would mysteriously disappear. Sassy
words would be spoken to parents and parents would be devastated. Someone wasn't
sleeping at the house where he or she said he or she was going to spend the
night. Mileage on the car speedometer would increase without explanation. There
were horrible scenes when someone was asked to do the most minimal of chores.

And yet, despite it all, despite the fact that every day I lost the battle,
I won the war. Each of you turned out to be what my own father used to call
'solid, taxpaying citizens.' You've all doing good works. All living upright,
moral lives. All creating healthy, functioning families. All of you are
excellent parents. The grandchildren are thriving.

So in the long run, I won. Lost every battle, won the war."

The Daughter said, "Blog it."

It had been a while since I last flew Frontier --the airline with the cute
furry anthropomorphic talking mammals on their tails. There have been changes
-- all of them for the worse. There's now an extra charge for each piece of
luggage. Those free meals are a thing of the remote past.  So are the days
when you would get the entire can of ginger ale or tomato juice. It's now a
splash of juice in a cup of ice. No free TV -- you swipe your card, they swipe
your cash. The seats are smaller, too. More rows, less leg room.  Wasn't there
a time when air travel was glamorous?  Now it's just a big Greyhound in the
sky, a warehouse on wings.

Not only was my seat compressed, but the back didn't recline. Somehow I had
been assigned a seat that backed onto the emergency exit row. In earlier
planes, such seats used to recline, but I'm guessing that Frontier has gained
a few inches by rendering the backs immobile -- at the cost of my comfort (but
not at reduced cost).

Adding to the insult is an unapologetic sign on the back of the seat in front
of me inscribed with the words  NO RECLINE THIS ROW. I wonder what language
the author of this sign thinks he is using. Not English, that's for sure.  "No
recline this row" does not even come close to parsing. What would it have cost
Frontier to affix a sign that read "the seats in this row do not recline." 
Where do they outsource their signs -- to the writers of 1940s cowboy and faux-
Indian movies?  No recline this row! Come on, frontiersmen; you can do better
than that. If you have no respect for me, at least have a little respect for the
language. The talking animals speak better English.

To the chief of sign-makers at Frontier I say, "No hire this job."

There was another sign for me to stare out while I sat there, miserably
cramped, watching the clock.  "LIFE VEST UNDER YOUR SEAT." Isn't Frontier
banging the frugality drum a little too hard?  The sentence might have read,
"Life vest IS under your seat." How much could a trifling copulative verb
cost?  If Frontier wanted to be truly prodigal, it could even have raised
the cash to provide an indefinite article:  "A life vest is under your
seat."  Wow. A complete sentence!. What a concept!

(Orignally posted 2011:  2013 update: no free beverage at all nowadays;  the
cart is only for paying customers. I didn't bother to ask how much for the
plastic cup of water. My prediction:  next time, there will be a charge to use
the bathroom.)

I've been reading Trollope's Palliser novels again -- my third or fourth time
through this series of six great big whoppers.  It's a familiar tour -- but
with enough forgettings and misrememberings on my part to keep me focussed and
surprised.

I finished The Eustace Diamonds late last night. I know that I read this novel
for the first time in 1961 because it was in the curriculum of a course taught
by showman Professor Edgar Rosenberg. I haven't the siightest recollection of
that early reading or of Rosenberg's lectures either, but then, sixty years have
gone by and larger and larger cavities riddle my porous Swiss cheese brain.

The Eustace Diamonds is rich in both plot and character.  In addition to
the usual "who is going to marry whom" scenario (three separate instances
here) and still another version of the handsome but weak  hero who is going
to the dogs but redeems himself in the last installment, there's a genuine
cops-and-robbers mystery along with three separate detectives (none of them
as competent as Mr. Bucket). And then there's also a riotous profusion of
characters. Some, like Mr. Benjamin and Mr. Mealyus, products of Trollope's
uncontrollable disgust with those nasty Semites, merely disfigure the page.
Others are stock characters who appear in novel after novel, the name alone
changed:  in this case the the patient Griselda figure Lucy Morris. But then
there's a glorious almost Dickensian abundance of highly-marked, genuinely
individualized and extremely imaginative, credible inventions.

There's Lizzie Eustace, with her fibs, taradiddles and utterly conscienceless
lies; George de Bruce Carruthers, who has an eye for the main chance but knows
how to protect himself against pretty women; elderly Lady Linlithgow, who's all
tart tongue and selfishness; Lord Fawn, a pitiful small-minded aristocrat; and
the bustling opportunistic hypocrite Mrs. Carbuncle.

And then there's Lucinda Roanoke, who inhabits a corner of the novel but
who is fascinatingly perverse. She's an American, very young and handsome,
impecunious, who's being shopped around to snare a husband. Under pressure,
and against all good sense, she accepts an offer from the brute Sir
Griffin Tewett. Lucinda has no intention of becoming an obedient wife. The
engagement becomes a war of attrition between the "lovers."  Sir Griffin holds
on only because, it appears,  he doesn't like to lose and because he assumes
that he'll be able to control Lucinda once he's married and has legal authority
over her. He looks forward to the only sort of sex that might occur, which
woud be nothing less than rape. Lucinda is sex-averse and finds even a kiss
to be abhorrent. As the wedding day approaches, she announces that she will
never be Sir Griffin's bride. She threatens both murder and suicide. On
the morning of the long anticipated day, she simply refuses to leave her
room. Trollope tells us that she has gone mad. And that's the end of the
affair.

Lucinda doesn't quite fit into the space. On the surface, the episode makes the
point that women were offered no place in society except obedient wife. But
this is not comedy of manners;  it's pathology. Sir Griffin is a sadistic
monster. Lucinda does not want to submit, and therefore "chooses" insanity.
Trollope does not follow Lucinda into her madness; instead, he dismisses her
from his novel in exactly the same way that the English society dismisses such
women. Trollope can't make a drop of sense out of the situation that he himself
created. Lucinda deserves, and will earn, a novel of her own. But it won't be
written by Anthony Trollope.

Title: Another Gosse-Pearlman Xmas
Date: December 30, 2013

And so we've come to the end of the "holiday season" once again.

Another Christmas, another winter solstice, another St. Lucy's day with
its deepest of midnights. Even here in ever-sunny Colorado, things are a
bit gloomy. However, I have every confidence that another spring is just
around the corner. I don't need to bring greenery into the house in order to
prevent the dragon from swallowing the sun. The days, now so abbreviated, will
lengthen and in five weeks we'll see the first crocuses and a week later the
daffodils and pussy-willows. It's going to happen. But as always, the last
days of the year challenge me.

I'm relieved and happy that Christmas and the whole Christmas business is done
and gone. No one wants to be a scrooge and I don't want to frown on carols and
gift-giving and plum-puddings and good fellowship, but in my heart, let me
confess, I don't like the holiday. I can't make sense of the virgin birth or
the sacrifice of the only-begotten son. I don't even respect the story-- to
me it's just dressed-up scapegoating. Moreover, Jesus' revolutionary message
about caring for the poor seems to be ignored or repudiated by Christianity's
most vociferous advocates. And then there's all that incongruous stuff that
has accreted around Christmas -- the hype and the commercialism and the
religious chauvinism and the reindeer and the tactless triumphalism. It's both
incomprehensible and offensive to me.

And I'm in good company. I have allies. Let us go back to the beginning of
Athe merican experience with Christmas.

If the profoundly religious seventeenth-century founders of our country had
a single favorite Biblical moment, it's when the Lord (speaking through His
prophet Amos) severely condemned the vanity of holidays. "I hate," said
the Lord, "I despise your feast days, and I will not smell in your solemn
assemblies." The Lord of Hosts specifically enjoined against the attempt to
placate him by sacrificing animals (a matter of topical concern in Amos's time).
"Though ye offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings, I will not accept
them; neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat beasts." Nor did
He rest with these easy-to-follow injunctions, but He went on to condemn all
musical tributes as well. Nor more chants, glees or carols: "Take thou away
from me the noise of thy songs; for I will not hear the melody of thy viols."
Our Puritan forefathers recognized that the Lord opposed not only rituals
and music but all formal observances and rote piety. The Ancient of Days was
moved not by empty ceremony but by right action and good behavior. Instead of
squeaking timbrels and sounding brass, why, "let justice run down as waters,
and righteousness as a mighty stream." Taking these uncompromising sentences
as their guide, our founders dug in their heels against the ostentatious
celebration of all holidays, especially Christmas.

I applaud the old guy, the Father, and I revere Amos. His mantra bears
repeating: "Let justice come down as the waters, and righteousness as a mighty
stream."

The neglect of "righteousness" in favor of buying things makes me melancholy. I
would be happy to see fewer purchases and more good deeds. It would help us
through the dark months.

The winter solstice is a sensitive time for me because it's the anniversary
of my father's birthday. He arrived to no poorer family on the planet on the
darkest day of the year, the twenty-second of December, 1904. ‘And they
called his name Emanuel, God with us,’ -- but whether by accident or design, I
have no idea. My father lived a long and just life. He had many virtues -- one
of them that he was the least materialistic person ever. He had no possessions
and craved none. But he was righteous.

I don't know how anyone could write a biography of Emanuel, my father. There
was so little plot, so little conflict in his life. He went about his business,
raised his family, kept to the straight and narrow. His memory is a blessing to
us.

At this time of the year I turn once again to one of the most
challenging fathers in literature. The voluminous works of Sir Edmund Gosse
are not much read nowadays except by specialists in Edwardian literature, but
Father and Son (1907) still stands as one of the world's great autobiographies.

The father in Father and Son is the biologist Philip Henry Gosse, whom Charles
Darwin once called "an honest hod carrier of science." The older Gosse was a
minister and a leader of the Plymouth Brethren, a very strict, very puritanical
splinter of English Protestantism -- one that could easily have taken Amos as
its prophet and leader. According to his son Edmund, P. H. Gosse held that
the celebration of Christmas was "nothing less than an act of idolatry. The
very word is Popish, [my father] used to exclaim, 'Christ's Mass!' Then he
would adduce the antiquity of the so-called feast, adapted from horrible
heathen rites, and itself a soiled relic of the abominable Yule-Tide. He would
denounce the horrors of Christmas until it almost made me [that is, Philip
Henry's son Edmund Gosse the autobiographer] blush to look at a holly berry."

A passionate man, Philip Henry Gosse. A difficult father. Can we Imagine how
Philip Henry Gosse would have suffered to behold a twentieth-century American
Christmas: muzaked "Silent Night" in a shopping mall. Or even --horror of
horrors --the odious, saccharine "Little Drummer Boy." There's not a sappier
song in all of creation.

In Father and Son, Sir Edmund recollects a Christmas of his youth. One
boyish year he defied his father and, putting his immortal soul in danger,
secretly ate some Christmas plum-pudding that had been offered to him by
'rebellious' servants. But then, overcome with guilt and stomach-ache, he flew
to his father, crying out "Oh! Papa, Papa, I have eaten of flesh offered to
idols!" Philip Henry then "ran with me into the midst of the startled servants,
seized what remained of the pudding,... and ran till we reached the dust-heap,
when he flung the idolatrous confectionery on to the middle of the ashes, and
then raked it deep down into the mass."

A frightening episode for a nine-year-old -- but beautifully told. Only an
accomplished writer of comedy (and one who was steeped in Dickens) could
have invented a phrase as marvelous as "idolatrous confectionery," where the
triviality of the noun undermines the high seriousness of the adjective.

Compared to Amos and to the Plymouth Brethren and to Philip Henry Gosse, my
own resistance to Christmas is trivial. I'm a dissenter, but a dissenter in
moderation.

In fact, I'm not even a Puritan -- I'm delighted with the baked ham and the
sweet potatoes. Moreover, I have devised a Christmas custom of my own. Every
December 25, I reserve three hours to listen to Handel's Messiah -- not out of
piety or reverence, but because the oratorio is so marvelous that it's almost --
almost -- sacred.

There are many Messiahs, but In our house, the performance of choice is,
inevitably, the extremely intelligent Pearlman version (Boston Baroque Orchestra
and Chorus-- Martin Pearlman, Conductor [Telarc 80322]). Blessings and honor
and glory and hallelujahs be unto George Frederick Handel and unto his
unsurpassed oratorio.

So this year and every year: rejoice greatly but appropriately, ye sons and
daughters of Zion!

Title: Stereotyping One Particular Class of Fellow Citizens
Date: January 12, 2014

i've been following the Bridgegate scandal -- the vindictive sabotaging of
traffic entering the George Washington Bridge by Governor Christie's staff with
the connivance and wink-wink approval of the governor hmself. I'm appalled --
is this the kind of man to whom we should offer the bully pulpit?

I've even gone so far as to read the internet comments to columns in the
New York Times. While some people who take the trouble to contribute  have a
reasonable point to make, there's a refrain that distresses me, all the more
so because it's a sentiment that no one bothers to refute. Here are three
representative examples.

"Like most politicians, the man [i.e. Governor Christie]  is a classic
sociopath."

"Politicians have a truth gene missing in their DNA."

"All, and I mean all. politicians are dishonest, deceitful, untruthful and
corrupt."

It's a common enough sentiment. We've all heard it.

One of our local school board members once said this to me: "When did I become
untrustworthy, a liar?  When I was citizen with kids in the school, I was an
honest well-meaning citizen.  But as soon as I was elected to the school
board, something must have happened to me, because  I began to be accused of
all kinds of chicanery and corruption. I went from 'citizen' to 'politician.'"

Or, you could say it this way: the stereotype kicked in.

I've never held public office myself, but I've known many "politicians" pretty
damn well-- members of school boards, members of our city council, county
officials and commissioners, many members of our state legislature, a couple of
state office-holders and at least two of our representatives to Congress. 
And here's what I know:  they're honest and talented people who
sacrifice time and money to serve the public. They work very hard and they
absorb a tremendous amount of abuse for little reward.

Of course there are vile and corrupt politicians. But there are also very
many public-spirited statesmen who rise to the challenge of governing this
complicated nation of ours.

Let us be fair to our fellow citizens.  And let us purge these ridiculous
stereotypes.

Title: Three Dreams in One Ten-Minute Period at 3 in the Morning, Eeek!
Date: January 29, 2014

The first (the most ordinary, the least wild):  I'm sitting in a basketball
stadium watching a game  (it's close to the end of the first half) when a fire
drill is announced. Everyone, including me and my "date," a mysterious unknown
woman whom my dreamatorium has conveniently supplied, leaves their seats. I'm
now outside but I'm cold and I remember that I've left behind my denim jacket. I
return to my place in the now-deserted arena but no jacket. Then I'm outside
again. I locate my date and tell her about the missing denim. She serenely
rises from her squat to reveal that she's been sitting on the jacket.  I
wonder:  did she try to steal it?  2) The scene shifts abruptly. I'm now back
fifty years, in graduate school, and I've been informed that a new requirement
for the degree has been instituted. Each semester, every student will have
 to drink a 20 oz. paper cup of a pink liquid (looks like Pepto-Bismol but
is decidedly more mucilaginous and nasty).  3) All of a sudden i'm being
pursued by a huge scary rhinoceros with an ovesize horn. I run, of course,
terrified. Fortunately, I come upon a cottage size stack of carrots (large,
grated, carefully arranged). I'm able to climb the pile, rather gracefully I
think, but the rhino can't get any traction and I easily outdistance him. I was
scared for a while but the carrots saved my life. Then I woke up.

Are there any interpreters of dreams out there?  Clearly, Dr. M. needs your
help. (Do not bother using words like "nutso" or "loco," please.  Serious
interpretations only.)

Title: A New Machiavel
Date: February 23, 2014

I tried the first three installments -- a netflix diskful of episodes  --
of House of Cards. I plan to watch a few more, but I'm deep into negative
enthusiasm, not at all sure that I'm going to continue. Cards certainly grabs
you, and it's startling and theatrical, but it's also far too cynical and
depraved for my rose-colored tastes. I just don't believe in it. I know that
it's all the rage to assume that politicians are horrid and power-obsessed
-- but every one of them, all the time, without a moment of relaxation or
redemption?  And so I'm skeptical of every character, every twist in the plot,
every nasty turn of phrase. And because I'm skeptical, I just can't, as they
say, "get into it." Or at least, not all the way in.  (Full disclosure: during
episode three I fell into a 'deep rest,' sometimes denominated a minor nap.)

The character who dominates House of Cards is Kevin Spacey's Frank Underbelly
-- I mean  Underwood --  who is fascinating but not credible. Or rather, he
is not designed to be credible, because he regularly violates the fourth wall
and converses intimately with viewers. Underwood is ruthless, implacable,
ambitious, vengeful, depraved, vicious, malignant, and amusing. He turns his
audience into his co-conspirators.

And where have we seen this curious concatenation of traits before?  Think
back, fit audience though few, to your college class in the History of
English Drama. There you encountered the vice and his crossbred friend, the
machiavel,who were ubiquitous in medieval drama. Shakespeare brought this
semi- supernatural hybrid to perfection two separate times -- once in the
person of Richard of Gloucester in Richard III and then again as Iago in
Othello.

Richard of Gloucester winks to his audience that he "can smile, and murder
whiles I smile,/And cry 'Content' to that which grieves my heart, /And wet my
cheeks with artificial tears,/ And frame my face to all occasions."  Now if
that isn't Frank Underhill to a T, first spotted killing a puppy and a few
scenes later baldly and straightfacedly lying to his President. Richard can "set
the murderous Machiavel to school" in order to gain a crown; our unFrank friend
Frank once wanted to be secretary of state, but now he just wants revenge.
Richard and Iago are capable not only of falsity but even of murder to get what
they want. Both of them kill their own wives. "I'll have her, but I wlll not
keep her long," says Richard of Queen Anne.

And therefore If I were to offer advice to Zoe Barnes, the reckless young
reporter for the Washington Herald, I would suggest that she steer mighty clear
of Frank Underwood. I would tell her to read Othello post-post-haste and take
careful note of what happens to Desdemona's lady-in-waiting Emilia. Hint: "Fie,
your knife upon a woman."

Zoe, please, please, get out of there while the going is good!

In Shakespeare's plays, Richard and Iago both overreach and come to
grief. Richard is left to die on the battlefield and Iago is subjected to the
rigors of Venetian justice ("Torture will ope his lips.") And that's what is
supposed to happen to machiavels.

I'm curious as to what will happen to Frank Underhill. By rights he should
be publicly humiliated and die a ghastly death. But inasmuch as we live in
an exceedingly cynical age, we can guess that Frank will only die when Kevin
Spacey is offered better work, or when ratings plunge, or when the series jumps
its inherent shark.

Title: New Careers for Me Me Me
Date: February 23, 2014

I've written before about occupations that are not for me.  Among them are tour
guide (because of my directional dyslexia), trapeze artist (i'm terrified of
heights), surgeon (frightened of gore), and dog groomer. I've also discussed
possible options for future employment, such as my plan to become a power
forward in the NBA. However, I'm now starting to think that, what with my back
acting up again, and the NBA plagued with salary cap problems and an influx of
7-foot tall Europeans, that professional basketball might not be a realistic
possibility.

But I have two new ideas. The first is to become a leader of a religious cult.
I think I have what it takes: charisma, creativity, and ruthlessness. I haven't
exactly come up with a theology yet, but if that Scientology guy could get away
with Thetans and the "clear," I feel that I could come up with something better.
I'm aiming for a system of belief in which participants deed over all their
worldly goods to their leader, i.e. me. And also I'd like a harem of willing
maidens. I admit that some recent cult leaders have given the profession a black
eye (David Koresh, Jim Jones, Charles Manson) but I have in mind something
milder, something paternal or even grandpaternal. Less Kool-Aid, more chocolate
milkshake.

A second idea: hedge-fund billionaire. I admit that I don't know much
about hedge-funds, but I plan to get started right away by reading
the Wikipedia article. How hard can it be? It's not as though they
manufacture something or invent anything. And then, after you collect
a couple of billions, you get to have "dark money," off-shore accounts, and
your very own Super-Pac. This is a career with no discernible downside.

Title: My Diamond Jubilee
Date: March 09, 2014

My 75th, my diamond jubilee, is coming up in a few days, and it's about time
that family and friends gave serious thought to the celebration.

When Queen Elizabeth II had her jubilee just two years ago, there was a
specially-commissioned anthem, a service for two thousand folks at St. Paul's,
an equestrian extravaganza (550 horses), a flotilla of schooners on the Thames,
and something that involved the lighting of 4000 beacons world-wide.

Frankly, a bit much. A little over-the-top, if you know what I mean. 
Although who can fail to admire  the hat.

Last year, I suggested that a good choice for my birthday might be an
Irish "starter" castle.  The year before that, I hinted at one or two ancient
sculptures.  But, disappointingly, there were no takers. Birthdays number 73
and 74 were left unacknowledged -- to the shame of my fans.

But here is an opportunity for redemption. Diamonds for the diamond jubilee. I
would greatly appreciate a pair -- a singleton is tacky -- of those big hunking
earrings that the professional athletes wear. They can be easily purchased, I
understand, in the $900,000 to $1,100,000 range, depending on size and color.

My only reluctance is that piercing the ears would violate the integrity of my
body.  Also, I'm afraid of the pain. So it's either pressure clips or ear-
piercing under general anesthesia.

I wouldn't want to drop so precious an ornament and then lose it forever when I
vacuum the rug.

Gosh, now I'm worried if I can afford the insurance.

Title: The Arms of Morpheus
Date: March 16, 2014

I'm not a good sleeper -- never have been. While I'm very accomplished at going
to sleep, I'm deficient at staying there for the full eight hours. By two
o'clock in the morning, I'm awake -- reading, watching a previously-recorded
basketball or baseball game, or, more often, lying there with the body dormant
but the mind in a frenzy about our doomed civilization and about whether my
newest skin thingy has already metastasized.

So I decided that it was time for divine intervention.

Surprisingly, there's no patron saint of sleep. The closest is St. Dymphna,
but she's more properly, at least according to her website, the saint of
"mental and nervous disorders." Insomnia a nervous disorder?  I don't think
so, but on the other hand, she works cheap. To light a seven-day votive candle
at her shrine in Massillon, Ohio costs only $3.00 -- so what the heck. And it
can be done online, via Paypal. it's a bargain; why not give it a try?

Then there's St. Vitus, the patron saint of oversleeping, also not exactly my
problem. But St. Vitus is a busy fellow, inasmuch as he's also the patron saint
of actors, comedians, dancers, and epileptics when he's not busy warding off
lightning strikes and fending off attacks by wild animals. He's kind of the go-
to saint for all manner of things, but as far as i can tell, simple insomnia is
not in his portfolio.

Inasmuch as I'm even-handed about religions, I think I'll try Hypnos. who is
billed as a genuine sleep god. Hypnos is the father of Morpheus (the god of
dreams), brother of Thanatos (yes, that Thanatos) and the son of Nyx (night) and
Erebus (the deity of darkness). Quite the family tree. In order to placate the
entire group a three-buck candle would be clearly insufficient, even insulting.
I figured better to go whole-hog and sacrifice a lamb. However, there are no
lambs in my condo unit, and I was, frankly, afraid of making a mess, so I
thought that  perhaps a lamb chop would do just as well. I mean, how would
Hypnos know. So I checked the freezer and would you know it not a lamb chop to
be found. However, I did manage to locate a couple of pork chops which I think
will serve just as well. Tonight, I will eat them in honor of Hypnos. By the
way, I make a nice sauce out of orange juice, soy sauce, and garam masala. I'm
hoping that honoring the deity will earn me a couple of good nights' sleeps.

And as a backup, I'll have 5 mg of ambien at hand.

Why doesn't Dick Cheney put a bullet in his brain? It would do him (and his
reputation) a world of good.  What could possibly stand in his way? Once
he sprinkles the ratsbane on his porridge -- and, of course, leaves behind a
detailed and humble letter of apology --  he will begin to free his soul of sin
and to enjoy some peace of mind. When he has fallen on his sword, his lackeys
and toadies will be able to claim that although he was a black-hearted knave,
at least he wasn't a shameless black-hearted knave. They can try to persuade
us that although he was egregiously and dangerously wrong, he was, like another
suicide, Othello, "great of heart."  But if Cheney continues in his surly,
obstinate, unapologetic lip-curling silence -- why then, he'll go down in the
books as an unrepentant demi-devil like Iago ("From this time forth I never will
speak word").

Cheney has brought disgrace upon our beloved nation and upon himself. Using
faked spy data, he suckered the ignorant, feckless Decider and almost the entire
Congress into invading Iraq. His war has been a monumental disaster. "Full
of scorpions [should be] his brain." At this moment of writing, Cheney is
guilty of killing 3260 American soldiers and maiming (by official count -- who
can possibly guess at the truth?) 24,314 others. If Cheney has even the most
rudimentary of consciences, on it lays the heavy burden of 60,000 to 100,000
Iraqi souls. The Dickster has cost America $414 billion dollars, loss of
prestige and the squandering of oceans of good will. Like Anthony, he "has
lived in such dishonor/That the gods detest [his] baseness."  But Antony took
the proper course. When Cheney dispatches himself -- "after the high Roman
fashion," let's hope -- he'll have taken the first step toward rehabilitating
himself and the nation. For him not to do the deed would be ignoble.

Dick:  I know that you're hunkering in your bomb-proof shelter.  I know
that you're up late at night, sleepless with guilt. You're cruising the
internet, perchance googling "Cheney + suicide," and you're wavering in your
purpose. Dick -- take my considered advice. I'm thinking of your place in
history.  At this point, "you have no friend,/ But resolution and the briefest
end."  You'll immediately feel better.  It's a no-brainer. Go for it.

April 10.  Spike Schapiro comments:  "Dr. M. -- I've read your exhortation
to suicide.  You are, as usual, falsely optimistic. Cheney can't off himself
because a) he's shameless and b) he's a total coward, and c) he has no self-
knowledge and d) he can't point a shotgun.  You cite the precedents of Othello
and Anthony but they're both great spirits and therefore irrelevant.  Cheney is
a slug. Moreover, Cheney can't be "great of heart" -- he has no heart of his
own --either a transplant or some mechanical contraption."

April 4, 2014  Why is this man still alive?  Allowed to give interviews?  Is
there no justice in our sublunary world?

In Breaking Bad, Walter White disappears for a few days when he is kidnapped
-- he escapes only by murdering his meth-addled drug dealer. In order to
cover his tracks and account to his family for the missing days, he feigns
amnesia. And he's persuasive, possibly because everyone has seen so many
amnesia movies. He's so persuasive, in fact, that the doctors think that the
amnesia might recur. In order to get himself released from the hospital, he
confesses to the state shrink that he was only pretending. "There was no 'fugue
state,'" he admits.  That's a kind of theatrical amnesia in which I can believe
-- phony from start to finish.

Title: Fuffa -- Fluff
Date: May 07, 2014

Fuffa is a "cosa inutile, ciarpame" [a useless thing, trash] according
to Federico Roncoroni in Sillabario della Memoria (Milano, 2010). 
It's a dialectical (probably Milanese) word not found in most Italian
dictionaries. Roncoroni tells us that his aunt Evelina called the tiny balls
of material that sometimes form on the surface of socks "fuffa."  She likened
them to "furuncoli" [pimples]. The etymology of fuffa is obscure. Roncoroni
proposes that it might be merely onomatopoeic, related to English fluff which
signifies, as he says, "lanugine o peluria" [fuzz or nap]. But fluff, fuzzy
stuff in English, derives from Latin vellus [fleece] or "villus" [hair].  It's
most commonly used as a verb ("to fluff a pillow'). In theatrical jargon, a
person can fluff or flub his lines. Fluff is also a horrid marshmallow-like
confection that appeared in my childhood (though it dates to the 1920) and put
me off sweets for years. As far as I can tell, the meaning "a light woman"
as in "a bit of fluff" is not present in the Italian "fuffa." I doubt whether
"fuffa" and "fluff" are linked, unless "fuffa" also descends from "vellus."

Title: Rocks Out, Rocks In
Date: June 08, 2014

I'm late as usual getting in the vegetable garden. After many years of adding
manure and compost and leaves, the soil is soft and fluffy. But every year,
rocks and more rocks.  When I first started this garden in 1978, I was pulling
out boulders; then large stones, then small stones, now one-inch stones and
pebbles. Why do I continue to do so?

Because my father took the rocks out of his garden. I remember once, as a
small child, saying to him, "Dad, you'll never get all the rocks out of your
garden."  "True enough, he replied, "but I'll have fewer rocks"  From which
response I realized that he was not an idealist but a meliorist, as I am.
So every year, a new crop of rocks. I put the rocks on the driveway, in the
low spots where puddles accumulate after a rainstorm.  It's ridiculous, I
know;  we order seven cubic yards of crushed stone for the driveway every few
years, so a bucket of rocks makes very little difference.  But if feels good
to perform two useful services at once:  rocks out of the garden, rocks on the
road.

Title: Occupations Not For Me, Updated Edition
Date: June 10, 2014

Here are some career paths that it's just as well I didn't tread. Opportunities
for failure and misery.

1. Taxi driver in a large city (especially a city that's not on a grid, such as Boston or London.  Even the DC-diagonals drive me nuts).  I've earlier written about my incapacitating directional disability, but I neglected to mention that I tend to get into a bit of a panic when I'm lost --  I start driving much too fast and far too waywardly. So, dear friends, imagine me a befuddled cabbie, sweating super-profusely, while the fares in back scream bloody murder when I take the exact wrong turn for the fourth consecutive time. It would be a freakin' nightmare. Related occupations that won't work: tour guide, wilderness guide, tracker.

2. Dog-groomer. I've hinted at my lack of affection for doggies before.  I just don't think I'd do a good job blow-drying Fido or brushing Fifi's teeth. (Incidentally, I'm joined in my prejudice against curs by gentle Will himself, whose references to canines are uniformly unfriendly: the superbly wicked sisters in King Lear, for example, are "dog-hearted daughters.")

3. Trapeze artist. I'm terrified of heights and I have absolutely no sense of rhythm.  Imagine me launching myself at just the right moment to catch my partner by the ankles. Related opportunity for ignominious disgrace: dance instructor.

4.  Surgeon. I'm far too squeamish to be poking around in someone's innards. Even channel surfing has become a dangerous pastime since we accidentally acquired the live surgery channel. Motto:  "all gore, all the time." I have to keep clicking that remote lest I accidentally pause at an open-heart moment.  The FCC should mandate a warning and a five-second delay:  "Caution: palpitating inner organs on view shortly." Related non-opportunity: veterinary surgeon.

5. Hostage. Chained to a bed somewhere in the 'stans wouldn't work for me. I must have my oatmeal every morning at 7 a.m., and I need to move my bowels shortly afterward. Moreover, if I don't eat lunch right on time, I get wicked headaches. Not to mention that I don't function well in rooms that are either too hot or too cold or not well ventilated, and I can't stand tobacco. On the whole, I'd be a mighty cranky hostage.

6. Monk. Poverty I could manage, I suppose. Chastity would be a struggle but with plain fare, isolation, and cold showers I might succeed (but why?). Obedience?  Never. Not a chance. Nope. Not for me.

Title: Two (Possibly Three) Improvements to Soccer
Date: July 10, 2014

Netherlands-Argentina was exciting and rather beautiful until it went to
penalty kicks. What a foolish way to find a winner! It's as if, in basketball,
tie games led to a foul-shooting contest, or if, in baseball, instead of
extra innings they started hitting fungoes for distance. Soccer travesties
itself by resorting to penalty kicks. A better solution: play until someone
scores. Sudden death. I mean, sudden victory. I would hope the game (the
match) would end before midfielders start to collapse from exhaustion.

Brazil-Germany offers a second opportunity for improvement. Is it not time
to institute a mercy rule.  When there's a mismatch in junior high girls
softball and one team gets ahead by ten runs, the game is called off. It's over.
It should be the same in soccer. Team A, let us say, runs up a five goal lead
-- stop the game, everyone go home.  Why should a team (Brazil, for example)
suffer interminable humiliation.

And a bonus recommendation: no biting. Recidivist biters should be banned for
life.

Title: On the Kindle with Tertius and Rosamund
Date: July 11, 2014

I'm reading Middlemarch again. It's either my fourth or fifth time through the
best novel ever written in the English language. If you want to know about the
nineteenth century, start with George Eliot.

I had the oddest feelings fifty pages in. (Actually, "pages" is an anachronism
because I am reading on the kindle.)  Lydgate is flirting with beautiful,
empty- headed Rosamund Vincy.  I thought "this time let him be smart;  let him
not marry Rosamund."  I must have been in an unusally plastic frame of mind,
or in some sort of reading reverie. I know that novels are immutable, but I
was hoping against hope that Lydgate had learned something since the last time
I read the novel. Even though he made a fool of himself with that actress in
Paris. And then last night, just before I turned out the lights, Lydgate did
it again -- fell for the blonde curls and the glistening eye. He's learned
nothing, not a thing, in the last ten years. And now I have to live through
the saga as his crush turns into crushing disappointment and bitterness. Marry
in haste, repent at leisure. Poor Lydgate.

The kindle changes the input but doesns't do a thing for the outcome.

Title: At the Old West Bradford Cemetery
Date: September 04, 2014

The old West Bradford cemetery, which is carved out of our land, is peopled by
the Worthleys, Hacketts, Kidders, and Sleepers who first settled this part of
Vermont. Some were long lived, some passed through this thoroughfare of woe only
briefly. There are o-so-many of those sad stone lozenges at the foot of a grave
that represent infants who died too young to be christened.

Our most disturbing gravestone, in my opinion, is the the one for Stanley
Franklin Dwinell, M.D. born in 1920 and who died along with James Scott
Dwinell (age 7), Peter Dewey Dwinell (age 6), and Jonathan Dwinell (age 2) all
on the same day, December 11, 1952.  What a horror, I thought -- a man and his
three young sons all at once. A tragedy. But what sort?  A plane crash?  A
boating accident? House fire?  Perhaps even an infectious disease.

An internet search came up empty-handed, so I enquired of our longer-tenured
neighbors. And here's the local legend. "Oh yes, the vet," I was told (although
the tombstone distinctly says M. D., rather than D. V. M).  "He was driving
along Route 5 in Fairlee one winter morning and it was an icy road and foggy and
he went out of control and all four of them died instantly. His wife was at home
drinking a cup of coffee when she got the phone call. She left the coffee half-
finished on the kitchen table, left the house without a word, and was never seen
again. Didn't even take her clothes. Just disappeared."

It's a good story and it sounds like the plot of a short story by Alice Munro
-- but I don't believe it.  The same gravestone reveals that Constance S.
Dwinell, wife of Doctor Stanley Franklin Dwinnel, died January 25, 1985, at age
65.

I'm trying to imagine the remainder of poor Constance's life. It's hard to
construct a scenario that isn't completely dreadful. Most likely, Constance
returned, shattered, to the small town in New Hampshire, let us say, where she
must have been born. She moved back into her parents' house and took a job as a
town librarian, her life blighted by the tragedy. She never remarried.

But I prefer to imagine that she moved to Paris (she had majored in French at
Wellesley, I'm guessing,) and never told a soul about her first family. There
she was wooed and won by Baron Guy de Condorcet de Noialles but could never
conceive a child. It was a long happy marriage. After Guy died, crashing his
motorcycle on the Riviera, she returned to the States a rich woman, and lived
out her life in a Park Avenue apartment in New York. Friends and neighbors
who had no idea of her first life were shocked when they read the will which
specified that she be buried, along with Stanley and the children, right here in
West Bradford.

That's my story and I'm sticking with it though I would very much like to know
the truth.

November 14, 2015  Larry Coffin, president of the Bradford Historical Society,
writes:

I would like to correct your information on Dr. Stanley Dwinell.  He and his
three sons were killed in a collision with a train on a crossing in Newbury,
Vt as he was going to treat a patient at Woodsville (NH) Cottage Hospital. His
father Dr. Franklin Dwinell was in a car following.

Title: Six-Leggedness
Date: October 13, 2014

I read Planet of the Bugs (Chicago, 2014) by Scott Richard Shaw, a Wyoming
entomologist. It's a good book on a great topic -- the evolution of insects. In
the acknowledgements, Shaw thanks his editor for helping him to "shape a bulky
manuscript into a sleeker book," but I think I would have much preferred the
fatter unpublished version, which I imagine would have been heavier on curious,
fascinating and sometimes lurid detail. I think that Shaw's editor may have
misunderestimated his potential enthusiastic readership.

Shaw loves his insects and writes the evolution of life bug-centrically. Instead
of the conventional telling, where everything leads ineluctably to majestic
us, homines sapientes, Shaw inscribes the triumph of the six-legged kind. For
example, Shaw disparages our (I mean mankind's) walking and running. "Two-legged
bipedal locomotion is so unstable and difficult to master that it seems highly
improbable and almost pointless." He has a point there. A child takes a year to
learn to walk, and even after he does so, he staggers like a drunken sailor for
several months. No other creature on earth is so ungainly at the outset.

Moreover, Shaw adds, six-leggedness optimizes balance and stability and has the
potential for rapid motion. "Six legged form is sublime. Fifty million insect
species can't possibly be wrong."

If I understand it correctly, most insect species propel themselves by
alternately moving one of their two leg tripods -- and tripods are inherently
stable.  It's a great system.

Now that I've achieved the "golden years," I spend much too much time worrying
about that I'm about to crash to the ground and break a wrist or a hip -- all
too common afflictions among the two-legged kind.  No one has ever seen a
beetle trip, or an ant sprawl embarrassingly on the sidewalk.

Too bad we don't have six legs. Or even four (the other two having evolved
into arms). We'd be better off. We'd need two pairs of hips, of course,
and copulation would be more complicated, but it would be worth it. Speed,
stability, grace. Four legs would definitely be sublime.

On the other hand, I'm glad that we evolved an internal skeleton, which the
insects never did. I wouldn't want to bother with an exoskeleton or carapace.
It would be ungainly, troublesome. And probably accompanied by all sorts of
emotional displays. "Don't pay any attention to him. He's moulting."

Title: Nobody Cares
Date: October 22, 2014

There's a brief sentence in The Second Part of King Henry the Fourth that
continues to move me no matter how frequently I return to it. I's a passage
that resonates in my latter-day soul.

Falstaff and Doll Tearsheet (whose name, obviously, indicates her profession)
are old acquaintances and old rivals who are evermore at odds. "They never
meet but they fall to discord."  They seem to delight in exchanging insults.
To Doll, Falstaff is a "muddy conger," "a huge full hogshead," "a poor ape,"
and even, when she is more affectionate, "a whoreson little tidy Bartholemew
boar-pig".  Falstaff is equally abusive. But at one point in the play, there is
a magical moment when Shakespeare allows Doll to propose a truce.

"Come," she says, "I'll be friends with thee, Jack, thou art going to the wars,
and whether I shall ever see thee again or no there is nobody cares."

I think that what electrifies me is the last phrase, "there is nobody cares.
"  A less imaginative, less empathetic writer than Shakespeare would
have ended the sentence more predictably: he would have written, "nobody
knows" and would have therefore repeated the commonplace that the future is
unknowable. But Shakespeare raises the ante -- as he so often does. "Nobody
cares" is demotic shorthand for "nobody else but we two care"-- which I take
to suggest that Doll reflects not that the universe is dicey but rather that we
are each of us isolated and unimportant except as we are valued by our nearest
friends and the people with whom we have gone through life.

The sentence is nostalgic in the best sense. It is not sentimental;  Doll
does not romanticize hers or Falstaff's past. Instead she faces the aleatory
universe bravely. You are at risk, it could turn out badly, let's be friends
now, all that matters is the moment. The sentence is valedictory and at the
same time extremely warm.

Perhaps I'm projecting my own feelings onto Doll Tearsheet. I'm at the point
in my life in which I value (perhaps even treasure) the people whom I've
worked with, or argued with, liked or loved.  (I have even come to value some
whom I've not loved.) They're all part of the fabric of my life and they are
all disappearing, one by one -- going to the wars, we might say. And nobody
cares. Except us.

Rudy York, Vern Stephens, Dom DiMaggio, and of course Ted Williams. One day
I talked to Ted Williams and asked him for an autograph. He said he would
bring me a signed picture. He did, but I wasn't at home. Ted Williams came
to my house and I wasn't there!!  My mother said, 'a very tall man came by
and gave me this for you. I told him you were at church.' I thought, how can I
trust a religion that would let me be at church rather than at home when Ted
Williams called. That's when I stopped believing."  It's a great story and

We were playing punchball on the PS 217 "big court." It must have been
during school hours because Mrs. McGowan (a fifth grade teacher) was
the umpire and the players included the entire population of the class,
not just the regulars. Michael Lurie, the least athletic student in the
grade, and perhaps in the entire borough, was told  to play third base,
and obviously unfamiliar with the game and with Billy Cox, stationed both
feet directly on the white- painted base. Someone hit (punched) the
spaldeen toward him and he froze, but the ball landed precisely in his
crotch, and lodged, and after a bit he found it there and held it up. We all
knew that the batter was out, but Mrs. McGowan, as ignorant as Michael Lurie,
shouted, "he caught it illegally" and awarded first base to the batter. I
remember that several of us protested, but Mrs. Mc Gowan was adamant. It
was a miscarriage of justice. A violation of the rules. The umpire was
incompetent. How could I ever trust authority again?

Title: "Creating Space"
Date: November 14, 2014

If you listen to the announcers of the NBA games, basketball players defy the
laws and logic of physics. They "create space."

One of the greatest space-creators was Shaquille O. Others merely imitate his
technique. His most characteristic play was to drive his massive left shoulder
into the chest of the defender, knocking him backwards a couple of feet. When
he had gained a sufficient advantage and had room to maneuver, he would flip
the ball (awkwardly) toward the basket. HIs defender would as likely as not be
charged with a foul while the pre-Newtonian announcers would celebrate him for
'creating space.' And a beautiful game would be transformed into a brutal game.

And why is LeBron James allowed to create space on his every drive to
the basket?  He's gifted enough that he doesn't need the advantage; but
nevertheless, he routinely pushes off with his off hand, often lodging his off-
elbow in the chest of the hapless defender.

I often watch LeBron create space on hdtv where I've precorded the game. I can
therefore watch the same play again and again. In doing so I stop time, or run
time backwards. He creates space, I stop time.

So two can play at defying Einstein.

Title: Another Myth Debunked
Date: November 15, 2014

One day, back in the 50s, our neighborhood softball team was hosting a team
from some exotic location, such as Bensonhurst, at the PS 217 schoolyard. I
think I must have been playing either shortstop or second base, because I had an
excellent view of the earthshaking event that I'm about to describe.

It was the case that our guys were often a little less well-outfitted than
the opposition because we didn't have enough baseball gloves for the whole
team and had to borrow them from the visitors. Jimmy Nolan was playing first
base and early in the game, possibly in the first inning, someone on the
other team hit a grounder to third and the third baseman made a good on-target
throw to first. But Jimmy, who happened to be wearing an official but I
suspect borrowed first baseman's glove with a big pocket, reached out for the
throw with his right hand (he was a southpaw) but let the ball miss the glove.
He then casually caught the ball with his bare left hand which dangled
nonchalantly at his knee. I was impressed, as was everyone, and I thought,
"that's the way to show these visitors how tough we are -- we don't even need
the gloves that we've borrowed." I was proud to be a PS 217 Misfit.

Sixty years later, last week in fact, at a reunion of PS 217 softball players,
I asked Spike Cohen if he remembered the play. He did, much to my surprise.
"Oh yes," he said, 'and I even remember who threw the ball. It was Marv Lasky,
and he had a cannon for an arm." So The Play became even more dramatic
and mythical. I thought, wow, I'm not the only one who remembers that
catch, which ought to go down in history as one of the great iconic moments in
PS 217 schoolyard athletics. And then, since Jimmy himself was present at the
reunion, I asked him if he recalled the Great Event. He said he did. So I
asked him,"Why did you do that? Why did you let the ball go under the glove?
 Why did you catch it with the wrong hand?"  And he answered, "I misjudged the
throw. It was a mistake."

I was deflated, nay crushed. For all these many years, I had been convinced
that Jimmy had made that play on purpose to make a statement. But now I know
that it was merely an accident. And so another myth comes to be de-mythologized
by revisionist historiography.

Next thing you know, they'll try to tell us Babe Ruth didn't point to the
right- field bleachers just before hitting that home run.

Title: Joy of Extinctions
Date: November 19, 2014

I am inordinately fond of mass extinctions. I find them consoling.

The most recent mass extinction, the newly-famous Yucatan-comet-iridium K-T
boundary event of 66 million years ago is one of my personal favorites.
To recall: a comet six or seven miles in diameter, zooming along at 65,00
miles per hour and therefore generating a good bit of momentum, smacked
into what is now the Yucatan peninsula with the force of a heck of a
large number of hydrogen bombs. The impact produced a crater that was
initially an astonishing 65 miles across and 18 miles deep, triggered massive
earthquakes as well as tsunamis half a mile high, and briefly heated the
earth's atmosphere to hundreds of degrees. Within minutes, everything as far
as Illinois became wasteland. Because of the blanket of smoke and dust,
sunlight could not reach the earth, so temperatures plummeted, completely
disrupting the world-wide chlorophyll-based food chain. At the same time,
downpours of acid rain corrosive enough to dissolve rocks killed everything
they touched. A full 80% of the world's animal species disappeared -- along
with half of all land plants.

Although it must have been quite a show, it was not as thorough a disaster as
the Permian extinction (252 million years ago) which killed 95% of all living
species, but it is, rather, comparable in scope to the Ordovician extinction
(444 million years ago), the Devonian (375 million years ago) and the Triassic
(201 million years ago). It's no wonder that folks in the know estimate that
99.9% of all the species that have ever existed have disappeared.

The knowledge that there will inevitably be another extinction helps to put
our daily woes in perspective. How can I worry about whether the grout
should be "Desert Sand" or "Forest Gray" or whether my newest skin thingy is
benign or dangerous when our species and the cool green earth itself are
doomed. Judgment day is a-coming, whether in the form of another wayfaring
comet, or a series of explosive volanoes, or the release of the nitrogen and
carbon now sequestered in the permafrost, or some event entirely unpredictable.
Something is going to happen, as sure as shooting. Perhaps, some think, it's
already happening.

So that's one benefit of a mass extinction -- it helps you sleep well at
night. Why worry about trivialities?

And also: if it weren't for the extinctions, we wouldn't be here at all. If
the dinosaurs hadn't been killed by the comet they would most likely have
continued to dominate the planet, and the descendants of velociraptors and
mosasaurs and thunder-lizards sure as heck weren't going to leave a lot of
breathing room for the proto-primates.

Extinctions are one of the many improbable accidents that got us here jolly    .

From my window I could watch a new skyscraper being assembled. The basic I-beam

the structure lacked external walls!!  Where there will be walls sometime
it the future, preferably before the building is leased and inhabited, was
what looked to be an orange plastic mesh, perhaps reinforced with a thin
cable or two. From my vantage point, I could could see right through to the
interior of the building. There men on aluminum stilts were spreading on
the ceilings something that might have been plaster but was more likely some
sort of curing preparation for raw concrete. Let me make this clear: men
on stilts were plastering ceilings in rooms that had no exterior walls and
where a slip or trip would send them plummeting twelve stories to the hard
sidewalk. Frankly, I found it difficult to watch without vivid and horrible
imaginings flashing across my vulnerable brain. So without hesitation I can
add to the set of occupations in which I would fail ignomiously, stilt-walker

What indeed?  In Trollope's Barchester Towers, when Mrs Quiverful discovers
that her husband, rector of Puddingdale, is not to become warden of Hiram's
Hospital, she sets out to Barchester to confront the bishop. Not a walker,
and not the owner of a horse or carriage of her own, she "begged that Farmer
Subsoil would take her thither in his tax-cart."  A tax-cart, as far as the
dictionary is concerned, is a "small spring-cart on which a tax is paid." So it
is properly a "taxed-cart."  A "spring-cart" is a "springed-cart" -- i.e a cart

kind of vehicle be called a "tax-cart?" But if not, why should this particular
kind of vehicle be singled out of taxation. Trollope does not illuminate.

And so to the other nineteenth-century horsedrawn vehicles (barouche, basket

Title: Winter Love
Date: December 08, 2014

My daughter's nephew-in-law, Zach Appelman, is a talented actor setting out on
what might very well turn out to be a terrific career. (His ascent would be
more rapid if he would take his aunt-in-law's father's advice and change his
stage name to Zach Barrymore or Zach Zellweger, but the young man has too much
integrity to comply with aged opportunistic wisdom).

Zach recently played Hamlet at the Hartford Stage in Connecticut (Hartford
Courant: "a career-propelling performance that at times takes your breath
away"). I spoke with Zach at the recent family Thanksgiving and he told me
that the director of this Hamlet, Darko Tresnjak, made an effort to emphasize
the play's comic passages. It was a good idea, I think, because Hamlet is
both in reading and performance an intermittently hilarious piece of dramatic
art. But, added Zach, sometimes the audience laughed at moments that he
did not anticipate. He cited an example in the so-called "bedroom scene,"
where Hamlet assails Gertrude for marrying Claudius. Hamlet's rebuke of his
mother is harsh and dislocating. About her marriage to Claudius, he says

You cannot call it love;  for at your age

The hectic in the blood is tame, it's humble

It waits upon the judgment.

These lines apparently caused quite a commotion among the seniors in the
audience. It is not hard to imagine why. Hamlet, for all his sparkling
intelligence, is callow. He has youth's ignorance about middle-age sexuality
-- as the silver-threads-among-the-gold demographic must certainly have
recognized. How could Hamlet (or perhaps even young Shakespeare, a mere thirty-
five when he wrote the play), know that desire and passion increase in middle-
age as impetuous adolescent oestrus and fumblings are superseded by mature
appreciation and achievement.

I doubt that Shakespeare meant Hamlet's lines to be funny -- there's no
room for humor in the rhapsody of words that the prince directs at his
mommy. Nevertheless, a modern sophisticated and wrinkle-deep-in-time audience
cannot help but titter at Hamlet's grotesque misjudgment.

These observations on sex in youth and age were still percolating in my
waiting- for-wisdom brain while I re-read, for, what?  the fourth or fifth
or sixth time, Anthony Trollope's excellent 1857 novel, Barchester Towers. My
attention was caught, this time through, by one of Trollope's digressions,
very pertinent to the topic of autumnal love, and which I now transcribe in
a slightly reduced version and which I think is well worthy intense study,
especially by my readers of certain late-hectic ages.

"It is, we believe, [says Trollope] common with young men of five and twenty to
look on their seniors -- on men of, say, double their own age -- as so many
stocks and stones -- stocks and stones, that is, in regard to feminine beauty."

(Let me interject that for "young men of five and twenty", think "Hamlet." And
when Trollope talks of "feminine beauty," let us recognize that the phrase
is a  euphemistic Victorian surrogate for issues of human desire and
sexuality that conventional taboos made it impossible for Trollope to address
forthrightly.)

"There never was a greater mistake [continues Trollope]. Men of fifty don't
dance mazurkas, being generally too fat and wheezy; nor do they sit for hours
together on river banks at their mistresses' feet, being somewhat afraid of
rheumatism. But for real true love, love at first sight, love to devotion, love
that robs a man of his sleep, love [and here Trollope begins to quote from the
famous passage in Love's Labor's Lost] 'that will gaze an eagle blind, love that
will hear the lowest sound when the suspicious head of theft is stopped, love
that is like a Hercules still climbing trees in the Hesperides, we believe that
this best age is from forty-five to seventy."

Forty-five to seventy, ladies and gentleman. Just the age of the
men and women in the Hartford playhouse who snickered at Hamlet
junior's incomprehension of his mother's passions.

And then Trollope brings his excursus to conclusion with a great sentence in
which he both disses and dismisses immature youthful ardor:

"Up to that age [i.e. forty-five] men are generally given to mere flirting."

As perhaps Hamlet flirts with Ophelia.

It's intriguing that Trollope recognizes that men of seventy summers may still
be ardent lovers and appreciators of the flesh. If he had been a little older
and more experienced, he would have increased his estimate to seventy-five,
perhaps even eighty. After all, eighty is the new seventy, is it not?  Or he
might even have acknowledged that it ain't over until it's over.

Trollope was only forty-two when he wrote Barchester Towers, so perhaps he knew
that he was only capable of mere flirtation with Rose Heseltine. But he was
67 when he proposed, in the nasty dystopia The Fixed Period, that 68 was the
age at which all men should be required to give up the ghost. The Fixed Period
is a novel which, at least to this septuagenarian, provokes not titters but
guffaws. Poor Anthony T. had become so terribly sour, so unlike the Trollope of
Barchester.

Title: Unfriendly Skies
Date: December 14, 2014

I bought a February airline ticket to The Big Easy. I bought it online, as
we all do nowadays (whatever happened to travel agents?) I figured that they
would try to squeeze a few dollars in extra charges out of me, but I  was
surprised that the airline had the balls to demand $25.00 for my one piece of
carry-on luggage (not checked -- carry on!). And then I was completely floored
to discover that Frontier now adds an extra charge for a seat. Yes, a seat! A
seat is an additional charge, even though an airplane is not like a subway,
where you can strap-hang. Nor can you sit outside, on the wing. A seat is not
a an option or, goodness gracious! a luxury. And yet Frontier now exacts a few
bucks for the privilege of sitting down.

Frontier, I can tell you, lacks any sense of irony.

"Would you like air with your seat. There will be a small extra charge for
breathing."

I know we're supposed to feel sorry for the struggling airlines, but that's
a myth, a canard. The airlines are not starving. thank you very much. The
International Air Transport Association, the airlines' trade group, estimates
that the industry's profits were $11 billion in 2013, will be $19.9 billion this
year and will rise to $25 billion next year. (Billion!, not million.)  Why so
much? Because fuel costs continue to drop. And also because we passengers have
become accustomed to being crammed into smaller and smaller spaces and have been
taught to pay extra for every glass of orange juice. And to enjoy the luxury of
a chair.

Hey, fellow passengers!  Remember when oil prices spiked a few years ago
and the airlines added "fuel surcharges"? Well, fuel is down. Raise your
hand if you think you're going to get a "fuel rebate." Let me count the
hands. Hmm. Not so many.

Where do you think the $25 billion in profits will go. I'll give you three
guesses. A) Increase the salaries of stewards, baggage handlers and other
airport workers?  B. Lower the cost of airline travel for passengers in the
economy (i.e. steerage) classes?  C. Improve amenities for first-class
travelers?

Shock!!  The correct answer is C. According to The New York Times, improvements
in service "have been directed at the airlines’ most lucrative passengers,
who are flying in business class or paying for full-fare coach seats. Delta Air
Lines, for instance, announced on Monday that it renamed its business section
Delta One, instead of BusinessFirst, and said it would glorify the seats with
brand-new quilted covers. American Airlines announced this week that it would
spend $2 billion to improve customer experience at the airport and inside its
planes. Part of that investment includes adding more lie-flat seats for business
class passengers.

For the rich: "lie-flat seats," and "quilted seat covers." And what is American
Airlines doing for the rest of us, the not-rich. "In the back of the plane, it
introduced a class of fares called Basic Economy, the cheapest fares. Passengers
with those tickets, though, will not be able to book their seats in advance and
will not be able to refund or change those tickets."

It's still another example of the way the good ol' USA is becoming more and
more a class-ridden society. Billions for the few, sub-minimum wage for the
many. I wonder why the airlines don't go whole hog and separate passengers
not by front and back of the plane, but by plane itself. Class I planes -- all
sleek and shiny with free champagne supper and lie-flat quilted seats, and Class
II planes -- no seats at all, just a few square feet on the corrugated metal
floor. For only a few extra dollars, you will be able to reserve your very own
couple of square feet. Do you think I'm imagining some sort of wild dystopian
future? I don't think so. The way things are going, it's an inevitability.

Title: "Man" Is Now an Adjective and not a Good One.
Date: December 23, 2014

I believe that I first heard "man" used as an adjective in the phrase "man cave"
-- which is, I believe, a place where guys go to isolate themselves from their
wimmen and famly and where they watch boxing on the TV, drink a lot of beer, and
puke on the shag rug. But recently I learned about the "man stand." "To do the
man stand" is when the husband waits at the door of the dress shop clutching
a bundle of packages while the old ball and chain decides between the 10 and
the 12 and between the gray one and the green. Sometimes a manstander parks
his carcass in a designated "man chair." And now there's a new one: the "man
spread", which describes the way a crude young guy with below-the-waist pants
sits in the subway, legs akimbo, indifferent to the gentle ladies and to the
tired old geezers who need to relax far more than he does.

"Man boobs," which are nothing more than unsightly fat, are sometimes
abbreviated to "moobs."  "Manparts" requires no elucidation.

In each of these cases, "man" is not used affectionately or admiringly. "Man,"
as an adjective, is anything but "manly." "Man" is primitive and insensitive,
an adjective of derogation and denigration.

January 4:  My penpalessa, SF, writes that in England the phrase "man flu" has
now become popular. A "man flu" is merely a cold that men (such babies they
are!!) make a fuss about, but which a woman would ignore.

Title: Amnesia on Film: Desperately Seeking Susan (1985)
Date: January 09, 2015

Desperately Seeking Susan offers a cartoon version of amnesia. Pow, Roberta
is knocked into a lamppost and doesn't know who she is. And then, a day
later, pow again, she is knocked to the ground, bumps her head, and her memory
returns intact. The film isn't interested in amnesia except as a plot device to
facilitate the doppelganger relationship between Roberta and Susan. Roberta is
a downtrodden cautious Fort Lee housewife; Susan is an anarchic adventuress.
In the course of the film, each woman tries on the other's identity. Without a
memory, but wearing Susan's clothes, Roberta "becomes" Susan, and Susan in turn
invades Roberta's home and tries on her clothes, her pool, and her husband. At
the end, Roberta has absorbed enough of Susan's pizzazz to leave her stifling
husband and Susan has changed enough so that she can enjoy a moment with the
boyfriend who has been desperately seeking her. It's an easy-to-watch film.
Rosanna Arquette is lovely as a perpetual naif and Laurie Metcalf is superb as
Roberta's short-tempered know-it-all sister-in-law. And it has more than one
brilliant line of dialogue. "I thought you were dead."  "Naw, I was in New
Jersey."  And my favorite: "How do you use the bird?"  -- which you have to
have been there to understand and appreciate. An enjoyable film; unless you
approach it with the idea that it has anything to do with real-life loss of
memory.

Title: Henotheism
Date: January 18, 2015

As a born-and-bred third-generation atheist, I never made much of an effort to
understand theology, which is, I gather, the study of the nature and attributes
of god or gods. But no god, nothing to study. No problem. Theology will
always be for me "the subject without an object." And therefore when I read
Michael Coogan's The Ten Commandments  (Yale, 2014), I was surprised by own
ignorance. For example, I had taken it for granted that the Bible was a
document of monotheism. No god but god, Jahweh. And also  that the monotheism
of the ancient Hebrews was their gift to civilization (though why to believe in
one god was a better idea than to believe in a plethora of godlings will always
remain a mystery to me). But Coogan makes it clear that I've gotten it all
wrong. The commandment "you shall have no other gods before my face" distinctly
postulates the existence of "other gods."

These other gods appear in the Bible in a number of guises and particularly
as '"the host of heaven." Some were apparently worshipped even in the Temple
itself. It is reported in Kings that the reformer Josiah ordered "all the
vessels made for Baal, for Asherah, and for all the host of heaven" be
removed from the sacred precincts. The ancient Hebrews were therefore not
monotheists, but henotheists (a lovely word new to me), which Coogan defines as
"the recognition that while other gods may and do exist, only one is to be
worshipped" (14).

So it seems that what has been represented to naive ol' me as a case of moral
development, from polytheism to monotheism, is better understood as a kind of
religious nationalism or jingoism: our god is better than your god -- so let's
everyone pay him exclusive attention. Or perhaps, more vulgarly but just as
accurately, in the words of the spiritual leader Hank Williams, move over little
god, big god moving in -- have I quoted this exactly right? -- just as Jahweh
moved in on El Shaddai and the rest of the crowd. One of my friends says that
the essence of organized religion is "my prince of peace can beat up your prince
of peace."

Title: Why Don't Chimpanzees Suffer from Alzheimer's?
Date: January 19, 2015

Why Indeed?  And also, while we're considering the question, why don't
chimpanzees get atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, endometriosis,
myocardial infarction, falciparum malaria, HIV infection, or epithelial
cancers?  Chimpanzees are, after all, our closest living relatives. We
share a common ancestry and we only embarked on separate path some six or
seven million years ago --a blink of an eye in evolutionary terms. Why is
it that we human beings, so superior, as we like to think, in so many ways
from our cousins -- in our big brains and delicate hand manipulations,
for example -- are subject to an array of diseases to which our inferior
relations are immune. What's the deal?

Here's the current thinking on this important problem (which I draw from
Eugene E. Harris's informative and up-to-date monograph Ancestors in our
Genome [Oxford, 1914]). As I understand it, human beings went through a
sort of bottleneck sometime in our recent (say 200,000 years ago) history
and our effective breeding population was reduced to a mere 10,000 or so
souls. When a population becomes so small, random genetic drift dominates
over natural selection, and so moderately deleterious but not incapacitating
mutations can survive and even thrive. The defective genes that would
be weeded out in larger populations persist in our genome. Hence our many
inherited susceptibilities and disorders.

But that's not the end of the story.  Yesterday there was a report that the
Ashkenazim went through "a severe bottleneck" six or eight hundred years ago
which reduced its population to about 350 individuals. O my, what a boon to
genetic drift, what a recipe for genetic disaster or genetic success, or more
exactly, both success and failure simultaneously.

And so our talents, our deficits, our strengths and weakness, our brains and our
bodies, are determined by arbitrary aleatory long-ago events. No surprise,
really, but another event in the continuously unfolding revelation.

Black Angel is a good, fast-paced Cornell Woolrich mystery and certainly
one of the noiriest of all noirs. It features lots of grimy black-and-white
photography of seedy hotels and bars, and a nebbishy weakling who is falsely
accused of murder and who is rescued from execution by a last-second phone call
to the Governor. It also offers a blackmailing chantoosie and a hogshead of
red herrings. The plot turns on an unusual episode of amnesia. Martin Blair,
played by Cornellian Dan Duryea, has strangled his cheating ex-wife while in an
alcoholic haze but doesn't remember that he did so. He gets himself involved
with the attractive wife of a man who has been accused of the murder, abandons
alcohol for Coca-Cola and sets out the find the killer. Eventually he falls
off the wagon, and in a blackout suddenly "remembers" that he himself is the
perpetrator. "It's Korsakoff's syndrome," mumbles an authoritative doctor,
trying to add a glimmer of credibility to a doubtful turn of events.

I had never heard of Korsakoff's and I thought it was just mumbo-jumbo, but
it turns out there is such a condition: "Korsakoff's syndrome is a chronic
memory disorder caused by a severe deficiency of thiamine. It is most
commonly caused by alcohol misuse."

But Korsakoff's is not a come-and-go disease; it's a progressive deterioration.
Moreover, there's not the vaguest hint in the "literature" to suggest either
that a Korsakovian is likely to commit a murder and then forget it or that a
second bout of drinking can restore his memory.  That sort of stuff is strictly
Hollywood

Once again Hollywood amnesia proves to be the most flexible and variable of all
diseases.

Title: Stoppers

I would have thought that I'd have had in the hopper all the senses, proper and
improper, of "'stopper."  But I've come a-cropper.

The most familiar stopper is, of course, the blocker of liquids, as for example
the cork that fits into the top of the wine bottle -- or the polished glass
stopper that used to slide into those old-fashioned ink bottles. And then
there's the stopper in baseball -- the ace pitcher, the "number one" on the
staff, who brings a  losing streak to a close. And also the show-stopper
-- the performer who freezes the show in its tracks, so excellently that he
or she earns several rounds of applause and encores. (Latterly, a supremely
attractive woman has come to be called a "show-stopper"; when she enters a room
all activities, even molecular motion itself, immediately cease).

But down here in South Florida, where I am enjoying a few days of indolent
hedonism, there's a stopper of which even the OED is ignorant. It's a plant
-- a bush or small tree. The best known stopper is the simpson, myricanthes
fragrans, demotically known to all as the nakedwood twinberry. It's a member
of the eucalyptus family and smells nutmeggy. The fruit is edible, as might
be expected of a distant cousin of the guava. Simpson stoppers are a food of
choice for Florida's state bird (not the pelican, as one might expect, but the
mockingbird). And there are other stoppers beside the aristocratic simpson: the
redberry stopper Eugenia foetida, whose leaves and flowers are foul-smelling; 
the white stopper; and the inedible Spanish stopper.

I have no clue about the etymology of "stopper" in this sense.  Neither does
anyone else.

Title: Susanne Bier:  Love is All You Need (The Bald Hairdresser) 2013
Date: February 21, 2015

There is unfortunately very little of the often superb Danish director Susanne
Bier in this darkish Hollywoodish comedy.  She's so much better when she stays
closer to her native themes.

The plot is built on an antique and hallowed cliche: northern Europeans migrate
to southern Italy to find freedom and to re-awaken love. In this case it's
Philip, a workaholic widower and Ida, the relict of a boorish unfaithful
husband, who make the journey. They (Pierce Brosnan and Tryne Dyrholm) carry
it off rather well. But the film has an incapacitating defect: three of the
supporting characters (Ida's husband Leif, Leif's mistress Thilde, and Philip's
ex sister-in-law Benedikte, played by Bier's favorite actress Paprika Steen) are
so broadly drawn and so melodramatically horrid that they don't belong in any
comedy that asks to be taken seriously. There are a few good scenes that almost
recall the director at her best: a conversation in which Philip momentarily
drops his guard and reveals his unresolved grief; another in which he tries to
make contact with this son while the Mediterranean waves lap at their feet; a
third in which mother and daughter talk about marriage. Redeeming moments these.
But for the most part Susanne Bier appears to be strait-jacketed by a plot for
which she has little empathy. The psychological complexity that should have
arisen from Ida's cancer and her breast surgery evaporates: a great opportunity
squandered, in my view.

Title: Lost Books
Date: March 01, 2015

If a person could rescue one of the many lost books of the Greeks and Romans,
which would it be? I think most ordinary walking-around-Americans would nominate
the lost second book of Aristotle's Poetics, about which Umberto Eco made such
a fuss, and which is presumed to be a philosophical analysis of the genre of
comedy.

I myself am not enamored of Aristotle's lit crit. I suspect that if the second
book had survived, it would only show that Aristotle had invented a vocabulary
to describe the various elements of comedy -- and as a result generations of
scholars would have felt an obligation to conduct sterile and inhibiting debates
about the precise interpretation of his various technical terms. So, therefore,
if I were interested in comedy, rather than rescuing the second book I'd prefer
to read Homer's lost Margites, famous among the ancients as a comic counterpart
to the Iliad and Odyssey. It might have been fun, and we would certainly learn a
lot more than we now know about the archaic Greek sense of humor. My suspicion
is that we moderns would find the Margites to be a trial, a puzzle, a genuine
challenge.

Not only comedies but tragedies also have perished. Anyone who has been dazzled
by the great Greeks would want to read the 60 or 70 lost plays of Aeschylus,
the hundred or so that have disappeared by Sophocles as well as the 60 or so
vanished plays of Euripides. No doubt our understanding of the great age of
Athens and Athenian religion and art and politics would have to be thoroughly
rethought. Nothing more tragic than the loss of the tragedies.

And then there is Livy's history of Rome in 142 books, of which only 35 (plus
fragments and reports) survive. How much more full would be our knowledge of the
last years of the republic with Livy as a guide.

But if I had to choose a single work of the ancients that has perished, I think
I would opt for one of the books that were written by Livy's student and friend,
the emperor Claudius. Claudius, whose first wife (and one of his better ones)
Plautia Urganilla was a native speaker of Etruscan, wrote two books about the
Etruscans: a general history, and a volume on the Etruscan language. It's this
second book that I would most want to rescue. Claudius was the last person known
to have been able to read Etruscan, a language which was becoming extinct in his
lifetime.

Etruscan was an isolate -- a language with no known relatives, like Basque. It
was written in an early (8th century) variety of Greek, so it can be recited,
but it cannot be understood. Etruscan contributed not only its alphabet but
a few words to Latin: "atrium," "histrio," "taberna," "stilus," and "cera,"
for example. Approximately 13,000 Etruscan inscriptions are in existence,
mostly on gravestones. There are also about 300 bronze mirrors with religious
or mythological scenes on one side, many with Etruscan inscriptions on the
obverse. They are found in the tombs of women who, it would seem, must have been
literate. There are no surviving Etruscan manuscripts but there is the Zagreb
mummy. Sometime around 125 in the last pre-Christian millennium, an Egyptian
technician re-used a linen Etruscan book to wrap a body. Twelve hundred legible
words survive. They seem to record prayers and invocations to the gods. Not much
else, except for a great linguistic mystery in the heart of civilized Europe.
Alas that Claudius's books did not make it through the dark age bottleneck!

without forethought or planning, I take a nap.  B) And closely related,
but certainly different, sometimes, waking up in the morning, I decide,
spontaneously, to lie in bed for another hour or so. And C), just yesterday,
when I trundled over to the Public Library to borrow the book on ancient
dead languages that I had reserved, I spontaneously pulled a second book (on
Neanderthals) off the shelf.

Ludwig Wittgenstein, the renowned philosopher whose strict stringent strictures
about language inadvertently destroyed my youthful interest in philosophy, wrote
in one of his less rigorous moments that "a man's own name [should be] sacred
to him. Surely it is both the most important instrument given to him and also
something like a piece of jewelry hung round his neck at birth." Wittgenstein's
name at birth was "Ludwig Josef Johann Wittgenstein" -- his Jewish origins
concealed behind a string of echt-German Christian names.

I've never thought that my own name was a piece of jewelry -- but if it were a
jewel, it was entirely a counterfeit.

My surname is an accident. My grandfather, according to the story, was born
into a family named Middlebank or perhaps Middlebrook. Because a sole male
child was exempted from the draft in darkest nineteenth-century Ukraine, he
was surreptitiously adopted into a childless family. As a result, the name
that he brought to America in 1895 was a merely a useful fiction. And then
there's my middle name, Hessel. The only Hessels I've ever been able to trace
are almost uniformly Danish. My grandmother on my father's side was born Eta
Hessel and it's from her that the name descended. But am I to believe that a
troop of Danes wandered into eastern Ukraine sometime before 1850 and left
progeny behind?  I doubt it. In any case, I don't feel any more Danish than I
feel anything else. And then my praenomen was borrowed out of the book of Job.
Why my atheist parents, who never ever attended religious services of any kind,
would have elected for me an obscure Hebrew name will always remain a complete
mystery. So the whole parcel is a fabrication, a construct, without integrity or
authenticity.

What name should I have had, a name I could finger like a rich jewel about my
neck. Something that would suit me?  Suggestions are welcome. I'm thinking
"Rocco" for a first name (it's so appropriate), but I'll need help on the middle
or middles and the family name.

Title: Susanne Bier:  Things We Lost in the Fire (2007)
Date: March 14, 2015

For the first twenty minutes or half-hour of Things We Lost in the Fire I
thought that Susanne Bier, my current favorite director, had succeeded in
transferring her wondrous Danish idiom into a big-name Hollywood production. I
loved the unusual but profound relationships, especially between Brian Burke,
the real-estate developer, and his childhood friend and heroin addict Jerry
Sunborne. It was all far-off-the-grid, but it rang true. It's not easy to make
a European movie in the American system. Nevertheless, I was disappointed when
the second half of the film fell into deep cliche and became a familiar saga of
addiction-recovery, complete with predictable confessions at the Narc-Anon shop.
Brian's wife Audrey, played by the impossibly radiant Halle Berry, dominates
the film equally as much with her acting as her beauty, but the script poses
insuperable challenges -- especially when she is asked to retain her sexual
innocence while snuggling in bed with Jerry. The direction is as might be
expected highly accomplished, but I'm concerned that Bier's fondness for extreme
close-ups, sometimes of only a single eye, has devolved into mere mannerism.
The film received passable reviews but was a box-office failure, which is,
unfortunately, not difficult to understand.

Title: On the Mall
Date: March 23, 2015

On the mall, smoking, wheels (i.e. bicycles and skateboards), and pets are
prohibited. Between forty and fifty signs and icons state the case very clearly.
Nevertheless, the rules are often flouted.

Smokers are furtive: they can't help themselves even though they show, by their
demeanor, that they are well aware that they're doing wrong. The bicyclists
are apologetic. Skateboarders are oblivious, totally. The dog-owners are
defiant. "No bureaucrat is going to tell me where I can walk my dog." The
beggars are entitled. This morning, one disheveled youth carried a sign that
read "Why lie?  I need to get fucked up." (I used occasionally to donate to
our "homeless" until I was taught that meals are readily available and that the
begged money goes to support alcohol and drug habits. Also I was taken aback
when a man to whom I gave two quarters returned them to me, saying, "I don't
take coins".)  Some of the buskers are fine musicians and earn their one or
five dollar bill but I think that there is something rather sad about their
forced cheer.

On the other hand, the strolling young folks, holding hands and radiantly in
love, are wonderful to behold, especially when there's a toddler or two trailing
them. And I also enjoy watching the strolling old folks, fifty or more years
into marriage, sometimes holding hands, sometimes wheelchairing it. Dyads of all
ages and kinds cheer and encourage me.

Title: Olivier Truc; Fiction; Age
Date: April 09, 2015

Olivier Truc's Forty Days Without Shadow came highly recommended, both by
the forty or so literary awards that it has garnered, and also by trusted
friends. It's a murder mystery -- or rather a "police procedural" -- and indeed
it is a very good "read." It's set in the northern reaches of Scandinavia
amidst tensions between the indigenous Lapps, or more properly Sami, and their
Swedish and Norwegian oppressors. It's got everything: a brutal murder, a
child molester; a budding but blighted romance between a veteran policeman
and his beautiful novice partner; a tough wise old "native" who clings to the
traditional ways; a search for an old gold mine; stolen Sami artifacts, and
enough red herrings to furnish a medium-size Stockholm restaurant. And snow,
lots of snow. Snowshoes, snowmobiles, snowstorms, snowdrifts.

And yet I had to discipline myself to keep on with the reading. Something,
perhaps age, has blighted my appetite for fiction -- not just genre fiction,
like this mystery, but all fiction. Let me confess: to read stories, rather than
to read history or biology or geology has come to seem frivolous. An indulgent
 waste of time when I could be learning something substantive.

I looked up some reviews of this novel. Let me quote one opinion: "the
background information about the Sami lifestyle will slow down the action and
readers may wish that Olivier Truc had left his documentary days behind."
Interesting, but I had exactly the opposite reaction. What kept me intrigued
and kept me plowing through the snowheaps was precisely the ethnographic and
historical detail that the reviewer deplores. I wasn't just being "entertained";
 I was learning something!

Five years ago, I reported on this very blague that in my youth I loved to
read science fiction and fantasy, but that somewhere along the line, I lost
my taste for such flights of imagination. (If anyone is interested, they can
find the relevant paragraph here.) I would say that my condition has worsened
-- my resistance to fantasy has now spread to almost all fiction. Odd that
I don't feel the same way about movies: I prefer fiction films, stories, to
documentaries.

Darwin carried his Virgil and his Milton to Tierra del Fuego and claimed
that the books sustained him throughout his Beagle days. But later, in his
autobiography, he revealed that he no longer found any pleasure in poetry.  I
can't compare myself to Darwin in any way except that we both grew older.  Yet
I wonder whether an impatience with fiction and a loss of aesthetic sensibility
isn't a characteristic of septuagenarians.

Title: Bats
Date: April 15, 2015

Bats originated approximately 50 million years ago. Although warm-blooded,
many have "thermostats" that allow body temperature to vary with ambient
temperature; they are therefore "heterothermic." There are 1300 living bat
species -- about 20% of all mammal species. The Long-tongued Fruit bat has a
wingspan of 1.5 centimeters; the Spectral Bat a wingspan of a meter. Many bats
sport "noseleaves"  --fleshy projections around the snout and nostrils -- which
aid in the transmission of sound. DNA studies have determined that the closest
living relatives of bats are not rodents but hoofed mammals and whales. There
are twenty bat families, nineteen of which employ laryngeal echolocation --
the twentieth relies on tongue clicks -- as well as ten extinct families. Bats
have five unique muscles: the occipitopollicaris connects the back of the head
to the hand and runs along the anterior edge of the wing. The coracocutaneous
anchors networks of elastic fibers to the armpit. The humeropatagialis tightens
and braces the distal parts of the wing membrane. The tensor plagiopatii
anchor the trailing edges of the wing. The depressor ossis syloformis controls
the interfemoral membrane between the hind legs. Hoary Bats can fly at 27
kilometers per hour. Migrating Silver Haired Bats fly at over fifty kilometers
per hour. The heart rate of an alert Little Brown Bat hanging in a roost at
room temperature is about 200 beats per minute but while flying the heart rate
increases to about 1000 beats per minute. The heart of a hibernating bat beats
five times a minute. Flying bats consume energy at about twelve times the rate
of resting bats. Bats can feel changes in air pressure with the skin of their
wings. Some bats' feet lock into place when hanging upside down, so no energy is
consumed except when the bat releases and drops. Common vampire bats engorged
with blood have difficulty regaining flight. They urinate copiously, then use
their long thumbs to provide extra lift leverage. Bats use echolocation (as
do toothed whales, dolphins, shrews and tenrecs). When Lazzaro Spallanzani
claimed  (in 1794) that bats could see with their ears, he was widely mocked.
"Does Signor Spallanzani also claim that bats can hear with their eyes?" 
Ultrasonic noises were not detected by scientists until 1938. Echolocation calls
cover a range of frequencies. A Little Brown Bat searching for prey usually
produces echolocations at the rate of twenty calls per second. but a Hoary Bat
will produce only five calls per second. Calls increase in frequency during
the actual attack. Bats can vary the length of the call from less than one
millisecond to over 50 milliseconds. Bats are very loud to those who can hear
them. A hunting bat can produce a sound that is twenty times more intense than
the alarm of a smoke detector. Bats, unique among mammals, can turn off their
hearing. At about two milliseconds before a vocalization is produced in the
larynx, muscles in the middle ear contract, disarticulating three bones in the
middle ear; then the ear is "reconnected" allowing it to hear the echo of the
sound it has just emitted. Bats can be insectivorous, carnivorous, frugivorous,
nectarivorous, piscivorous and sanguinovorous. Some bats eat birds, some eat
other bats. Eastern Red Bats eat both tent caterpillars and gypsy moths. They
must eat about 150 moths per night simply to retain their weight (thank you,
Eastern Red Bats). The upper incisors of vampire bats are greatly enlarged, but
since they don't chew their food, the cheek teeth are reduced to mere spicules.
More than 500 species of flowering plants are pollinated by bats. Bats may eat
up to 120% of their body weight each day. The common vampire bat can consume
about two tablespoons of blood during a single night. Tiger Moths produce clicks
that "jam" the echolocation patterns of bats. Because bats must minimize their
weight, their digestive systems are extremely efficient --  Little Brown Bats
move food through their system in twenty minutes. One million bats roost under
the Congress Avenue Bridge in Austin, Texas. Bats are capable of eating 500
mosquitoes an hour. Some bats hibernate but bats can also enter into a state of
torpor to consume less energy while roosting. Frio and Bracken caves in Texas
each house over ten million Brazilian Free-tailed Bats during the summer. Bamboo
bats roost in the hollow spaces in bamboo stems. In Borneo, Hardwicke's Wooly
Bat roosts in the leaves of Raffle's Pitcher Plant and donates its feces to the
plants nitrogen intake. Some Leaf-nosed bats bite the stems of banana and palm
leaves in order to create tents for roosting. White-throated Round-Eared bats
roost in excavated cavities of termite mounds. Hibernating Little Brown Bats
bats breathe once an hour. Most bats bear one offspring rather than twins or
multiples. Bats live surprisingly long lives. A banded Brandt's Myotis was at
least forty-four years old. Vesper Bats mate in the fall but the female stores
the sperm and does not ovulate until early spring. White nose disease is caused
by a European strain of a common soil fungus. Bat droppings can contain spores
that cause histoplasmosis in humans. Rabies, often bat-borne, kills 60,000 to
80,000 humans per year in Asia and Africa.

Title: The Lobster -- Why?
Date: April 18, 2015

Thomas Fairfax, a well-known nineteenth century lobster smack captain, wrote
convincingly that "lobsters are very good as an article of commerce, and pretty
enough to look at, after they're boiled, but, as to eating them, I prefer
castoff rubber shoes." George Hoag, a down-easterner, added that "if them
tourists want to come up from Boston and pay those prices, then, by Christ, let
them. Damn fools. Lobsters, hell, they're big cockroaches, that's what they are.
You won't catch me eating one, even if I could afford the damn things." Fairfax
and Hoag may be two of the most honest men in the history of American commerce.
Lobsters are loathsome, both in appearance and as culinary articles. The meat is
stringy tasteless gristle. And inaccessible to boot. And messy to attack. How
did modern "sophisticates" get themselves bamboozled into thinking that these
big bugs of the sea should be considered a gourmet item. It boggles the healthy,
balanced, sensible mind. Lobsters are hideous insect-like creatures. Who was the
first addled individual who took a look at a lobster and said, "looks good, I'll
try it." Eeew.

Then there's the practice of immersing live lobsters in boiling water. Just
remember to put your fingers in your ears while the poor creatures screech.
Human beings degrade themselves morally and aesthetically when they lower
themselves to such indifference. How can they torture a lobster and then pretend
that the poor things are palatable.

I've eaten a couple, may all the gods of the sea forgive me. Before I reached
the age of enlightenment I would go along to get along. I never pretended to
enjoy them, but, petty conformist that I was, I would participate in the horrid
feast. Now I'd rather eat kale and tofu, tasteless trendy manifestations of
liberal guilt, than violate my integrity with a severed claw or tail.

it's time for a moral revolution in America. Let's make a start by liberating
the lobster.

Title: My Favorite Suffix
Date: May 05, 2015

Not just my own, but surely every thinking person's favorite word-forming
element is "--some," perhaps because It appears in so many cheerful
formulations. If you experience a sudden, overpowering urge to transform a noun
to an adjective then  "--some's" the way to go.

Imagine yourself, for instance, writing a novel and searching for the words to
describe your ingénue heroine. She's not just "handsome" and "wholesome" but
also "blithesome," "lissome," "winsome" "toothsome," "cuddlesome" and perhaps
even "frolicsome."  Could you find a better word? Well, maybe. Perhaps "buxom?"

Most of these words are of obvious origin but a few are on the obscure side.
"Winsome," one of the language's most delightful (or delightsome) adjectives,
derives from the now defunct "wynn," meaning "joy". It's a word that apparently
hid out in illiterate northern English dialect for a couple of centuries before
it was resuscitated, to everyone's advantage, by Burns and Scott. "Lissome,"
which now means supple or graceful, comes from the old English "lithe" meaning
mild, gentle, or meek. "Buxom" is drawn from a stem meaning "bow" and for most
of the existence of the English language signified "compliant" or "obliging."
"Buxom" began to connote zaftigity only during the middle of the last century.
Here's the very best use of "buxom" in its long history.  It's by John Milton
-- the young Milton, not yet the epic Milton.

And then there's "fulsome" which for the longest time meant what it seems to
mean, then latterly acquired the learned connotation "odious," which it is now
in the process of shedding. And "awesome" which has deteriorated from "filled
with awe" to meaning "cool" -- and has become a favorite adjective of praise to
an entire cohort or generation of the vocabularially deprived.

No one can say, "unbuxom" or "unblithesome."  Yet we regularly say
"unwholesome."

For the record, the "--some" in "threesome" is an entire different "--some," 
as is the "--some" in "chromosome."

of a spectacular misjudgement, a wildly incorrect speculation.  It's time to
kneel on ground glass, to scourge myself (metaphorically speaking).

One of the attendees of a support group that I attend is a "little old lady."
Elderly, gray in complexion and attire. Wizened, juiceless. She looks as though
nothing of any moment happened to her in all her eighty or eighty-five years.

Her husband, Steve, died last week. Here's the piece of her story that she
revealed.

"I was Steve's third and fifth wife. He was an airline pilot, so we traveled
together all over the world.  Steve had two children by his first wife; I had
five children by my first husband. I had so many babies because they started to
come in pairs. At his funeral I played some of the Bach preludes."

You, gentle imaginative readers, can fill in the blanks. There are many, several
novelsworth, in fact, starting with the obvious question, "who was wife number

And here are some sentences that you should definitely avoid  --  all of them

Title: Sleepers
Date: June 07, 2015

In the catchment area of P. S. 217, as indeed in all of my home territory in
darkest Flatbush, there was very little immigration or emigration. People stayed
put, for the most part, and the students with whom you entered kindergarten were
the ones who were likely to graduate with you at the end of eighth grade.

I can think of two outsiders who came not from a near neighborhood but from the
rumored "outside world." One was Beryl McLeod, who arrived from Scotland, stayed
long enough to engender in me a most powerful and confusing pre-adolescent
crush, and then disappeared. Lovely Beryl spoke with a most exotic and
enchanting accent, Glaswegian if I remember correctly. And then there was Alan
Dean, who dropped in for a year or two from western Pennsylvania. He was a
diminutive tough boy, not very bright but competitive on the punch ball field.
He also spoke in a dialect unfamiliar to me and which I now judge to have been
country or Appalachian. One day in Miss Finsmith's crowded stuffy fifth-grade
classroom we pupils were asked to elucidate a picture that the teacher had
displayed. It was a young lad with a candle in his hand. I recall very clearly a
sentence of Alan Dean's: "you can see that it's nighttime because he's wearing
his sleepers."

Alan Dean's "sleepers" made a lifetime impression on me, not only because I had
never heard that specific term before, but because I wasn't until that moment
aware of dialectical differences in vocabulary. I knew about soda but I had
never heard of tonic; I knew about pancakes but had never heard of griddlecakes
or flapjacks, and I wore sneakers all day every day but knew nothing of tennis
shoes or tennies -- not to mention plimsolls. I was not only monolingual but
monodialectical, if there be such a word. For someone to employ the word
"sleepers" for an item of clothing that I knew only as "pajamas" was therefore a
transformational experience.

And a very sensible word, at that. Much to be preferred to other deplorable
dialectal terms for pajamas, as for example the twee diminutive "jammies,"
or worse, the lazy "pj's" (not doubt employed by the sort of people who would
call orange juice, O.J.), or even worser, the infantile reduplicative "jim-
jams."

So I was on the alert the next time that 'sleepers" swam into my imaginative
ken, which was when I first became acquainted with John Donne's clever little
love poem, "The Good Morrow," in which the poet claims that until he fell in
love, he was immature, unconscious:

Who the heck, I wondered, were these "seven sleepers?" Not, in fact, a
wardrobeful of pajamas nor (my first guess) a parody of the famous 'nine
worthies" of chivalry?  But no, inasmuch as Donne habitually and regularly
conflated religion and sex, he knew that the seven sleepers were a group of
enthusiastic early Christian converts who were imprisoned for their faith
in a cave near Ephesus, fell into miraculous sleep, and then woke up two
centuries later to discover to their delight that their city had adopted and
institutionalized their religion. Rips van Winkles of miraculous devotion.

Of other religious or literary sleepers surely the most prominent are Thoreau's.
In a poignant passage about railroads in Walden, Thoreau recalls that "sleepers"
is the demotic name for the wooden ties on which steel rails are laid. From
this suggestive bit of nomenclature, Thoreau elaborates a conceit about the
way the new industrialism favors some and crushes others. "We do not ride on
the railroad; it rides upon us. Did you ever think what those sleepers are
that underlie the railroad?  Each one is a man, an Irishman, or a Yankee man.
The rails are laid on them, and they are covered with sand, and the cars run
smoothly over them. They are sound sleepers, I assure you. And every few years a
new lot is laid down and run over; so that, if some have the pleasure of riding
on a rail, others have the misfortune to be ridden upon.” So "sleepers" live
on.

I have never heard this sense of "sleepers" in conversation, but then, I don't
talk about railroad-making all that much. Nevertheless, it is not difficult to
endorse the continued pertinence of Thoreau's witty comparison.

No doubt my regular metablogian readership has been waiting patiently for me to
mention that the "sleeper" is the first and easiest trick learned by beginners
with the yo-yo. At least, such was the case in the 1950s P. S. 217 schoolyard.
And a spy in a "sleeper cell." And a dark horse. A surprise. A film; in fact,
many films that are unexpected successes.

A lifetime of many and various "sleepers."

September 21, 2015.  Let me add that Sleepers are plentiful in the old West
Bradford cemetery, they being one of the first families to colonize the part of
Vermont in which I am now writing this paragraph. A quaker Sleeper disrupted a
church service in the 1790s, shouting at the congregational minister, 'Sir, you
preach false doctrine." There's a Sleeper farm right at the end of South Road,
just over the West Bradford line into Corinth. Never met them, don't know if
their family's historic religious enthusiasms have persisted.

Title: Some Numbers
Date: September 18, 2015

Last night there was no moon and no clouds. It was so bright and clear that I
couldn't resist going out to take a gander at the stars. It was, once again, a
brilliant and dazzling spectacle.

I can never remember whether there are two hundred million or two hundred
billion stars in the Milky Way. Both numbers are so beyond my ability to grasp
that I wonder whether it even matters. But after marveling at the expanse
of stars, I returned to the computer and did the research. It's true and
astonishing: there are between 100 and 400 billion stars in our home galaxy.
(The astronomers, I have to say, give themselves quite a bit of leeway.) And
then I was reminded that there are an estimate hundred million galaxies in the
known universe.

I was feeling mighty small, mighty intimidated.

After a while, I went upstairs to dip back into the book on human anatomy that
I'm struggling to read. Here's a fact that I should have known, but didn't:
there are six trillion cells in the human body. More or less.

That's a a lot of cells. And a lot of stars. If a trillion is a thousand
billion, then there are a ten thousand times more cells in my own personal
body than there are galaxies in the universe, which is an interesting but not
particularly important statistic.

I feel as though there is some important conclusion that I should draw from
these numbers, but honestly I have nothing much to say beyond the usual awe --
that ordinary feeling of insignificance and impermanence. It's not exactly news
that I am merely a heap of cells in an obscure corner of a tiny planet of an
undistinguished star in a medium-size constellation.

And yet, sitting by the pond this sunny afternoon, watching a pair of
companionable ducks slowly swimming one after another, I have to say that this
particular transitory conglomeration of cells has been enjoying a mighty fine
day.

Title: My Grace
Date: October 05, 2015

I'm devoutly secular, just as I was raised. Moreover, almost all of my
friends are equally unreligious: either retired Catholics or atheist Jews or
freethinkers or lapsed UU's or never-wases. I was therefore taken aback and
a bit unsettled last week when at a friend and neighbor's dinner party, just
as the guests were starting to dig in, we all paused for a moment and held
hands while the head of the household thanked the Lord for providing. It was a
brief and inoffensive grace but still startling because so unfamiliar. I had
momentarily stepped into another world.

And then I thought, if I were preparing to deliver a "grace" before a
meal, what would I say?  Who would I thank?  For I readily confess that
I feel great gratitude every time that I lift a loaded fork to my hungry,
salivating mouth.

To begin, I wouldn't thank any god or gods, because I don't see the least
evidence or sign of the supernatural around the table. No god of the beets or
the chicken or the lasagna.

Instead, I would thank, sincerely and reverently, all the people, present and
past, who have in fact made a real and palpable contribution to the meal. Let us
think for a moment about the slice of bread. While I could not detect the real
presence of anything transcendent, yet the bread was immanent with the labor of
the farmer. And the trucker who delivered the fertilizer and the trucker who
took the wheat to market. And the guys at the John Deere factory in Moline who
made the tractor that harvested all the seven grains in my particular slice.
And the baker. Road builders. And for that matter, now that I think about it,
how about our intelligent Neolithic ancestors who first spotted the einkorn or
emmer and decided that it was a plant worth domesticating. Moreover, the butter
that I lavished on the bread did not arrive by flights of angels but through
its own particular chain of development and distribution. And then the wine,
the "merry cheerer of the heart" which wouldn't have cheered anyone's heart
if someone hadn't mastered the technology not only of wine-making, but also
of glass bottles. And I would also like to thank the furniture makers -- the
designers, the carpenters, the turners -- because there would be no sitting at
the table without their help. And therefore foresters and the manufacturers and
inventors of chain saws. I could go on and on, but I think the sitters-down at
my board would take my point. A moment's reflection reminds us that when we
collect ourselves for dinner, we profit from the efforts and endeavors of not
dozens but millions of people. Diachronic and synchronic, now and then.

It is to all of them that I offer my thanks, my gratia, my grace. And in doing
so I acknowledge my continuing connection to all members of our wonderful,
horrible species.

Egregious Rush Limbaugh, who ranks number three on my list of the people who,
in the course of my lifetime, have done the most damage to the United States
of America (Dick Cheney and Antonin Scalia are one and two and Dick Nixon only
slithers in at number 6) speaks a language that is extraordinarily difficult
to parse. His sentences are shapeless, wayward, and undiagrammable, equally
indifferent to the conventions of language and the rules of logic. When you're
fact-free there's no compelling reason not to be grammar-free as well.

Now there's a new and appalling example of Limbaugh's resistance to reality.
NASA recently announced that the planet Mars must once have had flowing water
and might still have underground water. Limbaugh, if I read his tangled language
aright, not only rejects the discovery but claims that water on Mars is evidence
a "left-wing agenda"  at work. Wow, we are tempted to exclaim. Double wow.
Paranoia run amok.

How can Limbaugh present such a counter-factual notion with a straight face? 
In order to coherently present his "thoughts" on this subject, I will now
extract and re-assemble some of his phrases from the linguistic rats' nest in
which they are embedded. Here's his chain of "thought" reduced to its essence.
First of all, global warming is a myth. Secondly, NASA has been "corrupted
by the current regime" and has falsified climate data. Inasmuch as NASA is a
mendacious organization, its discoveries about flowing water must therefore also
be false. And because NASA is subject to a leftist regime, its claims must be
not only false but "a technique to advance the leftist agenda." A watery Mars is
therefore a "leftist' Mars. And so the circle is almost complete. Limbaugh knows
he's correct but hasn't quite figured out how it all works:  "I don't know what
it is, I would assume it would be something to do with global warming."  So
round and round we go.

While Limbaugh's logic is roundabout, his perspective cramped and his evidence,
how shall I say, perhaps a bit on the skimpy side -- all assertion and no fact
--  I feel that I must agree with his conclusion. Yes indeed, the discovery of
ancient flowing water on Mars is definitely "leftist"-- and is leftist in at
least two different ways.

Let us try to connect the subterranean dots inside the Limbaughian skull. What
is it that is so paranoia-inducing and threatening about Martian water? Well,
water on Mars might indicate life on Mars. If there is life on Mars, then there
might be life elsewhere in the universe. If life elsewhere in the universe,
then the creation story in Genesis is certainly incomplete and probably false.
No creation myth, no biblical absolutism. Moreover, if there is life elsewhere,
there are probably intelligent beings who are highly likely not to worship our
earthly gods and are probably not -- horror of horrors --  subscribe to Baptist
fundamentalism. Water on Mars therefore challenges his local and provincial
Truth. Limbaugh is therefore correct to see Martian water as 'leftist" in its
implications.

Watery Mars is yet another blow to conservative "thought." It's just like
evolution or the big bang -- in actuality like any truth that comes to be
discovered either by hard science or social science or by the unbiased study of
history. Truth and fact are anathema to radical conservative Limbaughians. Of
course they are repelled and confused by scientific discoveries.  Martian water
is still another manifestation of the continual drip drip drip of facts that
challenge their provincial world view and animate their paranoia.

Title: "Oil the Women"
Date: October 21, 2015

A friend recalls seeing a film, many years ago (1950s or 60s), in which a
character speaks the wonderful line, "0il the women." My friend cannot remember
the name of the movie or much about it, except that it was a desert "sword
and sandal" job in which a sheik or pasha or emir or something else very
"Orientalist," preparing for a lubricious but acceptable-to-the-League-of-
Decency orgy, utters the fabulous phrase.

I can't identify the film and the words don't google. Does anyone out there
in blaguelandia know where such an inspired bit of dialogue occurred. Who
said it?  And more importantly, what genius wrote it?

In the absence of real information, I'm free to create my own scenario. It's
got to be a 1950s film in now-faded Technicolor, and really cheesy. It's not a
real desert but a sound stage with minimal sand and and a few plastic rocks. The
inferior lighting allows you to see shadows on the stained backcloth that passes
for a vista. The costumes are off the rack and every once in a while there's a
visible zipper. A microphone appears briefly and intermittently at the top of
the screen. The part of the sheik is played not by Steve Cochran but by one of
his less-accomplished imitators. The dialogue is in pseudo-archaic phony-middle-
Eastern-accented English.

News comes of a victory in battle and the bejeweled and beturbaned emir, whose
heavy eyebrows dance above his too-heavily-kohled eyes, turns to his muscular
bodyguards and shouts, "bring out the food, bring out the drink, oil the women."

Anyway, that's the way I imagine it. But it's also possible that the line comes
from a parody of such a film. Could it be tucked away somewhere in a Marx
brothers movie? Or somewhere in one of Mel Brooks' historical skits. It's Monte
Pythonish but alas before their time.

Please help, friends of Vivian de St. Vrain. Who oiled what women?

Title: Words of My Life -- Boobs
Date: October 22, 2015

When I was a boy, the word boob denoted a simpleton, a nincompoop-- what
Shakespeare calls a mooncalf and what in an earlier life I might have called
a schmuck or a schmendrick. "Boobs" was an everyday expression; so common and
pervasive that The Three Stooges might just as easily have been called the The
Three Boobs. There were other related uses of the word; "booby hatch" -- a semi-
humorous appellation for what was formerly called an insane asylum, and also
the "boob-tube" -- though whether the boob in that doublet denoted the machine
itself or the schmendricks who stared at it was never clear to me. But at some
point in my linguistic career the word "boob" re-emerged with a new primary
signification. It now seems to have become the most common word for the female
breast.

I do not like it when a breast is called a boob. It is disrespectful. A
breast is soft and nurturing but also erotic and enticing. A boob is
neither; it is a denatured object, stripped of its warm associations and
joined instead to foolishness and boobery. "Boob" is a deliberately
unsexual and undignified term. It is also, as Shakespeare says in a different
context, "base, vulgar and popular."

And available. If a person should happen to google the word "boob," perhaps
searching for information of an etymological kind, the first, second, third and
perhaps hundredth entry that he or she will encounter is for "boob selfies."
A "boob selfie," for readers equally as naïve as me, is a photograph which a
woman takes of her boobs and posts on the internet.

Jane Austen did not do this. Neither did George Eliot. I can't demonstrate
that the word "boob' is responsible for such a decadent display of immodesty,
but I do note that phrases such as "breast selfies" or "bosom selfies" are
inconceivable.

Nor did suicidal Cleopatra, when bringing the venomous asp to her breast, say
"Peace, peace/ Dost thou not see my baby at my boob/ That sucks the nurse
asleep."

Other words of my life: slouch, cishet, yips, ramps, jot and tittle, worship,
mucilage.

Title: Old Folks Show How it's Done
Date: October 23, 2015

There are two memorable moments in Kent Haruf's competent, enjoyable and
posthumous novel, Our Souls at Night (2015). The first is the proposal that
Addie Moore make to Louis Waters that starts it all off. Addie and Louis are
long spouseless and in their seventies, solitary. Addie calls on Louis and
says, without much preparation, "I wonder if you would come and sleep in the
night with me." The second takes place after Addie and Louis have become a
couple and the local Holt, Colorado Nosey Parkers are beginning to gossip. The
lovers decide to confront the talkatives directly. "They stood at the corner
of Second and Main in the bright noon sun waiting for the light to change and
looked straight back at the people they met and greeted them and nodded and she
had her arm entwined with his and then they walked across the street to the
Holt Café where he opened the door for her followed her inside. They stood
waiting to be seated. People inside looked at them. They knew about half of
those sitting in the café, or at least knew who they were. The girl came and
said, is it the two of you?  It is, Louis said. We'd like one of those tables
out in the middle."  The forthrightness, the honesty in both of these scenes
is rather wonderful. And so it's sad that eventually the puritanism of the
Colorado plains wins out and the novel becomes a trifle ScarletLetter-y. But
good for the septuagenarians, I say, who show a lot more grit and juice than
their townsfolk and family.

Title: More on Muff and Spot
Date: October 25, 2015

I enjoy good relations with animal -- respectful, sometimes even
affectionate. I remember with great fondness the many purring, playful cats
and kittens of my youth. I was once very taken with a calf named September
and, I confess, almost in love with the matriarch of a small herd of Morgans,
a lovely lady named Gillian. The twin Nigerian dwarf goats, Orville and
Wilbur, were, I think, special friends. But for some reason I've never taken to
dogs, even though I know the story about dog/human co-evolution. Doggy dogs
are moderately acceptable, but the various special breeds of dogs, dog-show
dogs, seem to me to be freaks and monstrosities. We should have left them as
wolves and not meddled.

Of all the various teratological breeds my least favorites are the ones who have
been hybridized into snoutlessness. Dogs deserve and need a snout.

I was once attacked by a snoutless ugly bulldog; its owner, who, incidentally,
had quite a snout himself, instead of apologizing profusely, made the utterly
unjustified claim that I had provoked the attack. The incident reinforced my
prejudice against bulldogs. It's not just that bulldogs are aggressive; let's
make no bones about it, it's that for some inexplicable perverse reason they've
been bred to be hideous. A travesty of a dog.

Nevertheless, I was startled to read the following paragraph in Richard C.
Francis' new book on domestication of animals (Domesticated, Evolution in a Man-
Made World, 2015):

The squashed face carries a heavy cost in and of itself. It starts with
breathing problems. The shortened snout causes the soft palate to bunch up in
front of the trachea in a way that impedes airflow. Since panting is the primary
way for dogs to cool, bulldogs are also vulnerable to death by overheating.
The mouth of a bulldog is also too small to accommodate its teeth, so they are
crowded and grow at odd angles, trapping food debris. Gum disease is rampant.
A bulldog's eyes don't seat properly In the skull and can pop out, even from
straining at a leash. Often the eyelids cannot close completely, resulting in
irritations and infection. The excessive skin folds often become infected.
Perhaps most telling, the bulldog's head has become too large to pass through
the birth canal; most births require Caesarean section.

Big mistake, the bulldog. We humans should have learned to leave well enough
alone.

Title: Rose Zimbardo (1932-2015)
Date: November 02, 2015

When I taught Shakespeare for the first time, at CCNY in the mid-60s, fresh out
of graduate school, I was mightily unprepared. I set myself the challenge of
teaching a new play every week for thirty weeks. So every weekend I would tackle
a play that I had read but not studied and then MWF try to explain it to my
unwilling cherubs. I learned a lot but I can't imagine that I was an effective
instructor, struggling, as I was, to keep my academic head above water (and, by
the way, deal with a colicky newborn at home).

But sometime during that first year I met Rose Zimbardo, who was teaching
another section of the course, and it was from Rose that I began to learn my
trade. She was a few significant years older than I, more experienced (and more
imaginative as well). Rose invited me to go for lunch with her and her great
friend Ed Quinn, who had recently completed, nominally with O. J. Campbell, but
in fact all by himself, the still useful Shakespeare Encyclopedia. Quinn knew
everything and Rose was chock full of theories about the plays, some sensible,
some borderline daft, but all provocative. Lunches for me with Ed and Rose
became a moveable seminar -- and it is not an exaggeration to say as valuable as
another Ph. D. I was challenged, inspired.

I lost that job (good fortune in the long run) and Rose moved on to Stony Brook.
I didn't meet Ed Quinn for many years, when I encountered him at Boston hotel
sometime in the 80s, and we had a moment to reminisce. I never set eyes on Rose
again. But I thought about her and Ed often and I look back with fondness and
gratitude for all they taught me.

Ed died a few years ago, a great loss. And now Rose.

Last year, through the miracle of the internet, I was able to exchange a few
emails with Rose. I hope I properly expressed my appreciation for all she had
done for me. It was my intention to visit her the next time I found myself in
California (she had retired to Davis, which she professed to loathe) as part of
my farewell tour.Too late, alas.

Rose was a fine scholar, an excellent teacher, and a great lady. Rest in peace,
old friend.

Title: Enough/ More
Date: November 11, 2015

"Enough" is a mighty peculiar looking word, but a good one nevertheless. It
frequently shows up in older texts as "enow." I don't know how the original
medieval velar fricative signified by "ough" evolved into so many different
pronunciations: e.g. although, through, hiccough, plough, rough.

My favorite enough proverb dates back to the fifteenth century, and is as
pertinent now as then: "enough is as good as a feast."  Our moralizing
ancestors knew that "the avaricious scraping together that knows no bounds" was
a vice, especially because it "renders us unfeeling to the wants of others." Yes
to a full belly, no to the excesses of the feast.

There's an oblique modern commentary on "enough is as good as a feast" in
Maxwell Anderson/John Huston's Key Largo. The dialogue is notable
and familiar, especially when we call to mind that the gangster Johnny Rocco is
played by Edward G. Robinson and the war hero Frank McCloud is Humphrey Bogart.

Johnny Rocco: There's only one Johnny Rocco.

James Temple: How do you account for it?

Frank McCloud: He knows what he wants. Don't you, Rocco?

Johnny Rocco: Sure.

James Temple: What's that?

Frank McCloud: Tell him, Rocco.

Johnny Rocco: Well, I want uh ...

Frank McCloud: He wants more, don't you, Rocco?

Johnny Rocco: Yeah. That's it. More. That's right! I want more!

James Temple: Will you ever get enough?

Frank McCloud: Will you, Rocco?

Johnny Rocco: Well, I never have. No, I guess I won't.

So there it is -- a nice contrast between "enough" and "more".  And
instructive, I think, in this day and age when our one-percenters seem to want
more and more, and are incapable of grasping that "enough is enough."

Title: Ferns
Date: November 16, 2015

It's a little late in the day for me to embark on a career in pteridology. Too
many ferns, too little time. There may be a backup option: intimate, private
pteridophilia or even pteridomania.

But in fact, empty enthusiasm is no substitute for knowledge. It's mortifying
that after all these years of treading upon, admiring and sometimes even
transplanting them, I know almost nothing about the Ophioglassales or the
Marattiales, the Equisetums (although I can identify both the scouring rush
and the horsetail), the Hymenophyllales, the lygodium (which climbs with a
twining midrib), nor the aquatic Salviniales. And then there are the twelve
thousand separate and individual species of Polypodiales. Although I could not
help being aware of polypody ferns -- they're all over the place, sparkling in
the understory and thriving in forest clearings -- I could not name the name
of a single one save the extremely distinctive and graceful maidenhair and the
undistinguished plain (and poisonous) and absolutely ineradicable bracken.

Nor, until I read Robbin Moran's enchanting A Natural History of
Ferns (Portland, OR, 2004) did I have a clear idea of how ferns reproduce. Of
course I was familiar with the folklore upon which Shakespeare drew -- that the
seed of the fern is invisible and confers invisibility. There's a micro-debate
on the truth of this imaginative idea in an early scene of The First Part of
Henry the Fourth:

Gadshill:  We steal as in a castle, cocksure; we have the receipt [i.e. recipe]
of fern-seed, we walk invisible.

To which the skeptical chamberlain replies, "Nay, by my faith, I think you are
more beholding to the night than to fern-seed for your walking invisible."

Our sometimes clever but often obtuse ancestors, knowing that all plant must
have seeds, and that ferns didn't, jumped to the conclusion that fern seeds must
be invisible. Well, there's a theory. It took a surprisingly long time for the
truth to out. In fact ferns bear very small, sometimes even microscopic spores,
visible, at best, as a fine dust. It was not until 1794 that John Lindsay
noticed that the spores produced a tiny green growth, nor until 1848 that
Michael Jerome Leszczyc-Suminski deployed his microscope to determine that these
so-called prothalli produced male and female sexual parts, and that from the
union of egg and motile sperm an embryonic plant with roots, leaves, and stems
was produced.

It seems like an unnecessarily complicated way to reproduce, but let's not judge
it harshly because it's worked very successfully for 345 million years, more or
less.

Of all the many ferns of past and present, the one that I would most like to see
with my own eyes fell by the evolutionary wayside 225 million years ago and is
unlikely to be resurrected in some vegetable Jurassic Park. They're the giant
lepidodendrons of the late Carboniferous, tree-size ferns that in the form of
coal are very likely providing right now the power for your and my computer.

One oddity of some lepidodendra  was that after fertilization they took
an unusual (perhaps even unique) path. The plant's root aborted while the
burgeoning shoot produced both the usual stem and also a downward-growing
rooting organ -- not a true root though it anchored the plant, but a root-like
system called a rhizomorph. Because the plant was a monocarp --that is, a plant
that grows for many years until mature, then flowers, fruits and dies -- both
the upside and the downside of the plant were, so to speak, term-limited. And
because the stem went both up and down, above ground and below ground, it was
remarkably symmetrical along the axis of the soil.

I wonder how a forest of lepidodendra would have appeared to a modern eye. Very
exotic, I imagine. Lepidoptera differed from modern trees in many ways, but
particularly in that their trunks were green with chlorophyll rather than bark-
brown. I think that a grove of them would have been littered with many uprooted
or rather uprhizomorphed plants. Quite a jungle, I should imagine, and quite a
delicious menu for the lumbering beasts who feasted upon it.

Title: Welders Versus Philosophers
Date: November 23, 2015

I asked some friends how they understood Senator Marco Rubio's very blunt
statement that "Welders make more money than philosophers. We need more welders
and less philosophers."  I received a variety of answers.

My linguistically conservative friends asserted that we obviously need
grammarians more than either philosophers or welders, because Rubio doesn't
respect the difference between "less" and "fewer." I admit that "less
philosophers" clanks on my sensitive inner ear; nevertheless, I don't think that
it's wise to hold presidential candidates to high standards of usage. It would
be enough for them to grasp the issues. No one I know is so very prescriptivist
that he or she will vote for the candidate who knows the difference between
less and fewer. I confess to a longing for a more perfect language from our
leadership, but traditional  grammar is too much to ask, especially since it's
evident that our electorate easily acclimated to the barbarisms of bushlingo.

Others of my friends took issue with Rubio's unabashed materialism. They
parsed his statement to mean "welders make more money than philosophers and
therefore we should have more welders than philosophers." Welding is better than
philosophizing because it makes the bucks, gathers the green. If this is what
Rubio meant, then his argument is not only crass but wrong. Data from the Bureau
of Labor Statistics proves that both graduates with a philosophy degree and
professional philosophers (meaning professors of philosophy) enjoy much larger
salaries on average than welders. But even if welders did outearn philosophers,
Rubio's argument would still be monumentally vulgar. I don't know anyone who,
if push came to shove, assigns value strictly on the basis of earnings. Do we
not value men of the cloth, social workers, nurses, small farmers, G.I's, smoke-
jumpers and sometimes teachers more than we value pornstars and slumlords?
Einsteins more than reality TV celebrities? And as much as we respect the
crafts -- electricians, plumbers, tractor and auto mechanics -- we also know
that it is not the craftsmen but the philosophers who now as in the past are
going to help us think our way out of our plight. Just as Locke and Hume got
us out of Aristotle and the Bible and into the age of reason, and Darwin laid
the foundation for all the advances of the last hundred and fifty years in
biology and medicine, so we now need someone, desperately, equipped with deep
learning and an insightful brain, to generate the ideas that will get the new
messy electronic world, bedeviled with fundamentalists/terrorists, into some
kind of intellectual order. Welders are good, especially when you want something
fastened to a steel I-beam, but philosophers have their place as well. Rubio
is just too downright short-sighted for most of us. We know that money ain't
everything and we want our statesmen to know it as well. Rubio's assertion that
welders do more valuable work than thinkers participates in bottom-line American
anti-intellectualism. We're a can-do practical people; we can see what welders
do. Who knows what the heck those airy liberal philosophers do at those lefty
universities? Can they fix a fuse? Can they meet a payroll?

Another bunch of my friends objected that there's no reason why a person can't
be both a welder and a philosopher. Why set limits on human versatility? 
As it happens, I have in my own family a fellow who makes his living with
his brain but who also builds his own furniture, can wire a house, and has,
strange but true, taken up welding. But I think he'd be the first to admit
that he's not a pro at any of these crafts. We live in a world of specialists
and it's hard to be perfectly skilled at two crafts, let alone a craft plus
metaphysics or epistemology or logic. I understand the longing for the
philosopher-welder, but I don't think it's a realistic wish. It's utopian,
prelapsarian, perhaps even Marxist. After all, it was Marx who developed the
vision of post-capitalist communist society "where nobody has one exclusive
sphere of activity but each can become accomplished in any branch he wishes,
[where] society regulates the general production and thus makes it possible
to do one thing today and another tomorrow, to hunt in the morning, fish in
the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening, philosophize after dinner, without
ever becoming hunter, fisherman, herdsman or philosopher" (German Ideology
[1845]). This is Marx at his least practical. I suspect that his hunters
and fishermen would return empty-handed, his herdsman would find that his
cows never come home, and his part-time philosophers would boggle over some
elementary error in logic or language. So no dice to the philosopher-welder,
I'm afraid. Not a starter, Karl.

What I myself would want to ask Rubio is this: how does it happen that there
are not enough welders?  Rubio puts his faith in the perfect workings of the
free market. In theory, the market should have solved the problem of the missing
welders by raising their salaries to make the job more enticing. And similarly,
it should have lowered the wages of philosophers to dry up the supply. Wait a
sec!!  Is it possible that the free capitalist market is not doing its job.
And if I or Marco Rubio propose that we establish more community colleges and
offer potential welders training in their craft at little or no cost, are we not
interfering with the proper working of capitalism and the free market? Picking
winners and losers, in the dread phrase.  t's centralized planning, almost
socialism to do so-- certainly anathema to the wing of the party to which Rubio
belongs. Riddle me that.

Bottom line:  it's helpful for Rubio to advocate for more welders. It's not
helpful (nor a credit to his candidacy) to set up a false antagonism between
welders and philosophers. Below the bottom line:  a democratic electorate
need thoughtful voters (let us call them philosophers). Welders need to be
philosopher-enough that they don't let themselves be snookered by some demagogue
who himself is bookless and factless and history-less. It's a challenge to
identify a thoughtful candidate when one of our major parties is offering a full
slate of empty but noisy barrels.

Title: Another Amusing Dream
Date: November 27, 2015

I hit a ball sharply to right field into the cosmos and made it safely to
second base. (By "cosmos" I do not mean that I hit the ball into the universal
void, but rather into a patch of cosmos i.e. cosmos bipinnatus, the common
herbaceous perennial that was growingly thickly against the stadium wall,
something like the ivy at Wrigley.) I was standing on second, enjoying the
applause of 80,000 spectators at the old Yankee Stadium, when my daughter-in-law
suddenly appeared with her two-year-old toddler in tow and handed him to me,
saying, "you're in charge." She disappeared, so there I was on second holding
the boy by the hand. I told him to stay put, but on the next pitch he broke for
third, running as fast as his little legs could carry him. I called out to the
shortstop, "Now you're in charge."  At which point I cannot recall anything
further, except that I tried to follow the boy to third but I could hardly run
and it felt as though I was running through mucilage.

A curious dream. Dream professionals and analysts will no doubt be attracted by
the claim to significance embodied in the word "cosmos" and by the dreamer's --
that is to say my -- transparent urge to shirk responsibility.

Title: Somnus Imago Mortis
Date: January 02, 2016

Which translates as "sleep is the image of death." It's a medieval commonplace:
God has blessed us with sleep in order to prepare us for the long sleep of
death. A daily premonitory death.

I can't buy the theology. However, I believe that there's genuine truth to
somnus imago mortis.

I'm a bad sleeper, a tosser and turner. A person who's likely to read fifty
pages of a novel or watch a few innings of pre-recorded baseball between 2am and
3am. Even when I sleep I rarely fall into that deep trance-like state that I
remember from my childhood. I'm in a dream state or I'm far too aware of my
body, my surroundings, my worries.

But a few years ago, when I had the surgery, I was thoroughly anaesthetized
into a dead sleep. Nothing happened between the administration of the drug and
the moment I awakened: no dreams, no thoughts, no awareness. Nothing. I went
away and I came back, but from nowhere.

Let me tell you what happened when I returned to consciousness. I thought 
"wow, if that is what death is going to be like, then it's not so bad. It's
nothing to worry about, nothing at all to fear."

And I've held on to that insight. Perhaps ordinary somnus isn't the image of
death, but drugged sleep is unquestionably a state of being that gives real
rational secular practical meaning to ancient wisdom.

Title: Beetles
Date: January 12, 2016

Evolution was inordinately fond of beetles. According to the
coleopterists, there are some 400,000 species, with many more still to be
identified. Beetles are everywhere. Every time I introduce a new plant into my
garden, along comes a species of beetle new to me.

Nevertheless, I must admit, to my shame and embarrassment, that I can call
only a handful of beetles by name. Is it failure of curiosity, failure to pay
attention, failure of memory?  As Holmes might have said, I see but I do not
observe.

Here are the few I can identify. The pestiferous, omnivorous Japanese beetle, a
pest every year and occasionally a veritable plague. The Colorado potato beetle,
voracious on potatoes and annoying on eggplants. The extremely stupid box elder
but, which comes into the house every fall to die and desiccate. Ladybugs,
supposedly eaters of aphids. Lightning bugs, beautiful in the night, helpless by
day.The heavy bomber among beetles, the June bug. The rose chafer, early spring
consumer and disfigurer of anything white, especially the white flowers of
peonies. A variety of oil beetle that  hangs out a couple of inches below the
surface in good garden soil -- what does it do there?

That's about it;  all the rest are unidentified and unidentifiable shard-born
beetles. OK, off to the library I go to bring home some beetlebooks. This
ignorance cannot stand.

Title: What We Watched in the Fifties:  Shane
Date: January 17, 2016

I didn't "get" Shane when I first saw it in 1953 when I just fourteen, and I
didn't ''get" it again last night when I watched it for the fourth or fifth
time, lifetime. It's a watchable film in my considered opinion but I have no
idea why various canon-creators have ranked it third or fourth among all 
Westerns. I revere Westerns but I can't revere Shane.

Not that there aren't some splendid moments. The first scene, when little
Joey with his kid-size rifle peers through the brush at a deer while, in the
distance, and through Joey's eyes, we see the figure of Shane a-horseback is an
excellent piece of film-making. We're going to see the whole movie through the
eyes of a child, the cinematography tells us. Moreover, it's going to be a film
about guns and Joey's love of guns and gunslingers. It's a very American story
shot through with the romance of weaponry, as is made clear right from the get-
go.

But it's downhill from there. The plot is minimal, classic, and familiar. A
Stranger Comes to Town. Even when I was a dewy youth I knew that Shane was going
to intervene in the struggle between the farmers and the ranchers. And that he
would resist as long as possible getting out his gun, and that his conversion to
violence would be cast as a Higher Moral Purpose. I had seen it all before, even
as an adolescent -- you can't negotiate with the bad guys; your weapon has to be
better than their weapon.

Van Heflin is the homesteader. He's a great, unappreciated actor, in my view.
But Alan Ladd is not credible as the mysterious stranger. First of all, he's
expressionless in face and monotonous in speech. Secondly, he lacks even a tad
of the charisma that's required of him. And thirdly, he's too small and skinny
for all the bareknuckle stuff. And Jean Arthur, I'm afraid, was simply too dowdy
to attract anyone's interest. The cast can't carry it off. Too much burden on
the child actor, Brandon de Wilde.

Why does Shane ride into the sunset at the conclusion of the story?  Why is
the most famous dialogue in the film, little Joey's plaintive "Shane, come
back. Come back, Shane?" There's really no good reason; nothing inside the
film compels his departure. Shane rides off because that's what the heroes of
Westerns do. The film is saturated with myth of the unconnected guy (well, he
does have his horse and his rifle) riding off, untrammeled by home, hearth, kids
and especially wives.

It's a powerful myth. My deep resistance to the film is that it is myth-driven
rather than character- or plot-driven. Shane doesn't create a myth; the myth
creates Shane.

Title: Sonia Green with an Addition
Date: January 24, 2016

I published this reminiscence some years ago:

My daughter continues to urge me to write something autobiographical. To which I
reply, it’s all autobiographical. But since she wants hard news, not indirect
revelation, I offer this account of my grandmother, born Sonia Chafetz, later,
by marriage, Sonia Usilewski and finally, after a legal name change, Sonia
Green. She was born in 1884 somewhere in darkest White Russia (now called
Belarus). I have no idea exactly where, but I know that she was a distinctly
rural girl -- she loved to fish, to pick berries, to grow plants. Of her life
in the old country, I know almost nothing -– only that she was raised in a
cottage with a dirt floor and that the family brought the cow inside in the
winter to keep the place warm. I know that she didn’t have a proper bed,
and that at least for part of her childhood she slept on the mantle over the
fireplace, which sounds mighty precarious to me. She couldn’t have had much
in the way of formal education, but she did read and write Yiddish and still
understood Russian in her old age. I know this because in the late 1940s or
early 50s I would occasionally sit with her and listen to the broadcast of
debates at the United Nations (in those days there were subsequent rather than
simultaneous translations) and she would render the Russian to me, as best she
could in her halting English. She never did become fluent in the only language
I knew so our conversations were stilted and confined to utilitarian topics.
When she was young--I’ve seen the pictures—she was dark, attractive, and
voluptuous. By the time I came to know her, when she was close to sixty, her
looks were long gone and she was disfigured by goiter and other diseases and
no doubt by the consequences of her many self-induced abortions.  The family
story was that both she and Joseph were engaged to other people when they
eloped to America (my grandfather deserting from the Russian army, where he had
been drafted for the usual twenty-year term, and where his salary was a ruble
every other month). They arrived in New York in August of 1904 from Rotterdam.
How they found their way from Minsk to Rotterdam I was never told, but the
Ellis Island records report that they came through London. My mother was born
in June of the following year, or just about ten months after her parents
arrived in this country. My mother’s story was that at first her parents had
only one pair of shoes between them, so that Sonia had to stay at home until
Joseph returned from work. The family settled in Harlem; my grandfather, who
was urban and more sophisticated than Sonia, had been trained as a pharmacist,
but never found work in his field in the new world. I don’t know what they
did for a living (was he some sort of salesman?) except that for a short time
my grandparents owned a delicatessen at the corner of 4th and 10th streets in
Greenwich Village. I’ve gone to that corner many times and tried imagine
such a restaurant, but of course not a clue remains. As far as I can guess,
their marriage was uneasy. My grandfather was frequently absent (my father once
darkly hinted, “I don’t know whether it was other women, or what”) and my
grandmother frequently ill. My father also told me that when he and mom married,
he laid down a prohibition—it was in the days when men made prohibitions--
that she wasn’t to act as intermediary between Sonia and Joseph any longer.
I know that my mother had to leave school six weeks into the ninth grade to
care for her mother and two younger brothers. But that’s about all I was
told and there are no documents. I have a few memories: Sonia trying to teach
me to play fan-tan and five hundred rummy -– I was as bad then as I am now
at card games; Sonia planting in wooden Philadelphia cream-cheese boxes every
orange or grapefruit seed that came into her house, so that her tiny apartment
had the pleasant aroma of a hot-house; Sonia growing avocados in the winter
but setting them in my father’s garden (just around the corner from her
third-floor walk up) in the summer. And I also remember her attempt to cure
my father’s sterile apple tree with an old-country remedy—rubbing the cut
half of an apple on the trunk in midwinter. I remember also stuffed cabbage,
the world's finest blintzes, and jars of apricot jam sealed with paraffin. In
her last years, Sonia lived with my parents; she had her own kitchen, a room
that had been remodeled from my former bedroom. She was weary of life and I
suspect that she died at least in part of malnutrition. I remember also that
she owned a pressed-glass ruby bowl that was always filled with hard candies. I
was allowed one candy per visit. When Sonia died in 1971, she had no money and
precious few possessions, but I inherited the bowl. It was pretty, and I’m
sorry to say that after a few years I accidentally broke it. But it was easily
replaced (it was in a popular pattern and every second-hand  store had the item
for sale) and I bought one for about $25.00. Some years afterward I broke the
second one and bought another, but by that time the price had gone up to $50.00.
So, although my inheritance in cold cash was a negative $75, I was left with
grateful appreciation and many warm memories.

Now I want to complete the story of the sterile apple tree.

My father had three fruit trees in his backyard garden on East 9 Street.  A
pear tree, which produced abundant fruit but not every year (it was a Seckel, if
I remember correctly, very sweet);  a peach tree, which was only occasionally
fruitful, probably because it was just a bit north of its proper range;  and an
apple (variety unknown) which was large and healthy, disease-free, but which for
some unknown reason never produced even a single blossom, let alone an actual
apple.  My grandmother Sonia Green explained to my father that when they had a
sterile apple in the old country, they would take a ripe apple, cut it in half,
and rub it on the trunk of the tree in mid-winter.  It always worked, claimed
grandma.  My father would have none of it.  "None of your superstition here,"
proclaimed. But one January he caught grandma apple in hand applying the folk
remedy.  He didn't say anything, but the next summer, he bought some apples and
tied them to the branches of the tree and took grandma to view them. She was
an intelligent old lady who immediately saw through the plot --but we all had a
good laugh and a good story to tell.

Title: Squirmish
Date: January 24, 2016

Sarah Palin, wordsmith, famous for her portmanteau "refudiate" (a blend of
refute and repudiate) has struck again with "squirmish," a coinage which
amalgamates "squirm" and "skirmish."  Here's the relevant sentence:

"Those are legitimate questions on both sides of the aisle, and another big
question that has to be asked is 'Are we at war?' I haven't heard the president
say that we are at war, and that's why I, too, am not knowing: Do we use the
term 'intervention'? Do we use 'war'? Do we use 'squirmish'? What is it?"

What, indeed?

I cherish the irony that the Governor is concerned with precision in language
and is troubled that our military actions in Libya lack proper definition.

I myself, an admirer of "squirmish," am puzzled by her use of the present
progressive "I am not knowing" where a native speaker of English would say, "I
do not know."  Is it an alaskanism with which I'm not familiar?  Did they
neglect to teach the present progressive at the University of Idaho, where Ms.
Palin earned her degree in Communication? Or is she perhaps an imperfectly-
trained foreign agent smuggled into the country by the Stasi or the KGB with the
mission of undermining the American polity?

Moreover, it is wonderful out of all hooping that "palin" means "backward" in
Greek.  As "trump" means "deceive" in French.

Title: Weird Dreams
Date: January 26, 2016

Folks who know me know that I'm not an imaginative or inventive human
being. I'm kind of dull, actually -- predictable, routinized, even humdrum.
What most people don't know is that I have an extremely vivid and creative
nighttime life. I dream big and I dream weird.

Take last night for example (an ordinary night by my standards). I was on
my way by NYC subway to Ebbets Field to see a 7:30 pm Brooklyn Dodgers night
game. I was accompanied by my elderly, arthritic father (in the dream I was
in my 20s or 30s). For some reason the train took a wrong turn and instead
of proceeding from DeKalb to Atlantic, took me and pop to Pacific Avenue. I
couldn't figure how to find a train going back to DeKalb so we went out on
the street to catch a cab. No cab would stop but a few people who were also
lost decided to rent a limousine. I was told that it would cost $50 apiece
but I agreed because my father was having trouble walking. However, when the
limousine came, he and I had lost our way and the car pulled away without
us. The next thing I knew pop and I were in a railroad car (it seemed like a
compartment in a European railroad and he was stretched out asleep and I had
in my arms a very pretty baby, whom I identified as my sister Susan who died
at age 9 months in 1938. She was sweet and gurgling until she let loose with
a tremendous flood of shit which covered my pants and even flooded over to
contaminate my father. "Who diapered this baby," I shouted. I had no equipment
to clean the child or myself. The conductor came over to help and offered to
stop the train but then the baby girl started to spew a huge quantity of vomit
all over me. I looked in her mouth and found a Band-Aid, which I removed, and
then, looking once again, found a roll of gauze, which I also removed. And then,
all of a sudden, I was no longer on the train but instead was visiting the home
of George Bush (the elder, not W) in Houston. I had been invited for dinner,
but before dinner was to be served I had to coach a grandson or great-nephew
of the former president in basketball, teaching him how to dunk. Afterward
we all sat down to dinner and I felt extremely awkward, wondering what would
have caused Mr. Bush to invite me, a Democrat. One of the guests asked me if
I ever shopped at Hill's In Bradford, Vermont and I had to report that Hill's
had closed. Then I was asked if I had ever eaten at the salad bar in the old
Greyhound station in White River Junction. I said that I had (it's true!!) and
then I woke up.

Man o' man that was something else.  Several novels worth of material for
someone with a daytime imagination, I should think.

Title: Althea Goss Pearlman (1939-2016)
Date: February 18, 2016

Althea Goss Pearlman, 76, of Boulder, died February 10, 2016 at
AltaVita Memory Care Centre in Longmont where she had resided for the last two
and a half years.

Althea was born in Paterson, New Jersey in 1939 to Daniel Goss and Anne Krull
Goss, both teachers of mathematics. She was raised in Utica, New York and
graduated as valedictorian from Utica Free Academy in 1956. She held degrees in
mathematics from Cornell University (where she was elected to Phi Beta Kappa)
and Harvard University. She married Elihu Hessel Pearlman, whom she had met in a
first-semester chemistry class, in June, 1960.

Althea had many interests but her life revolved around her two passions:
teaching and family. Althea taught mathematics at Ithaca High School in Ithaca,
New York, at Warren Junior High School and Newton South High School in Newton,
Massachusetts, at the City College, CUNY, in New York City, at Platt Junior High
School in Boulder and, for twenty years, at Boulder High School. In 1991-92,
she was an Einstein Congressional Fellow in Washington, D.C, serving as an
advisor to the House of Representatives on mathematics teaching. She also spent
four years as a Clinical Professor in the School of Education at the University
of Colorado, Boulder, where she acted as a mentor and coach to prospective
teachers. For Althea, teaching was not a job or a profession, but a calling.
She was an artist whose medium was chalk and blackboard. She accumulated a
wall full of teaching awards, including, most notably, the Presidential Award
for the Teaching of Science and Mathematics (1987), but was most gratified not
by certificates but by appreciative letters from students whose lives she had
influenced.

Althea was an excellent and loving wife, mother, and grandmother. She is
survived by her husband, with whom she enjoyed a deep, spirited, and ever-
evolving love for more than half a century, by her children Nathaniel, Benjamin
and Eve, by their spouses Connie Chang, Kyla Holcomb Pearlman, and Jonathan
Soglin, by her seven grandchildren: Talia and Oliver Soglin of Alameda,
California, Ella and Lola Pearlman-Chang of Washington DC, Luke, Caleb and Asher
Pearlman of Boulder; and by her sister Paula Goss Gombas and husband Allen
Gombas of Lyman, New Hampshire. Althea's sister Phyllis Goss Murray died in
1998.

Althea's ashes will be buried in the family cemetery in West Bradford,
Vermont.  A memorial event in her honor will take place in the auditorium of
Casey Middle School, 1401 High Street, on Saturday, March 5, at 3:00 P. M.

The family would like to thank the skilled and sympathetic caregivers
at AltaVita and at New Century Hospice who made Althea's last years
as comfortable as possible.

Should anyone wish to make a gift in Althea's honor, the family recommends
the Althea Pearlman Memorial Fund at Boulder High School. Checks should be
made out to Treasurer, Boulder High School (at 1604 Arapahoe Avenue, Boulder,
Colorado 80302) and designated "Pearlman Memorial." A scholarship will be
awarded annually to an outstanding student of mathematics.

Title: "I Love a Tall Girl"
Date: February 21, 2016

I never "got" T. S. Eliot. When I first became serious about poetry and
"intellectual" stuff, in the 50s, Eliot was the presiding grand khan of English
literature. Because Eliot liked Donne, my teachers liked Donne. Because Eliot
was down on Milton, my teachers were down on Milton. Eliot had pronounced
that "a dissociation of thought and feeling" occurred in the later seventeenth
century, and we all tried to interpret literature in the light of that putative,
imaginary divorce. Eliot discovered that Shakespeare's Hamlet was a failure
because it lacked an 'objective correlative." We were enjoined to wonder exactly
where that OC had gone. Nevertheless, I thought Hamlet was an exciting success
and still do. So do many discerning readers.

To me, Eliot's criticism was mysterious and his poetry was incomprehensible,
unmusical and occasionally repellent. "The Waste Land," his masterpiece,
was to me obscurantist, pretentious, show-offy and shallow. And yet I was
unquestionably an outlier. I studied the "Four Quartets" for weeks under the
able direction of a serious teacher and scholar, Arthur Mizener, but in the end
there was nothing there for me. My own insufficiency?  Perhaps.

I could not get around Eliot's public positions ("I am an Anglo-Catholic in
religion, a classicist in literature, and a royalist in politics"). To me,
these views were fringe, absurd, reactionary, borderline fascist. Eliot was
puritanical about sex, looked down his Brahmin nose at people not of his class
(see the Sweeney poems) and couldn't abide Jews.

When I taught a course called "History of Poetry in English," which I did for
many years, I would skip from the undeniably great poets of the World War
I generation (Brooke, Rosenberg, Sassoon, Thomas, Owen, Graves, Hardy) right to
Yeats and Frost, leaving Eliot in the deep lurch, possibly to the consternation
of my more sophisticated students.

So it gives me great pleasure to say that I've finally found a poem by the old
pretender that tickles me. It celebrates his second wife, whom he married in
1957 when he was sixty-eight and she was thirty, and remained unpublished until
it just now appeared in the second volume of the new Johns Hopkins edition. It's
not exactly juicy, but it seems to be honest and forthright:

I love a tall girl.

When we lie in bed

She on her back and I stretched upon her,

And our middle parts are busy with each other,

My toes play with her toes and my tongue with her tongue,

And all the parts are happy.

Because she is a tall girl.

To me, this brief lyric is worth forty Quartets.

Title: Parking Garage Criminal;  Transients
Date: March 31, 2016

On February 11, an "intruder" was discovered in the parking garage of the
downtown condo where I now live. Actually, I found him myself. I had to run a
late night errand, unusual for me, and there he was, scruffy and dirty, hanging
out near the elevator. I said to him, "are you lost?" and he answered that he
was staying with a friend who lived in the building. It seemed fishy, but I was
in too much of a hurry to concern myself with him. But when I returned two hours
later I found him curled up in a stairwell, apparently sleeping. I notified
the police but I didn't stay around for the outcome because it was 2:30 in the
morning and I was exhausted from the night's events. It turned out that he had
stolen a bicycle and also entered a number of unlocked cars, including mine. We
know he was in my car because the police found my Volvo S70 owner's manual where
he had been sleeping. Whether he used it as reading material or as a makeshift
pillow I don't know.

Yesterday I was called by the police and told that perpetrator had been
arrested. It seems that he was recorded on a surveillance camera (I didn't
know we had one) in the garage and that his image was shown to the police who
specialize in dealing with our city's population of transients. ("Transient" is
the current term of art for people who have at various times called "homeless,"
"hobos," "bums," or "vagrants.") He was well known to the authorities and was
picked up; he readily confessed to the crimes. I asked what was going to happen
to him and whether there was any chance that he could rehabilitated. The police
lady with whom I spoke said that he would be sent to jail for a few months
and then be back on the street. "Sometimes we have someone who turns his life
around, but this guy has a history and he's not going to change. He's been in
the system for years. He had a place to live a while ago but preferred (her
word) to be out on the street. Drugs and alcohol. The shelters require that the
inhabitants be drug free and he can't stay clean."

Our fair city is popularly thought of as a mecca for transients. I don't know if
it's so, but I know that we have a very visible population of such folks. All
the downtown public institutions, such as the library, are dense with them. When
I walk the four blocks of the downtown mall, I'll be approached by 3-5 beggars.
And there will also be knot of five or six unwashed persons with backpacks and
blankets on two or three different benches. The local merchants complain, and
the transients are moved on, but they return.

I don't like the situation. I find it morally challenging. Do I give a man a
dollar, even though I know that the city and the churches provide adequate
food, and the money will go for contraband -- or do I avert my eyes?  If I
avert my eyes, am I treating the guy or gal as a non-person? But if I engage in
even the slightest conversation, I feel that I am condoning a way of life of
which I thoroughly disapprove. If it is my obligation to support the poor, am
I obligated to support the liquor and drug habits of the transient population?
How do I deal with the occasional, inconstant, but sometimes very strong feeling
of repulsion that I feel for the "houseless heads and unfed sides." Are we not
all members of the human population, of the family of man? If I ignore these
people, have I turned into a complacent, unsympathetic, hardened, unfeeling old
bourgeois, a scrooge, mouthing, "are there no prisons, are there no workhouses?"

I asked the police person, who has been dealing with the transient population
for many years, if she had any ideas about what to do. She knew of a number of
experiments in various cities which had some success, but all had ultimately
failed.

She said, "Lock your car door. Lock your apartment."

Title: Junebug (2005)
Date: April 13, 2016

When I saw Junebug for the first time shortly after it appeared in 2005, I
enjoyed its gentle, affecting comedy. It's yet another "stranger comes to town"
enactment, although this time, for once, the stranger is a woman. Madeleine
Johnsen is a fortyish, worldly, sophisticated Chicago-based art-dealer. She
arrives in a small North Carolina Christian-saturated community accompanied by
her brand-new twenty-something husband, who is a native of the place. If they're
not deeply in love, they're certainly enjoying a time of sexual satisfaction,
perhaps even frenzy. As the film proceeds, a series of exquisite culture-clash
misunderstandings illuminate both city and country.

On last night's viewing, however, the film was far less amusing and more painful
than I remembered. Did I see it the first time with rose-colored glasses?

In the film's loveliest scene, the young husband George Johnsen, played
gracefully by Alessandro Nivola, is prevailed on at a church-basement social
to "give us a hymn," which he does rather beautifully, offering Will Lamartine
Thompson's ""Softly and Tenderly, Jesus Is Calling" which is an extremely
melodic but theologically naive piece of sentimentality. As he sings, obviously
very comfortable with the milieu and with the surroundings, the director's
camera focuses on his wife Madeleine's (i.e. Embeth Davidtz's) expressive face.

When I saw the film in 2005 or thereabouts, I thought Madeleine shone with
wonderment and appreciation. O, I thought, she sees and appreciates a new
dimension in her husband. This will lead to understanding between them and
help her to navigate the gulf between her and her new family. How could I have
been so undiscerning? This time, it was entirely clear that her reaction was
exactly the opposite of what I had previously attributed to her. Madeleine
doesn't get it at all. It's not appreciation, it's incomprehension, perhaps even
condescension. Madeleine, I'm sorry to say, doesn't understand her husband, his
culture, his religion, or his family. And indeed, subsequent events in the plot
confirmed my new pessimism, for every time Madeleine has to make a choice, she
does so with no accommodation to her husband's upbringing or values

She's glad to leave the place, she says at the end, but it's clear to me that
she's learned nothing and that there's trouble brewing.

Most of the attention that the film has garnered is owing to Amy Adams'
performance as George's pregnant child-like sister, which is indeed a remarkable
piece of acting. But for my money, it's the visiting husband and wife who steal
the show -- along with the intelligence and art of the director (Phil Morrison)
and the writer (Angus MacLachlan).

I am a bad sleeper. I don't know if I'm technically an insomniac but I can say
in all honestly that for me, the nighttime is the hardest part of the day. It's
been this way for a long time. I''m good at going to sleep and I enjoy the
"first sleep" of two or three hours, but after that, say from 2 am on, it's an
adventure. Nightmares, tossing and turning, "fluff in the lung and a feverish
tongue," and mostly what I think of as "airplane sleep" -- that is, the kind of
semi-sleep, semi-awake borderline limbo which you're in when you're sitting up
in a crowded plane.

Moreover, things start to look mighty bleak in the 2-5 part of the morning.
Is that pain in my toe a bruise, or is it the beginning phase of gout or
neuropathy? Cancer of the instep? Will they want to amputate my leg at the knee?

Not so in the 1950s. Return we now to those days of yesteryear and recall
the most glorious sleepings of my life. I'm in my teens, and it's spring. A
weekend. I spend the morning at the PS 217 schoolyard, playing basketball. I'm
tireless once I get my second wind. After four or five hours, I drag myself
home for a roast beef dinner, stuff myself. Then I lie down, turn on the radio
and listen to Red Barber and Connie Desmond broadcast the Dodgers game (if it's
Sunday, perhaps a double-header). By the second inning, I'm deep in the arms of
Morpheus. Profound. Incomparable. A sleep beyond ordinary sleep. When I wake,
it's the seventh inning. I've been in sleeptopia for two hours.

Where are the sleeps of old time?

Title: What's Next?
Date: April 19, 2016

Our sun is halfway through its life cycle. Its luminosity increases 1% every
110 million years. Therefore the Earth ineluctably grows hotter and hotter.
In a billion years, life on its surface will be impossible. Global surface
temperatures will reach 117F and the oceans will evaporate. Water molecules in
the atmosphere will be broken apart by solar radiation and hydrogen molecules
will escape the planet. Eventually the sun will exhaust the hydrogen fuel in its
core. When it begins to exploit other material, its luminosity will increase a
thousandfold until it stabilizes with a radius about 250 times its present size.
It will consume Mercury and Venus but probably not the Earth which will become
locked into an orbit with only one side facing the sun (as the moon does to
the earth). This will mean impossibly hot temperatures on one side, impossibly
cold on the other. The moon's orbit will reduce to 11,000 miles causing it to
fracture, raining pieces of itself onto the Earth. Eventually the sun will lose

"I worked for Ethiopian Airlines in Ethiopia. I have a degree in business. One
time my wife came to America and she says she wants to stay here. I had so much
paperwork and investigation but now I am a legal immigrant. America is the land
of opportunity. I believe that one hundred per cent. I bought a house, it is my
house. In Ethiopia, I would have to bribe many big shots and one day they could
take the house anyway if someone wanted it. Here, no trouble. I had to leave
Ethiopia because I was opposed to the government. We had an election and 100% of
the people voted for the government, hah! We do not like Obama so much because
he visited Ethiopia and said it was a democracy. Our government is fighting
the terrorists in the Sudan so he pretends not to know the facts. I have two
children, they speak English but also Amharic. My wife is a nurse. It is good
here. I am an accountant at LAX but I drive for Uber on weekends and sometimes
at nights, extra money. Los Angeles is very expensive to live."

Title: A Couple of Incomplete Stories from Real Life, Embroidered and Novelized but Left Hanging
Date: May 06, 2016

1)  "My husband's niece, his sister's daughter, has been staying with us. She's
nineteen just about to turn twenty. For a couple of months now. She's working
on her English --the family is Finnish. She's also enjoying the local social
scene; she's out a lot a night, but that's not a problem. She's old enough to
be on her own. She's a nice girl, I thought, a good girl, kind of pretty in
a northern way. She helps out with the kids if I ask her. I had no complaint
until I started to notice that money was disappearing. At first, I thought I was
crazy, but I did a couple of experiments to make sure. I left my purse with the
wallet inside it  in a place where only Anniki could access it. I counted the
money carefully. Sure enough, when I came back a $20 was missing. I calculate
she must have taken about $300 so far. What should I do?  I can't ignore it. I
could hide my purse, hide the money, but either she'd find it or she'd know that
I knew. I have to tell my husband. I mean, it's his responsibility, isn't it?
 I don't care so much about the money, but I think, yes, she should reimburse
me. And she needs to know that she's on a wrong path. She's too old for this. I
think we should sent her back to Finland, tail between her legs. She needs to
learn a lesson."

2)  "I went back to South Dakota, haven't been there in a number of years,
maybe three or four. I have second cousin, he's in his sixties. A decent guy,
runs a wrecking service. Hard worker, no employees. Up all night sometimes.
Twenty years ago, his son, Jake Leath Percy married this lady from Oregon. She
got pregnant, had a baby, then skipped. No one ever saw her again. Returned to
Oregon, we speculate. Left the baby with Jake Leath. Well, Jake Leath proved to
be as incapable as his wife. On the road a lot. So my cousin Herb Percy kind of
adopted the child. He was a big kid for his age, didn't do particularly well in
school, but not a real trouble-maker. Herb did right by him. But then, and here
I'm unclear about the details, they did some sort of DNA testing, I don't know
why exactly,  and it turns out the kid isn't a Percy at all. Not biologically
related to Herb's son. She was pregnant by someone else. Not a surprise, if you
think about it. A cowbird kind of situation. But Herb brought him up, feels
responsible. Doesn't really like him so much, I think. He's six-four, takes up a
lot of room in the trailer. Drinks beer. And now it turns out he likes to start
fires."

Title: Where's the Gasplant?
Date: June 22, 2016

I'm most fond of the gasplant, also called fraxinella or dittany or, when
formality is called for, dictamnus albus. It's a beautiful plant. In flower
it's an ornament to the perennial garden, and even when it's done blooming, it's
neat and orderly and retains a lovely shade of green throughout the summer.
Smells good too. It's a long-lived perennial, very hardy. It takes a number of
years to establish itself, but then lives almost indefinitely. If you have one,
you treasure it. I have two, both of which I took from the garden of my late
sister Phyllis when she died in 1998. Or should I say I had two, because over
the winter one of them went missing.

In the location where there should have been and always has been a fully-mature
gasplant, there was nothing -- not a leaf, not a twig, not a root. If the plant
had died, it would have left some evidence behind. It's a woody plant which dies
back to the ground each year, so every spring there is a bundle of dry hollow
stalks or kexes. But this year nothing. Not a shred.

What happened to Mr. Dittany. Here's a possibility. I transplanted him, put him
somewhere else, and then forgot that I had done so. An unlikely possibility.
I searched my brain but can't' recall moving it. I searched the grounds -- no
luck. If it wasn't me, was it someone else?  Did some malefactor steal the
gasplant?  I have never heard of a gang of perennial thieves. Is it possible
to believe that a nefarious individual entered the garden while I was away and
heisted an out-of-season gasplant, roots and all?  Not an hypothesis I can much
credit. Did the plant have enemies? If it's being held for ransom, I have yet to
receive the note. "We have your fraxinella. Either fork over $14.99 or we'll mow
it."

Another possibility: there never was a dittany. It was always a hallucination
of my decaying brain. Nope, no go. It's been in the same place for years. Many
people have seen it. I show it off -- it's so dramatic, so striking.

Or perhaps, it's a plot against me. Am I being gaslighted?  With a gasplant?

Title: Elsa Morante on Mussolini
Date: October 05, 2016

Elsa Morante, the distinguished Italian novelist, spent the war years in what
might be called internal exile, holed up, hungry, with her friend and later
husband Alberto Moravia in a one-room hut in Sant'Agata (both Morante and
Moravia were half Jewish). After Mussolini and his mistress Clara Petacci were
arrested and shot, hung upside down for all to see, Morante wrote about her
countrymen that "all of Mussolini's faults were either tolerated or encouraged
and applauded. Thus a people who tolerate the faults of their head of state are
complicit with these faults. But if they encourage and applaud them as well, it
is worse than being an accomplice, it makes them an accessory to these faults."
Mussolini was, according to Morante, a mediocre man, a crude man, a man outside
the culture. But Mussolini was also a perfect exemplar of the Italian people
who, she claimed, were such that they would rather given their vote to a strong
man than to a just man, and if they had to choose between their duty and their
profit -- even if they knew what their duty was -- they would choose their
profit.

It is difficult not to see an analogy to our beloved country at this election

Source: 2016/12/orts

Title: Orts
Date: December 01, 2016

"Orts" is a rare but tasty word. Orts are the bits of bones, gristle, stems,
skins, pits and other inedibles that are left on the plate after one finishes
eating -- the stuff that is scraped directly into the garbage can. Orts are to
be distinguished from "leftovers" which are the uneaten remains of the meal that
are carefully sequestered for tomorrow's breakfast. Leftovers good, orts bad.

Shakespeare uses "orts" twice in the plays, both times metaphorically. The first
instance is in Julius Caesar, when Anthony tells Octavius how little he values
his colleague Lepidus. According to Anthony, Lepidus is "A barren-spirited
fellow; one that feeds/ On abjects, orts and imitations." In this instance, orts
seems to be prompted by the word "feed." A second appearance of the word orts
is in Troilus and Cressida. Troilus has discovered that his beloved Cressida
has been playing at fast and loose with Diomedes: "The bonds of heaven are
slipp'd, dissolved, and loosed/ And with another knot, five-finger-tied,/ The
fractions of her faith, orts of her love,/ The fragments, scraps, the bits and
greasy relics/ Of her o'er-eaten faith, are bound to Diomed." It's a strong
speech and "orts of her love" is a powerful phrase, though rather obscure
nowadays to audiences for whom the "ort" is a mystery --which certainly includes
contemporary audiences.

Whether Shakespeare's first audiences would have required a footnote for orts
I do not know. It was never a frequently used word, though the OED attests its
presence in the language from 1440 to 1880. I don't know of any recent usages,
but once, when I was at lunch with a group of professional Shakespeareans, I
asked at the close of the meal, "What do we do with the orts" -- everyone at the
table knew exactly what I meant. Rather a specialized audience, however.

Orts should not be confused with Oorts. The Oort cloud is the presumed boundary
of the solar system, way out there, ten times further than Neptune, where the
comets are thought to reside until they are dislodged from their proper home
and come hurtling toward the inner planets. Orts and Oorts are both leftovers,
in the sense that they are the remains of an original creation, in the one
case chicken pot pie and in the other the universe. Orts are much smaller but
more palpable than Oorts. Makes a guy wonder what could possibly be denoted by
ooorts? Or oooorts?

Title: Even More New Words
Date: December 08, 2016

Carinate, which sounds vaguely dental, actually describes the shape of a
particular kind of ceramic or metal vessel. An object which has a rounded base
and inward sloping sides is "carinated." Hypogea, which is drawn directly from
Greek under (hypo) and earth (gaia) means, obviously, underground, but in
the world of archaeology generally refers to an underground temple or tomb.
Catacombs and crypts, therefore, are both hypogea. A megaron was the great
hall of a Grecian palace but archaeologists use the word to describe the large
entrance room of any substantial structure. An exedra is a semicircular recess
set into a building's facade. It think of it, perhaps incorrectly, as a half
of a rotunda. A plinth is the base or platform on which a column or statue
rests. Ashlar is finely dressed stones, generally in the shape of a cube or
a rectangular solid. Ashlar construction is therefore different from rubble
masonry, in which walls are made of irregularly shaped or found stones. A
tophet is a burial place for children either sacrificed or dead of natural
causes; it's a word of Hebrew origin and recalls the valley near Jerusalem n
which ancient Canaanites sacrificed children to Moloch or Baal. I'm embarrassed
that I apparently never encountered the word annona, which characterizes the
grain supply of the city of Rome in ancient times.  Annona, the common noun,
is also personified or deified as "a theophany of the emperor's power to care
for his people through the provision of staples." Annona, the goddess, is
sometimes assimilated to her compatriot Ceres. Acephalous means headless, and
describes "clerics not under a bishop" or lines of verse missing a first foot.
In archaeology, it's a decapitated statue. A cist is simply a stone-lined
grave or shaft.

These splendid words are drawn from Shepherds, Sailors & Conquerors,
Archaeology and History in Sardinia from the Stone Age to the Middle Ages by
Stephen Dyson and Robert Rowland, 2007, which I read with great care,
enjoying especially the middle chapters on Sardinia's fascinating nuraghagic
civilizations.

Title: Reposted:  "Crosspatch, / Draw the Latch" and Industrial Capitalism
Date: December 12, 2016

One of the most joyful of nursery rhymes, and a personal favorite, is this
brilliant piece of poetry:

Crosspatch,

Draw the latch.

Sit by the fire and spin.

Take a cup,

And drink it up.

Then call the neighbors in.

The clicky rhymes and jaunty meter are undeniably beautiful -- and there's much
more complexity than first meets the eye.

In the first triad, a "crosspatch," -- a "cross or ill-tempered person, usually
a girl or woman"-- is at work, spinning; in the second triad, she's exhorted to
drink and also to invite her neighbors "in" -- presumably into the room, or just
as likely, the tiny cottage-- where she lives alone. In the first strophe, the
theme is isolation, but in the second, isolation is challenged by the calls of
society and by the hope of a more satisfactory and convivial life.

What can we know about the surly individual addressed by the evocative
designation, "crosspatch?"  The first element in the name --"cross"-- implies
not only sourness, but also resistance, as in "cross-grained." The second
element--"patch"-- suggests that the crosspatch's discontent is not without
cause. We can infer that she's poor because she's a person whose garments are
either assembled from various rescued materials, as in "patchwork," or that her
clothes are, in another sense of the word patch, repaired. In addition, it's
possible that ill health has caused her skin to become "patchy." But "patch"
also signals a degree of mental stress, as in Shakespeare's "patched fool." In
this signification, patch derives from Italian pazzo, crazy. The crosspatch is
therefore disabled physically, socially and psychologically.

At the outset of the poem, our "crosspatch" sits glowering, impoverished,
perhaps muttering indistinctly, friendless, without family, her youth blighted
by poverty, huddled against the last embers of her dying fire. What is it
that she is spinning? No doubt she ekes out a meagre living in the impersonal
mercantilist "putting-out" system. Some exploitative proto-capitalist venturer
has delivered to her lonely door a quantity of unspun wool or cotton; her job
is to return the material to him in the processed form that will then be passed
on to an equally poor weaver, then to a tailor, etc. She works alone and never
sees the fruits of her labor except for the occasional, paltry farthing that
allows her a bare subsistence. No wonder she is slightly barmy and has "drawn
the latch" -- closed herself off from her fellows. But then, suddenly, comes
the antistrophe, and in a series of importunate injunctives the crosspatch is
solicited to rejoin the company of humanity. "Take a cup,/ And drink it up,/
Then call the neighbors in." What's in the cup?  Spiritous liquors, no doubt,
which, though designed to dull the pain of wage-slavery, also act to augment the
revelry with which the poem climaxes. The wine is not sipped, but it is drained
to the lees. And once the door is unlatched, and the neighbors -- neighbors of
both sexes, no doubt,-- are called "in," why then, let the libations and the
wild rumpus begin!  Alienated labor is suddenly set aside and replaced by the
natural bonds of one human being to another, and the stasis of the opening lines
of the poem transforms in a flash into a wildly kinetic bacchanal. Emotional
weakness transmutes into healthy liberated pleasure. Dour Puritanism, with its
punishing work ethic, yields to the spirit of holiday and to pagan, perhaps even
dionysian, excess. Here, in miniature, is the essence of the comic vision. In
a few powerful lines, freedom, good humor, and natural appetite triumph over
bondage, artificiality, social constriction and repression; the justifiably
sullen crosspatch, in a burst of energy, reintegrates herself into the social
nexus from which she has been banished.

Whether or not the crosspatch can permanently liberate herself from the
oppressions of industrial capitalism, or whether the anodyne and spurious relief
of alcohol is a merely transient solution is left unresolved. To ask a short
poem, however dense with meaning, to answer so difficult a question would, just
possibly, be to ask too much of it and, perhaps, to push the evidence the merest
tad too far.

Title: Fango
Date: December 18, 2016

I'm marvelously fond of the Italian word "fango," which translates into English
as "mud." "Fango" is expressive of the matter which it describes. To my ear,
the word fango sounds slimy and disreputable, perhaps even repulsive, while its
English counterpart "mud" is bland and lacks character. And "fangoso" is so much
more dramatic than "muddy."

But why fango?  How did fango infiltrate the Italian language? The Latin word
for mud is "lutum," which would naturally yield Italian "luto", which, as it
happens, is a word that does exist, but, so far, one that I've encountered only
in dictionaries. Fango it is, and gladly. Let us revel in fango.

Fango, according to my bank of etymological resources, appears to be of Germanic
origin and a distant cousin to the English word "fen," "a low land covered in
whole or part by water." Lots of fango in that there fen, obviously. There's
also a rare (my dictionary says 'poetical') French word "fange," for mud, but
the more common word is boue. Boue is one of a handful of French words (other
than toponyms) that are of Gaulish origin. So that when it came to mud, both
the Italian and French languages adopted indigenous rather than Latin words. And
for good reason: if there's any substance that is common rather than learned,
it's mud.

"Fango" bears no relation to English "fang." Fang is an oversized tooth, but
not in its earliest appearances. Old English fang denoted plunder or booty,
"a seizing or taking." The root meaning of grasp or capture is present in the
name of Good Master Fang, an ineffectual officer of the law in Shakespeare's The
Second Part of King Henry the Fourth. Yet fang as unquestionably tooth or toothy
in Duke Senior's metaphor in As You Like it, where "the icy fang/ And churlish
chiding of the winter's wind,... bites and blows upon my body."

Title: And Now He's Come out of his Coffin to Advise Trump!!
Date: December 22, 2016

I wrote the following long ago, republished it once. Here it is, relevant again.

What Doesn't Dick Cheney Commit Suicide?

Why doesn't Dick Cheney put a bullet in his brain? It would do him (and his
reputation) a world of good. What could possibly stand in his way? Once he
sprinkles the ratsbane on his porridge -- and, of course, leaves behind a
detailed and humble letter of apology --  he will begin to free his soul of sin
and to enjoy some peace of mind. When he has fallen on his sword, his lackeys
and toadies will be able to claim that although he was a black-hearted knave,
at least he wasn't a shameless black-hearted knave. They can try to persuade
us that although he was egregiously and dangerously wrong, he was, like another
suicide, Othello, "great of heart." But if Cheney continues in his surly,
obstinate, unapologetic lip-curling silence -- why then, he'll go down in the
books as an unrepentant demi-devil like Iago ("From this time forth I never will
speak word").

Cheney has brought disgrace upon our beloved nation and upon himself. Using
faked spy data, he suckered the ignorant, feckless Decider and almost the entire
Congress into invading Iraq. His war has been a monumental disaster. "Full
of scorpions [should be] his brain." At this moment of writing, Cheney is
guilty of killing 3260 American soldiers and maiming (by official count -- who
can possibly guess at the truth?) 24,314 others. If Cheney has even the most
rudimentary of consciences, on it lies the heavy burden of 60,000 to 100,000
Iraqi souls. The Dickster has cost America $414 billion dollars, loss of
prestige and the squandering of oceans of good will. Like Anthony, he "has
lived in such dishonor/That the gods detest [his] baseness." But Antony took
the proper course. When Cheney dispatches himself -- "after the high Roman
fashion," let's hope -- he'll have taken the first step toward rehabilitating
himself and the nation. For him not to do the deed would be ignoble.

Dick:  I know that you're hunkering in your bomb-proof shelter. I know
that you're up late at night, sleepless with guilt. You're cruising the
internet, perchance googling "Cheney + suicide," and you're wavering in your
purpose. Dick -- take my considered advice. I'm thinking of your place in
history.  At this point, "you have no friend,/ But resolution and the briefest
end."  You'll immediately feel better. It's a no-brainer. Go for it.

April 10.  Spike Schapiro comments:  "Dr. M. -- I've read your exhortation to
suicide. You are, as usual, falsely optimistic. Cheney can't off himself because
a) he's shameless and b) he's a total coward, and c) he has no self-knowledge
and d) he can't point a shotgun. You cite the precedents of Othello and Anthony
but they're both great spirits and therefore irrelevant. Cheney is a slug.
Moreover, Cheney can't be "great of heart" -- he has no heart of his own --it's
either a transplant or some mechanical contraption."

April 4, 2014  Why is this man still alive?  Allowed to give interviews?  Is
there no justice in our sublunary world?

December 22, 2016  Only a silver stake in his heart is going to do it. Mirrors,
garlic. Too late for prayers.

Title: Poor Robert Mitchum (Out of the Past, Angel Face)
Date: January 02, 2017

On successive nights, we watched Out of the Past (1947) and Angel Face
(1953). Both are, as they say, "gripping" films. In my present situation,
"gripping" means that even though the nominal curtain rose on these movies after
9:00 pm, and I was in bed, comfortable, with a full stomach, I was sufficiently
gripped that I didn't waver or snooze or nap, even for a second. Such criteria
of excellence may not seem significant to younger folk, but trust me, loyal
readers, in these latter years, staying awake and engaged is a crucial critical
yardstick.

Both Out of the Past and Angel Face are superior noirs. In both films the
central character is played by Robert Mitchum. I couldn't detect a the least
tad of difference between the two parts he plays. You could lift his Jeff
Bailey from Out of the Past and plunk him down in Angel Face as Frank Jessup
and no one would notice, except that civilian Frank would lack private-eye
Jeff's semi- official trench coat and fedora. In both films, Mitchum's character
is expressionless and sleepy-eyed and smart but, once his testosterone kicks
in, falls prey to a clever, ruthless bad bad bad girl. Both characters know
that they're being framed for murder and yet can't just pack up and move to
Nebraska or Mexico or somewhere sensible -- as any human being outside of the
world of noir would do. You, the spectator, want to raise yourself from your
soft pillow and shout at the TV and at the guys Mitchum plays, "Hey you big
lug, what the heck are you doing. Use your noodle." But lunkhead Mitchum makes
mistake after mistake. I hope everyone who's reading this post has seen the
movies, because I don't want to spoil their pleasure in the endings, but let
me just say this -- Jeff, or Frank, or Bob, please next time don't get into an
automobile with a homicidal femme fatale in the last few frames of a murder
mystery and expect to escape alive. And if you must  do so, at least check
your so-called girlfriend's purse for a silver-handled Beretta. And under no
circumstances surrender to her the keys to the vehicle. Do the driving yourself.

These films have everything one would want in a classic film noir: a relentless
wicked ambitious beautiful dame who entraps an honest but naif and helpless
ingenu, and also snappy dialogue, a gloomy claustrophobic atmosphere, multiple
plot twists and turns, and the valueless atomistic society that Hobbes feared
would follow from curtailed authority. And much yearning for cash, which is
never in adequate supply. Lots of shadows and odd-angled photography. Some good,
complicated characters but a few who are merely melodramatically evil.

Mitchum's acting is much praised of late but I don't buy it: he's effective in a
way but monochromatic to a fault. A better actor is Kirk Douglas, who  projects
gleeful menace as a corrupt, criminal businessman. But to me both movies are
carried by their female leads. Dazzling Jane Greer as Kathie Moffat is equally
adept at innocence and villainy, often in the same scene, sometimes from moment
to moment. At the end of the film, when she's killing people left and right,
she wears a nun-like snood that only an accomplished actress could transform
into a brilliant metaphor. Equally splendid is Jean Simmons as the angel-faced
Diane Tremayne, who conveys innocence, ambition, obsession, and intermittent
but genuine madness with the raise of an eyebrow (and the help of excellent
lighting). And good girl Mona Freeman shines in a restaurant scene in which she
sees right through Tremayne's beauty to the dangerous craziness beneath.

Here's Mitchum and Greer together.

Title: It Happened in Brooklyn, so  they Say
Date: January 20, 2017

If it happened in Brooklyn, it must have happened in metaphorical or
mythological rather than real Brooklyn, because it's not the Brooklyn of my
memory. It Happened in Brooklyn is a 1947 musical, I guess you'd have to call
it, featuring still skinny Frank Sinatra and womanly Kathryn Grayson, and also
Jimmie Durante, who steals the show. And also the ever-luminous Gloria Grahame
in a very small role as an Army nurse in England. Brooklyn is evoked as a fairy
tale land where everyone is nice to everyone and jobs and money fall from the
trees -- kind of an urban big rock candy mountain. Not the case -- though
nowadays Brooklyn, which used to be mocked, is every Twenty-Something's land
of putative milk and theoretical honey. In truth there's nothing much that is
recognizably Brooklynian -- even in geography -- to my jaded old eyes except a
rather beautiful sequence of Frank Sinatra singing and "dancing" on Brooklyn
Bridge. Most of the action supposedly takes place in the basement of New Utrecht
High School, but in actual fact it's a Hollywood sound stage.

Sinatra, a returned soldier, thinks he's in love with Kathryn Grayson but she
prefers Peter Lawford, playing the shy grandson of an English Dook. The film is
worth seeing if only because Sinatra and Grayson sing, believe it or not, "La ci
darem la mano" from Don Giovanni -- as far as I know Sinatra's only foray into
grand opera.

If I had been the screenwriter, I would have had Gloria Grahame jump on a luxury
liner and return to Brooklyn for the climactic concluding scene, rather than
remaining, as she does, merely a sweet overseas memory of Frankie's.

our own eyes, and yet he denies that he did so. He claims that his inauguration
was the best attended in history, and then we look at the pictures, and see
with our own eyes, not so. It is hard to know exactly how to interpret such
effrontery, such a remarkable disregard of facts.

I fear that he is actually pulling the wool over his own eyes. He's certainly
not pulling it over ours.

He is marooned in an absurd farcical world. He is drowning in duck soup.

Mrs. Teasdale:  Your Excellency! I thought you'd left.

Cihicolini: Oh, no, I no leave.

Mrs. Teasdale:  But I saw you with my own eyes!

Chicolini:  Well, who you gonna believe? Me or your own eyes?

Unfortunately, what in fiction is farce becomes tragedy in real
life. Nonsense, assimilated as truth in the mind of a person in power, cannot
be anything but incendiary.

Title: A Few Curious Italian Plurals
Date: January 27, 2017

On the whole, Italian is a mighty regular language. Of course it has its
irregularities, but many fewer than, say, English. Plurals, for example, are
largely predictable, but with some curious exceptions. The masculine noun bue
(ox or sometimes, by extension, a dolt) seems to call for the plural form *bui,
but it's not so; it's buoi. Dio (god), becomes dei rather than *dii. The very
ordinary word uomo (man), yields the extraordinary plural uomini -- which is
strange indeed except to oldsters who remember homo, hominis from their high
school Latin class. The word for wing is ala and, if Italian were law-abiding,
its plural should be *ale but instead it's ali. Similarly, arma should yield
*arme, but doesn't; it's armi. Eco has the plural echi, which seems normal,
except that the singular is feminine and the plural masculine, so la eco but gli
echi. Some words, conversely, have masculine singulars but feminine plurals:
most notably, uovo (egg) which becomes uova rather than *uovi, while dito
(finger) becomes the odd masculine dita. Paio (pair) is similar; its plural is
paia. Il riso (a laugh) has the plural le risa. There's the same gender switch
with the truly curious word for ear -- orrechio becomes orecchie. There are a
few words with two slightly different plural forms, many of them words for parts
of the body, such as braccio (arm) which can become bracci or braccia;  ciglio
(eyebrow), which has plurals in cigli and ciglia; ginocchio (knee) which can be
either ginocchi or ginocchia, and osso (bone) which can be ossi or ossa. I'm
fond of muro (wall) the regular plural of which is muri (the walls of a house)
but also yields the irregular plural mura, which refers to the fortifications
or walls of a city.

Title: Sciascian Geography
Date: January 28, 2017

Years ago, I read, in translation of course, a few of Leonardo Sciascia's
Sicilian mysteries. Excellent books: The Day of the Owl (Il giorno della
civetta -- 1961)), Equal Danger (Uguale pericolo --1973), The Challenge (Il
contesto-- 1971). Last week I tried to read one of Sciascia's short stories
in its native Italian. A good idea, but quite a struggle. Too taxing for my
present fluency. Sciascia's vocabulary is enormous, mine is puny. Not to mention
Sicilian expressions that would be stumpers and require footnoting even for
mainland Italians.

The story I tackled is Il lungo viaggio, (The Long Voyage). Some impoverished
Sicilian peasants pay a man whom we would call a coyote to smuggle them into
America; he takes their entire savings, takes them on board his ship, and then
after ten excruciating days sets them right back down in Sicily. A sad tale of
exploitation, not, alas, irrelevant today.

Sciascian geography: the Sicilians think they are headed for the middle Atlantic
coast of North America, where they will find Nugioirsi, Nuovaiorche, and my very
favorite, Brucchilin.

Title: News from my Brain
Date: January 29, 2017

The twins and their older brother came to visit and were playing their favorite
new game, "hide the goose." The goose?  a two foot tall hollow plastic replica
perhaps originally a lawn ornament, now an excellent child's toy. Easy to find.
After the hiding game had gone on long enough, and was just starting to become
a trifle rambunctious, I tried to signal to my fellow student of Italian that
the time had come for the goose to retire for the day -- but try as I might, I
couldn't come up with a translation for the word goose. Later, after the lads
had left, I looked in the Italian dictionary for "goose." Oca, it said. A
strange, unanticipated word.

I tried to recall the Latin word for goose. Nothing. But after several hours
(and here comes the point of the story), a word suddenly floated to the surface
-- anser. Let me tell you now, fans of Dr. Metablog, that I was exceedingly
proud of myself. Fifty-five years or so after my last study of Latin, out popped
anser. Self-celebration knew no bounds.

After I had stopped crowing about my triumph, I started to marvel at the brain
-- not just my brain, but any brain. In what corner of the brain, in what
concatenation of synapses, had the word anser been lurking lo these many
decades. And what sort of ingenious search program needed only a few hours to
ferret it out?  Glaciers have melted, rivers have changed their course, and yet
anser remained unchanged, permanently embedded somewhere in my brain. It's kind
of miraculous, isn't it?

So how did Italian acquire oca rather than a word descended from anser. Why
not *asse, for example. My dictionary of classical Latin offers no alternative
to anser, but the Italian etymological dictionary explains that the late Latin
word for goose was auca, derived from a diminutive aucellus of avis (bird)
and it cites as cognates old French oue and Occitan auca. No doubt demotic auca
replaced the "book word" anser sometime in late antiquity.

The result of this investigation: next time, I will be able to say, with great
authority, "nascondi l'oca."

Title: A "Hitch" Conundrum
Date: February 07, 2017

According to his biographer (Peter Ackroyd), Alfred Hitchcock "feared and
hated the body." When he was a student at St. Ignatius in London, whenever he
used the lavatory, he scrubbed it "so that it seemed as though no one had been
there." At maturity, Hitchcock stood 5' 5" and weighed approximately 300 pounds.
His marriage to Alma Reville (4'11") was mostly "white." He claimed that it
was "sexless" and that he was a "celibated" director, and that his daughter,
Patricia, was some sort of error. "If he was not the center of conversation
or attention at a dinner table, he would often doze off." He made a bet that
a property man would not be able to spend the night chained to a camera in a
dark studio, then sabotaged him with a bottle of brandy laced with a strong
laxative. He referred to his audience as the "moron millions." He was fond of
the great painters but had no interest in any "symbolic significance or inner
meaning." The actress Ann Todd reported that he had a schoolboy's obsession with
sex and "an endless supply of very nasty and vulgar stories and jokes. He was
a very sad person." He "had a fetish about women wearing glasses." One of his
secretaries reported that he bought her five or six pairs but if she appeared
without wearing one, "it irritated the devil out of him." During the making of
Psycho, Hitchcock would place one or more grotesque models of Norman Bates'
mummified mother in Janet Leigh's dressing room, just to hear her scream. "He
would also regale her with his fund of dirty stories just before she went on
camera." When asked, "what is the deep logic of your films," he replied, "to
make the spectator suffer." When an actor was dissatisfied with a performance,
Hitchcock refused another take, saying, "They'll never know in Peoria." While
"The Birds" was being filmed, he harassed Tippi Hedren mercilessly, sending her
flowers, specifying what clothes she could wear, keeping her from her daughter,
trying to convince co-workers that they were having an affair. He gave Hedren's
young daughter (Melanie Griffith) an image of her mother lying in a coffin.
Hitchcock's recurrent dream was that his penis was made of crystal.

Is it possible that so stunted a human being might become a great artist?  Or
is it rather that his obsessions, distortions and failures of human empathy
constitute a permanent barrier to greatness and that time will reveal that even
his best films are shallow and brittle -- all surface glitter?

Title: My Teachers:  James Hutton (1902-1980)
Date: March 01, 2017

The most erudite man that I ever encountered in my own person was James
Hutton, a professor of classics when I was an undergraduate at Cornell back
there in the 1950s. Professor Hutton bristled with knowledge -- nor is this my
opinion only, but one that is well attested by his international reputation and
by the list of his writings. Hutton wrote two enormous books (800 pages each!!)
that won him his scholarly spurs: The Greek Anthology in Italy (1935) and The
Greek Anthology in France and in the Latin Writers of the Netherlands to the
Year 1800 (1946). I encountered Professor Hutton in 1958 when, callow and poorly
educated, I enrolled in a Latin course called "Terence and Catullus" (of which
more later). But first, for those curious readers out there in bloglandia who
are on tenterhooks, painfully stretched like new wool and are wondering what
the heck is the "Greek Anthology" about which James Hutton composed his
pair of magna opera and around which his life centered -- turn we now to the
pages of the Encyclopedia Brittanica.

In brief, the Anthologia Graeca is a collection of poems, mostly epigrams, that
had a complicated ancient history, but originated perhaps with an anthology
complied by Meleager of Gadara in the first century BCE, which brought
together works by many ancients including Archilochus, Alcaeus, Anacreon and
Simonides (all big names in their time). There were a series of early editions
that do not survive but an authoritative version was made by Constantine
Cephalas in the 10th century. "Cephalas appended a number of other collections:
homoerotic verse collected by Straton of Sardis in the 2nd century AD; a
collection of  Christian epigrams found in churches; a collection of satirical
and convivial epigrams collected by Diogenianus as well as Christodorus's
description of statues in the Byzantine gymnasium of Zeuxippos; and a
collection of inscriptions from a temple in Cyzicus." And then in 1300 or
thereabouts Maximus Planudes brought together an edition which became standard,
which, while adding some poems, also deleted or bowdlerized many of those that
offended his puritanical Christian sensibilities. Planudes' anthology was the
only one known to Western Europe for many centuries; manuscript transmission was
superseded when an edition based on his work was printed in 1494.

There's a lot more but that's enough information for us to understand the area
which James Hutton worked. Professor Hutton knew the anthology backwards
and forwards and made it his business to trace its considerable influence
through the Latin and vernacular poetry of late antiquity and the medieval
and renaissance worlds. Quite an endeavor, in my opinion.

Hutton was a Scotsman, born in Airth, son of a sea captain, though from where
I sat (in a small seminar room in Goldwin Smith Hall!!), it was impossible
to imagine that he had ever been a child or even a young man. He came to the
US early in life and there was not a trace of Scotland in his speech. Hutton
entered Cornell as a freshman in 1920, received three degrees there, stayed
on to teach, and retired in 1973. According to his Cornell obituary, he was a
life- long bachelor. For most of his adulthood, he lived with his mother, Mrs.
Elizabeth Hutton, and he shared a house for many years with Professor Lane
Cooper, his teacher and another bachelor Cornell classicist. After the death of
his mother and of Cooper, he continued to live at 123 Roberts Place with his
cousin/housekeeper, Mrs. Margaret Green. Perhaps he was a delightful presence
among his friends, but to my eyes he was a pale, tall, gaunt, dry-as-a stick,
bony man devoid of humor or juice. Born only two years before my own father, he
seemed to be generations older.

Now a few words about Terence and Catullus, the twin subjects of my 1958 Latin
classroom experience.

Terence (Publius Terentius Afer) was Roman playwright possibly of Berber origin
but certainly originally a north African slave. Brought to Rome and freed,
he wrote six comedies, adapted from Greek originals, of which we students of
Professor Hutton plowed through three: Andria (166 BC); The Self-Tormentor (163
BC) and the Adelphi (160 BC). Terence drowned on a trip to Greece, age 25. His
must have been a marvelously romantic life, even though much curtailed. Too bad
we know only its barest outline.

Here's the title page to the first "modern" edition of Terence's works (1496)

In Terence's plays, young noblemen dally with prostitutes or mistresses even
as their fathers insist that they marry more respectable ladies. Plots, often
contrived by the dull hero's wily slave, fail to come to fruition because the
conspirators are carelessly overheard. Sometimes apparently unrelated women (one
rich, the other poor), turn out to be sisters. Sham marriages and double-dealing
are frequent. It is not uncommon that sons discover by accident, in the last
scene of the play, the identities of their biological fathers. When there are
plans to destroy female infants, the girls are rescued and raised secretly, only
to come forward as beauties at a critical juncture of the plot. Young noblemen
are prone to breaking into the houses of pimps to carry off the girls they
love. Generally, plays end with multiple and suitable marriages, the old folks
outwitted and the youngsters carrying the day. Slaves are freed.

Meanwhile, characters coin memorable aphorisms in succinct, elegant
Latin. Everyone knows "Homo sum, nihil a me alienum puto"  -- I am a man,
nothing human is alien to me.  But also quot homines tot sententiae: suus
cuique mos -- So many men, as many opinions; to each his own way. And "fortis
fortuna adiuvat" --  fortune favors the brave.  And "nullumst iam dictum quod
nos dictum sit prius" --nothing new is said that has not been said before. And
"amantium irae amoris integratio est" -- lover's quarrels are the renewal of
love.

But with all these comic goings-on and witty sayings, there was not one moment
that I can remember when Professor James Hutton laughed or smiled or indicated
in the least that the plays were clever or amusing. Instead, we discussed
grammatical questions with much emphasis on the differences between second
century and first century Latin. Dry as dust, it was. The opportunity to find
the common humanity of ancient Romans and 1950s Cornellians was missed, even
shirked.

Terence's louche and lively plots must have posed a problem for Professor
Hutton; Catullus of Verona, a poet of love and sex and bawdy, could only have
caused even more of a difficulty. In the edition in which we read Catullus, a
drab gray book which must have dated from the early part of the century, certain
of the more scabrous poems were omitted but, in a moment of confused prudery,
printed -- in a smaller font --in an appendix. I suspect that they were also
bowdlerized. Some of the words that Catullus used in his freer verse were not to
be found in our dictionary, which had also been cleansed. And in a translation
that I consulted (was it the Loeb?) the offending poems did appear, but only in
Italian. Was the idea that if anyone could read Italian he must be sophisticated
enough to deal with Catullan pornography. Perhaps my readers think that I'm
fantasizing or imagining this half-hearted censorship, but it's as true as true.
Swear.

Even after all these years, two of Catullus's poems stay in my mind. The best,
the most frequently republished and the most influential is known to classicists
as Catullus 5. It's a remarkable poem. Here's the Latin, which is not difficult.

Vivamus, mea Lesbia, atque amemus

Rumoresque senum severiorum

omnes unius aestimemus assis.

Soles occidere et redire possunt;

nobis, cum semel occidit brevis lux

Nox est perpetua una dormienda

da mi basia mille, deinde centum

dein mille altera, dein secunda centum

deinde com milia multa fecerimus

conturbabimus illa, ne sciamus,

aut ne quis malus invidere possitor

cum tantum sciat esse basiorum.

And here's a translation. "Let us live, my Lesbia, and love. The gossipings of
stern old men let us value at just one penny.  Suns may set and rise again,
but us, when once the brief light has set, night is one perpetual sleep. Give
me a thousand kisses, then a hundred, then another thousand, then a second
hundred, then yet another thousand, then a hundred, then when we have counted
up many thousands, let us shake [the abacus] lest some evil man be envious when
he knows how many kisses there were." That is to say, Let us keep on making
love no matter what the old envious guys think. (Lesbia has nothing to do with
lesbians; it's just code for the name of the married woman with whom Catullus
was sleeping.)

I have no recollection of any discussion of this peach of a poem in 1958.
Perhaps we talked about the ingenious lux/Nox juxtaposition, but I am sure we
didn't touch on either the boasted adultery or the joys of sex. We were still
in the last gasp of Victoriana. We were pre-Beatles, pre-Kennedy, pre-readily
available contraceptives. Some things were not to be discussed.

The other poem that stands in my memory is Catullus 61, a joyous epithalamion
(or marriage song) which celebrates, with great gusto, the wedding of Vinia and
Manlius. It is sensual and almost hypnotic. It's frankness about sexual pleasure
pleased me in 1958, when such things were rare. Still pleases me.

But what about the omitted poems, the ones too "coarse" for our tender eyes and
ears?  How would James Hutton have dealt with them. Not at all, of course.
But now, censorship and self-censorship and propriety eased, we can read the
poem that begins Paedicabo ego vos et irrumabo. which I can now translate as
"I will fuck you in the ass and then fuck you in the face." And goes on from
there. Not part of the 1958 curriculum. In Professor Hutton's class, we were
more comfortable discussing a synezis of the genitive than any exercise of the
genitalia.

But I wonder, now, about, James Hutton, at home after a hard day of declining
and conjugating, at dinner with his mother and his bachelor roommate. What did
Professor Hutton think about Catullus's "paedicabo ego vos et irrumabo".

This I know: whether repelled or offended or secretly sympathetic, he certainly
did not share his feelings with his students.

Title: Chinatown -- Odd Man Out
Date: March 03, 2017

At the Vivian de St. Vrain Theater, also known as the bedroom, pleasurably
supine on what Italians call the letto matrimoniale, we watch films from all
decades of cinema history. The new technologies deluge us with riches. Films
arrive by mail, by download, and on TCM and MGM and Encore Classics. It's all so
remarkably easy.

We especially enjoy unplanned, spontaneous juxtapositions. Two nights ago, for
example, we re-re-re-rewatched, on Encore, a film that must be on everyone's top
ten list, the great noir classic Chinatown. Dazzled we were, once again. And
then, last night, courtesy of the U. S. Post Office and Netflix, along came
Carol Reed's masterpiece, Odd Man Out. There was, trust me, no plan to follow
the one with the other -- but what a stroke of good fortune!!

Chinatown (1974) gives us a fully-realized Los Angeles in the 1930s. The plot
is complicated but not confusing. J. J. Gittes, a bored, compromised detective,
is smart enough to unravel the plan to steal the water and smart enough to
identify the murderer but nevertheless too innocent to grasp the unspeakable
corruption at the heart of the of Mulwray-Cross family. Odd Man Out (1947),
which also manages to make its Belfast setting as real as real, offers only
the slightest plot -- Johnny McQueen's desperate attempt to escape his city.
Yet what a remarkable story and how ably peopled with a variety of characters.
It becomes almost picaresque in organization as Johnny reels from adventure to
adventure, encountering Irish samaritans good, bad, and traitorous. On the
surface the films are miles apart --Los Angeles all bright colors and fancy
clothes, awash with prosperity, Belfast dark dark dark and gloomy. And yet the
two films seemed oddly similar.

The overlaps and echoes were such that we decided to investigate. Here's what
we discovered, via the wikipedia entry on Chinatown. "Filmmaker Roman Polanski
(the director of Chinatown) has repeatedly cited Odd Man Out as his favorite
film. 'I still consider it to be one of the best movies I've ever seen and a
film which made me want to pursue this career more than anything else....  I
always dreamed of doing things of this sort or that style.  To a certain extent
I must say that I somehow perpetuate the ideas of that movie in what I do.'"
 So our speculation about the similarities was validated. Unquestionably,
Polanski had Carol Reed in mind while making Chinatown.

Let us cut to the chase and (spoilers coming, so watch out!) concentrate on the
two films' last scenes. Johnny McQueen, badly wounded, is trying to make it
down to the docks to get himself out of Belfast. He's helped by his girlfriend
Kathleen Ryan. For a hopeful second, it appears that he's going to escape, but
the police surround him. He can no longer see, but he asks Kathleen, "Is it
far?"  Kathleen replies (and you have to be made of stone not to drop a tear),
"It's a long way, Johnny, but I'm coming with you." She shoots at the police and
they respond with "deadly force." It's suicide by cop -- a sad emotional love-
death Romeo and Juliet ending. The ending of Chinatown is much more hopeless.
Evelyn Mulwray tries to escape her father, corrupt and powerful Noah Cross. She
drives away with her daughter but a fusillade of police bullets kills her. Evil,
malevolent Cross wins everything -- the money, the land, the water, the child.
(Polanski even altered the original ending to make it darker, more like Odd Man
Out.) "Forget it, Jake, it's Chinatown" --  i.e. inexplicable, impenetrable.

More on Polanski here.

Title: "Maestro to the Pit"
Date: March 07, 2017

Several times a year, we attend the opera -- that is, we wander over to the
Metropolitan Opera widescreen HD broadcasts at our local movie theater.
Last week, it was Dvorak's Rusalka --overproduced, over-costumed, a mighty
silly story, but nevertheless glorious. Sung in Czech. Of course, I didn't
understand a word, but then I never do expect to do so, even when the opera is
sung in a language with which I'm supposed to be on speaking terms. But it's not
the libretto which we savor, it's the music.

Nevertheless at each performance there's a solemn  moment when language moves
front and center. It comes after the preliminary fol-de-rol and acknowledgements
and interviews and trailers-for-next-month's performance are finally dispensed
with. Now, at long last, the camera locates the head-setted director, who sits
at huge intimidating console of buttons and knobs and switches and lights. And
now here they come, the words of magic and enchantment: "maestro to the pit."

In that pithy, incantatory sentence is encapsulated all the ritual power of
language. It's a hieratic moment. After such a magnificent statement,
everything else is anticlimax (linguistically speaking).

Freed by these words, the shamanic conductor heretofore invisible, steps up,
turns his back to the audience and faces the orchestra, brandishes his baton,
and initiates the business of the day.

"Maestro to the pit."  I love the idea that the generic term for conductor is
"maestro." I love the quasi-oxymoronic juxtaposition of "maestro" and "pit."
 In fact, I love the word "pit" in this context. Not a hole in the ground, nor
the pit of hell, nor a place in which to chuck pieces of dismembered bodies. No,
an orchestra pit, which is a horse of an entirely different color. Good thing
it's not the custom to say "conductor to the podium." How flat, how banal, how
unsacral. No dignity, no grandeur, no poetry.

No, it's "maestro to the pit." And let it always be so.

And by the way, I make a pretty good barbecue sauce, and I'm proud to say
that my spare ribs are semi-famous. Let the word go forth, that now and
forever, whenever I'm called to the grill, it's going to be "maestro to the
pit."

Title: You Can Count on Me Again and Again
Date: March 10, 2017

All my movie-loving friends told me that I must watch Kenneth
Lonergan's Manchester-by-the-Sea (2016). That was before the film won all
those awards. So I crashed the Netflix line and there it was in my mailbox the
first day that it was released on disk. And indeed it's a fine film. No car
chases, no special effects, just real people wrestling their way through his
world of woe. Good dialogue. Excellent camera work, excellent editing, splendid
acting.

But half way through the film, I began to experience disappointment. An
unavoidable sense of dejavuitude. Wait, haven't I seen this before? And then I
remembered Lonergan's earlier film, You Can Count on Me (2000). Hmmm.

In YCCoM, 20ish small-town boy Terry Prescott is unsteady and unfocused because
he has lost his parents in an automobile accident. in MbtS, 30ish small-town boy
Lee Chandler is sullen and isolated because he has lost his children in a house
fire. In YCCoM,  Terry Prescott has a nephew, son of his much more grounded
sister, with whom he tries to connect. In MBtS, Lee Chandler has a nephew, son
of his brother, with whom he tries to connect. In YCCoM, Terry Prescott gets
into a fight with a guy he used to know very well. In MbtS, Lee Chandler gets
into a bar fight with a guy he's never met.  In YCCoM, Terry Prescott can't
stay put, has to be on the road; in MbtS, Lee Chandler is stuck at home, can't
get out of his rut.

The details are different, but it's unquestionably the same story, inverted. It
can almost be thought of as a sequel, with Casey Affleck recapitulating the role
created by Mark Ruffalo.

They're both excellent films -- just a trifle redundant. As a would-be
enthusiast of the later effort, I felt just a little cheated.

All writers, even the best, repeat themselves. Nevertheless, I'm hoping that
Kenneth Lonergan's next picture, to which I'm looking forward with great
anticipation, breaks out of the box, tries something entirely new.

Title: Birthday Gifts for Me Me Me
Date: March 13, 2017

A few years ago I posted, right here on this blague, pictures of some handsome
objects that would make good birthday presents for yours truly. But one March 11
after another March 11 has come and gone, and -- nothing. Not a single reader,
acquaintance, friend, or relative has embraced the opportunity. There has not
been so much as a serious inquiry, even though my suggestions were eminently
sensible.

I'm going to try once again this year. After all, unemployment is down, the
stock market is up, and there's more loose change out there. (And perhaps more
escapism.) Moreover, there won't be many more birthdays for me -- I'm getting up
there in years. It's now or never.

So -- fans of Vivian de St. Vrain, and Vrainites everywhere, seize the day.

OK, steady now. What about a castle in Ireland? I would really enjoy a castle.
There are many on the market this year, and they're quite reasonably priced, as
castles go.

For example, here's Ballindooley, a starter Castle in Galway.

Even though it's small, it has undeniable "curb appeal." The realtor claims that
it was built toward the end of the 15th century in the Norman style and probably
for the DeBurgo family. The realtor also notes that there's "a new stone parapet
and that there have been recent repairs to the machicolations."

Inasmuch as I wouldn't dream of owning a castle where the machicolations were
all busted up, I'm happy for the reassurance. The price: a bargain at a mere
950,000 euros.

Though I wouldn't turn up my nose at Ballindooley, I would certainly prefer
Killaghy Castle at Mullinahone in Tipperary.

It's a better value. The original castle was built, the realtor claims (I
haven't seen the documentation) in the first decade of the 13th century. A "long
house" was added during Tudor times, and two more buildings were attached during
the 18th century -- so it's already been updated. Plus there are two walled
gardens with "excellent mature specimen trees."  An ominous note though: "price
upon request."

So, loyal readers, it's time for you to chip in your pennies and farthings and
join together for one big happy birthday celebration for me.

And please, don't forget that in order for me to care for your gift properly,
I'm going to need a bit of an endowment --  which I do not see as much of a
problem. Plus furnishings.

And by the way, for those of you who are not "in the know" about castles, a
"machicolation" is a "projecting gallery at the top of a castle wall, supported
by a row of corbeled arches and having openings in the floor through which
stones and boiling liquids could be dropped on attackers."

I like a castle that says, "all welcome."

Title: The Mall of Me
Date: March 16, 2017

I can, however, imagine a shopping mall designed for my particular and personal
satisfaction. It would be called "The Mall of Me."

Anchoring one end of the Mall of Me is a large book store, carrying both new
and used, but stocked with volumes of history, fine arts, crafts, popular
science, biography, travel, fiction, gardening and what used to be called
"natural history", with lots of room to browse and sit and read. Proviso: the
"bookstore of me" carries zero books on Spirituality, Self-Improvement, Soul
Regression, Tarot, Alternative Therapies, or Healing Arts. No books written by
TV pastors or repentant politicians recently released from prison or by instant
millionaires. No celebrity autobiographies. At the other end of the Mall of Me,
there's a shop selling music cds which  specializes in the great age of middle
European music from 1685 (birth of Bach) to 1911 (death of Mahler), but also
features a treasury of classic blues, bluegrass, American roots, popular song,
rock and roll, and gospel of the golden age. No New Age, No Rap, no Electronic.
Between my two "anchors," there will be a good garden store featuring expensive,
elegant, heavy-in-the-hand garden tools. No power mowers or power tools, but
when appropriate to the season, racks of seeds, preferably of heirloom and
antique vegetables. Next to it, a movie memorabilia and poster store, with large
collections from the earliest days of cinema right through 1950, especially
Shakespeare movies. And then I'd like a high-end antique store displaying walls
and shelves of classical and Asian works of art. Unfortunately, because of
budgetary constraints, I won't be doing any purchasing in this particular shop,
but I'll be pleased to browse in it, at least weekly, perhaps oftener. Also, a
cafe where a guy could purchase a hot chocolate and an almond croissant. I would
also like a store that specializes in 19th and early 20th century Caucasian rugs
and wall-hangings though here, once again -- it would be more for appreciating
than for actual buying. Subject to the same constraints, a baseball memorabilia
shop -- National League only. A high end crafts store. And as for restaurants:
a Jewish deli, modeled after the now defunct Second Avenue Delicatessen. An
imaginative Asian fusion restaurant. A bagel bakery. No fish, and certainly no
sushi. Perhaps a hole-in-the-wall one-person walk-in shop where a guy or gal
could help me with computer and cell phone anomalies and failures -- someone
who speaks in traditional English, not in acronyms. And then there will be
buskers: at one end of the mall, a string quartet; at the other end, a bluegrass
band. No fire-eaters, contortionists, or drummers banging on pots and pans. All
performers personally vetted by me. No panhandlers or noble solicitors with
their dread clipboards.

And of course, some intelligently-designed play areas for infants, new walkers
and small children. And some comfortable chairs for their parents (and me) to
sit and watch the kiddies frolic.

Yes, I think that will do it.  It's the Mall of Me.

Now that I think of it, everyone should have their own mall. Instead of vast
mall installations, let's have targeted malls. Individually designed and
executed.

Merchandising genius!!

Title: Chalaza
Date: March 21, 2017

If you asked me to guess what the word "chalaza" means, I'd say, from its sound,
that it would have to be an odd cactus-y looking plant that grows only in the
Atacama desert and flowers once a decade, or an extinct language formerly
spoken in the southern Caucasus mountains, or perhaps some sort of Levantine
breadstick. It's a strange exotic word. But if then I told you that you've seen
thousands, perhaps many thousands of chalazas (or chalazae) with your own eyes,
and eaten as many, you'd be perplexed, even startled. Because you have eaten
them.

Anyone who's cracked an egg has noticed two ropey white bands that extend from
the yolk and are rooted in the transparent albumen.

Here's some more information about chalazae which I quote from Tim Birkhead's
The Most Perfect Thing (2016), a detailed and most enthusiastic book all about
eggs.  "The role of the chalazae is to suspend the yolk within the albumen....
One end of each chalaza is attached to the ovum itself... and the other is
firmly lodged in the layer of dense viscous albumen, which itself is attached to
the shell membranes at the pointed and blunt ends of the egg. The chalazae allow
the yolk to rotate when the egg is turned so that the embryo always remains on
top of the yolk and within the inner liquid albumen layers. This self-righting
ability is [necessary] because the embryo develops on the least dense side of
the yolk. Keeping the embryo uppermost ensures that it is always closest to the
parent's brood patch for maximum warmth, but also closest to the inner surface
of the shell for maximum access to oxygen."

No chalazae, no chicks.

I'm astonished that although I have scrambled thousands of eggs, and certainly
noticed the "ropey strands," I never gave them the slightest thought. How
incurious of me!

Birkhead's book is a revelation. He is the egg man of our times. Occasionally
he gets so carried away with his joy in the egg that he veers into unconscious
comedy. I adore the phrase, "a renaissance in the study of eggshell
pigmentation."  Or, "guillemots are not quite unique in incubating
shit-covered eggs."  Or, "tinamous lay the most extraordinary and beautiful
eggs."  Or, "there is something sensual about eggs."

About the word chalaza: it's from the Greek meaning "small knot." Nor is it new:
it entered the language (in Latinized form) in 1704.

Some practical information: the more prominent the chalazae, the fresher the
egg.

Title: Gender-blind Casting?
Date: March 28, 2017

Last Saturday, we hiked to the multiplex to hear and watch the Met's HD
performance of Idomeneo. Once again, the opera did not disappoint. Early Mozart
and glorious, especially the rousing choruses, while soprano Nadine Sierra was
a luminous Illia. A silly story, of course, but for once there was a happy
ending --a young man and a young woman, of different heritages, were allowed to
marry-- hurrah. Not without the forgiveness of a god--in this case, Neptune,
who could have saved everyone a lot of trouble if he had been quicker to act
but unfortunately didn't bother to theophanize until the passing of four hours
(including extended intermissions) and three long acts of melodic anguish and
dread.

Nevertheless, I was troubled. "And what was it this time, Mr. Malcontent," you
ask.

It was the "trouser" role. The "hero" of the opera, Idamante, the guy who gets
the girl, was played by Alice Coote, a soprano, a middle-aged woman not at all
"boyish," but full-figured, prominently bosomed, and generously hipped. She was
costumed as an ancient Cretan soldier, with an ineffective corset under her
corselet and with a circle of what looked like old-fashioned elongated leather
shaving strops or giant bookmarks hanging from waist to ankle. But her outfit
did not fool me, even though I'm very good at suspending disbelief. Trust me, I
can suspend like crazy.

And I know that there's no point going to the opera if you can't suspend
disbelief. One would think that once you accept the idea that the performers are
going to aria at each other whenever they are together and aria at the audience
when they are alone, and that they are followed wherever they go by a 100-piece
orchestra, you can believe anything at all. But I have to admit that I boggled
at Coote/Idamante and that I was sufficiently distracted that my pleasure in the
opera was compromised, diminished. At the climax, I thought, "oh no, don't let
them kiss." (They didn't, when they should have, and would have, if Idamante had
been not a soprano but a tenor or baritone -- is it possible that the director
was as squeamish as I.)

Idamante is customarily (but not always) played by a soprano because the part
was originally written for a castrato, in this case Signor Vincenzo del Prato
(no doubt known to his buddies as del Prato the castrato, or perhaps, as gli
italiani would say, del Prato il castrato). I suppose that it is considered
"authentic" to sing the part in the register in which it was composed. But
why not transpose it down an octave and give it to a handsome tenor. Yes, it
would be different, but to my eyes, much better. After all, authenticity has
already been compromised --  Alice Coote is no Vincenzo del Prato. Nor do I
hear even the most enthusiastic supporters of "period" performances call for a
restoration of castrati.

Shakespeare's women were played by boys. But even the new Globe, with its fetish
for ancient ways, does not insist on a boy Cleopatra or a boy Juliet. And all to
the good, in my opinion.

Title: Amnesia on Film: The Scarf (1951)
Date: March 30, 2017

The Scarf is a most curious, eccentric film. Something of its oddity is conveyed
by TCM's one-sentence plot summary: "An asylum escapee meets a waitress and
hides on a turkey farm; supposedly he killed someone." The film was written and
directed by E. A. (Ewald Andre) Dupont, one of the many German refugees working
in Hollywood during and after the war, and features a splendid cast including
John Ireland, Mercedes McCambridge, Emlyn Williams and especially James Barton,
in a rather brilliant performance as a good-hearted, grizzled, hermit farmer
whose flock of turkeys serves as source of income and as watchdog and possibly
as metaphor.

John Howard Barrington escapes from an institution for the criminally insane.
It seems that he's been incarcerated for a murder that he can't remember
committing. Some sort of stress amnesia, the audience is expected to believe. He
falls in with Connie Carter, a forthright waitress-singer-floozy: she introduces
herself succinctly: "I'm no lily, not at all.  But my morals have no zipper.
Let it go at that."  Connie wears an unusual scarf; when Barrington notices
it he regains a smidgen of memory. It's going to be the clue to resolving his
amnesia.  After many an adventure and some good photography, it is revealed
that judge, jury and Barrington himself have been deceived. Barrington is
innocent and the real murderer and villain is Dr. David Dunbar, an effete
confidence man/psychologist who has hidden his own psychopathic past. At the
climax, all is revealed (with the help of the scarf) and turns out for the best
--  Barrington gets the girl, regains his memory and his innocence, and takes
up the serious business of farming turkeys.

I found The Scarf absolutely riveting although I had to suspend disbelief over
the many holes in the plot and some occasional crazy continuity problems. But
amnesia movies can be mighty flexible about such details.

And there's a subtext of theatrical repetition-compulsion:  Emlyn Williams, who
plays the maniac-murderer David Dunbar, "became an overnight star in 1935, with
his thriller Night Must Fall, which he wrote and also played the lead role of a
psychopathic murderer."

Title: Amnesia on Film:  Journal of a Crime (1934)
Date: April 07, 2017

This pre-Code film deploys amnesia in a manner that is bizarre and possibly
unique. Paul, a playwright, is conducting a no ambiguity, no euphemism affair
with the actress Odette. His wife Francoise is jealous, so much so that she
shoots and kills her rival. And gets away with it. However, she is overcome with
guilt and falls into a profound depression, which the actress Ruth Chatterton
portrays convincingly, perhaps because her face lacks expression even when she
is jubilant. It appears for a while as though Francoise is going to succumb
to guilt. However, she is seriously injured in an automobile accident. She is
hospitalized but recovers, losing only her memory. But no memory, no guilt, and
in the end Francoise has recovered her husband and her health and happily sips
martinis on the Riviera. It's a rare case of therapeutic amnesia. Loss of memory
doesn't create a problem; it solves it. And why is Paul content to re-unite
with his wife the murderess? Because he is convinced that it is all God's
will -- a mighty shallow expedient. So God too is complicit in the murder and
its aftermath.

This was 1934; they couldn't have made it that way in 1935, when adultery and
crime were required to be punished.

Here's Ruth Chatterton, famous in her day but now almost forgotten:

Title: World War II Memories
Date: April 10, 2017

I was six years old when the war ended in 1945, so my memories are few and
arise in no particular order. I remember hearing news reports on the radio
that were datelined "Moscow"-- but I conflated Moscow with Bosco, a brand of
chocolate syrup popular in the 1940s. I remember that the floor of our kitchen
was disfigured with an infinite number of black marks -- rubber was in short
supply and the substituted soles left nasty blotches. My mother said, "We'll
wait until the war is over to replace the linoleum." Many commodities were in
short supply: instead of butter there was a white oleomargerine into which a
packet of orange food color was mashed to simulate a credible yellow. There were
ration books and ration stamps for gasoline and sugar and coffee and greens.
My mother was furious that Mr. Lerner, who owned the fruit and vegetable shop
on 18th Avenue, sold black-market lettuces from the back of his store. A bus
driver was rude to a passenger; my mother said: "all the decent young men are
overseas." We saved our nickels and brought money to school to buy war bonds.
Following government advice, my father dug up his carefully tended lawn and
planted a "victory garden" of vegetables. There were frequent blackouts: my
father's friend Jack Patent sported a white hard hat because he was a warden.
My Uncle Dan, a major in the Army Air Corps, came home from the Burma border
for a thirty-day furlough and showed me his captured German Luger. We received
air mail letters from him and from other soldiers with details blacked out by
military censors. I complained to my mother: "Mrs. Callery (my first grade
teacher) isn't nice to me." My mother said, "You have to forgive her; she's lost
four of her boys in the war." Lost?  Four of her boys? I did not understand.
On a sunny spring day in 1945, we heard on the radio that President Roosevelt
was dead; my mother sat on the stoop and cried. And in August of that same
year, when our family was visiting someone on a lake somewhere, all of a sudden
the adults who had motor boats were zooming back and forth and shouting and
laughing. I asked what was happening and my father said, "the war is over."

Uncle Jack's tank was demolished by German cannon fire and he was the crew's
only survivor. He lived with shrapnel in his brain until the age of ninety-one.
Cousin Saul's older brother was killed in New Guinea, but Sarah, his mother,
"knew" that he was alive and waited for the knock on the door or the telephone
call until the end of her days. Meanwhile, the poor fellow's bones lay bleaching
at Buna or some other long-forgotten field of battle. Before the war, my mother
told me, we used to receive mail from the old country -- from the many members
of the Chafetz and Tomaszewski and Middlebank and Hessel families who had stayed
behind. "But after the war, nothing."

Can we, even now, bear to imagine what became of all those Malkas and Rifkas and
Levs and Mendels?

Title: Amnesia on Film:  Love Letters (1945)
Date: April 17, 2017

Here's another film in the sub-genre that might be called a "Did I Do It."  And
still another case of "post-murder amnesia."

Singleton, who can't remember anything, even her own first name, is played by
Jennifer Jones with a kind of distant unfocused look about her. She is seriously
troubled; in addition to her amnesia, she's been the victim of a prank in which
Alan Quinton (Joseph Cotten) wrote her Cyrano-like love letters under the name
of the lout Roger Morland. She fell in love with the author of the letters, but
alas, deceived, married the lout. Now the lout has been murdered and Singleton,
blamed for it, is just out of the mental hospital where she was incarcerated.
Did she do it?  Of course not. She may not have a clue, but Alan and we the
audience suspect that she's too pretty and harmless to have done anything bad,
let alone committed a murder. Eventually, the truth outs and the real murderer
is revealed. Singleton regains her memory and gains the replacement husband (the
eloquent Alan that she wanted all along). It's a mighty unbelievable story but
whenever amnesia is involved, probability goes flying out the window.

Bosley Crowther, the New York Times film critic at the time, who never liked
anything, called it "sentimental twaddle." I myself, once disbelief is not only
suspended but obliterated, found it to be a quite an engaging mystery.

Title: A Letter to my Grandchildren
Date: April 18, 2017

What was it like in the 1940s when I was your age?  Very different. Milk was
delivered daily in bottles: a milk-wagon, drawn by a tired, plodding old horse,
appeared on East 9th Street three times a week before we sat down to breakfast.
There were also daily visits from a horse-drawn vegetable truck. An itinerant
knife-sharpener came once every couple of months. And also a very old man with
a large sack thrown over his back, singing out in the loudest voice I've ever
heard, 'I cash clothes." There were squarish automobiles (Packards, DeSotos,
Studebakers), but far fewer than today -- so few that kids would play punchball
and stickball right in the middle of the street, just stepping to the side to
let that occasional car whizz by. Kids also skated in the street, using clunky
metal skates that attached to the shoe by turning a "skate key." There was
no television, but everyone listened to the radio. "Portable" radios were as
big as bread boxes. Some people had refrigerators (much smaller than modern
ones), but most had "iceboxes." Every week, an ice delivery man would haul a
block of ice (about a foot-and-a-half square if I remember correctly) with
large tongs and set it in the icebox. Coal was delivered in barrels: men with
heavy gloves would roll the barrels from the truck to the ground-level coal
chute. All telephones were attached to the wall with wires. Long distance phone
calls were expensive and only for emergencies. People did not communicate by
e-mail or by texting, but by means of postcards and letters. A "letter" was a
piece of paper on which whole paragraphs were written; it was inserted into an
"envelope" and put in a "mail box" for delivery. Hard to believe, I know. There
were no word processors. I learned to write using a "straight pen." There were
no dvd's or cd's or streaming. Instead, we had "records," vinyl discs 12-inches
in diameter which were placed on a rotating "turntable" on which rested a hand
with a stylus, at first steel and then later diamond. It was primitive, I know,
but it worked rather well. There were no credit cards. Some people had checking
accounts, but 99% of commercial transactions were completed with "money." When I
started at P. S. 217, in 1944, I wore "knickers" (pants that went to just below
the knee and were held in place with elastic) and long socks. You can sometimes
see knickers in old illustrated books or in clothes museums. Men always wore
hats: fedoras or derbies or panamas or bowlers or pork-pies, usually made of
felt. Women wore hats too, some with veils, most of them godawful ugly. Young
folks "courted." In those days, before people became intimate, they would go
through a period in which they would "date" and talk and get to know each other.
This period could last for weeks or even months. Astonishing, I know, but trust
me, it happened that way in the old days. "The past is another country; they do
things differently there."

Title: Deepfried Oreos
Date: April 20, 2017

On the main street of Estes Park (Gateway to Rocky Mountain National Park),
a sign outside the restaurant advertised "deepfried oreos." I was both
flabbergasted and thunderstruck, not believing my eyes. But here's the evidence:

Just above ice cream and below "funnel cakes" (but that's another story). Is it
a hoax, or can there be such a thing? Absolutely, there's many a google-entry
on "deepfried oreos." Several different recipes, one more hideous than the next.
A piece of cuisine americaine that had somehow escaped me all these many years.

One of my waggish friends writes: "I should confess that the last time my wife
and I were in Paris, we sampled the deep fried Oreos at a little café on the
rue de Rivoli. The sommelier suggested a hearty Cabernet to take the edge off
the sweetness of the dish and the wine worked beautifully with the cookie
filling, an amalgam of flavors that made our senses tingle." I of course was
skeptical of his story. No knowledgeable sommelier would recommend a red wine
because it was well known that deepfried oreos were best served with champagne
or gatorade.

Is it possible that deepfried oreos could become part of the cuisine of old
Europe? Will it be the case that in every Italian village, just between the
macelleria and the quaint pasticceria there will be an oreofritteria? A
mom-and- pop oreofritteria using recipes that have been in the family for
centuries -- but in danger of being taken over by the big American chain,
a subsidiary of -- who knows what -- called Signor Oreofritto. A terrifying
prospect all around.

Title: Sexual Dimorphism -- What's the point?
Date: April 25, 2017

By all rights I should have been attending to the intricate areas of my face
while shaving, but I lapsed into a reverie. My obsession of the moment--the
beard. Why? Why in the world do human males grow hair on their faces? What's the
point? The beard is completely valueless except to Gillette and Schick and now
Harry.

If the beard had a genuine function and if it honestly kept a person warm in
winter, then for what reason would evolution deprive the gals of equivalent
protection?

Do bearded males garner a larger share of the nubile maidens than the shaved and
beardless? Or a disproportionate share of the wealth? I know of no evidence that
they do so. The fact that most men shave their beards argues that beards lack
power or function.

It's sexual dimorphism without purpose or logic. My guess--and it's only a guess
--is that the beard-gene clung to a gene with a useful male purpose a couple of
hundred thousand years ago and never let go. Accidental hirsuteness.

I suppose that there are times when sexual dimorphism can be useful. Those
magnificent manes sported by the lions of the Serengeti certainly make a
formidable statement--noli me tangere and by the way remember to keep your paws
off the the ladies in my harem. I can see that--but then, the males of the
enormous extinct European lion managed without a ruff, as do Bengal tigers.

The gorgeous display of the male peacock is exuberant but inessential--more
subtle birds manage to signal their gender and their availability without such a
prodigious waste of resources.

I should be relieved that it's only the beard that I have to worry about.
Imagine if by some quirk of evolution, males of my species grew a big rack of
antlers. Way more inconvenient than a mere beard. What a bother!! I can easily
imagine myself lodged in a narrow doorway, or lying in bed trying to find a
comfortable position while the antlers scratch the headboard, put holes in the
pillow, or poke the eye of the beloved.

Perhaps an advanced civilization would demand that we disbud the antlers at
birth? Or we might go the other route and celebrate a magnificent set. We might
have evolved into a society that decorated or colored or polished the antlers.
"How are you wearing your antlers this winter?" "Natural brown, I think, this
year, but with golden highlights." Chains of "Mr. Antler" or "Antler King" shops
("discount on sharpening this week only"). And for guys declined into the vale
of years--prosthetic antlers.

Better a beard than antlers. Definitely.

Title: Representative Markwayne Mullin Back in the News
Date: April 27, 2017

Four years ago, I listened to a radio interview with Markwayne Mullin, a new
member of the House of Representatives from eastern Oklahoma, and was absolutely
flabbergasted. Astonished and dismayed, I wrote a few paragraphs about him.
Here''s what I said then: "It wasn't that he was inarticulate or stupid. It was
that he was so utterly smug, so absolutely and entirely certain of himself. He
has no doubts. He knows exactly what ails the country -- too much government
-- and he knows how to fix it -- lower taxes, less regulation, more free
untrammeled capitalism. He does not seem to be aware that the United States of
America is a big, complicated, multi-faceted country. Markwayne Mullin possesses
all the arrogance of ignorance, in spades."

And here he is, Representative Markwayne Mullin, smiling in front of the
mandatory flag.

I went on to report on Mullin's views, which were the usual list of utterly
unoriginal, thoughtless, simplistic tea party talking points. I concluded by
offering the hope (or might I say it) the prayer, which was "that Markwayne
Mullin, who as he begins his congressional career is superficial to the very
core of his being, will come to Washington, meet some folks from different parts
of the country and from different ethnic backgrounds, learn a little about the
world, come to an appreciation of the complexity of things, and grow up to be a
useful broad-minded compassionate public servant. It's not impossible, but it's
not going to happen until Mullin realizes that he doesn't know everything about
everything, and that the practices that made Mullin Plumbing such a success may
not be the same practices that will promote the general welfare over all of the
US of A. I'm hopeful, but frankly, I'm not at all optimistic."

Well, the calendar has shed a few leaves, and it's come to pass as I feared.
Representative Markwayne Mullin has no more brain than earwax. He's learned
nothing.

He's back in the news:

"An Oklahoma congressman is facing scrutiny after a video posted Monday showed
him telling constituents at a town hall that they do not pay his salary.

“You say you pay for me to do this? That’s bull crap. I pay for myself,”
Rep. Markwayne Mullin told constituents at a town hall in Jay, Oklahoma. "I paid
enough taxes before I got here and continue to through my company to pay my own
salary. This is a service. No one here pays me to go.”

“Pays you to go where?” a constituent objected.

“This is a service for me, not a career, and I thank God this is not how I
make my living,” Mullin responded.

“Oh please, then don’t run,” a constituent said."

As I understand the exchange, Mr. Mullin believes that inasmuch as the taxes
that he paid before he became a congressman exceeds the salary he now draws,
that he has limited or no responsibility to his constituents. Not at all a
persuasive argument, because like the rest of us, Mullin's taxes go to the
defense department and to HEW with a few dribs and drabs left over for social
programs and only a trickle for paying for the House of Representatives

But that's not the heart of the matter. The important question is this:  why
the heck is Mullin in congress? Obviously, he hates the job and and even more
obviously he hates his constituents. He has no respect for government.

Perhaps it's time for Mr. Mullin to reconsider his career. What everyone wants
in a representative is someone who will inform himself, be sensible, broad-
minded, be able to work with all parties, and be respectful of his constituents.
Mr. Mullin fails on all counts. Let's assume he's a good plumber. Look, Oklahoma
needs  good plumbers. Please, Mr. Mullin. Do the work you were called to.
Markwayne, go back to where you came from, fix those pipes, and stay away from
government. Please, don't run again. You've done your bit; let someone else take
a crack at it.

Title: "Leonardo the Enlightened Lion" by Ralph Ganesha Jefferson
Date: April 30, 2017

Once Leonardo defeated the old king and began to rule the pride, he evolved into
a more modern lion -- more sensitive, more sharing, and more mindful. While he
did not trim his mane or become less manly, he transitioned to a new kind of
male.

First he decided no longer to bite the necks of the lionesses whom he mounted.
Instead he wooed them gently with wine and flowers. He was a considerate mounter
-- always taking care that the experience was sweet for his lionesses. He
learned to roar more musically.

And soon after, he gave up the custom of breaking the backs of the kittens of
the previous king. Instead, he nurtured the babies and brought them porridge and
toys and stuffed animals. Nor did he drive the juvenile males into the bush. He
taught them to dance and to draw and to meditate.

And finally Leonardo stopped treating other animals as prey. He became a gazelle
guardian. Conscious of the environment, he encouraged all in his pride to eat
organic fruits and vegetables and wholesome ancient grains.

Nowadays Leonardo the enlightened lion starts each day with a large bowl of
gluten-free granola and yoghurt.

He's into wellness.

Insomnia once again -- a nightly affliction, a family trait. Perhaps we lack a

tombstone inscribed with the motto, just beneath my name and dates, "No More

During the wakeful nights, I've taken to listening to old-time radio. My

the 1920s (perhaps John McCormack) in a scratchy recording (tuba for bass) wail
or warble "The Lost Chord"-- quite the 3 am treat it was. A flood of memories
arose, because "The Lost Chord" was one of the songs that we learned during
the PS 217 assembly back there in Flatbush in the 1950s. I recalled with some
amusement that our determined "music specialist," Miss Georgia Keiselbach, a big
lumbering woman with a trained contralto voice, tried gamely to inculcate an
anguished mid-Victorian quasi religious parlor song into the minds of a roomful
of fidgety 10-year-olds. Quite an experience. I was entranced by Sir Arthur
Sullivan's melody, but I have to admit that the lyric was incomprehensible to me
then and is still quite a challenge to this day.

So I investigated. Onto the internet, which, fortunately, works very well at 4
am.

The words to "The Lost Chord" are by Adelaide Anne Procter, after Tennyson
apparently the most popular poet of her day, although I must confess that
I had never heard of her even though I'm supposed to know something about
nineteenth- century English literature.

Here's Ms. Procter's fervid poem:

Seated one day at the organ,I was weary and ill at ease,And my fingers wandered
idlyOver the noisy keys.I know not what I was playing,Or what I was dreaming
then;But I struck one chord of music Like the sound of a great Amen.It flooded
the crimson twilight,Like the close of an angel's psalm,And it lay on my fevered
spiritWith a touch of infinite calm.It quieted pain and sorrow,Like love
overcoming strife;It seemed the harmonious echoFrom our discordant life.It
linked all perplexed meaningsInto one perfect peace,And trembled away into
silenceAs if it were loth to cease.I have sought, but I seek it vainly,That one
lost chord divine,Which came from the soul of the organ,And entered into mine.It
may be that death's bright angelWill speak in that chord again,It may be that
only in Heav'nI shall hear that grand Amen.

I'll paraphrase (even though I know that paraphrase is not a nice thing to do
to a poem): in a reverie at the organ the poet experiences something grand
that is aesthetic, transcendent, ineffable, and fleeting. The "lost chord
divine" -- note the Miltonic deployment of adjectives -- stands for the hope
or wish or belief that there is such a place as heaven and that it's a place
where weariness, fever, pain, sorrow, perplexity, strife, and discord are
superseded by the "infinite calm" and "perfect peace" of the "grand Amen."  A
not unusual or extraordinary nineteenth-century sentiment where the hunt for the
disappearing god was frequently mediated by art -- in this particular case by
the art of music.

As long as I'm reducing the poem to its paraphraseable meaning, I might also add
that Procter, like many poets before and after her, has conflated religious and
sexual longing. I derive this meaning, inaccessible to the roomful of quavering
sopranos of which I was one, and very likely unsuspected by Miss Keiselbach
herself, from the vocabulary of passion in which the poem is couched: "crimson,"
"touch," "lay" "love," "trembled."  And from the sentence, "It came from the
soul of the organ,/  And entered into mine," where it might be argued, slightly
frivolously, that any line of poetry that contains "came" "organ" and "entered"
has got to be about a symbolic sexual encounter. Especially when the ambiguous
word "mine" can denote either "my soul" or "my organ." So in this extravagant
reading, in which it is once again clearly demonstrated that you can take the
boy out of Brooklyn but you can't take the Brooklyn out of the boy, "The Lost
Chord" is not only about the search for "perfect peace" but also for the perfect
orgasm which will provide infinite calm to the poetess when she "dies" -- a word
which is itself a Victorian euphemism for sexual climax. The lost chord is the
big O (and I don't mean Oscar R.)

Just for fun of it let me also adduce a couple of sentences from the wikipedia
article on Adelaide Anne Procter: "Modern critics argue that Procter's work is
significant for what it reveals about how Victorian women otherwise repressed
feelings." "One critic suggests that Procter may have been a lesbian and in
love with Matilda Hays; other critics have called Procter's relationship with
Hays 'emotionally intense.'" "Procter became engaged in 1858. The identity of
Procter's fiancé remains unknown, and the proposed marriage never took place."
"In 1851, Procter converted to Roman Catholicism." "Procter never married. She
became unhealthy, possibly due to her charity work, and died of tuberculosis at
the age of 38." I'll let my loyal readers connect the dots.

Title: Greek and Latin Basketballese
Date: May 08, 2017

Now that we've at last come to the NBA playoffs and are heading toward another
Warriors-Cavaliers showdown, it's fitting that we reflect on basketball jargon,
which is distinguished by its many colorful monosyllables: hoops, hops, bigs,
stuff, slam, jam, slash, dish, board, glass, dunk, pick, screen, paint, lane,
point, wing, trey, rim, post, trap, "D", roll, box, press, tip, swish, bank,
brick, feed, stroke, hole, "J", rock, range.

But down-home slang is not basketball's only linguistic register.

Curiously, roundball jargon exhibits a contrary tendency toward polysyllabic
words of Greek and Latin origin. Some teams, for example, are said to be
"physical." "Physical" (from Gr. physicos = nature) means, in basketballese,
simply "rough" and does not imply that the other team plays either an ethereal
or spiritual game. It used to be that a guard played on the "outside" and
a center on the "inside"; nowadays they've become "perimeter" (Gr.) and
"interior" (L.) players. A fast break has become "transition offense." A
player doesn't drive to the basket; he "penetrates." Players no longer
jump; they "elevate"; they don't block an opponent's shot, they "reject"
it. In an odd linguistic development, a point guard no longer passes the
ball; he "distributes" (Latin: distribuere, to allot) it. In its ordinary
signification, to "distribute" a basketball would be to cut it into pieces
like a loaf of bread and give each teammate a slice, but not so in the language
of basketball. Only a few years ago, it was still possible to "switch" from
guarding one man in order to guard another; now players "rotate." "Rotate,"
derived from "rota," the Latin word for wheel, properly means "to turn on an
axis, to spin." A defender who did not switch but rotated would pirouette, and
pirouetting would not be an effective defensive strategy. (A better classical
upgrade for switch would be "revolve.") Even sillier than rotate: "rotate
over" or "rotate around"-- a usage that evokes the grotesquerie of a big guy
in a tutu pirouetting across the baseline -- a vision that is all the more
picturesque now that traditional basketball shorts have been replaced by big ol'
floppy bloomers. Just last night I heard a TV announcer declare that a seven-
foot tall player had "a lot of verticality." (I suppose that if he fell to
the floor he would have lots of "horizontality"). Players don't score; they
"convert," as in, "they had a transition opportunity  but failed to convert."
They don't push an opponent out of the way;  no, no, no, -- they create space
(Latin: creant spatium). Although I am not a physicist, I suspect that space
is something like matter, and can therefore neither be created nor destroyed. At
least not created by power forwards, however potent they may be. How silly of
me to object; neither the laws of physics nor the usual constraints of language
are binding on punditor basketballensis. OK, game's on; let's see how well they
play -- oops, sorry, how well they execute.

Title: What I Said at Our "Event"
Date: October 17, 2017

"Thank you all for coming. We appreciate it more than you can possibly imagine .
We've needed, and relied on, the support that all of you have given us         .

It's no secret that both Lynn and I have gone through some difficult times. It's
good to host a cheerful event.

A number of people have asked us about our use of the word "wed" in the
invitation that we sent to you. (We said, you remember, that we were 'wed" on
June 30). I don't want to mislead you. We didn't mean to imply that we involved
either state or church in our relationship. There didn't seem to be any point
for us to get married legally. People marry for the sake of children, but we've
decided that we're not going to have children.

Here's the story. Lynn and I wanted to acknowledge in a public way the
seriousness and permanence of our friendship -- for our families, and, I think,
especially for our grandchildren (there are ten of them). We wanted our families
to know that our relationship wasn't like some streetcar or trolley that you
hop on and hop off. So we decided to invite our most nuclear family to Lynn's
backyard garden for a brief "ceremony" -- just my children and grandchildren,
her children and grandchildren, her brother, my brother, the various spouses --
and pledge our love and fidelity. But then one of my daughters-in-law, Connie,
said that we couldn't ask people to fly in from all over the USA just for a
five minute ceremony. She suggested that we at least exchange rings. It seemed
like a good idea. So we walked over to Classic Facets on the Pearl Street Mall
and bought two not antique but vintage rings -- because we're vintage people.
Handsome rings, as you can see. And then as long as everyone was coming here a
day early we decided that we should have dinner the night before. And if you're
going to have a dinner you might as well have some music. So gradually the
"ceremony" evolved and grew. But more importantly -- and here's the point -- the
meaning of the event evolved as well. It became more significant, more profound,
more intimate. We never liked the phrase "commitment ceremony" or even the word
"commitment" because it sounds as though you are being sent either to jail or to
a mental institution, and we didn't have the vocabulary for what we intended to
do. But little by little, while we planned the event, and even more so, after
we performed the ceremony, we began to feel more and more married -- in all the
positive senses of the word. We can now say "wed" and mean it. I haven't yet
been able to say "husband" or "wife" but I suspect that one day in the not too
distant future those words will manifest themselves. But the point is that in
all the ways that matter, we are "wed."

When my Vermont friend Bert, who's just my age, got married 18 years ago, I said
to him, Bert, is it real --that you're head over heels in love at age 60? At the
time, it seemed so improbable. But now, here I am, just a year and a half short
of 80, and setting out on a new life. And 60 seems like dewy youth.

So let me repeat to you now what I said to Lynn on June 30. "I bring you my
children and my grandchildren, my prosthetic tooth, my lens implants, my hearing
aids, my non-standard but warm heart, and I take you and your children and
grandchildren and your titanium hip and arthritic finger and I say, "let us
make a life of it."

And let me just add that between us we have been married for 100 years (an
average of 50 apiece). So we ought to know what we're doing.

And what we're going to do is to ride this old trolley right to the end of the
line."

Title: Yet Another Comcast Experience
Date: October 18, 2017

I had to change the name on my Comcast -- now they call it Xfinity -- account
(internet, TV, "landline"). In the pencil and paper days, you would just cross
out the old name and put in the new. But that's not how it works nowadays. I
didn't want to call the company and be put on hold for a half an hour, and then
accidentally disconnected, which happens pretty regularly, so I drove over to
the Xfinity storefront on Baseline. Very slick modern spacious venue. You're
supposed to sign in on the computer at the front desk, but the computer was down
so they just had a paper sign-up sheet -- embarrassing I would think to the
employees to have to resort to something as antique as a written list. I noticed
that I was tenth in line and I looked around and I saw that there were only
two clerks -- they're probably called "technicians" or some other highfalutin'
name, but they're clerks. I guessed a forty-five minute wait and I wasn't far
off. I had forgotten to bring my cell phone so I couldn't amuse myself with FB
or the NYT or texting friends so I looked at the various items for sale and I
immediately felt mighty ignorant. There were all sorts of devices that I didn't
know what they did, and if I did recognize them, they were described in language
that made not the slightest bit of sense to me. One cellphone, for example,
offered both CDMA and GSM. Which is probably a good thing, and maybe someone
could explain to me what they do and why you need both of them. And would  I
want the cellphone with or without the Qi charger? That sort of thing. There
were lots of connectors with fancy plugs for connecting one device to another,
which is good if you know what you want to connect, and why, and if you have
a solid grasp of your ports. So the forty-five minutes flew by and eventually
my name was called and there I was at the counter with this young guy with a
scruffy beard that looked like his lifetime growth of facial hair. I explained
that I wanted to change the name on the account and he got to work. It seems
that you can't just change the name but you have to cancel the one account and
set up a new one so we went through the "mother's maiden name" thing and "last
four digits of your social" and so on. It seemed to go on forever and every
once in a while my technician would look up and say sort of mournfully to me
"the computer's kind of slow today." While I was with him, two old guys, older
than me, brought their bills to the next technician over and said, essentially,
"I don't understand a thing about my bill. What am I paying for. What is this
charge." Both guys went away mollified by the explanation but both said that
they had to figure out how to reduce the monthly bill. And it's a fact that the
monthly bill is rather complex. For example, I don't know why I pay a $6.00
monthly "athletic fee" but the clerk explained that it allows the company to
televise high school football and small college football games which means that
I'd be able to see Cherry Creek play Fairview or the University of Northern
Colorado play Mesa College which is something I suppose though no particular
advantage to me inasmuch as I'm personally boycotting all football because of
the incidence of traumatic dementia. But that's not the point. It took between
half and hour and forty-five minutes for my technician to make all the changes
and I signed my name several times to acknowledge this and that which I didn't
entirely understand and I was about to leave at last, but my fuzzy-cheeked
technician gave me a piece of paper on which he highlighted a telephone number.
He said, "There's one more step. When you get home, you call this number and
they will "activate" your TV and your internet and your telephone. I said, why
don't you just call them, or hand me your telephone and I'll call the activator
now but he said that wasn't the way it was done -- I had to call from my home.
So I went home picked up the telephone, but it wasn't working. No dial tone.
Of course it wasn't working -- it hadn't been "activated." The message on the
telephone screen was "check tel line," but of course I had no idea how to do
that. How did Xfinity in their wisdom and experience expect a consumer to
activate an account from an inactivated telephone. A rather large glitch in the
system I would think. However, I'm a resourceful guy so I picked up my cell
phone and called the number. I got through immediately and went through the
sequence of this press 1 if that press 2 but there was no option for activating,
so I said, several times, "I would like to talk to a human being" and after a
number of iterations and going around the choices from 1 to 5 I got through to a
person. I explained the situation very carefully to my new clerk or technician
who sounded as though he could be in India and we did the mother's maiden name
thing and the last four digits of your social and I was put on hold several
times which always makes me very nervous and finally he came back and said
that he was going to transfer me to the "activation unit," who turned out to
be a pleasant-voiced lightly-accented woman who was all business, but it took
her about half an hour to activate me because Tel 2 kept lighting up on the
modem before Tel 1 which is apparently not the way it's supposed to happen.
But eventually it came to pass. I asked my new friend where she was physically
located and she said "the Philippines." So now I'm back in business and it only
took maybe three and a half hours at the very most to change the name on the
account. Which is much longer than it took to find out why I had a $13.00 charge
including a late payment fee on my Traveler's auto insurance (put on hold twice)
or why I'm paying for a electronic newspaper subscription but can't access the
newspaper on line (on hold three times), where I eventually gave up and canceled
the subscription (it had been a long day).

Title: "Jumping the Broom"
Date: October 19, 2017

In Charles Dickens' Great Expectations, it is reported that the woman who is
eventually revealed to be Estella's mother was married "over the broomstick
(as we say), to a tramping man." Dickens offers no explanation for "over the
broomstick," apparently assuming that it was a concept with which his readers
were familiar. There is in fact a long tradition of 'jumping the broom" to
certify informally a marriage sanctioned neither by state or church. It was
practiced in west Africa where it symbolized the sweeping away of the old life
and of a leap into the new world of fertility and increase. "Jumping the broom"
was also a frequent practice in southern American slave culture where legal
marriage was prohibited. The custom was a feature of ancient Celtic societies,
especially among the Welsh and the Picts. As practiced by the Picts, broom
jumping neither predicted nor solicited fertility.

Title: Bringing Us up to Date on Otzi the Ice Man
Date: October 24, 2017

Otzi the freeze-dried 5300 year old Tyrolean man/mummy continues to be studied
and his corpse regularly yields new information.

Otzi was about 45 years old, stood 5'3" and weighed only about 110 pounds. He
had been wounded with an arrow in the shoulder which pierced an artery. He may
have bled to death or, alternatively, died from a blow to the head. He had brown
eyes, a dark beard, and long dark brown hair. He was wearing a bearskin hat, a
goat loincloth, a goat cloak, and goat leggings with deerskin laces. His shoes
were complex -- bearskin soles and deerskin uppers and were lined with hay --
presumably for both comfort and insulation. He had a calfskin belt in which he
carried flint and bone tools, including a flint dagger, a large bow and a quiver
of chamois hide reinforced with hazelwood. The quiver contained unfinished
arrows made of shoots from the guelder rose tree. He had a container constructed
of birch bark. He carried equipment for lighting a fire -- a flammable fungus,
a piece of pyrite, and a flint. Otzi also carried a woven net for trapping
prey and a mat made of grass fibers which probably served as a raincoat. And
frameworks of hazel twigs that most likely were snowshoes. His outfit consisted
of materials drawn from 18 different kinds of wood. His last meal, consumed
two hours before his death, was of various unidentified plant material, and a
helping of ibex meat. Otzi was lactose intolerant. His skin was marked in about
50 places with "tattoos" where charcoal had been rubbed into incisions. Some
ribs (he lacked a twelfth rib) and his nose bone had been previously broken but
had healed. He carried a stone ax with a copper edge --a rare and expensive
possession. To judge from the traces of arsenic in his body he might have been
a copper smith. An analysis of his mitochondria revealed that he belonged to
haplogroup K which was a typical marker of members of the farming culture that
was then expanding into Europe. His closest relatives today are found on Corsica
and Sardinia. He also belonged to a Y-chromosome haploid group G which which is
also associated with migrating farmers. He had a rare mutation known as G-L91
which has been discovered in 19 contemporary residents of the Tyrol. He was not
healthy. His knee joints were in bad shape and caused him considerable pain,
his teeth were worn down and inflamed, his lungs show traces of soot particles
probably from living in badly ventilated spaces. He suffered from Lyme disease,
rheumatism, intestinal parasites, hardened arteries, gallstones, and an ugly
growth on his little toe perhaps caused by frostbite. It would appear that he
had had a hard life.

Title: Feeding Me
Date: October 29, 2017

I calculate that for the last seventy-five years I've eaten a box of raisins
every month (I'm a big fan of raisins and of dried fruit in general). A box of
raisins is about 5 inches tall, 4 inches wide and 2 inches deep, or forty cubic
inches. In a an average year, I eat 40 x 12 or 480 cubic inches of raisins. If
I maintained my raisin-eating pace, it would take me four years to eat through
a cubic foot of them. And it follows that in the last seventy-five years I've
eaten approximately 19 cubic feet of raisins, which amounts to a stack or block
of raisins three feet long, three feet wide and two feet high. That's a heck
of a lot of raisins. And that's just raisins --  I'm not even counting table
grapes, also eaten plentifully over the decades. And wine.

I myself did not breed, plant, trim, fertilize or harvest the Thompson Seedless
or Flame grapes. I did not fence the deer out of the orchard. No did I process
the grapes. Nor box, ship, load, unload, or stock them in the market. Someone
else made the boxes from wood that another person chainsawed to the ground. I
just brought the raisins home from the market and sprinkled them on my oatmeal.
Someone else, many someone elses, did all the hard work.

I wonder how many people and how much accumulated skill it took to provide me
with 19 lifetime cubic feet of raisins.

Then there's milk. I've drunk many many cartons of milk. I'm too lazy to do the
calculations, but I'm going to guess that I've consumed a hundred times more
cubic feet of milk than I have of raisins. Probably a spacious roomful. And
once again, I did not domesticate those fearsome wild European cattle, nor did
I breed or milk them, or pasteurize  the milk, or ship it. I did not invent
refrigeration, nor did I manufacture or install the refrigerators. I did not
drive the milk truck (itself the creation of many hands). I hunted and gathered
by walking to the market and plucking a carton (whole milk, vitamin D added)
from the case. Easy as pie.

And what about potatoes? And pasta?

I don't think I need to go through any other of the commodities I consume.
My point is simple: that it takes a titanic effort by society to keep me me
me going. That I am borne on the shoulders of farmers, truckers, engineers,
mechanics -- not to mention our neolithic ancestors who first looked at a cow
and thought "glass of cold milk" or at a wild grape and thought "those would
make good raisins if we could just get the moisture content down."

So to all those people who think they are "independent" and who assert that they
can fend for themselves, I say bullshit. If you eat anything at all, you're part
of the great web of humanity that stretches around the earth and also extends
back 65,000 years.

So when you sit down to eat, and offer a prayer, don't thank god. Thank your
industrious imaginative fellow humans.

Title: Do the Dodgers Have an Outfielder Named Bacchus Pederson?
Date: November 01, 2017

Judging from his spectacularly wonderful name you might guess that Bacchus
Pederson is either a character in a novel by Thomas Pynchon or the son of a
Swedish father and a patriotic Greek mother. Not so. He's the creation not of
eccentric parents or postmodern fiction the but of the voice recognition system
that's been close-captioning that 2017 Dodgers-Astros World Series. He's an
imaginary being. He does not exist. Except on the TV screen.

There is, however, a up-and-coming not-Greek-but-Jewish on-his-mother's-side
left hand hitting center fielder for the Los Angeles Dodgers named Joc Pederson.
And what is the relationship between Joc and Bacchus, you ask?

The other day (and the following morning because the game went on roughly
forever), I watched the epic 13-12 Houston win over the Dodgers. A most exciting
game. There was bad umpiring by the home plate official, there were balls
flying out of the bandbox and onto the short porches, there was some beautiful
defensive plays and some costly mental errors. See-saw, back and forth.

And yet more. Inasmuch as my veteran ears are past their prime and over the
hill, I now supplement my hearing with "close captioning." I try to catch
what Joe Buck and John Smoltz say and then watch as their words, or some
approximation of their words, flashes across the screen. It's an activity that
is almost as fascinating and much more amusing than the game itself. And it is
out of this experience that the fanciful mythological figure of Bacchus Pederson
emerges. Smoltz says "a fly ball to center and back goes Pederson." CC writes "a
fly ball to center and Bacchus Pederson." No human being would translate "back
goes" into "Bacchus". It's nonsensical and not even decent English grammar. t's
got to be a machine, an idiot savant machine, that, stumped by "back goes," has
located "Bacchus" in its word hoard.

And similarly, what is an "Amana board?"  Something wooden manufactured in the
Amana colonies in Iowa, you might guess. No, it's CC for "a man aboard."

CC produces all sorts of comic linguistic wonders because it's utterly
untethered to common sense.

When John Smoltz, a human being who knows all there is to know about pitching,
said that the left-hander was going to try to "bury it in the back foot,"
knowledgeable baseball fans would understand exactly what was meant. The lefty
intended to throw an unhittable pitch by coming as close as possible to the
left-handed batter's left foot. However, readers would have to be mighty clever
to interpret the meaningless wild CC phrase "Marriott in the back foot."

Other electronic locutions were easier. Not much of problem with "hit it into
the upper tank" or "rubbing him of a double" or "sacrifice bump" or "Taylor will
eat it off."

Some CC flights of fancy require a little more interpretive skill. Will the
Dodger manager replace his pitcher with "a fresher god?" Perhaps a "fresher
guy." Did the pitching staff "hand out seven rocks?" Seven walks is more likely.
Do the Dodgers have a right fielder named Yossi el Pogue?  No, but they do have
Yasiel Puig. Was a reliever taken out after "a short student?" Naw, it was a
short stint. Did a pitch come "in her half" of the plate?  Who is "her"?  But
no, it was "inner half." Is it possible that a batter "applied to center?"  No
but he might very well have "flied to center."

Here's one that is Impossible to comprehend: "Turner headset hard." I had to
rewind and listen again: "Turner hits it hard."

Sometimes CC sounds vaguely spiritual. "Flies want to center," says CC. Do they
really, I ask. But what Joe Buck said was "flies one to center."

My favorites, aside from the immortal Bacchus Pederson, are errors that make no
sense at all. What does it mean to say that a pitcher is a "shortest writer."
And that he "threw his lighter."  The correct locutions: he was a "short
strider" who "threw his slider."

Voice recognition systems are technological marvels, no doubt. But they have a
way to go. There's still a place at the table for humans.

Title: All You Need to Know about Antres
Date: November 12, 2017

"Antres" is among the rarest of rare words. Shakespeare's Othello speaks of
"antres vast and deserts idle" in the magnificent oration in which he takes
issue with the Venetian bigotry that claimed that he was only able to win
white Desdemona by employing drugs and witchcraft. No, it wasn't because he
was a sorcerer; it was because he was accomplished, heroic, romantic. "Antres"
is one of the exotic words that defines the great African general as a
non-Venetian -- an outlander, an "erring barbarian," an "extravagant and
wheeling stranger."

Shakespeare coined "antres" just for the occasion, deriving it from Latin
antrum, a cave. He never used "antres" again, nor did anyone else until
Keats fleetingly revived the word two centuries afterward. "Antres" never
domesticated into English and remains curious and remote, eternally in need
of an explanatory footnote. It is unlikely that Shakespeare expected that a
popular or even a courtly audience would grasp "antres" at first hearing. It's
a risky word, but Shakespeare didn't become Shakespeare without taking risks.

The playwright coupled the neologism "antres" to another shiny new Latinism
to produce "antres vast," a phrase which translates into the language
of 2017 as "really big caves." Yet no translation can do justice to
the spacious resonance of "antres vast." The caverns to which Othello
refers are monstrously huge -- grown grander and even more inaccessible
because Shakespeare ingeniously placed the modifier after rather than before
the noun. "Antres vast" are a hundredfold more mysterious -- darker, more
echoic, more glinty with stalactites and stalagmites -- than "vast antres."

"Antres vast" occurs in tandem with a second and equally remarkable noun-
adjective combination: "deserts idle." Othello reports that before he came to
Venice, he had not only traversed "rough quarries, rocks, and hills whose
heads touch heaven" but had also dwelt among "antres vast and deserts
idle." Strictly speaking, deserts cannot be "idle," but they can be vacant
or useless. "Deserts idle" reinforces and augments "antres vast." Taken
together, the two phrases are infinitely more evocative than either alone.

As a structure of sound, "antres vast and deserts idle" pivots on the "d"
of "and" and the "d" of "deserts" and it positions "antres" and "idle"
in symmetrical opposition. The two key words are dissimilar yet cleverly
interlinked, each comprised of an open vowel (Antres, Idle), a dental (anTres,
iDle), and a liquid (antRes, idLe). It is not by accident that "antres vast
and deserts idle" is such a euphonious and mouth-filling phrase.

Shakespeare not only invented "antres" for Othello's oration but also took
care to surround it with other linguistic novelties. For example: Othello
claims to have encountered "cannibals that each other eat/ The anthropophagi."
"Cannibal" is now a commonplace noun, but in 1604 it was a newcomer to the
language. "Cannibal" derives from "Carib," the name of a recently-encountered
people-- reputed to be man-eaters --who gave their appellation to the sea in
which they lived. "Cannibal" was sufficiently strange--it had only made harbor
in England (arriving by way of Spain) in the 1550s--that Shakespeare felt a
need to define it, which he did once in English ("that each other eat") and
once in Greek ("anthropophagi"). "Anthropophagi," a word that had originated
with Herodotus, was as new to English--and as seldom employed--as "cannibal."

"Antres vast," "deserts idle," "cannibals" and "anthropophagi" play crucial
parts in Othello's stirring autobiographical fragment.

I spake of most disastrous chances,

Of moving accidents by flood and field,

Of hair-breadth scapes i'th'imminent deadly breach,

Of being taken by the insolent foe

And sold to slavery;  of my redemption thence,

And portance in my travel's history:

Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle,

Rough quarries, rocks, and hills whose heads touch heaven,

It was my hint to speak -- such was the process.

And of the cannibals that each other eat,

The anthropophagi, and men whose heads

Do grow beneath their shoulders.

It's an astonishing story, each element more incredible than the one that
precedes it. Hair-breadth escapes?  Every hero can boast of them. Redemption
from slavery? A bit less likely. Hills whose heads touch heaven? A pardonable
hyperbole. Cannibals?  Surely, less believable still. The Othello landscape
then crosses the border from exotic to fabulous when it adduces "men whose
heads/ Do grow beneath their shoulders." These headless men are the
blemmyae -- Nubian or sometimes Ethiopian -- who were a feature of 
pseudo-anthropological folklore from Pliny to Sir Walter Raleigh. The skepticism
that these monstrous creatures ought to provoke is diluted because the road to
the blemmyes passes through "antres vast and deserts idle." If audiences
had not been lulled and seduced by "antres," they might dismiss Othello as a
mere braggart soldier-- rather than admire him for the near-magician that he
becomes in his self- dramatization.

Shakespeare had yet another purpose for "antres vast." In the sentence that
treads on the heels of the "men whose heads/ Do grow beneath their shoulders,"
Othello abruptly turned his attention to Desdemona. His language dulls. "This
(i.e. his exotic narrative) to hear would Desdemona seriously incline,/ But
still the house affairs would draw her hence." Shakespeare strategically
contrasts Othello's vocabulary to Desdemona's when he juxtaposes "antres
vast" to "house affairs." Only the tinnest of ears can fail to be struck
by the difference between the two phrases. Antres vast--house affairs; house
affairs-- antres vast. The gap between these two most pregnant phrases is small
enough to allow the electric impulses of sex and romance to spark, but is too
wide to allow genuine understanding or empathy to shoot the gap. The tragedy
of Desdemona and Othello arises out of the unbridgeable space between "antres
vast" and "house affairs."

Shakespeare therefore knew exactly what he was about when he invented the word
"antres."

If he had been in a more antic mood, less determined
to characterize Othello's massive dignity, he might have coined a word from
another Latin word for cave, e.g. spelunca.  But "spelunkies vast" --
or even "spelunkies splendid" -- could not possibly do the work of "antres
vast."

Title: The Cheese Stands Alone
Date: November 13, 2017

Certainly in the 1940s and perhaps in later decades, first-graders all over
America were taught an "activity" based on a song called "The Farmer in the
Dell." Older readers of this blague, if they are courageous enough to delve into
long-forgotten and repressed pockets of the past, might dare to summon up the
memory.

Here's the game:  Ten young waifs, divided equally by gender, formed a circle
holding hands around the Chosen One who was designated the "farmer." The gamins
(and gamines) sang the following song:

The farmer in the dell,

The farmer in the dell.

Heigh-ho the derry-o,

The farmer in the dell.

While they sang, the "farmer" walked around the inside of the circle and chose
a partner from the circle of children. Then the tune was repeated with the key
word altered:

The farmer takes a wife,

The farmer takes a wife,

Heigh-ho the derry-o

The farmer takes a wife.

The "wife" then joined him inside the circle, and the plot thickened. Now they
sang:

"The wife takes a child,

The wife takes a child;

Heigh-ho the derry-o

The wife takes a child."

And so on down and down the great chain of being.

"The child takes a nurse...

"The nurse takes a cow...

"The cow takes a dog...

"The dog takes a cat...

"The cat takes a mouse..."

And finally, when all the players have been chosen but one, the game ended on
the following exclusionary note:

"The cheese stands alone.

The cheese stands alone.

Heigh-ho the derry-o,

The cheese stands alone."

What was the point of this weird game? Why was it included in the
"curriculum?"  Even seventy years later, it seems to be not fun but gratuitous
cruelty. The most popular, the handsomest boy picks the most alluring young
lady, and then choices are made in order of status. The game seems to have been
devised to reinforce a hierarchical social structure. It was unAmerican, neither
democratic or egalitarian. In retrospect, the game was triumphalist with regard
to the farmer and his wife and harsh as all get out to the mouse and the cheese.
If literary critics were to get their hands on this verse, they would be forced
to notice the tragic pattern -- marriage at the outset followed by inevitable
decline into isolation and soul-death.

Needless to say, I myself identify not with the prosperous farmer and his
vivacious wife, but with the lumpish cheese. Velveeta it probably was, a big
shapeless orange block of it, because no fancy aristocratic European cheeses
were known to those of us who grew up in the 1940s PS 217 schoolyard. A sad
cheese, inanimate, excluded from society, unchosen, least loved. Does the entire
history of poetry offer a more mournful note than "the cheese stands alone?"
Poor poor pitiful solitary neglected cheese.

In recompense (it's too late for an apology) let us remember, three quarters of
a century later, that cheeses have feelings too.

And for the curious, a "dell" is "a small valley in a forest, tucked away from
the rest of civilization." At the corner of Newkirk and Coney Island Avenue,
where PS 217 was to be found, there were, trust me, no wooded dells. Concrete
sidewalks, chain-link fences, yes. Dells no. Delis, but no dells.

Title: A New Fear
Date: November 16, 2017

When I was a exceedingly young fellow (teens and twenties), I suffered from a
great fear of death. It was not obsessive or constant, but enough to keep me
lying awake at night, sometimes in a sweaty panic. It was not a fear of death
itself, nor a concern about anguish in an afterlife -- hell a story which I
always regarded as a pathetic fiction and fraud. No, my fear was that I would
miss out on things. Children, grandchildren, springtimes, love, baseball,
mountains, travel, books, knowledge, corn and hamburgers in August, the works.
I wanted to live to an old age for the experiences. I well remember that in the
1960s, when I was barely out of adolescence, I would project myself forward to
the distant future, as far as to the year 2000, the new millennium. I remember
thinking, if I can just make it to 2000, when I'll be sixty-one, I'll have lived
a full life. I'll be ready to go.

Well, 2000 has long ago come and gone, and here I am, pushing eighty, and in
excellent, almost miraculous health. Such good health, in fact, that on good
days I climb our neighboring foothills like a gazelle. (On bad days, even
walking downhill seems as though I'm slogging through a swamp of mucilage, but
that's another matter.)

I no longer fear death. No matter what else happens to me, I'm not going to die
young, with my promises, such as they were, unfulfilled.

But the fear of dying young has been superseded by a new fear -- the fear of
living too long. When did the transition occur?

I don't want to outlive my time. I don't want to outlive my friends, my family,
my health. I'm already the senior member, the patriarch, of my extended
family -- not just the direct line from my grandparents, but of the extended
cousinhood. In my family, there are no elders and only a couple of near-coevals.
I don't want to become an isolate. Even more so, I don't want to lose my
mobility or my mind. I don't want to find myself in a nursing home, pee on my
pants, bedridden, "locked-in". And I'm going to do everything I can to avoid
allowing myself to get into that situation. I've seen people in that trap at
close hand too many times -- and it ain't pretty.

Meanwhile, I'm enjoying the perspective of the moment. I'm glad that I managed
to get to this point. From where I stand, I can remember my grandparents and
I know my grandchildren. I'm at the midpoint, the apex, of five generations.
I marvel at the changes -- recall, will you, that my grandfather was born in
darkest Ukraine in 1863, my youngest grandchildren were born in hi-tech Boulder,
Colorado in 2013. Need I say more?

Title: Shakespeare Gets Going
Date: November 21, 2017

Setting aside the suspicion that The First Part of Henry the Sixth is a
collaborative work or perhaps even a "prequel" to Parts Two and Three, the
play can be read as if its first few lines were the earliest example of
Shakespeare's playwriting. If so, then, what can be learned, right there at
the very beginning, by looking closely at Act one, scene one, line one?

Here's the first considerable speech in the play -- just about the very
moment, let us imagine, in which Mr. W. S.'s "rough and all-unable" goose quill
touched paper. Thirty-seven or thirty-eight astonishing plays lie in the
future.

The adventure begins as Gloucester eulogizes the recently-deceased
Henry V. The speech is not brilliant, not accomplished; in fact, it's just
plain vanilla ordinary. But it's a seed, a kernel.

Gloucester:   England ne'er had a king until his time.

Virtue he had, deserving to command:

His brandish'd sword did blind men with his beams:

His arms spread wider that a dragon's wings;

His sparking eyes, replete with wrathful fire

More dazzled and drove back his enemies

Than mid-day sun fierce bent against their faces.

What should I say?  his deeds exceed all speech:

He ne'er lift up his hand but conquered.

A reader or playgoer would have to be superbly insightful to predict that this
Shakespeare would become the Shakespeare. This opening speech is a a mighty
flat piece of rhetoric.

It's formulaic  -- simply a litany or list. First comes an item, a
noun (virtue, sword, arms, eyes, deeds) which is then amplified by a
hyperbolic qualifier (beams, wings, fire, sun). It's open-ended; it could
go on indefinitely. But because it's so much a formula, there's no
surprise--there's no mystery or excitement about where Gloucester is heading.

Moreover, for each element in the list, there's a congruence between the
unit of thought and the unit of verse. The sentiment of each of the first
four items on the list is exactly contained in a five-beat, ten-syllable line
of verse--a pedestrian procedure which Shakespeare would soon transcend. And
finally, there's an excess of old-fashioned, traditional alliteration: "His
Brandish'd sward did Blind me with his Beams" "affects the letter" and browbeats
the brain with the letter B. It goes almost without saying that there's nothing
in this speech that is particular (Elizabethans would say peculiar) to either
Gloucester or Henry. This is Anyduke reciting sentences about Anyking.

But then something truly amazing occurs.  Although it looks as
though Gloucester is gathering his strength and his breath for a speech that
might go on for forty lines and which would celebrate many more of the late
kings's amazing attributes, he suddenly changes plans and truncates his
intention:  "What should I say?  his deeds exceed all speech."

Gloucester seems to have run out of rhetorical gas. He is frustrated because he
simply doesn't have the words. He throws in the rhetorical towel, so to speak.
He surrenders. And he's right to do so, because at this early moment neither he
nor Shakespeare has the power to generate a language that is equal to Henry's
deeds. Better to stop speaking if you are utterly unable to say what you want to
say.

Yet what is the task of such a playwright as Shakespeare?

It is not to do exactly what Gloucester admits that he cannot do? -- to find the
words that are commensurate with the deed -- as Shakespeare certainly will when
he returns to Henry in the 1598 play which concludes and climaxes this sequence
of eight history plays. In a decade, Shakespeare will move from the pathos of
"What shall I say?" to a rich eloquence that is up to the task.

"What shall I say?" is therefore an important question -- the most important
question of all, in fact -- and the playwright asks it right here at the
outset. Readers can watch and learn as Shakespeare little by little, in play
after play, gradually invents a rhetorical style in which speech not only
equals but eventually comes to exceed all deeds.

Title: "Hurrah for the Pumpkin Pie"
Date: November 29, 2017

Another Thanksgiving come and gone, and here am I in a nostalgic mood, harking
back to those songs that we sang in the PS 217 "assembly" in the 40s and 50s
of the last millennium. With Miss Georgia Keiselbach at the piano, we marched,
in size places, decorated in white shirts and green ties, into the school
auditorium and warbled our dear little hearts out every Thursday at 10:00 am.

I remember very well the stirring but perplexing Thanksgiving hymn that began

We gather together to ask the Lord’s blessing;He chastens and hastens His will
to make known.The wicked oppressing now cease from distressing.Sing praises to
His Name; He forgets not His own.

Looking backward, I admit that I understood the first line of the stanza but was
pretty much boggled by what came next. "Chasten" and "hasten" make a wonderful
internal rhyme, but who does He hasten and how exactly does He chasten? 
A syntactical mystery for sure. Were we expected to believe that the Great
Signifier in the Sky "chastens and hastens" His own will?  Why in the world
should he be asked to do so?

Nor did I grasp the meaning of third line, because I didn't recognize that "the
wicked oppressing" meant "the oppressing wicked" or more precisely "the wicked
who are oppressing someone." But who were they "oppressing"? Apparently, the
"distressing", that is, the people who are distressed. And who, to be more
specific, were the innocent distressed who were being oppressed. Us?  Our
teachers? Let me now confess that I sang then and remember at this moment the
line as "now cease us from distressing", thinking that we, the pupils, must
have been the "wicked" and that it was our now enlightened task to cease from
oppressing the distressed. I read the line as a provocation to guilt, even
though I knew that I myself, third-grader, had never oppressed anyone.

Nor was I the only confused 10-year-old, because BB, my PS 217 classmate and
consultant on our assemblies, remembered the line as "The wicked oppressing now
seize us from distressing" -- a sentence which is way beyond my parsing skills.

Of the last line of the quatrain, I grasped "Sing praises to his name" but "He
forgets not His own" opened another can of confused worms. I construed "His own"
to be shorthand for "his own name." But what kind of Lord forgets his own name?
 As BB, equally misled, says, 'it's god, just three letters; how hard is that?"

The hymn goes on for another four puzzling stanzas, though to tell truth, I
don't remember whether they were required of us PS 217 choristers. I for one am
retrospectively pleased that we omitted the stanza that included the lines "We
praise thee, O God, our Redeemer, Creator,/ In grateful devotion our tribute we
bring" which surely seemed even then a trifle too theological.

Despite the fact that I was mostly clueless, I rather enjoyed belting out the
hymn's anapests. It's a joyous, rollicking piece of music. Whether it was
appropriate for a public school in the heart of immigrant Brooklyn is another
question. But hey, it was the 50s, before we all became so multicultural.

Nevertheless, out of spirit of curiosity, and because it's now so easy even for
us lazybones to investigate such questions, I turned once again to wikipedia and
typed in "We gather together." Warning: surprise in store.

It's a Christian hymn (of course) written in 1597 by one Adrianus Valerius to
celebrate the victory in the Battle of Turnhout, a turning point in the Dutch
Protestant war of liberation against Spanish Catholic domination. It first
appeared in print in a 1626 collection of Dutch folk and patriotic songs but
didn't find its way to the New World until 1903 and became popular only in
1935 when it was included in the "national hymnal of the Methodist-Episcopal
Church." During World War II, which was entering its last phase when I was
a kindergartner in PS 217, the hymn became popular because "'the wicked
oppressing' was understood to refer to Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan." Which
is, I suppose, how an anti-Catholic Protestant hymn came to be included in our
curriculum. After all, it was out of such strange and unpredictable meldings and
divagations that Brooklyn/American culture was formed.

"We gather together" was not our only Thanksgiving song. We also sang th       e
entirely unobjectionabl                                                        e

Over the river, and through the wood,

To Grandmother's house we go;

The horse knows the way to carry the sleigh

Through the white and drifted snow - oh.

I found this song lovely but otherworldly, because my own particular grandmother
lived not over the river but in a tiny third-floor walk-up on distinctly
unpastoral Coney Island Avenue, where there was an occasional tired horse,
pulling a vegetable wagon, but there were few sleighs.

But as it turns out, "Over the river" too has a history.

That's a portrait of its author, Lydia Maria Child. She looks rather forbidding,
as though she might have taught sixth grade at PS 217, but on further
investigation she turns out to have been a radical and revolutionary woman to
whose accomplishments I wish we had been introduced. Born in 1802, she started
her writing career with the novel Hobomok which depicts and approves of the
marriage of an Indian man and a white woman. It caused a small scandal. In 1833,
she published An Appeal in Favor of that Class of Americans Called Africans
which proposed the immediate emancipation of slaves, arguing that slavery was
as harmful to slave-owners as to the enslaved. It was the first anti-slavery
book printed in America. Ms. Child was also an early advocate of women's rights
and spoke favorably of sexual passion. Of course she was ostracized from polite
society. In 1844, she published the small innocuous poem for which she is
remembered, which concludes "Hurrah for the fun! Is the pudding done?/Hurrah for
the pumpkin pie!" -- a sentiment to which there can be no possible objection or
dissent.

Title: Why I Am So Damned Pissed at Charles Grassley
Date: December 07, 2017

Inasmuch "on horror's head horrors accumulate" every single Trump day, I
wonder why an atrocity out of the mouth of Senator Charles Grassley (of once
progressive Iowa) pisses me off to the top of my bent. Over the top, actually,
even though he's probably no worse than the others.

In an aha!! moment with the Des Moines Register, Senator Grassley defended his
vote against the inheritance tax thusly: "I think not having the estate tax
recognizes the people that are investing as opposed to those that are just
spending every darn penny they have, whether it's on booze or women or movies."
 His very words. Out of his own ignorant head.

Why am I so enraged? Let us count the ways.

First, it goes without saying that Grassley doesn't know that most ordinary
citizens have a hard time making ends meet. That they raid the kids' piggy-bank
at the end of every month. That they regularly postpone filling that
prescription or repairing the car until next month's paycheck arrives. That they
can't invest in stocks because they're busy "investing" in bananas and oatmeal
and potatoes, not because they're frittering their money away on playthings.
Grassley is completely out of touch with reality -- with the way real people
live.

But it's worse than that. It's not only that he's unconnected to his
constituents  --  he oozes contempt for them (and therefore for me). Wasting
their money on movies, the poor ignorant slobs. If they had self-control and
brains of Chuck Grassley quality, why they'd go out and buy a couple of hundred
shares of a good growth stock and contribute to the American economy. He's worse
than Marie Antoinette, who, bad as she was, never said, "let them buy stocks."

And therefore it follows in the universe of Grassley values that the tax system
should penalize the improvident and reward the rich. (Which it already does in
myriad ways, most obviously by taxing unearned income -- e.g. capital growth --
at half the rate of sweat labor).

And in Chuck Grassley's view, to reward the rich and penalize the poor is the
higher morality -- because  the rich will invest and the poor will do nothing
but spend every darn penny.  To those who have much shall be given, even if
they don't need or want it.

And while I'm stoking my indignation, let me add that I'm offended by the
Chuckster's sanctimonious "darn" -- he can thieve from the working class but
he's too prissy to swear while doing so. And I'm also just slightly off my gourd
that he includes "women" among the vices of regular Iowans -- as though (if I
understand his point) all money is earned and spent by "men." I think that the
dumb Chuck slipped -- let down his guard for a second -- and revealed that in
his heart he doesn't acknowledge that women are wage-earners nor that they are
wage-earners who vote.

And I am also pissed because the whole argument against the estate tax is
fraudulent. The case for repeal has nothing to do with small farmers or small
businessmen. It already excludes the first $11,000,000 of estates and therefore
affects only a very small number of multimillionaires and billionaires who can
well afford to contribute a bit to the general welfare. The sole purpose, and
the intended effect of the repeal, is to satisfy the greed of a handful or
plutocrats who want to pass their wealth to their heirs and therefore maintain a
perpetual class of wealthy aristocrats. Just like France before the revolution,
when the titled were exempted from taxation. Chuck -- do  your realize that
your sentiments are profoundly unAmerican.

So let me say to Senator Charles Grassley, with respect for the high office that
you hold and with as much love as I can muster, Chuck, you are a moron, and you
can take your insulting opinions, roll them up, and stick them where the sun
don't shine.

Title: Notes on "Mucilage."
Date: December 11, 2017

“Mucilage” is a word whose sound is wildly inappropriate to its meaning.
In the world of adhesive nomenclature, “paste” is good and “glue” is
even better. Trisyllabic mucilage ought to denote something far more serious --
perhaps a problem involving waste disposal ("OK, we've rescued the elephants,
but what are we going to do with all that mucilage.")

In my life, mucilage made its mark long before glue arrived on the scene. In
Brooklyn (and perhaps elsewhere) 1940s schoolchildren were issued small curvy
bottles of the yellow stuff, each fitted with a red-rubber tip which was slit
so that a drop or two of mucilage could be emitted when the bottle was pressed
to the surface of your construction-paper or doily project. Actually, the slit
regularly became caked and occluded and the hardened mucilage had to be scraped
off with your fingernails. It was a lot like nose-picking.

LePage’s Mucilage, I believe it was called. We said Page as "page" but
surely LePage's Mucilage if pronounced Frenchly (le pahje) would be far more
euphonious. Some claim that if you were building a model airplane, you would
use mucilage on your fuselage, but I believe such an assertion to be the kind of
persiflage at which I take umbrage.

And yes, the word is a descendant and cousin of Latin mucus, meaning mucus.

Unbeknownst to 1940s me, mucilage has a life outside the bottle. It is a
glycoprotein and exopolysaccharide found in most plants where it helps to store
water and thicken membranes. I have now learned that the sticky stuff on the
leaf tips of the insect-catching sundews that live at the edge of our pond is a
form of mucilage.

I would be curious to know from what plants William Nelson LePage distilled the
vast vats of mucilage that were diluted and parceled out to schoolchildren,
who then spent the hour after "Arts and Crafts" removing nasty mucilage scale
from their fingers. But I do now know why schools loved the stuff  -- because
vegetable mucilage is, if not exactly edible, not poisonous either. No hoofs
were harmed during its production.

Once having established the mucilage monopoly, Mr. LePage must have brought
home zillions. And if his descendants were as sticky-fingered as I suspect
they must have been, they will be enjoying the profits on their yachts or in
their Manhattan penthouses to this day while we 1940s pupils are left with only
memory-traces of mucilage's peculiar feel and odor.

Other words of my life:

slouch,

cishet,

yips

ramps

jot and tittle

Title: Lady on a Train (1945)
Date: December 12, 2017

When you start to watch a 1945 black-and-white movie called Lady on a Train you
have certain expectations, especially when you're told in advance that it's
about a woman who sees a murder take place from a train window. And when the
movie features such noir stalwarts as Dan Duryea and Ralph Bellamy. And
especially when the title of the movie evokes The Lady Vanishes and Lady in the
Lake and Strangers on a Train. But Lady on a Train is not what you might think
it's going to be; in fact, it's a film that never has a clue about what it is or
wants to be. It's an unsatisfying hodgepodge.

There are some films that are so bad that they become fascinating for sheer
awfulness. Lady on a Train is that kind of awful. It starts out noir-y and
offers, intermittently, fistfights and mistaken identities and shadows, lots of
shadows, and enough red herrings to feed cast and crew for the entire time the
film was in production. But it also takes a shot at comedy -- not sophisticated
banter but broad farce: in one scene, trying to hide herself from a hired
gunsel, the heroine disguises herself as a chair and moves around from place
to place just as she would in an Abbott and Costello vehicle. And then, if
farce/noir weren't enough of a burden, at three separate times during the
events, with the least possible justification, Deanna Durbin, playing at being a
detective, breaks into song, but only because she's Deanna Durbin, not because
the film requires her to do so. So it's a noir-farce-sentimental musical. It
just don't work, except for connoisseurs of badness.

Plus it features two of the ugliest hats ever to come out of the Hollywood
chapeau-shop:

After making this film (and another clunker) Deanna Durbin left Hollywood, where
she had been the highest paid woman in America, married and moved to France,
never appeared on stage or on film again -- and reassumed her birthname, Edna
Mae Durbin. It's a decision one can respect.

Title: Written For the Great-Great-Grandchildren of Solomon Goss (1878-1972)

Dear Talia, Oliver, Ella, Lola, Luke, Caleb, Asher:

Althea's grandfather, Solomon Goss (born Guza), who contributed 1/16 of your
genetic inheritance, fled Poland after the worker's rebellion in Lodz in 1905,
walked across Europe to Rotterdam where he boarded a ship and traveled steerage-
class to Philadelphia. He had been a silk weaver in the old country and was able
to find similar work here. In two years he saved enough money to pay for second-
class passage (not the dreaded steerage) for his young bride Miriam Halpern.

Solomon Goss played his part in the wave of political and social unrest that
rocked the Russian Empire in the first years of the twentieth century --
uprisings that preceded and anticipated the 1917 Russian Revolution. The
resistance had at its root the exploitation of workers especially in rapidly
industrializing cities like Lodz (which had grown six-fold in a generation), in
the state policy of enforced Russification, in czarist tyranny both cruel and
arbitrary, and in heady intellectual and Marxist ferment both in universities
and in informal worker self-education projects. The workers' strikes and revolts
in Lodz (the city, though Polish, was then incorporated into the Empire) were
part of that great historical process. The Lodz Insurrection, also called the
June Days, was one of the largest of these local rebellions. Following months
of unrest and strikes, repressed by Russian police and soldiers, enraged
workers began building barricades and assaulting police and military patrols.
Additional troops, including the hated Cossacks, were called in. By June 23, the
city and commerce was immobilized. Martial law was declared. But rocks proved
futile against bullets and horses. By June 25, the uprising was crushed. It was
officially reported that several hundred workers were killed but modern scholars
estimate that between 1000 and 2000 died and many more were injured. There were
arrests and imprisonments and executions. In this atmosphere Solomon Goss, who
had manned the barricades, wisely decided that his time in Lodz had come to an
end.

I do not know how he was able to walk to the Netherlands and shipboard. A
secular non-believer, he would not have been welcomed at local synagogues. Were
there way-stations manned by sympathetic socialists?  How did he eat?  Where
did he sleep? He never talked about his trek and if anyone ever asked him, they
did not pass the information along to me.

When he came to America he found work in the silk mills in and around Paterson,
New Jersey, which was then known as the "Silk City." Weavers were skilled
workers. Most were immigrants from traditional silk-weaving areas in England,
Germany, and Italy but there was also a considerable influx from Lodz itself.
The working day was ten hours long with a half day on Saturday and the new
fifty-five hour week was considered a victory for the workers. Between 1881 and
1900 there were nearly 140 strikes. By the first decade of the 20th century,
practically every mill had one or more labor organizations.

Solomon Goss told me that when he would take a job in a mill, he would
immediately set out to organize and radicalize his comrades. As a result, he
said, he was frequently fired. But he was, he claimed, a very skilled worker,
able to operate four looms at once (he looked down on American-trained workers
whom he thought of as inferior and whom he derided as "Columbus weavers)."

By 1913, close to 5,000 Jewish men and women worked in the Paterson silk
factories. It was in Paterson that Solomon Goss must have participated in one
of the crucial events in American labor history, the Paterson silk strike. In
February. nearly 300 mills and dye houses were closed, as 24,000 men, women,
and children joined in an industry-wide strike. The strikers' demands were
radical. They wanted an eight-hour day as well as increases in wages. Workers
agreed that no one would return to work until all of the owners accepted their
terms. Picket lines kept "scabs" and strike breakers out of the mills. More than
2,000 workers allowed themselves to be arrested, flooding the jails. But mill
owners held firm and refused to meet with the workers. By the end of May, the
workers' solidarity cracked. English-speaking and better paid workers voted to
accept settlements with individual mill owners. At the same time workers started
to cross the picket lines. In July the central strike committee voted to endorse
shop-by-shop settlements. The Paterson silk strike collapsed and owners conceded
nothing. "Your power is in your folded arms," IWW leader "Big Bill" Haywood had
said. But the mill owners, with greater resources, outlasted the hungry workers.

I do not know how Solomon Goss responded to this second crushing defeat nor
when he abandoned the silk trade. But in the 1940s, when Althea first knew
him, he operated a "candy store" in Clifton Heights, New Jersey. When I met
him in the late 50s, he had long ago sold the store and moved with Miriam to a
tiny apartment in Utica, New York, where his son Dan and wife "Grandma Anne"
(your great-grandma) lived. The man who had once been a proud unionist and
socialist and who considered himself a follower of Daniel de Leon, founder of
the Socialist Worker's Party, had drifted into conservatism, even voting for
Richard Nixon in 1972. Defeat and poverty and deracination had not ennobled
him. On the contrary, he was to my eyes a mean old man, given to gratuitously
cruel and cutting remarks. His default stance toward me and toward the world was
scorn. Miriam died in the late 60s; Solomon, having alienated his friends and
relations, lived out his widowhood in a single room in a hotel in Rockaway and
ultimately in the Hebrew Home for the Aged at Riverdale, where, a secularist to
the end, he complained to Althea and to me about the intermittently broadcast
Hebrew prayers.

I find it almost impossible to reconcile the two sides of the man: the sour,
sad, nasty old reactionary that he became and the heroic youthful fighter for
social justice who fought the Cossacks, walked seven hundred miles from Lodz to
Rotterdam and, I like to imagine, welcomed his beloved, radiant bride at the New
York dock with tears in his eyes.

Title: An Enigmatic Nighttime Experience
Date: December 26, 2017

The person with whom I share a bed reported that last night, following some
incomprehensible mutterings, I sleep talked, clear as a bell, the sentence
fragment "four ones, which I interpret as eleven hundred and eleven."

I have absolutely no remembrance of saying these words, nor of any dream that
might provide them with a context.

Some observations:

a) I'm mighty proud of myself for having a dream that was so literate.  I mean,
"interpret."  Not your run-of-the-mill sleep vocabulary.

b) What could "four ones" refer to?  Four aces?  Some sort of runic          ?
inscription  Score keeping                                                    ?

c)  What about eleven hundred and eleven?  A late antiquity or early medieval
date?  A quantity, but of what?

d)  Why did some part of my brain feel obliged to "interpret" the phrase "four
ones?" Did my right brain think that my left brain was communicating in code?

Altogether inexplicable. But fascinating. The brain seems to have  a mind of
its own.

Title: More Genealogy Written for my Grandchildren
Date: January 02, 2018

Dear grandchildren:

I once asked my father, your great-grandfather Emanuel Pearlman, where in the
Ukraine we originated. He said that he was told that it was a village called
(and here he used a very deep guttural initial consonant) Xhosantin-gebernya
 -- an answer that left me not much enlightened. If he knew more -- and I don't
think he did -- he didn't say. Our family did not cultivate nostalgia for the
old country. Nor much curiosity either. We had no reason to yearn.

But new information about our past has recently come to me. According to a
correspondence between my late cousin Marion and a distant Israeli relative,
it is now clear that our family hails from the the town of StaryConstantine --
also called Starokostiantiyniv in Ukrainian and Alt Konstantine in Yiddish.
It was a small city of perhaps 30,000 people at its height, founded, as far
as wikipedia and I can figure, in the sixteenth century by a noble or wealthy
person named Konstanty Ostrogski who built himself a castle sometime during the
1560s. Castles are built for protection in lawless places, but then, most places
were lawless in late medieval Europe. Old Constantine is in northern Ukraine
at the junction of the Ikopot and Sluch rivers. Here's a picture of the Old
Constantine castle across from the Sluch:

But when, you ask, did your and my ancestors settle in Old Constantine?  I
remember it mentioned when I was a child that our family came to the Ukraine
from "the west", which I assumed to be Germany because my grandmother Eta's
maiden name was Hessel (though in fact Hessel is more commonly Danish rather
than German). The Jewish community in Old Constantine dates to the sixteenth
century, it is reported. "The town’s Jews suffered Cossack onslaughts during
the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. At the end of the nineteenth century,
more than half of the town’s population was Jewish." That's all we know.

However, in the nineteenth century, there lived in Old Constantine a husband and
wife named Yaakov and Menucha Sheindl Perelman. They dwelt in a house on the
corner of Ragnedinshkaya and Bolshaya Vasikovshaya streets (a house which was
destroyed during the second world war). Yaakov Mikolshtein Perelman was born
about 1830, lived a long life, and died in about 1920. According to the story,
he resided in the one house his entire life. His wife, Menucha Sheindl came
from Radomyshyl, a village not far from Old Constantine that was historically
a center of Jewish settlement. (In 1797 a total of 1,424 people or 80% of the
total population were Jewish). Menucha Sheindl Perelman was the daughter of a
sugar and wool merchant named Solomon Rabinovich, who was so rich that "they
changed houses for Passover" -- which is a custom heretofore unknown to me.
Menucha died in 1908 at age 75 or thereabouts. The family, once wealthy, lost
everything in the 1917 revolution and the disorder and purges that followed.

And how are Yaakov and Menucha related to you, my grandchildren?  Well,
they're your great-great-great grandparents. According to the newly discovered
information, they had eighteen children "mostly twins," of whom only nine
survived to adulthood. Seven daughters were born before your great-great
grandfather Isaiah (also called Buzya or Buzzy) saw the light. Isaiah it is
reported, was born "the year the serfs were freed," which is 1861, but I know
that he was 83 when he died in 1946, so I calculate that he was born in 1863.
But perhaps Isaiah didn't know his own age which wouldn't have been unusual
in an era of bad record keeping. When he was thirty-five, Isaiah emigrated to
America, arriving in 1896 or thereabouts.

Why did he set out for the New World?  Certainly the troubled conditions in Old
Constantine were reason enough. But there's also something of a story. Isaiah
married (I don't know whom) but after one night of marriage he asked for a
divorce. I don't know if the divorce was granted, but I do know that very soon
afterward he left town with Eta (or Yetta) Hessel, also from Old Constantine.
She was 23 or 24, a decade or a dozen years younger than he.

Why the one-day marriage?  No one knows what happened that night, but it
couldn't have been good. A sexual impediment?  An arranged marriage gone bad?
 Prior misdeeds come to light?  The discovery of pregnancy?  We're free to
speculate, but never to know.

However, we do know that Isaiah and his father did not see the world with
the same eyes. Yaakov was religious; his son Isaiah was an atheist. We don't
know Yaakov's politics, but we know that Isaiah was some sort of leftist or
communist. Something of a free-thinker, after the style of Moses Mendelssohn.
And perhaps Karl Marx. And we can also guess that it might have been impossible
to remain in Old Constantine after the marriage contretemps.

In New York City, Isaiah and Yetta had four children: Max, born around 1896,
Solomon, born about 1898; Mollie, born in 1900; and my father Emanuel, the
youngest, born on December 22, 1904.

My grandfather Isaiah also had two younger brothers. There was Chaim, who
followed him to America some years later and from whose daughter Rose spring the
Goldberg and Chodosh lines. And also Isaiah's youngest brother, who was named
Meshulam Zusi Perelman. He did not follow his older brothers, and I don't know
his history, but his family left the Ukraine and it's his Israeli granddaughter
Nechama Sheindl Brukman (born Perlman) through whom these facts were recovered.
Nechama Brukman died in 2008 at age 86.

It is most melancholy to read that in 1939 there were 6,743 Jews living in Old
Constantine, accounting for 31 percent of the total population, and that the
entire Jewish community, some no doubt our cousins, were murdered during the
first years of the war.

Title: Geological Words New to Me
Date: January 03, 2018

Unlike most sciences, where there are numerous pseudo-Greek or pseudo-Latin
coinages, geology offers all sorts picturesque and lovely words that have
been in the language for years  -- and are novel to me. So "graywacke" --a
muddy sandstone containing particles of quartz"; "fumarole" -- a small vent
emitting jets of steam; "sinter"  -- a crust of calcium carbonate; "molfette"
-- a vent emitting gases such as carbon dioxide; "coquina" -- a cemented mass
of debris of shells; "clint" -- a sharp ridge; "grike" -- a fissure or crack
opened by dissolving limestone; "knickpoint" -- a sharp step, up or down, in
a river; "gour" -- a calcite ridge formed when water rich in carbonate flows
over an irregular surface; "drumlin" -- an isolated mountain; "nunatak" -- a
projecting peak in land otherwise covered by ice;  "firn"-- a mass of ice
pellets compacted by the weight of snow above;  "cwm" -- a steep rock basin;
 "col" -- a narrow pass; "esker" -- a winding ridge formed by retreating
glaciers; "pingo" -- a cone, dome  or hump caused when freezing water expands
beneath the permafrost and pushes up the earth; "yardang" -- parallel ridges of
hard rock.

I'm not convinced that I could recognize any of these phenomena of my own
accord. I'd probably need a professional geologist or guide. But the words
themselves sure are magnificent.  And this is just a small sample of the
wordhoard.

Title: Small Screen Godlessness
Date: January 06, 2018

We binge-watched the seven-hour mini-series Godless in three marathon nights.

Godless is a Western, or more exactly a fantasia on Western-movie themes and
incidents. To the genre-literate, almost every plot element or character will
be familiar, but shootouts and jail breaks and horse-rustling and miraculously
healing bullet wounds were re-combined in ways that kept our attention. I'm
proud to say that I didn't fall asleep once during the three long evenings,
which is quite a compliment to the series, inasmuch as I've recently emerged as
an Olympic-quality narcolept, prone to drift into sleep at the drop of a hat,
even during the second overtime.

The three most interesting features of Godless, were, in my opinion, a) the
landscape, which, although it surrounds us here in Boulder, seemed particularly
crisp on the hi def screen, b) the horses, which are noble beasts of their own
and were respectfully depicted and admired by the cinematographer, and c) the
character of MaryAgnes, played by Merit Wever, who was rather wonderful in the
role and who was rewarded with a lot of the good lines. MaryAgnes is a tough
young rifle-toting crack shot who plays for the other team but who you want on
your side.

I thought that Jeff Daniels who played the ruthless mass-murderer Frank Griffin
overacted like crazy. If overacting were a crime, he'd be looking at a good
twenty years in solitary. Plus I know it's the fashion that your deranged evil
charismatic lunatic villain always has to be a bible thumper yet let's face
it -- that's a cliche that has served its purpose and earned its retirement.
Speaking of religion -- even aside from the title of the series and the
observation that it's a godless country there's a heck of a lot of religion
stuff both good and bad but mostly bad in this series. For example, much of
the backstory evokes the Mountain Meadow Massacre -- one of the most dreadful
acts of domestic terrorism in our nation's history -- which was perpetrated by
Mormons (although Mormon participation is underplayed and instead the atrocity
is attributed to a nonspecific religious fanaticism). There are frequent scenes
of worship and pilgrimage as well as intermittent focus on the new church that
the villagers of LaBelle are constructing and specifically on the fashioning
of a substantial cross that is photographed as though it were brimming with
significance. Moreover, the inhabitants of LaBelle wait six and seven-eighths
episodes for the new preacher to arrive but when he finally appears he has
only the most banal platitudes to deliver. Frankly, I'm not positive whether
the writer of Godless thought the preacher's speech was genuinely profound or
whether he couldn't give him better words, or whether he was trying to assert
that the pieties of faith offered no consolation whatever to the beat-up
townspeople. It would have been better if the preacher had just sung an
appropriate hymn and let the LaBelleians join in so we could at least end with
good music.

Godless offers a number of revisionist moments where tradition is overturned,
sometimes too obviously. An instance: LaBelle is inhabited almost entirely by
women and it is the women who make the decisions and take the active roles; men
are passive bystanders. Quite an inversion of the usual macho practice. And
also: usually in the westerns when there's the threat of intermarriage between
the races, it's the dark skin who gets killed. This time the commonplace was
turned on its head with the gratuitous killing of he white guy -- but I think
it was a bit too pointed to name him "Whitey." And the Indians: now that we
have the word "orientalism" to describe the mythologizing and falsifying of
people of the east, we could apply the word "Indianism" to the romanticizing
of the Paiutes, who are depicted as repositories of supernatural mystery and
tribal wisdom (which is I suppose is a step up from brutal savages, but still
not respectful or true). "Indianism" leads to a grotesque failure in the story
when the sheriff is accompanied by a lone brave on horseback who may or may not
be a ghost and who should have thudded to the cutting-room floor (along with
some faux-spiritual nonsense, totally out of place, about the sheriff losing and
regaining his shadow).

The series centered on the conflict between father and adopted son -- a
borrowing straight out of Red River, but this time around there's not going to
be a reconciliation. The allegorically-named son Roy Goode winds up shooting his
father, up close, pistol to temple. Which I liked a lot, because, first of all,
I was by this time totally inured to violence, and also because the evil addled
father-villain-prophet repeatedly claimed the ability to foresee his own death
and "this isn't it." "You're wrong," says Goode, pulling the trigger. So much
for prophecy. Immediately afterwards, the hero rides alone into the sunset --
not into a metaphorical sunset but a very real and carefully photographed sunset
-- even though if he had his wits about him he would take his more-than-a-match
lady friend with him. It's a unsatisfying conclusion and one that is dictated, I
think, more by the zillion Saturday afternoon Westerns of my childhood than by
the internal logic of the film. She loves him. But Western heroes named Goode
just plain love their horses more than hearth, home and sex and they are all
secretly afraid that if they marry and allow themselves to become domesticated
they'll wind up like poor uxorious powerless Van Heflin in Shane.

Title: Some English Words Incorporated into Contemporary Italian
Date: January 08, 2018

Italian has the ability to swallow English words whole, not even bothering to
Italianize them. Here are a few examples drawn from a 2016 novel by Stefano
Benni.

"Freezer," as in diventa rigido come un peluche lasciato nel freezer."
("It became stiff like a stuffed animal left in the freezer.")  "I
cornflakes," incorporated as a plural noun. "Ha occhiali rossi da rockstar."
 ("He had the red eyeglasses of a rockstar.") "Un overdose."  "La soap opera,"
entering Italian as a feminine singular noun, no doubt because of the "a" ending
of "opera."  "Un popcorn."  "Compriamo un gadget" ("We are buying a gadget.")
"Sembra un clown in pensione." ("He seemed like a retired clown"). Gli zoom
fotografici." "La mia partner."  "Il controllare piu sexy del mondo." ("The
world's sexiest conductor.")  "Ha iniziato con multi okay". ("He started with
many okays.) "Jukebox d'epoca." "Old-fashioned (classic) jukebox."  "La
famiglia era in relax." ("The family was relaxed)."

Title: Another Paragraph Written for my Grandchildren
Date: January 11, 2018

Dear Talia, Oliver, Ella, Lola, Luke, Caleb, Asher:

This is a picture of my father's grandmother (that is, my great-grandmother
and therefore your great-great-great grandmother) whom I can now identify as
Menucha Sheindl Perelman (born Rabinovich) who died in 1908 at the age of 75
or thereabouts. She was born in the shtetl of Radomyshyl and married Yaakov
Perelman of Old Constantine in western Ukraine. Menucha is reported to have had
18 children including many twins. Seven daughters and three sons survived to
adulthood. The four daughters whose names are known were Rochel Lerner, Reizel
Shposhnik, Miriam, and Chaya-Beila, who married Schmul Spector (I remember now
that my father had a cousin named Julian Spector). Her sons were Isaiah or Buzya
my grandfather, then Chaim, and Meshulam.

My father told once told me story that seems incredible. He said that he had a
grandmother in the Ukraine who came from a large family. He said that she had
ten children but that all of them died in a week during a cholera epidemic. Then
they had five more children. Or perhaps there were five children who died in the
epidemic and then they had ten more. Both stories are hard to believe.

What would it be like to lose five or ten children in a week? How could anyone
ever recover from the grief?  How could you live?  It's possible that this
story attaches to Menucha Sheindl Perelman, who lost at least eight children.
But it might also be a Hessel story (i.e. my father's mother's side of the
family, not his father's).

Provenance:  I have no idea how this picture came into my possession. It's a
drawing, not a photograph. A copy of a drawing, to be more precise, not the
original. My father told me that it was done by an itinerant Ukrainian artist
(apparently a pre-photography custom). I wish that I could say more about
Menucha's costume, especially the scarf. Is it traditional garb? Or about her
very dark hair, which might be a sheitel, the wig worn by the orthodox.

Is it possible -- is it truly the case that the woman pictured above bore
eighteen children?  And Inasmuch as your direct ancestor Isaiah was child
number sixteen, if she had said to her husband Yaakov, after birthing number
fifteen, "I'm done, Yaakov, no more children" -- which would have been a
perfectly understandable sentiment -- then it's obvious that none of us would
exist.

Title: Old Age, Poetry, Ulysses
Date: January 15, 2018

It wasn't until I reached college that I discovered poetry. My comic-book,
super-hero and baseball-infused brain was until then, poetry-wise, an almost
complete tabula rasa; I say "almost" because at eight or nine eight years old I
had already memorized two great classics of American literature: "Casey at the
Bat" and also the poem by Grantland Rice about Tinkers, Evers, and Chance. In
addition, I knew the ubiquitous stercoraceous distich the first line of which
is "Here I sit, broken-hearted" and a related gnomic verse that begins, "No
matter how much you wiggle and dance." Then in 1956 I left Flatbush for higher
education and enrolled in a course in English Literature. The rest, as they say,
is history. It was love sonnets and rich luscious liquid poems by Marlowe and
Keats and Hopkins that entranced me. The more intellectual poems were too taxing
for my immature head. Lycidas, which I now can acknowledge to be the finest
poem in the language, was utterly impenetrable for at least a decade, although
I immediately responded to its music: "With nectar pure his oozy locks he
laves."

One of my teachers sagely observed that certain poets and certain poems were
for youth, some for maturity, and some for old age. "You may no longer like
then what you like now." Which has come to pass. As an example of poetry for
the latter years, he adduced Tennyson's "Ulysses." "This poem may not mean much
to you now, but it will some day, if you live long enough." I remember that I
was much taken with the touchstone line "Far on the ringing plains of windy
Troy" but I thought that "Ulysses" was too much about a really old guy trying to
cheer himself up and I did not see it holding a place in any future that I could
envision.

Well, folks, I've now arrived at the so-called golden years, or, more properly,
the endgame, or extra innings (which in some sports is called sudden death)
and guess what?  "Ulysses" has returned, front and center, exactly as was
predicted 50+ years ago. It's right on target.

Tennyson's Ulysses is Homer's adventurer a generation older, kinging it in
Ithaca, but bored, unchallenged, and unstimulated. "It little profits that an
idle king,/ By this still hearth, among these barren crags,/ Matched with an
aged wife, I mete and dole/ Unequal laws unto a savage race,/ That hoard and
sleep, and feed,/ And know not me."

To put it vulgarly, Ulysses plans to bust out of the home for old kings. He's
been a warrior, a hero, and a roving explorer. He "cannot rest from travel." He
needs to search "beyond the utmost bound of human thought." He leaves Penelope,
and he resigns the government of Ithaca to his bureaucratically-minded son
Telemachus. The last lines of the poem, the leave-taking, are most stirring:

Come, my friends

"Tis not too late to seek a newer world.

Push off, and sitting well in order smite

The sounding furrows; for my purpose holds

To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths

Of all the western stars, until I die.

It may be that the gulfs will wash us down:

It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles,

And see the great Achilles, whom we knew.

Though much is taken, much abides,

And though we are not now that strength which in old days

Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are;

One equal temper of heroic hearts

Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will

To strive to seek, to find, and not to yield.

Yes, I know -- the diction is a little antiquated and artificial, the urge to
get away a trifle too vehement. But nevertheless, I'm moved by the resilience,
the perseverance. Though tear-inducing, the poem is anything but lachrymose. And
it's accepting: "that which we are, we are."

It has lately become the fashion to interpret "Ulysses" as a poem about
capitalism and imperialism. In this reading, Ulysses is just another white male,
off to conquer and colonize The Alien Other. Or to see it as a poem about male
privilege: he's a bad husband, abandoning the family. Or to conceive the poem as
a structure of ironies, in which Ulysses doesn't realize that he undermines his
own suppositions. There's a tad of truth in these arguments, as there always is,
because Tennyson was caught up in a Victorian striving that he didn't fully or
consciously assimilate. But frankly, I feel sorry for readers who can't hear the
verve and excitement in Ulysses's expansive view of things.

Moreover, it turns out that Tennyson was absolutely correct to proclaim that
there is a time in life when "not to yield" is an act of daily heroism.

Title: "Wyoming"
Date: January 17, 2018

I am totally in love with a bit of dialogue in Dog Day Afternoon (1975), the
great Sidney Lumet social drama/comedy/crime film.

Sonny's plan to finance his wife Leon 's sex change operation by robbing a bank
has run aground. In exchange for freeing his hostages, Sonny wants a plane
to take him to a foreign country. He asks his not-so-brilliant friend/co-
conspirator Sal to what country he would want to travel. Sal cogitates for a
while, then suggests, "Wyoming."  After a pause, Sonny replies, "Sal, Wyoming's
not a country." The exchange (by John Cazale as Sal and Al Pacino as Sonny) is
delivered magnificently -- Cazale with blank-faced understated sincerity, Pacino
with tempered exasperation.

"Wyoming" was not in the script (nor in the essay from which the script was
drawn) but was improvised by Cazale. A moment of pure genius.

Title: Zeus: the Apology
Date: January 24, 2018

If I've offended anyone, I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to; I have tremendous
respect for pretty and desirable women. 10s, all of them. So let me just start
by saying that many years ago, decades or centuries I can't remember exactly
when, I had a thunderous crush on Io. She claims that she signaled me that she
wasn't interested, but I did not stop. You know, when you're a god, they let you
do it. You can do anything. It was probably a mistake to have turned her into a
heifer but I think she enjoyed it then -- even if she complains about it now.
Same thing with Leda; it's possible that I misinterpreted her but I honestly
thought that her "no" meant "maybe" or "yes," so I turned myself into a swan
and grabbed her by the pussy. Maybe I should have backed off, especially since
she had already spent that same night with her husband Tyndareus, who had, as
everyone knows, very small hands, if you know what I mean. It's good to be a
god. And then there was Semele. I mean, she was one of my very own priestesses,
and I realize now that your own priestesses ought to be off limits. But she
provoked me by bathing nude in the river Asopus. And I happened to be flying by
in the shape of an eagle. What happened, happened. It was definitely wrong of
her to ask to look at me face to face and I regret that I incinerated her, but
it wasn't my fault. Europa was also an error, but she should have known better
than to come near to me when I'm in the shape of a white bull. And the same with
Taygete who came to me as a doe with golden horns. I couldn't stop myself. I've
always had a thing for golden horns, though I think Pindar made a bit too much
of it. And then there was Dia, who happened by, so she says, when I was in the
shape of a stallion. What can you expect of a stallion? Alcmene, that's another
story. She was tall and beautiful, with eyes that reminded me of Aphrodite.
I definitely wanted her. I had to disguise myself as her husband Amphitryon
to make love to her. Maybe it was wrong to do so, but I don't think she ever
figured out what actually happened, which kind of excuses me. And then there was
my adventure with Antiope, where I disguised myself as a satyr; and once you're
a satyr well, you know, a satyr does what a satyr does. To seduce Callisto, I
had to transform myself into Artemis, which sounds a little like girl-on-girl
action, but it really wasn't because it was me. Come to think of it, I can't
remember exactly how we did it. And also: I blame Acrisius for shutting up his
daughter Danae in a bronze tower. I took it as a deliberate provocation. I had
to sneak through an air vent to impregnate Danae in the form of a shower of
golden rain, which, I have to tell you, wasn't entirely satisfying and just a
little bit kinky.

But what can I say?  I don't want to play the victim, because, after all, I am
a god, but I had a hard childhood, what with my father castrating my grandfather
and then me being suckled by the goat Amalthea. You get off to a bad start when
you're suckled by a goat.

were soaked to plump up, then boiled and mashed (but not for me, if I could
possibly avoid them). Potatoes in any form, but usually mashed and buttered.
No chicken or lamb chops, but lots of tongue. (When I left home, I vowed never
to eat tongue again, and, trust me, I've kept the faith.) Chopped chicken
liver mixed with hard-boiled eggs and onions. Steak, when we could afford
it. Roast pork with applesauce. Delicatessen meats -- salami, baloney,
corned beef, frankfurters. Baked beans, courtesy of Heinz. Apples, seeds
and all, right down to the stem. Chocolate in any form, but especially white
chocolate. Halvah, a particular favorite. Dates and figs, dried. Black
radishes and onions, soaked in gribbinis. Tschav, borsht with huge helpings
of sour cream. Corn on the cob. Slimy canned Harvard beets. No alcohol,
nary a drop. On hot days, not beer, but instead iced tea or iced coffee.
Cheese, either Velveeta or Swiss. Good bread -- pumpernickel or rye. Crumb

Title: 666
Date: February 05, 2018

Donald Trump has taken credit for the rise in the stock market. "The stock
market hit yet another record high yesterday. There is great confidence in the
moves that my Administration is making.” If he is responsible for the rise,
then surely he is also responsible for the fall. It can be no accident, and can
only be a signal from the other world, that Trump's market fell exactly 666
points last Friday. One trillion of market value was erased with the wave of
the supernatural wand. Six hundred and sixty- six is "the number of the beast"
in Revelation. Inasmuch as everything happens for a reason, we must ask what
the Lord is telling us. The 666 point drop undeniably demonstrates that DT is
"the man of sin" who "opposes and exalts himself above every god or object of
worship" (2 Thessalonians 2:1). He is the false god who has erected his tower
at 666 Fifth Avenue. Heed, O supporters of Trump, the words and acts of the
Lord, for the man of the flaming hair is the egg of the serpent, the false
prophet, the anti-Christ.

No possible probable manner of doubt.

Title: United Airlines to Charge to Use Toilet
Date: February 25, 2018

United Airlines has announced that starting March 1, passengers will be charged
for the use of on-board toilet facilities. "Charges will be nominal," according
to United spokesperson Alma Santistevan, "just five dollars for the first
five minutes and two dollars for every subsequent minute, but passengers must
remember to bring their credit cards with them to the facility."

Toilets are now being equipped with card-operated locks but passengers may still
use the facilities for free until the end of the month.

Last year, United carried 95,611,500 passengers. "Even if each passenger uses
the facilities just once a trip, we are looking at half a billion dollars of
additional revenue with very little capital expense," explained Santistevan.
"Stockholders will be very very pleased."

United is considering additional charges for toilet paper and for paper hand
towels. Barf bags will also require a small fee.

Other airlines are expected to follow suit.

United CEO Scott Brandon was asked if he anticipated passenger resistance.
"There will be some grumbling at first," he replied, "but passengers will get
used to it. After all, they've accepted smaller seats, charges for water, rude
service, unpredictable bumping, huge fees for cancellations and plane changes,
luggage surcharges, pets stuffed into overhead bins and suffocated, as well as
the occasional person dragged from his seat screaming. Besides, what choice do
they have? They've got to piss."

Title: Corporations to Buy "Naming Rights" to Trump Wall
Date: March 16, 2018

The White House announced today that "naming rights" to stretches of the Trump
Wall across the southern U. S. border are up for sale.

Portions have been pre-sold. Among the corporations that will have their names
in neon on the wall are Chick-Fil-A and Hobby Lobby. The largest single stretch
has been claimed by Koch Industries, Inc. Together with its subsidiaries
Invista, Georgia-Pacific, Molex, Flint Hills Resources, Koch Pipeline, Koch
Fertilizer, Koch Minerals, Matador Cattle, and Guardian Industries, Koch will
place signs on almost six hundred miles of wall. It is rumored that the National
Rifle Association has contracted to name a large portion of the Texas barrier.

The White House did not say how much the corporations paid for the naming
rights.  Charles Koch, in a rare interview, asserted that the cost was "a good
buy.  But it's not about money," he added, "it's about patriotism."

Trump Industries has also claimed a few choices miles of the wall but has yet to
make a payment.

Title: Status Report
Date: March 16, 2018

A few days ago Vivian de St. Vrain aka Dr. Metablog began his last year as a
septuagenarian. His next birthday, 80. Astonishing. Unbelievable. And kind of
miraculous.

When I was boy, I thought that people of such an advanced age were very likely
extra-terrestrials or possibly members of another species. I remember my ancient
ancestors and relations as very small people, odd-smelling (chicken soup and
mothballs), whose faces were covered with knobs, whelks and unsightly dark
spots. As a group, they appeared to my youthful eyes as swollen, distorted,
asymmetrical.

But now, at this present age, I don't feel even the slightest bit extra-
galactic. I feel like me. Except, of course, when I catch sight of my reflection
in a shop window as I stroll the mall. Who is that white-haired guy?

Here's my status report at age 79. I'm healthy. All my organs might work a
little slower, a little grumpier about doing their jobs, but none of them has
crapped out completely. My joints are relatively supple, especially my knees.
I have great knees. I experience muscle pains and muscle spasms occasionally,
and my back is bad, but it's better than it was a decade or two ago, thanks to
the surgery. I tire more easily and recover from fatigue more slowly. My memory
is not as sharp as heretofore, but it's still pretty good, better than most.
I'm learning a new language and I admit that I have to look up new words two or
three times before they stick. Sometimes four or five times, truth be told. My
capacity for abstract thinking, never strong, has definitely diminished, but my
sense of humor is intact.

I'm not taking any medicines, except for an occasional sleeping pill. The
bifocals and the lens implants are working just fine. So are the hearing aids.
And the tooth implant is still firmly in place. The rest of me, I'm proud to
say, is all original equipment.

On the whole, I'd say that I've come through some dark times and that I'm
enjoying a personal renaissance. How long will it last? Impossible to predict.
A day, a year, ten years?  But hey, I have love in my life. Children who are
thriving. Lovely grandchildren.

I must acknowledge that at my age I could be growing something deadly and that
the least little twinge could be an early sign of a fatal disease. And although
nothing of that kind has happened yet, it's inevitable that something will
happen. Life is term-limited and I've lost too many friends and relations to
deny the obvious. I'm acutely aware that each day is precious.

Date: March 21, 2018

Numerous European websites are reporting that Barron Trump, the 12-year-old
son of United States President Donald J. Trump, has been betrothed to Katerina
Kabaeva, the 11-year-old daughter of Vladimir Putin and "first mistress" Alina
Kabaeva.

White House spokesman Sarah Huckabee Sanders refused to comment on the report.
But another member of the Trump administration, who spoke under the condition
that his name not be revealed, said that, "if the story is true, then it's a
significant diplomatic coup for the United States and for the Trumps.  It would
allow two great families, one Russian and one American, to link their fortunes.
It's a significant step forward for Russian-American diplomatic relations. It
could be the making of a dynasty."

It has also been reported that the betrothal agreement, negotiated by Trump
lawyer Michael Cohen and former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, calls
for the transfer of somewhat more than a billion dollars from the Russian
bank Vnesheconombank, or VEB, also known  as "Putin's bank," to Trump
Industries. VEB has previously been known to be an important investor in Trump
properties.  What the Trump family offered in exchange is as yet unknown.

The rumor that the spelling of "Barron" Trump's name has been changed to "Baron"
Trump has not been confirmed.

A date for the wedding has not been announced.

Title: More Genealogical Information for my Grandchildren
Date: March 22, 2018

Dear Asher, Caleb, Luke, Lola, Ella, Oliver, Talia:

These are pictures of your great-great-great-grandparents, Leib or Louis Hessel
and Tsina Voloshen Hessel. They are the parents of Eta or Yetta Hessel, who
married Isaiah Pearlman, your great-great grandfather, in StaryConstantine,
Ukraine, sometime around 1895. I knew Eta, who died in 1962 when I was in my
early 'twenties, although our conversations were limited because we did not
share a common language.  According to my father, these pictures are copies of
drawings executed by an itinerant Ukrainian artist. Drawn when? Perhaps 1870 or
thereabouts.

I don't know much about these people. I have no idea what they did for a living
or how long they lived. I see some family resemblance in Leib's small black
eyes and abbreviated eyebrows, but otherwise, not much. What sort of hat is he
wearing? Is Tsina wearing the wig of the orthodox or is that her real hair?

He looks mild.  She looks determined.

I know that my grandmother Eta had a number of siblings. In my father's
handwriting, I have a document that hints of two of them: a brother, Morris
Hessel, who married Mary Greenberg and had a son, Paul and a grandson Merel;
 and then a sister Malka, who married one Joseph Cohen and had a son, Saris,
who was a high school principal in New York, and had a son Peter Cohen, a
physician based in Denver. I wonder why my father kept so aloof from his aunts
and uncles and cousins? Was there a story? They were not at all a part of our
life. No visits, no family celebrations, nothing.

I once met my father's "Aunt Mary," who sold tickets at the Kent Theater on
Coney Island Avenue. it must have been the only time I went to a movie with
my father; he said, "This is my Aunt Mary."  I was perhaps 8 years old, and
uncurious. That's the end of the story. I wish I had more to tell you.

Title: Nang Yai
Date: March 28, 2018

Nang yai is an intriguing form of Siamese drama, a shadow play with puppets,
which, unfortunately, I have never seen performed -- in fact, never been to
Thailand, alas, or anywhere else in that part of the world.

The "puppets" are large, almost three-quarters life-size, made of painted
buffalo hide. A story, drawn from the Ramayana, is told by means of songs,
chants, music, and dance. "Nang Yai" simply means "large puppet." People who
have studied Nang Yai have traced performances back to the 1400s. Nang Yai
dramas would be performed before a large white cotton screen illuminated from
behind by fire -- the puppets supported by bamboo poles.

The puppets themselves, one of which is illustrated above, are magnificent
works of art. From what I can learn, the tradition of making Nang Yai puppets
was almost extinct but has now been revived. Nowadays, and I imagine in the
past, the hide of a young ox is bleached and cleaned to get rid of hairs and
tissue. Then it is soaked in the juice of the lamphong tree, whatever the heck
that is, and also in a tincture of lemon grass, pineapple, and orange, and
finally darkened by rubbing with burnt coconut husk. The hide is carved with
chisels, hammers, knives, and then painted. Here's a picture of a particularly
complicated puppet.

Here's a picture of a Nang Yai museum in Thailand.  It's on my list of places
to visit.

Title: Words of my Life: "Worship"
Date: March 28, 2018

There are some words which one might study and parse the dictionary definition
and yet still not understand -- words for which one has no intuitive or even
rational conception. For example, there's the word "heaven." I know that
"heaven" can mean "sky," a definition that poses no problem, but when "heaven"
is presumed to refer to a place beyond the sky in which the souls of dead people
are eternally rewarded, then I'm absolutely baffled. My brain empties out.
"Heaven" in such a sense is to me incomprehensible and meaningless nonsense.

Another such word is "worship," a word which has always puzzled me, right from
the start, when the church bells of St Rose of Lima would ring on a Sunday
morning to call parishioners to mass, leaving me and my brothers to play
stickball or punchball all by ourselves. I recognize that "worship" is a word
to which communities of English speakers give assent, and I observe that people
attend temples, mosques, and tabernacles to perform certain activities, such
as kneeling, genuflecting, singing hymns and uttering hosannas. Nevertheless,
I can't agree that such activities equal "worship" -- because "worship"
presupposes that there is an entity to which these activities are directed. And
that entity, like "heaven" in the religious sense, doesn't exist. Just as heaven
is a non-existent place, so worship posits a non-existent entity. And therefore
the word "worship" has no intelligible meaning, to me.

Perhaps I lack what Charlotte Bronte called an "organ of veneration." Or,
alternatively, worshipers are engaged in mass delusion.

On the other hand, I have an excellent grasp of the word "awe." In fact, I am a
great practitioner of awe. I'm regularly "awed" by both the achievements of my
fellow beings in art, architecture, music, literature, mathematics and science,
and also by the majesty of nature, in the form of grand canyons and in the
triumphs of evolution. Moreover, I've felt "awe," in cathedrals and once, in
the Church of the Rock in Helsinki -- a magnificent building that melds human
ingenuity with natural beauty, -- overwhelming, transcendent awe.  And I can
understand that for some people what I identify as "awe" might translate into
"worship."  But again, not me. Though I'm awed by Rembrandt and Bach, but I
don't worship them or their works. I'll stick with awe.

I may lack an "organ of veneration," but I have a highly developed organ of
wonderment.

Update on "worship."  For the first time in my life, a few weeks ago, I
attended a religious service. I was in New Orleans and friends suggested that
I join them at Vespers at Trinity Episcopal Church on Jackson Avenue. The
attraction was Ellis Marsalis, who was to play a few notes for the attendees.
A priest or whatever he's called, said a few words, read a prayer, and then
elderly, frail Mr. Marsalis sat down at the piano and improvised for a few
minutes. It was beautiful and perhaps transcendent. I suppose it was a form of
worship. And it didn't hurt a bit.

Other words of my life:  slouch, cishet, yips, ramps, jot and tittle, worship,
mucilage. spatchcock, umpire.

Title: Amnesia on Film:  Crossroads
Date: April 17, 2018

What a strange little movie, odd even by amnesia-on-film standards! Film amnesia
is the most malleable and flexible of illnesses, as fact free (and fact-averse)
as the EPA under Trump.

In this modest 1942 adventure, David Talbot, played by William Powell affecting
a slight now-you-hear-it-now-you-don't French accent, is either an amnesia
victim or an amnesia scammer. He either was or wasn't a criminal before the
accident in which he apparently lost his memory.

An extortionist-grifter Henri Sarrou, played by Basil Rathbone, who looks like
"two profiles glued together," is trying to squeeze him for a million francs in
exchange for not turning him over to the police for a murder that he might or
might not have committed in his former life, if he had one.

I don't think I'm giving away any secrets to say that all turns out for the
best. But what is interesting, amnesia-wise, is that there is no recovery of
memory.  Talbot's amnesia never resolves, and he comes to the end of the film
with no knowledge of three-quarter of his life. This should-be painful situation
doesn't seem to compromise or concern him the least little bit. Off he goes, at
the end, blithely, with his luminous bride Hedy Lamarr, at his side.

There are holes within holes in the plot, but what is most striking, I think,
is how casually amnesia is deployed, as if losing one's memory were no more a
challenge to selfhood and identity than a case of sniffles.

Source: 2018/04/contra-tattoos

Title: Contra Tattoos
Date: April 25, 2018

Here are some reasons, young 'uns, why you should steer clear of tattoos.

a) because tattoos are permanent and because taste, your taste, is impermanent
and will inevitably change. There's a poster on the wall of your bedroom that
you love. Five years later, you're indifferent to it, and ten years later,
you've trashed it. "How could I ever have thought that thing was beautiful?"
Same with your taste in all the visual arts. So with the tattoo. You may
think t's beautiful now, perhaps, but ten or twenty years on it has become a
permanent definition of your callow taste. Without remedy or the possibility of
amelioration. You're stuck with it.

b) because ink fades and bodies sag. That crisp tattoo is going to bend,
distort, twist and fade as your body ages. Face facts: that tattoo is going
to become uglier and uglier. Have you caught sight of someone of my age who's
tattooed?  If you have, you know what I'm talking about; if you haven't, don't
look. It ain't pretty.

c)  tattoos are expensive if they're done by someone with talent. The cheap
ones are horrid. What a waste of money! You could donate the same amount to a
useful cause and feel good about yourself.

d)  tattoos hurt in the application; sometimes they become infected.

e)  because tattoos limit your romantic options. For many a potential partner,
that pseudo clever tattoo will be a deal breaker. "You have a tattoo where?
There? Right there? Ugh?" And also, don't tattoo yourself with the name of your
present beloved. Consider the divorce rate.

f)   if the tattoo is in plain sight, it will lower your earning power. No
problem getting a job as a dishwasher, but perhaps that upscale employer is
going to think twice before hiring someone who made such a bad choice. Because
the employer doesn't want to offend potential customers.

g)  because the Bible tells you so. "Do not cut your bodies for the dead or
put tattoo marks on yourselves. I am the LORD” (Leviticus 9:28). Your body
is a temple; do not mutilate or desecrate it. And for god's sake don't tattoo
yourself with religious symbols. To do so is like throwing ashes in the face
of the Almighty. The injunction against tattoos is one of the few biblical
proscriptions that I can sincerely embrace.

h) because tattoos are an expression of vanity, like wearing show-off jewelry or
expensive designer clothes. Let us take pride in our achievements and not in our
shallow foppery.

j ) because you don't want to cause me, ME, to look askance or into the air and
wrinkle up my nose whenever I meet you.

Title: A Most Peculiar Dream
Date: May 02, 2018

The ol' dreamatorium was working overtime last night. The protagonist, who was
and who was not me was a mature, bearded gentleman, a prosperous landowner in
what seemed like the antebellum South. He, or he/I, was the target of a plot
by a younger cousin in league with a scuzzy lawyer to have him/me declared
insane -- and therefore his/my property to be confiscated and transferred to the
control of the villainous cousin. The heart of the dream was a hearing or trial
in which he/I was cross examined and every of his emotions mischaracterized
by the lawyer and the panel of mental health experts. For example, if he/I
expressed indignation and anger, it was interpreted as paranoia; if he/I
remained impassive it was understood as catatonia. Every emotion became its
parodic extreme. As a result, he/I was placed in an institution; a rather
bucolic one, but still a place of incarceration. However, after some while,
another hearing was held, and he/I was able to convince a judge that there
had been a miscarriage of justice. So he/I was set free to reclaim his
property. But, he/I said to the judge, I have no money, no clothes, no means of
transportation, so no one will believe me. The judge then offered to loan me/him
some money, but was clear that it was a loan, not a gift. In the last scene of
the dream, he/I is mounted on a horse (black and white one, like a Holstein),
wearing a Confederate uniform, and carrying, believe it or not, a shiny sword.
Then I woke up.

I cannot interpret this beaut, this honey of a dream.  It was very cinematic,
very vivid, and very long. But it doesn't apply to my life in any obvious way.
I've never been accused of insanity, never lost any property, don't know any
corrupt lawyers, never been institutionalized, never even been on a horse,
and certainly don't carry a sword.  Moreover, it was an undreamlike dream:
no fantastic elements or objects morphing into other objects. It seemed less
like a dream than like a lost chapter or sub-pot to Gone with the Wind. Mighty
puzzling.

There's this woman of a certain age, good looking, usually blonde. Generally,
she's a detective but she could be reporter or a spy -- some sort of
investigator. She has an instinct for her work, an unusual insight or gift.
There's a murderer or villain out there and she's determined to get him; it's
personal with her and often she has to violate procedures in order to bring
this character to justice. She regularly confronts her superior, an older man
who is a stickler for the rules and wants to shut down the investigation.
As a last resort, she'll ask for 24 hours, or more rarely 48 hours, to
bring the villain in. And guess what -- it turns out that her instinct was

I don't know why, but after 66 years I found myself thinking about my first
English teacher at EHHS, Mr. Stephen Mitchell . Here's what I can recall. Mr.
Mitchell was a lazy guy. I remember that on many a day he would give us busy
work assignments, take up his New York Times, rest his feet in the lower drawer
of his desk, and read, while the class occupied itself doing who knows what. 
In retrospect, Mr. Mitchell was probably a classic burnt-out case.  Perhaps he
had been young and enthusiastic at one time, but in 1952, he needed desperately
to retire.

I remember also that in his class we read "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner." 
His instructional technique: he taught us some vocabulary, such as
"onomatopoeia" and "personification." Then one student after another was asked
to take a stanza and search it for examples of onomatopoeia or personification
or perhaps metaphor and also to identify iambic tetrameter or iambic trimeter.

Of the romance of the Rime, we knew nothing and learned nothing.

All the while, Mr. Mitchell's feet never left the drawer.

In retrospect, I wonder whether he might not have been a WW2 veteran, not quite

Title: Year of the Rooster
Date: September 10, 2018

The rooster came to our attention about a month ago. We heard him before we saw
him. He was living at the edge of the forest, about one hundred yards from the
house. After a few days he became bolder and we were able to catch a glimpse now
and then. He's a Barred Rock, fully mature, with a bright red comb and superior
wattles, but with woeful tail feathers. We don't know from where he came. We
asked around but none of the neighbors is missing a rooster. We guessed: he's
an escapee, or, perhaps his owner became tired of him and kicked him out of the
truck, or (my favorite theory) he was in a rooster fight, lost his tail feathers
and retired to the woods in shame. But in fact, we have no idea how he came to
settle on our property.

Little by little he started to become more comfortable with us. He would spend
his day in the flower garden, furtively eating insects. He was especially fond
of earwigs. A good occupation, I thought. No harm except to the bugs. Eventually
he came to tolerate our presence. He would sit a few yards away, studying me
while I weeded. He gained our respect, because he managed to survive even though
the forest is filled with foxes and fisher cats and weasels and coyotes and
the air is patrolled by hawks. He liked to visit the donkeys and peck around
their manure piles.  When he started to roost not in the forest but in the
blueberry bushes close to the house I became concerned -- this may be more of a
rooster guest than I need. And then he took up the habit of cock-a-doodle-do-ing
at dawn just outside our bedroom window. And during afternoon nap time. And
familiarizing himself with the vegetable garden, where he snacks on cucumbers.
(He loves cucumbers.) He became ever more bold -- a few days ago he was just
outside the kitchen, pecking on the glass door, hoping, I imagine, to be let
inside. And when I didn't let him in, he left a large retaliatory splash of
rooster dropping right at the doorway.

We looked out of the small north window of our bedroom and there he was perched
on the railing, peering in. A peeping-Tom rooster. (Did he catch an eyeful!!)

One day a near neighbor telephoned: "Your rooster is here."  "He's not my
rooster."

And then he disappeared. For the first time in a month, there was no crowing at
dawn.  OK, we thought, some predator got him. One of these days, we'll stumble
upon a bunch of black and white feathers in the forest.

But then a friend who lives on Ira's Pinnacle told us that he had seen a pair of
chickens on Hackett Hill Road about a half a mile up the road. He couldn't be
sure, but he figured it must be "your" rooster and a hen.

So that's where he's been!! He's a gallinaceous gallant gallivanting with the
local ladies. I thought, good for him; I don't have to concern myself with him
any longer. He'll go feral and start a family. He must not know about Vermont
winters.

But not so. This morning he was back, solitary, crowing vigorously outside my
window. His romance, if it were a romance, didn't work out. I can't imagine why
because he's become quite a handsome bird. He personable, friendly and he's
grown an an impressive new set of tail feathers. He's plump and shiny; his walk,
once furtive, has become a decisive strut. There he is now, cock-a-doodling his
head off in the patch of cucumbers.

Title: A Choice Euphemism
Date: September 29, 2018

Victorian novelists had a hard time describing bodies, especially female bodies.
Their usual practice was to sidestep such subjects entirely though the more
daring of them might resort to suggestion or innuendo.

Here's an instance in which Thomas Hardy ties himself into comical  knots
trying to tell his audience that although Tess Derbyfield (in Tess of the
D'Urbervilles, 1891) is very young and almost childish she has already developed
a large bosom: "She had an attribute which amounted to a disadvantage just now;
and it was this that caused Alec d'Urberville's eyes to rivet themselves upon
her. It was a luxuriance of aspect, a fullness of growth, which made her appear
more of a woman than she really was. She had inherited the feature from her
mother without the quality it denoted. It had troubled her mind occasionally,
till her companions had said that it was a fault which time would cure."  So
very elliptical. It's distressing that frank-minded Thomas Hardy had to resort
to such circumlocutions.

A later novelist might simply have noted that she was physically mature and that
her emotions would eventually catch up but for now she was vulnerable.

Back in Brooklyn we might have said, "Though she's only a kid, he has a pair of
gazongas on her like you wouldn't believe and they're going to get her into a
whole lot of trouble"

Title: For My Grandchildren: Anne Goss
Date: October 09, 2018

Dear T, O, E, L, L, C, A:  This is about your great-grandmother, Anne Goss.
She was born Hannah Sarah Krull in 1912 in New Jersey, but I've forgotten which
city, although I know that as a young person she lived in Bayonne, Hackensack
and Paterson. Her parents, David and Katherine Meltzer Krull, were recent
immigrants from eastern Europe. She was the oldest of five siblings: Anne, Jacob
(Jack), Hyman, Freda, and Max (Mendy). Her father installed metal ceilings,
her mother was what was then called a "practical" (i.e. unlicensed) nurse.
The family was not wealthy. The five children shared two beds, boys in one,
girls in the other, sleeping crosswise. Anne had a bout of polio at sixteen
months which left her with a permanent limp and weakness in the left side of
her body. Because of the effects of the illness, she endured an unusually
difficult childhood -- marked by a series of surgeries on her leg which may or
may not have helped. But she was quick-witted and talented, learning to play
violin and viola and graduating as high school valedictorian. About the Jewish
religion, important to her parents, she told me, "I gave up that stuff when I
was thirteen." She was intent on a college education which her parents opposed
because the few dollars that she made as a dental assistant were crucial to
the family economy. She won a full scholarship to Barnard College but it's sad
to report that when she arrived on the first day of classes she discovered
that she had to pay for room and board, which her family could not afford. She
returned home but was admitted to Montclair State Teacher's College where she
majored in chemistry. In a world with more advantages he would have gone on
to medical school and become a distinguished physician, but such a career was
not in the cards. At Montclair she played string quartets and met your great
grandfather, Daniel Goss. There wasn't enough money to allow them to marry and
no one lived together before marriage in those days. Anne once told me that the
greatest mistake of her life was that she didn't go to bed with Dan until after
they married, which didn't happen until he was 26 and she was 24. I think those
premarital depression years must  have been hard and unsatisfying. And even
after they married, still not so good because Dan and Anne couldn't afford a
place of their own but shared an apartment with his parents (actually shared a
bedroom, with a curtain between the parents'  bed and theirs). Dan's parents
disapproved of Anne: "Why would you want to marry a cripple?" Eventually Dan was
hired as a teacher of mathematics at Paterson High School and then in 1946 moved
to Utica College in Utica, New York. Although Ann had been told that the polio
made it impossible for her to carry a child, she gave birth to three daughters
(Althea -- your grandmother --in 1939; Phyllis in 1942, and Paula in 1951).
She taught mathematics until she retired at the then-mandatory age of 65 but
continued with her tutoring business through her seventies. Meanwhile, she had
mastered the domestic arts: cooking, baking, sewing (she made all her daughters'
 clothes through their childhoods) and knitting. She was a hard-working woman,
often to be found knitting, reading a book, and watching TV at the same time.
Dan died in 1966 and so she spent many more years as widow than as a wife. Her
life was filled with pain (two dozen major surgeries) but she never complained.
She was independent, frugal, and adventurous. She was also strict, cool, not at
all affectionate, and humorless. Not exactly humorless -- she never laughed,
that I can remember, but sometimes she would respond to a joke by saying,
"That's funny."  She played bridge to win and not for fun and she liked a rough
game of Scrabble with her grandsons. She was easy to respect but difficult to
love.

She moved to Boulder at age 87 and lived to be 97, though much impaired. At her
90th birthday party, in 2002,  she was still functioning well but "looping."
 If she had died at 90 she would not have missed much. She was demented and
bedridden for the last few years of her life. The last coherent statement she
made to me, in her last month, was "I'm not afraid of this dying business."

A good memory: Anne spent most of her early life wearing a heavy metal brace on
her bad leg. But when she was in her early 90s, she acquired a brace made of a
light space-age material. I took her walking in the mountains. First time. She
was thrilled.

Here's another: she liked to help grade Althea's math exams and she liked to
talk calculus with her grandsons. I remember saying to them, "You have to
understand something. This is unusual. Your standard run-of-the-mill grandmother
does not understand calculus."

Title: A Cliffhanger
Date: October 16, 2018

I've been reading the novels of Thomas Hardy. Some of them are familiar old
friends, like Jude the Obscure and Return of the Native; some I've read so long
ago that they're new again (Mayor of Casterbridge, Far from the Madding Crowd);
 and then there are a few that I know I've never looked at before, such as The
Woodlanders, Under the Greenwood Tree, and, the one I just finished a half a
second ago, A Pair of Blue Eyes.

Blue Eyes is an early novel (1873), moderately autobiographical. In it, young
Stephen Smith is an apprentice architect of working class origins (as was Hardy)
who woos Elfrida Swancourt, a maiden of a higher station. He has a rival for
Elfrida's hand in a former teacher, elegant and prudish Henry Knight.

It's safe to say that this is a novel only for confirmed Hardy enthusiasts     .
There's little in it that Hardy doesn't do better later on                     .

On the other hand, Blue Eyes contains one rather wonderful piece of
melodramatic excess. Elfrida and Knight go hiking on a dangerous cliff and
Knight slips and gets himself into an awkward position, hanging on six hundred
and fifty feet above the ocean. His foot "was propped by a bracket of quartz
rock, balanced on the edge of the precipice." She's clinging to him and they're
both stuck. Knight is ever the gentleman. "Clamber up my body till your feet
are on my shoulders: when you are there you will, I think, be able to climb
on to level ground." "What will you do?" asks Elfrida. Knight answers that he
will wait "whilst you run for assistance." But just their bad luck, there's no
one around. And so the chapter comes to a cliffhanging close (the novel was
originally published in serial form in Tinsley's Magazine).

Several minutes and several pages of reflection pass. At last, Elfrida
reappears, her form "singularly attenuated."  She carries a bundle of white
linen.

Jumping jiminy, holy moly, I say, -- the girl has removed her underclothes.

She tears the linen into thin strips, knots them, and forms "a perfect rope,
six or seven yards long." Knight 'clambers' up the rope, and is saved.  But
by surrendering her undergarments,  Elfrida has, as Hardy delicately puts
it, "absolutely nothing between her and the weather but her exterior robe or
costume."  Goodness gracious me, the poor dear is clad only in her "outer
bodice and skirt."  So, of course, to spare everyone further embarrassment, she
runs away as fast as her little legs will carry her.

Poor struggling Thomas Hardy has wrestled Mrs. Grundy to a draw.

Good thing Elfrida was clothed in sufficient unmentionables to construct a rope
seven yards long. Suppose Knight had been down there couple more yards and she
had to remove her "upper bodice."  Would she have done so, or would she have
let Knight plummet?` Hardy arranges it so that Elfrida can defy social norms,
but not to the point of actual nudity. Hardy is bold, but not too bold.

I suspect that if Hardy had his way and wasn't enchained by the humbug prudery
against which he struggled all his life, he would have stripped Elfrida to the
skin. How would Henry Knight have responded? Probably keeled over from the
shock.

What would Elizabeth Bennet have done in the same situation?  Removed her
underclothes to save her suitor?  Probably not. The most likely answer: Jane
Austen would never have let her go out walking near a cliff with a gentleman.

1958:  First batter of the game is Smith. He's batting .278. First pitch is a
ball. Smith is 5'9", 155 pounds. Married, two children, makes his winter home in
Fort Smith, Arkansas. Sells tractors in the off-season. Good curve ball hitter.

2018:  First batter is Smith. He's batting .278. His slugging percentage is
.342. His OBP is .335. His OPS is .445. He hits .225 against right-handers and
.303 against left-handers. First pitch is a ball. On first pitches he's batting
.225. With a count of 2 and 0, he's batting .247. Second pitch is a ball. On two
strike pitches he's at .175. On fast balls in the upper right quadrant of the
strike zone, he's batting .345. On fast balls in the lower left quadrant he's
hitting .175. On two strike pitches, he strikes out 25% of the time and hits
fly balls 30% of the time. He bats .283 in his home park, .246 on the road. Day
games, .290, night games .225. His OPS in away night games against a left-handed
pitcher is .341. In this ballpark he's batting .283. He's batting only .125
against this pitcher, just two for sixteen lifetime, and one of the hits was
a double, but that was in a different ballpark and in a previous season. He's
batting .285 against fastballs, .276 against curves, .225 against four seamers,
.215 against split fingers, and .275 against change-ups. He sees an average of
4.3 pitches per at bat against right-handers and 5.1 against left-handers. He
swings and misses 38% of the time. Here's the next pitch; it's a strike. When he
connects against a left-handed split finger fastball in the lower left quadrant
the ball comes of his bat at an average velocity of 85 miles per hour to left
field, 87 to center field, and 76 to right field. His average launch angle
is 18 degrees. With men on base, he's hitting .285. With runners in scoring
position, .290; his launch angle to right field against right-handed split
finger fastballs in the lower left quadrant rises to 25 degrees, but only on
his first at bat in a game. Afterwards, it declines to 17 degrees. But that's
in April and May, on weekends. In August and September, under the lights, his
launch angle is 20 degrees against change-ups from right-handers who throw into
the upper right quadrant when there's a man on second or third and fewer than
two outs. There's ball four.

Here comes the manager out to the mound. That's all for this pitcher. We'll be
back in a moment.

Title: A Truly Awful Western
Date: November 01, 2018

The Sons of Katie Elder (1965) -- another film so awful that it's utterly,
undeniably fascinating. It's packaged as a western, but underneath the arid
mountainous scenery and the garish Technicolor, it's a film noir.  What's it
about?  Well, a gang of crooks have been muscling in on the Elder ranch. Not
an unusual circumstance, but in this case the heart of the matter, it seems, is
that the four sons of frequently praised Katie Elder, proprietor of the ranch,
have neglected their mother. They should have visited more often, or written,
or at least called. The brothers are, in birth order, swaggering John Wayne,
a gunman; sniggering Dean Martin, a gambler; colorless bland Earl Holliman, a
failed businessman, and sophomoric Michael Anderson, whom the older brothers
want to send to college, but whom they should rather send to high school to
fulfill the prerequisites for Acting 101. It's all a mighty predictable -- a
string of cliches -- and, just as expected, after the climactic gunfight the
Elders get their land back from cheating Morgan Hastings and his gang of no-
goodniks. The dialogue throughout is embarrassingly wooden; no, not wooden,
harder than that, ceramic; no, not ceramic, titanium.

I blame it all on Henry Hathaway, the director, who had some good westerns and
also a series of films noirs (The House on 92nd Street, The Dark Corner, Kiss of
Death, Call Northside 777) to his credit. How could he have perpetrated this
film? And someone, I don't know who, has to take responsibility for the ugliest,
unfunniest, uncomic bit of grotesque "comic relief" ever perpetrated, in which
Dean Martin auctions off his make-believe glass eye to a passel of local yokels.
But I also think that some of the blame attaches to the producer, Hal Wallis.
This is a film utterly without a female presence except for Martha Hyer,  who
wanders into a couple of scenes without point or purpose. I couldn't figure out
what the heck she was doing in the film until I read that she was married at the
time to Wallis and that her career was on the fritz. I'm positive that Wallis
told the screen writer, "Put in something  for Martha."  Well, he did, but
it just made the whole mess a little messier, and if possible, a little less
coherent.

The Sons of Katie Elder stoked my indignation. What a waste of resources!

But hey, there's a good three minute scene of a hundred or more horses being
herded by the brothers, and there's George Kennedy as a gunslinger and Dennis
Hopper as a neurotic youngster who gets killed  by his own father. It's
something, but, sorry, not enough to dilute the indignation.

Addendum November 16.  I've just watched another western, Big Jake (1971), in
which John Wayne parodies an earlier John Wayne. Just as awful as Katie Elder.
Maybe less intelligible. You can infer a lot from the poster.

Title: Nomenclature
Date: November 04, 2018

If a widow and a widower form a relationship when they're both in their
seventies, what is the proper and appropriate name for their relationship?

Legally, they're married, because here in the state of Colorado, if you live
together and represent yourself as married, you're married, even if you haven't
sought governmental sanction. Yet "husband" and "wife" don't come easily to
the lips. They seem too doggone official. And they also seem like words out
of an earlier era, especially "wife," which carries irrelevant overtones of a
dominant-submissive relationship. "Just a housewife."

But "companion" is only slightly better. To my ear, it smacks of "faithful
companion Tonto." "Partner" is even worse; are we associates in a law firm?

"Girlfriend" and "boyfriend" are clearly ludicrous and inappropriate to persons
of mature years. Such words lack seriousness and heft; they trivialize a
weighty relationship. So, similarly, does the naked "friend," which in this
context is colorless, neutral. "Ladyfriend" is a bit more serious. "Gentleman
caller" was last said without irony in Peoria sometime in the middle of the
nineteenth century. "Mistress" suggests that the friendship is merely sexual;
its counterpart, "gigolo," is even more specific, and seedy to boot. "Lover" is
also one-dimensional.

"Old lady" and "old man" are outmoded hippieisms. So is "significant other    ."
Other archaisms: "main squeeze," "stud," "pal," "steady lay," "fancy man      ."
 "Love-slave                                                                 ."

"Spouse"? No, too dry, too legalistic. "Consort"?  Disrespectful. "Odalisque"?
"Handmaiden." Sexist. "Concubine?"

It's fascinating that we've had more trouble with nomenclature than with living,
eating, working, and sleeping together.

Title: Garum vs. Ketchup
Date: November 11, 2018

The universal condiment in the ancient world, a staple of Roman, Greek and
Byzantine cuisines, was garum. Garum was manufactured in enormous quantities
and shipped in special amphorae all over the civilized, colonized universe. What
is garum? It's a fishy sauce that any sensible modern apple-pie-loving American
would avoid at all costs. Trust me, you would not want to slaver your bacon
cheeseburger with garum.

To make garum, the innards -- the guts -- of fish (whitebait, anchovies,
mackerel, tuna, etc.) were stacked between layers of salt and herbs and left in
the sun for several months. Honest to Pete!! The result, which must have been
malodorous and horrid, was then strained and bottled, or rather, poured into
amphorae for transport.

Don't believe me? Here's a direct quotation from a 10th century Byzantine
manual: "the intestines of fish are thrown into a vessel and are salted; and
small fish especially atherinae, or maenae or lycostomi are seasoned in the sun,
and frequently turned; and when they have been seasoned in the heat, the garum
is thus taken from them. A small basket of close texture is laid in the vessel
filled with the small fish already mentioned, and the garum will flow into the
basket." Sounds dreadful, you must admit. And I don't even know, and I don't
know that anyone knows, exactly what sort of monsters of the deep are designated
by the words atherinae and lycostomi.

Here's a picture of a ruined garum factory in Baelo Claudia in Spain. The
remains of such factories can be found all over the Mediterranean world. I
myself have toured one near Pompeii. Garum factories were set as far as possible
from centers of population because they, er, stunk.

Title: East 9 Street Between Ditmas and 18th, 1939 -1955
Date: November 16, 2018

Beginning at the northwest corner and preceding south -- in the first brick
house, a family of notably obese immigrant Syrian women who spoke no English;
there were no children that I know of and no interactions with other neighbors.
The house itself was not unusual but it was fronted by a wrought iron fence and
a row of ancient stubbed catalpas which we called "umbrella trees." Next was
the house belonging to Dr. Jerry Yurkovsky, our M.D. In retrospect, he was a
kind man but a badly-trained, out-of-touch physician. He was also an immigrant
-- from Poland, I believe. My father, who rarely spoke badly of anyone, thought
that he was a decent sort but that Mrs. Yurkovsky was "a real pill." I remember
only her iridescent dyed red hair. Then came the Lampsons, Hubert and Dorothy.
He was never seen in daylight but was rumored to own a "yacht"; she was the
neighborhood grouch, known to slice in half any errant pink "spaldeens" that
that might be punched (kids played "punchball" in the street) over her tall
privet hedge and into her front yard. While I never questioned this neighborhood
orthodoxy, I never saw a sliced spaldeen either. Then came the large Victorian
house belonging until about 1950 to the Heidtmanns and then to another family
whose name I can't remember but who had an impaired daughter who screamed and
screamed at maximum volume at all hours day and night. Next came our immediate
neighbors on the south, Mr. and Mrs. Pynn, who lived in a small old wood-
shingled structure.The Pynns (did they have given names?) were extremely old,
in their 90s I would guess. He was a retired Cornish seaman, believe it or not;
she cultivated colorful gladioli in her small backyard garden. Their upstairs
tenants were the Rhodins, Thor and Pearl. He was a tall gaunt ancient austere
Norwegian whose only known activity was writing letters to local newspapers; she
was almost as tall but Jewish and "went to business." They had three children
but they were out of the house and too old for me to know them: Thor, jr, Yammie
(Hjalmar), and Margeret. Thor was a physicist at Cornell rumored to have worked
on the "bomb." I have written about the Rhodins elsewhere. Then came our house,
a three-story 1912 Victorian of which our family of five occupied the top two
floors. The first floor tenants were the Burnets (formerly Bernsteins), Albert
and Bessie. He was musician who had retreated to accountancy. There were two
sons, the older, Leonard, was troubled, and I now realize, probably gay; he
played the sax; the younger son, Henry, had a cleft palate, later corrected by
surgery, I believe, and banged on his drums incessantly. To our north were the
Carps, who owned a brickyard or building supply business somewhere not in the
neighborhood. They were a gloomy Dickensian family. Both of the daughters were
nuns who came visiting once a year in their long black robes; the son, hang-dog
Eddie, had the demeanor of a jaded funeral attendant. The Carps first act on
moving into the house was to erect a tall forbidding chain link fence around the
perimeter of their property which annoyed my father no end. Proceeding south,
the next house was occupied by the Spollens, an immigrant Irish family who
seemed to produce a new child every year. My memory is hazy about the south end
of the street, under grand old elms until they fell victim to the Dutch blight,
except that in one of the houses dwelt two tired bony sisters, perhaps twins,
who every Sunday, trudged down 9th Street and past 18th Avenue to one of our
neighborhood's numerous under-attended Protestant churches. They had a splendid
garden of hollyhocks. Also at that end of the street lived, Mr. Mennino, who
shared his personal variety of cucumbers with my father. At the very end of the
block lived the dog-faced man..

On the other side of the street was an Italian family named Cocito, pronounced
American'ly, ko-see-to. When Junior Cocito (perhaps he had a name, but everyone
called him Junior) grew up and married, he bought the house next door to his
father's. Then next, coming closer to us, were the Cunninghams. Mr. Cunningham
was a large imposing firefighter; there was at least one daughter and two sons,
Jimmy and Billy. Billy was our only celebrity; he became rich and famous as
the "Kangaroo Kid"; he also played first base on my younger brother's baseball
team. After the Cunninghams was another house of semi-mystery, occupied by
an unfriendly family whose last name was Harris. I believe my mother told me
that Mr. Harris was a school principal. There was a shapely daughter a year or
so older than I whom I admired from a distance. She (Betty) married at 16 or
17 ("shotgun," I was told), and disappeared -- as did the family. Then came
the Burkes, directly across the street from us. There were two sons, Charley,
a genuine dolt and high school dropout who became an armed guard for Wells
Fargo, and lanky John, who was studying for the priesthood. There was also an
uncle or cousin who lived with them and who spent every weekend waxing and
noisily buffing his big new DeSoto. Then came the house occupied by Mr. and Mrs.
Petranto along with their ancient father who spent all day every day watching
the traffic from the oversize glider on the porch. There was an older daughter,
Madeleine, whom I didn't know, and a son, Frankie, a bachelor, a contemporary
of my older brother Eugene, who later found work in the U.S. post office and
who, when I investigated a few years ago, still -- eighty years later -- lived
in his childhood home. Upstairs from the Petrantos dwelt the Meinekes, Charlie
and Tessie. He was a butcher; she was "at home." There was a rather sad ungainly
but harmless daughter just my age, Charlotte, who dropped out of school early.
I hope she a good life but I wonder. Next northward was another mystery house,
probably a rental; for a year it was occupied by the Tebbets family. There was
an attractive mid-twenties daughter whom my older brother and his peers admired
no end, and a son, Lee, whom twenty years later I encountered in Vermont where
he gave me an envelope of blue corn seeds (which I never planted). And then
came the Constantino household. The father was a shoemaker, I believe. There
were three children, Frankie, a terrific athlete; Regina, a beauty, and Carly,
who dyed his hair henna and moved to Greenwich Village. There were two or three
more houses at that end of the street, but I'm vague about them. Sorry, don't
remember; too far away. The name Ortner comes to mind. Mystery houses.

Even though I lived on the street for my entire childhood and until I left for
college, I never entered a single house, nor did any of the neighbors ever enter
ours. It wasn't that kind of neighborhood. Or perhaps we weren't that sort of
people.

Title: Amnesia on Film:  High Wall (1947)
Date: November 20, 2018

In High Wall (1947), an extremely noir-y noir, Stephen Kenet, played by an
unusually glamorless Robert Taylor, suffers from a fully credible traumatic
amnesia. Did he, or did he not kill his wife. He can't remember.

So far so good. Happens all the time in such films.

But he's cured of his affliction in a most unlikely, most unscientific  manner.
He's injected with "truth serum" --  sodium pentathol -- and what was once lost
is found. Such easy recovery of memory could ruin dozens of amnesia movies. 
Good thing the treatment never caught on.

The gimmick spoils an otherwise grainy, hard-edged film.

Here's Kenet (Taylor), and Ann Lorrison, played by Audrey Totter. They're good
as patient and doctor, but unpersuasive when they emerge as lovers in the last
scene.

Title: Notting Hill (1990), Two on a Tower (1882)
Date: November 23, 2018

We watched Notting Hill, a cute 1999 "rom-com" or "date movie" with cute couple
Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts. (It's hard to believe that the film is almost
twenty years old. It's so slight and fluffy that I can't remember whether or
not I saw it last millennium, but frankly, it wouldn't make much difference one
way or the other.)  In Notting HIll, Julia Roberts plays a pricey celebrity
actress ($15,000,000 a film) who happens to wander into Hugh Grant's tiny
bookstore and -- a few cute scenes later -- into his tiny Notting Hill bedroom.
It's a slight, unconvincing fairy-tale of a film and I'm giving away no secrets
when I say that the cute apparently- mismatched couple not only overcome all
psychological obstacles and class anxieties in order to marry but that also, in
the cute coda scene, when she's lying in his lap on a bench in the park, she's
well along in her pregnancy. Ah love! Ah romance! Ah idealized domesticity! Ah
cuteness!

Cynic that I am, I'm curious whether she's crammed herself into his narrow
digs (and displaced his second-banana roommate) or whether she's purchased the
biggest finest mansion in the upscale Notting Hill neighborhood and moved the
new husband into it. And closed down the bookstore. The film is wise to sidestep
concerns of such dreary ordinariness.

Notting Hill is a rip-off and inversion of Pretty Woman (1990), in which Julia
Roberts was poor and Hugh Grant was Richard Gere, a mega-billionaire. Notting
Hill might just as easily have been called Pretty Man -- it's that close a
parallel. Only without the shopping.

And Notting Hill, though upscale, is no Rodeo Drive. It's a neighborhood that
has gone through a number of transformations. Once famous for its piggeries, by
the middle of the 19th century, it was on the way up. In 1862, when Thomas Hardy
left Dorchester and his Wessex homeland to apprentice himself as an architect,
he took up residence in Notting HIll's recently constructed Westbourne Park
Villas. And there in Notting Hill he wrote his first novel, never published and
now lost, called with the remarkably appropriate Hugh-and-Julia title of The
Poor Man and the Lady.

Lower class boy and upper class girl was a perennial theme in Hardy's novels. An
obsession, in fact. By coincidence, I'd just finished reading -- on the same day
as I watched Notting Hill -- one of Hardy's most thorough explorations of the
poor-rich theme -- his novel Two on a Tower (1882).

No idyllic pregnancy in the park in the Hardy universe.

In Two on a Tower, Lady Constantine falls in love with Swithin St. Cleeve, an
impoverished amateur astronomer, but Hardy strews their path with one obstacle
after another. For the Lady, a wastrel husband who is missing in deep dark
Africa, and who may or not be dead; an inadvertent pregnancy; a duped second
husband, this time a clergyman; for St. Cleeve, a badly-needed inheritance that
can only be claimed if he remains single, and an extended exile. For both of
them, misunderstandings, accidental damaging eavesdroppings, important letters
gone astray, etc. And finally, when it appears possible that the poor boy and
lady might find solace together, a sudden inexplicable spontaneous death.

Good thing that Thomas Hardy didn't write Notting Hill. Trust me, there would
have been no happy ending. Perhaps Hugh would been disfigured in the fire that
destroyed his bookstore and his livelihood, and Julia, repulsed, would have
returned to her abusive alcoholic boyfriend. But very likely something even more
arbitrary and cruel.

Title: Canyon Passage (1946)
Date: November 24, 2018

In our tour of classic western movies, we watched Canyon Passage (1946),
directed by Jacques Tourneur, who is famous for the noir masterpiece Out of the
Past (1947). Canyon Passage is a good substantial film and it's got everything a
frontier drama should have: a cabin raising, a saloon in which a poker game is
perpetually in progress, gold mines, muddy streets, Indians (unsympathetically
depicted as mere murderous savages), gun fights, bar brawls, lovely landscapes,
and Andy Devine.

At its emotional heart is a mighty curious three-way relationship between Dana
Andrews as Logan Stuart, an upstanding entrepreneur; Brian Donlevy as George
Camrose, a banker/gambler, and Susan Hayward as Susan Hayward. Hayward is
engaged to George but attracted to Logan. She doesn't seem to know what is made
obvious to us, that George is a compulsive gambler, a wastrel, an embezzler,
a serious flirt, and eventually a murderer. Why Hayward, or Lucy as she's
sometimes called, doesn't see him for what he is puzzles us. It's an even
greater mystery that Logan Stuart, who knows George's faults, remains loyal --
even, at one point, risking his life and imperiling his reputation to break his
friend out of prison.

The oddest scene is one in which George gives his fiancee Lucy a tepid kiss.
He turns to Logan and says, "Can you do better?" Logan takes the challenge
and kisses his friend's fiancee; he wins -- she clearly responds less to her
intended than to his friend. What are we to make of this?  It seems borderline
pervy. Is there a suggestion that the men are closer, more "friendly"  than the
conventions of the western film ordinarily allow?  Or are Logan and George more
than just good ol'  loyal buddies?

After George is killed, Logan and Lucy wind up together, but more for
convenience than passion, or so it seems to suspicious ol' me.

Title: My Mitt
Date: December 02, 2018

My most valuable possession, lifetime, was my baseball mitt. A fielder's glove,
not a catcher's or first baseman's. It was, I think, a Rawlings model, and it
was inscribed with the name "Monte Pearson." (Pearson had been a pitcher for the
Cleveland Indians.)  I remember many hours spent oiling it. I guarantee that it
was well cared for.

In the P. S. 217 neighborhood, to possess one's own baseball glove was a marker
of class. When we played, there were never enough gloves to go around, so when
our team came in to bat, those who had gloves would leave theirs on the field
for someone from the other team to use. Although I never articulated it at the
time, it felt downright prosperous to be a lender, not a borrower. I think a
good glove cost about $15.00 in those days, so it was no trivial expense.

When my brother Jonathan, who was three years younger than I, was presented with
his glove, he slept with it every night.  I recently asked him if he continued
to do so after he was married.  He says no, but....

I don't think that anyone who didn't grow up in the 40s and 50s in Brooklyn, in
the Jackie Robinson era, can appreciate the importance of baseball to us.

I've tried to think of another possession that ever meant as much to me -- a
particular book or an automobile, for instance -- but nothing compares. Not even
slightly.

Title: Amnesia on Film:  Crack-up (1946)
Date: December 04, 2018

Ho-hum. Another day, another amnesia movie.

Crack-up offers still another variant on this most malleable of diseases:
amnesia that is chemically-induced.

George Steele (played by too-old-for-the-part Pat O'Brien) presents a danger to
a doctor-thief played by reliable Ray Collins. To discredit  him, Steele is
kidnapped and injected with "narcosynthesis" which causes him lose his memory
and act erratically. Too many silly plot complications and a couple of murders
follow, but eventually a second injection brings Steele round.

I'm not aware of another case of chemically-induced amnesia in film, but I know
that there is such a thing in medicine. Propofol and scopolamine are frequently
mentioned and I believe that even the common sleeping pill, Ambien, may have
amnesiac properties. So there's some limited scientific underpinning for Crack-
up's apparently fantastic premise.

In noir, amnesia is as common as the common cold. In the 40s and 50s, a guy
couldn't walk down a louche shadowy city street or take a dame out dancing to
 a night spot without encountering half a dozen cases. It was a regular plague.

Title: Billy Graham and Me, 1957
Date: December 04, 2018

In 1957 (I was 18 and in my second year in college), the reverend doctor Billy
Graham led the largest revival meeting in history -- an average attendance,
in the old-old Madison Square Garden, of eighteen thousand people a night
for three months. What was his message?  It was half jingo, half Christian
fundamentalism. "Let us tell the world that Americans believe in God, that we
are morally and spiritually strong as well as militarily and economically.
Let us tell the world that we are united and ready to march under the banner
of Almighty God" -- not a sentiment that would have been dear to my heart. No
Almighty God in my upbringing or anywhere in my brain.

Graham was a fervent anti-Communist, but of a sort that left me baffled: "My own
theory about Communism," he proclaimed, "is that it is master-minded by Satan.
I think there is no other explanation for the tremendous gains of Communism
in which they seem to outwit us at every turn, unless they have supernatural
power and wisdom and intelligence given to them."  Let me try two non-Satanic
explanations for apparent Communist success: 1) "They" didn't outwit us;
 in fact, they were dumber than us, overplayed their hand, and collapsed.
2) European and American imperialism had left a mess in the "underdeveloped
countries" that was ripe for exploitation.

How was a secular partially-educated young fellow supposed to understand such a
paranoid, irrational  analysis of world politics?

With mockery, I'm afraid. Sometime in the middle of the summer of 1957, along
with a bunch of wise-ass PS 217 cronies, I took a break from my Sears, Roebuck
warehouse job and took the subway to 49th Street to take a gander and a listen
to the Crusade for Christ (it was free). What do I remember?  A chorus
(probably led by George Beverly Shea but I can't swear to it), bright lights, a
cheering, milling crowd. I remember that Billy spoke, but I have no recollection
of what he said, though the bronze gong of a voice resounded through the hall.
Did he tell us of the five ways that Americans could most effectively combat
Communism? By "old-fashioned Americanism" -- whatever that was, by "conservative
and evangelical Christianity," by prayer, by "spiritual revival," and by
"personal Christian experience." All five of which sound pretty much the same to
me. And remote from my experience or desires.

Needless to say, I wasn't his most sympathetic or susceptible auditor.

I wonder if he touched on another of his favorite topics that night: that "a
woman commits sin when she deliberately dresses in such a way as to entice a
man"; "that a wife "should keep herself attractive and give her husband a big
kiss when he comes home from the office instead of yelling at him from the
kitchen."

Except for the spectacle, it's all vague in my mind. I do remember, though, that
when leaving that Garden I accidentally and momentarily found myself on the line
of people who had made a "decision for Christ" and were heading to the podium.
That was scary. I beat a quick retreat.

I wonder how many other members of the audience were rubberneckers like me.

I'm reminded now of the great old gospel song by the Carter Family, "Something
Got a Hold of Me."  It's a parable that tells the story of a man who goes to a
revival meeting to scoff. "I says I'll go down, take a look at the crowd/  It's
just the weak-minded I feel."  But then there's a revelation: "They sing and
shout and they all clasp their hands/ And they all got down on their knees./
When the fire fell from heaven it fell upon me,/ And then I fell to the floor."
Because

Something's got a hold of me.

Yes, something's got a hold of me.

I have a spirit I'll never forget

That something's got a hold of me.Well, nothing got a hold of me. No fire from
heaven, no road to Damascus revelation. If anything, I was confirmed in my
scoffery and atheism.

What did I learn? Not much. At the most, only that if the people who inhabit
this country, my fellow Americans, are incomprehensible to me, then it is
equally likely that I am incomprehensible to them.

And frankly, the mysteries that I encountered in Madison Square Garden in 1957
are, sixty years later, still mysterious to this day. Perhaps even more so.

Title: Where I Lived (I)
Date: December 10, 2018

From my birth in 1939 until I left for college in 1956, I lived at 539 East 9
Street in the Flatbush (now gentrified to "Kensington") section of Brooklyn.
539 was a three-story, three-family wood-frame Victorian, which my parents
had acquired in 1937 for $4500 -- a depression-era fire-sale price financed
by my generous "maiden aunt" Mollie. The house was larger and more splendid,
I believe, than my father's modest income would otherwise have justified. At
first we lived on the first floor and rented floors two and three. Much later,
substantially more prosperous, we rented the first floor apartment and lived
on the second and third floors in nine spacious rooms, only a couple of which
mattered to me.

Most mysterious was my parents'  bedroom, which was entirely off limits to me
and to my brothers Eugene and Jonathan. A forbidden zone. Absolutely taboo. I
remember that one time I played some sort of racing or hiding game with one of
my brothers and ventured into the room and -- horror of horrors  -- rumpled my
parents' neat bedspread (the bed was always carefully made). It was as if I had
robbed a bank or bitten Miss Bildersee, our formidable PS 217 principal. I was
severely rebuked and made to swear that I would never commit such an outrageous
transgression again. An overreaction by my parents, I knew even then.

Nevertheless, I used to sneak into the room when the parents were absent. In one
corner hung a picture of my deceased infant sister Susan. Placed on the floor
under the picture, was a child-size chair of wood and rush which was venerated
even more than the connubial bed. A shrine. I'm sure that the taboo against
entering the room was linked to the shrine. Yet to me, the parents' bedroom was
not so much holy as it was weird and strange.

After my mother died in 1978 my father moved downstairs, abandoning shrine, bed
and bedroom. When I visited as an adult, my wife and I would sometimes sleep in
what had formerly been the parents' bed. That was mighty creepy and inhibiting.

Equally important to me but much more pleasant was my father's small but
intensely cultivated backyard garden. He grew roses -- hybrid teas, mostly but
also a floriferous "Blaze" climber. An apple tree, not very prolific, a Bartlett
pear, and a peach tree that was damaged by the hurricane of 1946 and finished
off by borers. There was also a patch of perennial sweet peas, a weigela with
picotee  leaves, and a fragrant mock orange. But the garden was dominated by
Dad's  perfectly tended roses.

In 1948 I was allotted a square foot of space in which I planted a single
pumpkin seed. The plant transgressed its assigned borders --  which amused
me no end -- and the single pumpkin that it produced was prizeworthy huge. In
subsequent years, I was allowed room to plant and study the habits of old-
fashioned annuals: snapdragons, marigolds, zinnias. I saved their seeds over the
winter. I now grow those same plants in their modern, much-improved versions.
But I don't dare to try roses; that will always be Dad's domain.

I think my life would have been very different without the garden.

On the whole, 539 was very good to us. After my father died, it was torn down
and replaced with an undistinguished apartment house rented by families of
Hasids. My very secular father would have been appalled.

Here's a picture of 539 as it appeared in 1940.  The kid's toy in front of the
house probably belonged to my older brother.

Title: Where I Lived (II)
Date: December 12, 2018

Between 1956 and 1961, I lived in five different places in Ithaca, New York:
four bad, one good.

The first was a cinder-block dormitory room, less a home than a cell, which I
shared with a young guy from Virginia who was a not only a smoker but a classic
Southern bigot of a type that's pretty much extinct nowadays. No doubt he's
changed and matured, but our paths have not crossed these last sixty years.
We were both very young, but I was much too young. Childish, when I'm honest
with myself. The following year -- 1957-58 -- I lived in a basement apartment
in a building that was known locally as the "Indian Embassy" because the upper
three floors were all inhabited by men (no women, not a trace of them) from the
subcontinent. The odor of garam masala and turmeric, much more exotic then than
now, regularly drifted into my apartment. I remember that my kitchen, which I
rarely used, was unheated and that it was not unusual to find in midwinter a pot
or pan of water, left in the sink, frozen into a block of ice. If the city of
Ithaca had any zoning laws, and enforced them, the owner of my apartment, Miss
Emily, would have been exiled to Siberia. In my third year in Ithaca I lived in
still another beaten-down house on College Avenue. It was also unfit for adult
habitation but had a functioning kitchen -- it's there that I learned to cook
my own food. In my senior year, I lived in a real apartment -- four bedrooms,
three roommates, including one who has remained a lifelong friend. I should
have noticed, but I didn't, that the fourth floor of an ancient building made
entirely of wood, with no fire escape, was dangerous. It was a firetrap and
although I survived, the building didn't, and was demolished a few years after I
graduated -- and left the southern tier for good.

My favorite residence during the Ithaca years came during the summer of 1961,
when, fleeing graduate school in Cambridge and still attached to Ithaca, we (my
bride and I) sublet a small (very small house -- essentially a single room that
served as both living room and bedroom) -- at 148 Snyder Hill Road. It was my
first experience of living in "the country." There was a cow next door! When I
returned to Ithaca in 1992 for my daughter's graduation from Cornell, my house
had disappeared and the fields were filled with acres of rich suburban homes --
large lots, big lawns, clean, neat and prosperous.

Our 1961 house, though not more than a tumbledown cabin, gave us a good summer
and a good memory.

Some childhood summer residences.

1944: my mother had surgery (I was never informed what sort -- such things were
kept secret in those days -- but I suspect a hysterectomy) and I was sent to
live with my grandmother Sonia, who rented or owned a house near Monticello, New
York. It was a plain wood-shingled house and I believe that Sonia used it as
an informal hotel or b&b. I don't remember much at all except that she tied a
long string to a light bulb over my bed and instructed me to pull it if I needed
help during the night. Help? Though only 5, I considered myself quite self-
sufficient.

1945: my parents rented a summer home on Glen Lake in the Catskills. It was a
house without indoor plumbing. I have a vivid memory of the outhouse, which
frightened me because you could look into the hole and see your and your
parents' deposits. I remember with more pleasure the pump in the kitchen through
which we drew our water. Sometimes I was allowed to prime the pump by pouring
a glass of water down its mouth. In August, the war ended and people who owned
motor boats were zooming around the lake, shouting. I asked my father what was
going on and he said, "the war is over."

1947, 1948, 1949: the best part of my childhood. Three long idyllic summers on
Makamah Beach near Northport, N.Y. I have written about this elsewhere.

378 Broadway in Cambridge, Massachusetts from 1960 to early in 1962. It was a two-family frame house in which the second floor had been turned into two apartments. We were in one of them, a bedroom, a living room with a kitchen and a detached bathroom down the hall. Perfectly fine for a newlywed graduate student. The newlywed neighbors, Adi and Rutty, are still friends; their daughter, Zerlina, born in April of 1961, was the first child I held in my arms (as an adult). But there was a conflict with the puritanical small-town Irish Catholic landlady because we had allowed a friend to stay in the apartment while we were away "and he brought a woman in." So we moved to a university-owned apartment house on Irving Street, between Cambridge and Kirkland, despite the fact that it raised our rent from $90 a month to $105. We bought a second or third or fourth hand bed for $25 and a rug for $10. It was a serviceable apartment that seemed like luxury after the decrepit Ithaca digs. We stayed until the summer of 1965 when we lit out for Manhattan.

Title: Horrors of Hellenism
Date: December 17, 2018

I've been reading about the death of Alexander at the beginning of the
Hellenistic period. It's all new to me, and much of it is fascinating,
especially about cultural matters, but there's also page after page of
difficult-to-retain accounts of warfare and of particular battles. Here's an
example of the kind of material that takes up three-quarters or perhaps even 80%
of the book.

"The two armies faced each other quite conventionally, with the phalanx composed
mostly of Lysimachus' and Cassander's troops confronting Antigonus'  phalanx.
On their right, Seleucus and Lysimachus stationed a vast mass of Seleucus'
 light infantry; on the left was their heavy cavalry commanded by Seleucus'
son Antiochus.  Confronting Antiochus was Demetrius in command of Antigonus'
 heavy cavalry. As the battle commenced, Demetrius and his cavalry charged
Antiochus and drove the enemy cavalry off. Demetrius proceeded to commit the
worst blunder a cavalry leader can commit: he over-pursued, leaving the main
battle well behind, instead of turning to attack the enemy infantry from behind.
As soon as Demetrius had disappeared in the distance, Seleucus brought forward
four hundred war elephants and placed them as a screen between Demetrius and his
path back to the battle. Meanwhile Lysimachus' phalanx came to grips with that
of Antigonus, and Seleucus led his light cavalry in an outflanking maneuver to
attack Antigonus' infantry from behind...."  Etc.

Exactly what is at stake in this war? The historian (Richard Billows, Before and
After Alexander [New York, 2018]) leaves us rather in doubt. He puts no emphasis
on the usual economic or ideological issues; the struggle seems to be entirely
about personalities. Will the kingdom be ruled by Lysimachus or Demetrius, by
Antiochus or Antigonus?  It doesn't seem to matter, either to me or to the
historian.

But what of the soldiers?  Whether on one side or the other, they're likely to
be impaled by the dreaded Macedonian larissa, trampled by horses, or squished by
elephants. For what purpose?

I think that at one point in my life I might have been intrigued by these
dynastic struggles, but now, what I feel most strongly is sympathy for the
ordinary soldier and sorrow for the stupidity of my species.

Title: Written in 2009 and Republished Today, as Relevant Now as Then:  As Time Goes By
Date: December 18, 2018

Two nights ago [this would be October of 2009, of course], I watched the
Phillies trounce the Dodgers, 11-0. What a colossal drubbing! HDTV let me
appreciate Cliff Lee's southpaw masterpiece in exquisite detail. But for me
the most memorable moment of the evening wasn't Lee's artistry or 270-pound
Ryan Howard's mad-dash triple to right. Instead, it was the discovery that
the Phillies'  lanky, awkward-but-effective scraggly-bearded right fielder
Jayson Werth sports a noteworthy baseball pedigree. His grandfather was Ducky
Schofield, a good-field no-hit infielder from the 1950s -- from the days,
that is, of my golden youth. Holy jumping jiminy! I saw this young feller's
grandpappy play!

Youch!  More evidence, as if more were needed, of my long-in-the-toothedness.

Why should I be surprised?  I went to my first baseball game in 1946 (at Ebbets
Field -- Cardinals 3, Dodgers 1).  Before there was TV. I've been attending
to the game for 63 years. Close to three generations.  [Nine more years have
passed since I first wrote this;  so 72 years now.]

I've grown accustomed to father-son combos. Bobby and Barry; the Griffeys (who
once played together in the same outfield); Felipe and Moises; huge Cecil
Fielder and his even more enormous son, Prince; the Hundleys, the Stottlemyres,
and many, many others. Sometimes while I'm watching a game I lose track of time.
Eric Young, Jr. looks and runs so exactly like his father that it's easy to
fall into flashback mode. I remember a game in which Pedro Borbon came in to
relieve. Holy moly, I said to myself -- he's a right-handed pitcher. Why the
heck is he throwing with his left hand?  Then after a few seconds of complete
bafflement it came to me: Pedro Borbon, Jr. I had simply lost twenty-five years
-- a phenomenon to which your "mature" brain is occasionally and increasingly
prone.

Jayson Werth isn't even the sole grandson. Aaron Boone's father was the catcher
(and manager) Bob Boone and his grandfather was the Cleveland infielder Ray
Boone, whom I also saw play, but only on the TV. And then there's the Bell
family: grandsons David and Mike, father Buddy, and grandfather Gus, a big
hitter with Cincinnati during the Ducky Schofield years.

So here's the question. Will I hang around long enough to watch the great-
grandsons play? Is Jayson Werth fertile?  Does he have any kids?  Are there
any budding Boones or baby Bells waiting in the wings?

Title: Debra Paget Then and Now  -- Broken Arrow (1950)
Date: December 25, 2018

In 1951, when Broken Arrow hit the Leader Theater on Coney Island Avenue, I
was just an ungrown twelve-year-old. I wasn't an assiduous movie-goer because
weekends were for basketball and softball, but when I did invest my 14 cents
in a matinee, it was for a Western  -- not for a soppy musical or scary crime
film. Last night, for the first time in 67 years, I watched Broken Arrow again.
I imagined that I would remember it clearly.

Hold on, let me be scrupulously honest here. I didn't pretend that I would
remember the entirety of the film, not even the plot. I knew only that
Sanseearah, the Indian Maiden "Morningstar" as portrayed by Debra Paget, was
incised into the deep fabric of my brain. She, Debra that is, might have been my
greatest crush or first true love. And why shouldn't she have been? Just direct
your admiring gaze to the still above. Miss Paget was young, lovely, exotic as
all get out, and yielding. I admit with chagrin that I didn't fully understand
what got me so het up about her in 1951, but het up I was.

But all is changed, now, almost three generations later. What was "hot" and
romantic then seems more than a little creepy now. Debra Paget (or DebraLee
Griffin, of Denver, Colorado) was only sixteen years old when the film was
shot. Sixteen! Moreover, she plays younger. In fact, the film devotes several
long scenes to Morningstar's  puberty rites -- so perhaps she's imagined to be
thirteen. (The head dress that she wears in the picture below as well as the
rest of the ceremony, was, I am sure, what is now called "fakelore.")

Look at her. The poor dear is barely out of childhood. Mr. Stewart (James
Stewart, her graying white mountain-man suitor) was forty-two years old, and
looks every bit of it. How can we, how did we, not notice the age difference?
Why is he attracted by a child?  I tried hard to suspend disbelief, but my
powers of suspension are not infinite. The film, I'm sorry to say, teeters into
unsavory child-molesting territory.

My pre-adolescent fascination with the film has now been altered, dampened and
dispatched.

It's a shame, too, because Broken Arrow was a self-consciously progressive
film in which the Apaches were figured not as brutal savages but as human
beings. It deserves high praise for its groundbreaking stance. The film was
written by the leftist Albert Maltz, of Brooklyn, New York, who was one of the
Hollywood Ten, and who, on the day I saw Broken Arrow for the first time, was
in jail serving a one-year sentence for refusing to cooperate with the runaway
House Un-American Activities Committee.

I therefore wish that the film hadn't been compromised by the March-October love
affair. And that Albert Maltz hadn't side-stepped the real difficulties of an
interracial marriage in the 1880s by allowing Dear Debra to be murdered.

And while I'm wishing, I wish also that the authorities at Twentieth-Century
Fox hadn't insisted that the two most important Apache roles be played not
by Apaches but by whites. Debra Paget is the one lead, while Cochise, the
Apache chief, was played in redface by Jeff Chandler, formerly Ira Grossel, a
graduate of Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn, New York. It's not as though
more appropriate actors weren't available. In fact, the character of Geronimo,
who has one brief speech, was played by an uncredited Jay Silverheels, an
accomplished actor of Cayuga and Mohawk heritage.

But would we, in 1951, have been able to empathize with real Apaches, genuine
Apaches, rather than with familiar faces in heavy makeup? Or would such Indians
have been, even for liberals, too "other," too foreign?

Title: The Precious Gift of Atheism
Date: January 04, 2019

Although my parents were pure and perfect atheists, they did not advertise their
atheism or disparage the religions of others -- at least not in my hearing.
They were exactly the opposite of what is sometimes called "militant atheists."
To be militant would have been to give religion too much regard, too much
importance -- and they wouldn't have bothered. To the best of my recollection,
they were utterly indifferent. In our house, it was as if theology and worship
had never been invented, practiced, or pondered. While my parents didn't enforce
or evangelize their views upon their children, their unconcern, their lack
of interest, was eloquence enough. Of course my brothers and I grew up to be
atheists, and have remained so. Peaceful and positive atheists.

My parents were both readers. Every Tuesday my mother trundled over to the
McDonald Avenue branch of the Brooklyn Public Library and trucked home a
shopping basket full of books. There were volumes of all kinds -- mostly fiction
and mysteries for my mother and, for my curiosity-driven father, politics, law,
science, history, art, and of course, gardening. But I never saw a book on
religion. Not a one. In their bookshelves at home, I remember only one volume
that might have touched on the subject. It was a collection of essays by the
Freethinker Robert Ingersoll.

I was young boy, perhaps 10 or 11, when I overheard some friend or acquaintance
of my mother say something to her about prayer, or putting faith in the lord,
or some such platitude. She waited politely until the person departed and
then turned to me and murmured, quietly, "Well, I suppose some people need a
crutch."  I think that's the sum of all I ever heard from her on the subject of
religion. One might think that the dismissive term "crutch" hinted at disdain
or superiority (they need crutches but we don't) but it was not so. My mother's
observation was made without prejudice or judgment.

Where other households might have worshiped or wondered or discussed, for us
there was absolutely nothing. Religious education?  None, not a drop. In our
home, there was no attendance at temple, mosque or tabernacle, no religious
ceremonies, and not even a Bible. I can remember my father and me dribbling
our basketball to the schoolyard to shoot some hoops. When we passed the local
orthodox synagogue, my father said, "Bingo.They play bingo in there." But he was
not condemning the religion. It was the gambling. He disapproved of gambling
(even Bingo) and the idea that a religious institution would allow gambling
every Tuesday night offended him deeply.

When I was a questioning adolescent, out of a spirit of curiosity and perhaps
rebellion, I liberated a bible from our local public library and secreted it
under my treasured collection of Mad magazines. While others of my age cohort
were squinting at smuggled Playboys or at The Amboy Dukes under the blankets by
flashlight, I was acquainting myself with the holy scriptures. In my ignorance,
I thought of the bible as a forbidden book, one which my parents would have
disapproved. But I was wrong. They wouldn't have noticed; they wouldn't have
cared. Looking back, I'm sure that they knew about my thirst for forbidden
knowledge and probably enjoyed a giggle at my expense. Many years later, when
my father was a widower, I gave him a copy of an annotated, edited Bible that I
used as a textbook in one of my literature courses. Did he disapprove?  Not at
all. He said, "It's interesting."  But of course he read it not as an inspired
text but as history and as fiction.

To have been raised in such a household was my good fortune. My atheism was an
unearned gift. I got it free, and I'm perpetually grateful. Many of my friends,
growing up in religious families, have struggled to achieve atheism -- often
with painful inner conflicts and anger and resentments. I admire them for the
strength to break free -- especially those that live with irreparable breaches
to the family. I endured no such struggle.

Philosophically speaking, it's been an easy life. There's a clarity about
atheism. It's based in reality, not (dare I say what my parents wouldn't!)
in wish and myth and superstition. Atheists, I think, are afforded a purer
appreciation of human achievement and a clearer, less conflicted understanding
of health, disease, and death. Reason and the evidence of the senses may not
always lead to perfect understanding, but they're the best tools that we have,
and we must cherish them.

From 1973 until 2009, this was the place. My longest stay in one location and
the childhood home of my children. The house had good bones, as they say, when
we arrived and was well worth the $46,500 that we paid for it. But the innards
had been remodeled into oblivion. Green shag carpet covering the lovely oak
floors; slick craftsman woodwork covered with white paint; stained-glass window
replaced and disfigured with a beaded curtain in the style of a New Orleans
whorehouse; flocked wall paper; some sort of plastic substance glued onto the
pine kitchen floor; and a kitchen untouched since 1917 and hopelessly out of
date. It took years to get it into shape, but by the time we left, it was
looking mighty fine. I was sad to leave but the time had come to move on.

I still miss the colorful spring garden, stocked with peonies both herbaceous
and tree, day lilies, irises, a lovely weigela, and a wall of clematis.

Dear Talia, Oliver, Ella, Lola, Luke, Caleb, and Asher:

Here's a picture of your great grandmother, Anne Krull Goss (1912-2009) with her
siblings.

Anne is the pretty young blonde woman, second from the left. She's the oldest.

The picture was taken during the World War II years, '42 or '43. On great
grandma's right is her brother Jack, whose tank was hit by cannon fire. He
was the only survivor of his crew and spent many months recuperating in an
army hospital. On her left is Hy, who was exempted from service, if I remember
correctly, because his business was declared an essential industry. On Hy's
left is your great-great aunt Frieda. Frieda's fiance (a soldier who was named
Aubrey, but I don't know anything else about him) was killed in Europe. On
Frieda's left is Mendy, the youngest, who was a bombardier on a B-24.

The war disrupted many lives, not only those who served but those who stayed at
home.

I've been lucky -- too young for Korea and too old for Vietnam. I hope you are
similarly lucky.  Better than that --  I hope these endless wars in which
we're engaged (in Afghanistan and Syria right now) come to an end.

Grandma Anne contributed 1/8 of your genetic inheritance. The people depicted
here might seem to come from the remote past, but be aware that they're in you,
part of you.

Title: Missing Megafauna
Date: January 12, 2019

Many years ago, sometime during the previous millennium, I was taken to an
African game park -- elephants, rhinoceroses, giraffes, and lions (the hippos
were AWOL). It was astonishing to see these huge beasts. I didn't realize at
the time that it was semi-miraculous that these creatures had survived to our
day, even in a de facto zoo, when so many other massive animals had recently
gone extinct. When homo sapiens arrived on the scene, say 50,000 years ago,
there were many animals that would have made a zoo park several orders of
magnitude more remarkable that the one I visited. Why did these beasts go
extinct?  Disease, habitat change, and competition are likely culprits but it's
hard to deny that our predatory ancestors must take some of the blame.

Yes, the game park had lions, but it would have been infinitely more exciting if
it housed not only the African lion, but the European lion which was half again
as large and which survived lately enough to be well known to the Greeks.

Other big cats were also missing: the famous saber tooth, everyone's nightmare,
as well as the American false cheetah, a cheetah-like cougar weighing 190
formidable pounds. I would also have liked to see the thylacine, the so-called
"marsupial lion" or sometimes "Tasmanian tiger" which survived until 1936, late
enough to be photographed.

I would also have liked to see a cackle of European hyenas. Even more, the two-
ton short-faced Bear, with whom our paleolithic ancestors competed, which was
three times the size of a modern polar bear. The equally large ground sloth,
even the bones of which are impressive.

And the sloth lemur, the size of a big male gorilla. The Irish deer, as big as a
moose, with an outsized, out-of-proportion rack. Then there were the elephant-
like animals: the Columbian mammoth of the American southwest, smaller than its
modern African cousin, but with astonishingly curved tusks. The wooly mammoth,
surviving until just 3700 years ago on Wrangel Island off the Siberian coast.
The straight-tusked elephant, two or three times the size of modern African
elephant. The North American mammoths. And also Cuvier's gompothere, which looks
like an elephant but isn't one, but which was seven feet tall at the shoulder
and which lasted until about 14,000 years ago:

And along with them, the morningstar-tailed glyptodon, a five thousand pound
armadillo:

I would have loved to cast my eye on the diprotodont, the largest known
marsupial, which weighed in at three tons and lived until 45,000 years ago

The wooly rhinoceros, as large as a diprotodont. The sivathere, an odd-looking
 giraffid. The tree kangaroo. The short-faced kangaroo, three times the size of
any living kangaroo.

And right there in Vermont, rustling and stomping in the forest, were the stag
moose and Jefferson's ground sloth and the long-nosed peccary and Harlan's musk
ox and the Vero tapir and the giant beaver, all recently gone. (You wouldn't
have wanted to come face-to-face with a giant beaver. Or swim in its pond, if
it made ponds. You'd be better off listening to it slapping its tail in a game
 park.)

And then there were some true avian oddities worth taking a gander at: the
flightless moas of New Zealand, the female at 440 pounds, two-and-half times the
size of the male. The cursorial owl, a three-foot tall flightless owl, which
pursued its prey afoot. Haast's eagle, with a wingspread of seven and a half
feet. The five hundred pound Elephant Bird, which survived in Madagascar until
a thousand years ago.

And then the tarpan, the warrah, the toxodon. Strangest of all, macrauchenia,
a three-toed ungulate not closely related to anything alive today, which looked
something like a humpless camel with a droopy snout and which was around until
about 10,000 years ago.

It would have been quite a show if these animals had survived. Well worth the
price of admission.

Title: Durocher 1947
Date: January 25, 2019

In 1975, Leo Durocher wrote an as-told-to autobiography called Nice Guys Finish
Last. I read every word of it, but I got to tell you, it's not a good book.
It's a piece of self-justifying pro-Durocher propaganda. It's argumentative,
hyperbolic, unreliable. Durocher was an irascible man: he got into fights
with sportswriters, players, umpires, owners, coaches, wives -- everyone he
encountered. In every single case, he was absolutely blameless and they were
absolutely wrong. The gambling that got him suspended for a year? -- why, it
never happened.

Durocher doesn't give it the emphasis it deserves, but he had, by accident, a
place in the story. Durocher was manager of the Dodgers when Branch Rickey hired
Jackie Robinson. It was a watershed moment, a supremely important step in the
civil rights movement, and the beginning of a major transformation of not just
baseball, or sports, but of the nation and the world.

Durocher played his part, and he's proud of it, but I can't help feeling that
he missed his moment. His vision was so narrow, so constricted, so unaware. I
suppose he should be commended for doing the right thing, but as far as I can
tell, he did it for trivial reasons and did not have a glimmer of understanding
of either oppression and injustice on the one hand, or equality and freedom on
the other.

When some Dodgers proposed to petition Rickey not to sign Robinson, Durocher
called a team meeting. Here's what he says that he said to them:

"I hear some of you fellows don't want to play with Robinson and that you have
 a petition drawn up that you are going to sign. Well boys, you know what you
can do with that petition. You can wipe your ass with it. Mr. Rickey is on his
way down here and all you have to do is tell him about it. I'm sure he'll be
happy to make other arrangements for you. I hear Dixie Walker is going to send
Mr. Rickey a letter asking to be traded. Just hand him the letter, Dixie, and
your'e gone. Gone. If this fellow is good enough to play on this ball club --
and from what I've seen and heard, he is -- he is going to play on this ball
club and he is going to play for me. I'm the manager of this ball club and I'm
interested in one thing. Winning. I'll play an elephant if he can do the job,
and to make room for him I'll send my own brother home. So make up your mind to
it. This fellow is a real great ballplayer. He's going to win pennants for us.
He's going to put money in your pockets and money in mine. And here's something
else to think about when you put your head back on the pillow. From everything
I hear, he's only the first. Only the first, boys. There's many more coming
right behind him and they have the talent and they're gonna come to play. These
fellows are hungry. They're good athletes and there's nowhere else they can
make this kind of money. They're going to come, boys, and they're going to come
scratching and diving. Unless you fellows look out and wake up, they're going to
run you right out of the ball park. So I don't want to see your petition and I
don't want to hear anything more about it. The meeting is over. Go back to bed."

To me, his speech, though apparently effective, is trivial -- an opportunity
wasted. He opposed the petition for three reasons: one, it defied authority
(his and Rickey's); two, Robinson is going to help us win and therefore make us
money, and three, there are "others" on the way, who also want to make money, so
get out of the way.

The idea that Jack Roosevelt Robinson and others of his hue should be allowed
to participate out of simple fairness and equity did not occur to him. Slavery,
racism, segregation, justice, equal opportunity -- not part of his thinking.
Durocher's awareness of his place in history -- zero. What a disappointment!

Title: Wisdom
Date: January 25, 2019

I've reached the age when, neuroscience claims, the "wisdom centers" of the
brain (the anterior cingulate and ventromedial prefrontal cortices) are supposed
to leap into action. Do they? Tell truth, I don't know. Have I, without
awareness or drama, metamorphosed from a jejune larva, dull as dishwater, into
a butterfly of wisdom? When did it happen? At this moment or writing, I confess
that I feel less wise than tired.

Nevertheless, let me offer, with maximum diffidence, a few homemade aphorisms
and sententiae. Whether they amount to wisdom, and whether they do credit to my
anterior or prefrontal lobes, my loyal readers will have to decide.

A) "Nothing ever happens until it happens." This proverb is slightly gnomic, so
let me gloss. If you assume that just because you've carefully planned your trip
to Tahiti or your visit to the new restaurant or even your outing to the local
barbershop that it's going to happen, you might be in for disappointment. Wait
until you're there before you get excited. There's many a slip twixt the cup and
the lip. Rejoice appropriately -- when it's time. By doing so, you avoid elation
deflation.

B) "No one knows what's going on between two people, even if you're one of
them."  I think this proverb is eminently self-explanatory. It applies mostly
to marriage but equally so to all dyadic relationships. Even between you and
your dog.

C)  "The only people who idealize the past are those that know nothing about
it."  Slavery, plague, torture, injustice, famine, rapine, brutality, poverty,
starvation. Etc.

D) "You're immortal until the day you die." Of course you are and don't let the
nay-sayers and "realists" bother you.

E)  "Religion: my Prince of Peace can beat up your Prince of Peace." Tribalism
sucks.

F)  "Enough is as good as a feast, and often better." Figurative meaning: a
modest sufficiency is all that is needed for a happy life. Literal meaning: one
hamburger (or half a hamburger) lies more easily on the stomach than two or
three. And hold the fries.

G)  "The secret of life is to turn routines into rituals."  Self-explanatory,
I think. Make a fuss about that glass of wine at four o'clock. Savor it.

H)  "The longer something has been believed by mankind, the less likely it is
to be true."  See C above.

Title: An Unpleasant Cortelyou Road Memory
Date: January 27, 2019

Let's say I was thirteen, so this event would have occurred on or our about
1952. I had brought my Raleigh 3-speed to the Cortelyou Road bicycle repair shop
which was between East 13th and East 14th. The shop was run by a small, fair,
heavily-accented German man who was perhaps 50 years old. He was assisted by his
father, an older and smaller, wizened, bald man who must have been in his 80s.
Mr. Hart and Mr. Hart.The older Mr. Hart, whom in my adolescent wisdom I thought
of as a gnome, was working on my bike -- replacing an inner tube or adjusting
the gears (which were fragile and frequently busted). A group of three middle-
aged women gathered on the sidewalk in front of the shop, chatting. Mr. Hart the
elder, the gnome, didn't like it. He looked up from his work and muttered to me,
"A real hen-party."  A few minutes later, he said, as if he owned the sidewalk,
"they're still there. Hen party."

I had never heard the expression "hen party" but I knew it was a slur. A piece
of anti-woman bigotry. I mean, what was the problem with three women talking on
a public street?

But what disturbed me was that Mr. Hart took it for granted that I was on his
side -- that we were linked by our maleness, our roosterness, against hens.
I knew (in language that did not at that point exist), that I was being "co-
opted."  But although I was uneasy, I was able to offer only silent resistance.
I failed. Later I learned to challenge such mini-bigotries but at this point in
life I was much too young, too unsure.

Of all the events that occurred in 1952, this trivial encounter is one that
clings and needs to be exorcised.

But it is such experiences that shape us. As David Copperfield says, "Trifles
make the sum of life."

Title: Street Talk
Date: January 29, 2019

On East 9th Street, and probably in other parts of Brooklyn, a manhole cover
was called a "sewer." I don't know why. Ignorance, perhaps. As far as I know,
manhole covers provided entrance to electrical work and other utilities, not to
watercourses. Openings to the sewers that were located along the channel next
to the curb were also called sewers. A sewer was also a unit of distance. "He
can hit a spaldeen three sewers." It was not a scientifically accurate form of
measurement.

A "gutter" is in most parts of the country a channel for water. On East 9th
Street, the word "gutter" referred to the street's entire asphalted area, not
just the area near the curb. "Hey, kids, keep out of the gutter. You'll get
hurt."

"Stoop" referred to the stairs leading up to the porch. In "stoop ball," you
throw your spaldeen at the stoop and catch it on the rebound.  Five points for
a grounder, ten points for a fly ball, twenty points for a "pointer."

I don't think there was a specific name for what is here called the "park front
area"-- the space between the sidewalk and the curb.  Nor a word for "curb
cut." which was considered, linguistically, as a section of a driveway.

East 9th Street had a wonderful tree canopy. In retrospect, I can identify and
recall a very large sycamore and a series of Norway maples, but the only trees
that had names were a trio of huge old elms which were called "Mickey's trees."
I have no idea why they were so called nor do I know who was this Mickey of
famous memory. The elms were cut down in the late 40s (Dutch elm disease) --  a
tremendous loss to East 9th Street.

Title: Man of the West (1958)
Date: January 30, 2019

Judging by its almost-allegorical title, Man of the West claims, or seems
to claim, that Link Jones, its conflicted protagonist, represents something
fundamental and archetypical about the American western experience. And indeed
it does, if Mr. Jones, played by rugged stalwart Gary Cooper, is to be judged by
his exceedingly laconic manner, his resourcefulness, his fundamental decency,
his initial aversion to gun play and ultimate resort to violence.

But in my opinion the title Man of the West is misleading. Man of the West
is a noir in chaps and ten-gallon hat. Its western-ness is superficial. It's
noirness is essential and real.

Here's what we've got: a reformed criminal trying to go straight who can't
escape his past; a crazed egomaniacal gang leader (played here by Lee J. Cobb
but James Cagney would have been a better choice); a dance hall singer who's
been mistreated by a succession of men even though she's got a good heart; a
bank robbery that goes south and gang members who turn upon each other. No
cowboys, no Indians, no horses, no cavalry. Not even a rattlesnake curling
around the heroine's shoe who is shot by our hero. Scares her temporarily, but
she's grateful.

The film was written by Reginald Rose of Twelve Angry Men fame; it was directed
by Anthony Mann (Side Street). Take away the cowboy hats and substitute fedoras
and you could call it Man of the East.

Title: Two Films Written by Lenore J. Coffee
Date: February 06, 2019

Lenore Coffee, born in 1897, wrote 50 or more silent films and any number of
studio productions in the 30s, 40s and 50s. Her most notable achievement at
Warner Brothers was the Oscar-nominated screenplay for Four Daughters, co-
written with Julius J. Epstein in 1938. Epstein, with his twin brother Philip
and Howard Koch, wrote Casablanca. Four Daughters is not on Netflix and not
conveniently available, but I'll continue to search.

In 1951, Coffee wrote Lightning Strikes Twice, directed by King Vidor
and starring Ruth Roman and Richard Todd. In 1952, she authored Sudden
Fear, directed by David Miller, which won both Joan Crawford and Jack Palance
Oscar nominations. Both films are well worth watching

Lightning Strikes Twice starts out as though it will center on Richard Trevelyan
(Richard Todd), who has just been released from prison after a jury failed
to convict him for the murder of his then wife, one juror dissenting. But it
rapidly becomes Shelley Carnes' (Ruth Roman) movie. It's refreshing to see a
film in which a strong woman shows "agency" but I have to admit that it is a
little disappointing when she falls under the romantic spell of Richard Todd,
who is supposed to be charismatic and sexual but who to me is an unappealing
block of wood. Trevelyan's guilt or innocence is the nominal subject but
the film focuses on the struggle between two women (Ruth Roman and Mercedes
McCambridge) who seek his affection. It's a noir-y melodrama with a startling
conclusion.

Sudden Fear is the stronger of the two films. Once again, a conflict between
two women: Joan Crawford, a rich successful playwright, and Gloria Grahame, an
on- the-make unscrupulous hoyden. This time the hypotenuse of their triangle
is Jack Palance, who is more expressive than Richard Todd could ever be, and a
heck of a lot scarier. Joan Crawford has some fine moments: when she realizes
that she's been duped by a gold-digging husband who plans to murder her, she
registers terror, thoughtfulness, resistance and finally resolve using only her
eyes. Unfortunately her intricate plan to save herself goes awry. There are some
unanticipated and surprising twists in the complicated plot.

My guess is that the censors intervened between the author's original conception
and the eventual portrayal, in which Palance and Grahame are disposed of in such
a way that Crawford is left without responsibility and without guilt. I would
have been much more satisfied if Coffee had let Crawford kill her antagonists
with that neat little silver revolver. Revenge would have been all the sweeter.

the Brooklyn  Baseball Club and examines the teeth of each and every player
on the club.  Seems that Business Manager Larry McPhail is fussy about it and
insists on x-rays at least once each year. As far as McAteer is concerned,
infielder Cookie Lavagetto has a perfect set of teeth, while good ones are owned
by pitcher Van Mungo and infielder Johnny Hudson."

So now we know. Cookie Lavagetto had perfect teeth! What a revelation.
Information that has been hidden for 80 years. Everyone knows that Lavagetto
broke up Bill Bevan's 1947 World Series no-hitter with a double off the Ebbets
Field scoreboard. But who knew a damn thing about his choppers?  This is
neglected news of historic proportions.

And it makes a guy wonder about the other players on the team (aside from those
with semi-perfect teeth -- the legendary Van Lingle Mungo and unknown-to-me
Johnny Hudson). Were other Dodger teeth cavity-filled, crooked, misshapen,
stained with tobacco juice, busted, false, even missing. No wonder the '39
Dodgers were so bad. Twenty-five players and only three to write home about,
teeth-wise.

So here they are, the fabulous teeth of Cookie Lavagetto, bright and shiny,
glistening at us over the years (I'm sorry but I couldn't find a picture of
Cookie's molars).

Title: Inferior and Superior Street Names
Date: February 13, 2019

Among its other attractions. New Orleans (where I happen to be at this moment
of writing) is a city blessed with street and avenue names that are both
unusual, particular to the city, and glorious: Basin, Burgundy (accent on
the gund), Calliope (three syllables), Desire, Dryades, Felicity, Frenchmen,
Poydras, Prytania, Rampart, and of course Tchoupitoulas. Just a few to get the
conversation started.

These names are elegant. No wonder I suffer from a desperate inferiority complex
concerning the names of the streets on which I've lived. East 9th Street, West
91 Street, 9th Street, 10th Street. Designations without character -- gray and
boring. No resonance, no power. Bland.

Of course it hasn't been all bad: I once lived for a transitory summer (1961) on
Snyder Hill Road -- a semi-poetic name that gestures at rurality.

I knew a guy who was raised on Old Oaken Bucket Road. I was initially dazzled
-- until I learned that his neighbors had petitioned the city for a name change
-- his street had formerly been called Third Avenue or Smith Road or something
of that ilk. So it was not a real name -- it was pseudo-historical kitsch. What
suburban pretension! What a comedown! I'd have blushed with embarrassment if
I had to admit that I lived on Old Oaken Bucket Road. It's almost as bad as
Christmas Tree Drive (a real street in Boulder, Colorado, to the everlasting
disgrace, nomenclature-wise, of our city).

But now in this latter end of my life, I've achieved onomastic eminence. For
half the year I live on Walnut Street, a name that is the epitome of small city
authenticity (though it would be slightly better if there were an actual walnut
tree anywhere nearby). And of summers I'm at Hackett Hill Road, which is just
perfectly titled, and even more perfect because there are numerous Hacketts in
our local cemetery and because, fifty years ago, I met aged Edna Hackett, the
last survivor of the family that gave its name to hill and road.

Title: Another Film Written by Lenore J. Coffee
Date: March 06, 2019

It's hard to say how much of The Great Lie (1939) is original to its
screenwriter Lenore J. Coffee. In the first place, the film is adapted from a
novel, and secondly, at least according to the story, its stars Bette Davis
and Mary Astor were unhappy with the screenplay and rewrote much of it. But
how much? Nevertheless, in The Great Lie, as in Sudden Fear  and Lightning
Strikes Twice, two other films written by Coffee, the heart of the matter is a
head-to- head struggle between two strong women. In this film it's Sandra, (Mary
Astor) and Maggie (Bette Davis) who go to the mat about first, a husband, who
is apparently married to both of them (don't ask!) and then, a baby boy. Maggie
(Bette) winds up with both husband and child, but it's touch and go for most of
the film. I wish I could say that Coffee's dialog was brilliant, but not so.
It's a serviceable, competent screenplay. George Brent, playboy and drunkard,
isn't nearly as desirable a husband and father as the film asks us to believe.
Not much of an actor, either.

Mary Astor won an Oscar and well-deserved it; she steals the show. It's ironic,
and it may be significant, that Mary Astor herself had been involved in a child-
custody case several years before this film was made.

The music (by Max Steiner) is noteworthy -- mood-appropriate variations on
themes from Tchaikovsky's first piano concerto.

Hattie McDaniel does as much with the stereotypical "colored" maid as an actress
could be expected to do, but her scenes are still painful and embarrassing to
watch.

Title: Amnesia on Film: Dead Again (1991)
Date: March 13, 2019

Usually the amnesia is the hardest bit to swallow. The amnesia in Dead Again is
particularly unpalatable, because Emma Thompson shows up at a Catholic orphanage
without any memory nor with any ability to speak. No explanation is ever offered
for her disease, not a grain. No cracking the skull, no mysterious drugs, no
trauma, nothing. Just a little all-purpose Hollywood-style amnesia to get the
plot rolling.

But spontaneous amnesia slides down the esophagus rather easily compared to
hypnotically-induced past-life regression, huge trenchers of which we're
expected to bolt and guzzle. I couldn't do it and the film became ridiculous
and ridiculously baroque, gimmicky, inhuman. A waste of Kenneth Branagh's
extraordinary talent. And the music --portentous, dictatorial, distracting.

I saw this movie when it first appeared, in 1991, and liked it. What was I
thinking?  My salad days, when I was green in judgment.

Title: The Toaster
Date: March 15, 2019

When I downsized into my present residence in 2009, a few essential items
disappeared, among them a venerable but excellent toaster. I did not replace it
because I was distracted by more pressing matters. I went toasterless for almost
five years.

Later, when I entered into a tentative new relationship, toasterlessness became
a matter of concern. Toast was an essential item in the diet of my new lady
friend. For a while, before she began to spend nights with me, she would daily
transport in bag or backpack -- along with toiletries and toothbrush and changes
of undergarments -- her glamorous red enamel Cuisinart toaster.

That this arrangement was comic became immediately apparent. No one can carry a
toaster from one home to another day after day without feeling the irony.

As our relationship solidified, it became clear that something had to be done,
toasterwise. And so we came to realize that it was time to progress to a stable
two-toaster situation.

The Cuisinart went back to its original home and off we went to McGuckin's
Hardware. There we acquired a Proctor Silex, with which we have lived until a
short while ago.

I don't want to badmouth the Proctor Silex, but let's face it, it's a cheap
lightweight contraption with too much plastic and a tendency to leak crumbs
over the counter. A paucity of knobs and controls. It's an entry-level toaster,
a "starter toaster." A provisional toaster that lacked the dignity that our
maturing connection demanded.

So yesterday, at Peppercorn on the semi-famous Boulder Mall, we purchased a
superior toaster -- a highly-recommended, weighty and substantial Breville two-
slicer equipped with "Lift and Lock" and other bells and whistles (which we
will no doubt some day master), the upper grill of which is inscribed with the
comforting motto, "BAGELS FACE INWARDS." A toaster of heft and permanence. It's
sitting proudly on the counter now.

Moreover, we purchased it with our new joint credit card.

Title: Blood Test
Date: March 17, 2019

I cooled my heels for more than an hour waiting for a "blood draw." Why so long?
There was no long line of people ahead of me. Was it simply that the department
was understaffed? That they all went out for ice cream? Or were the blood-
collectors, the vampires, gossiping and lazing about behind the curtain?

I was miffed.

But it wasn't long before I transitioned from passive miff to active glare. Now,
"glaring" is a powerful, if ineffective, way to deal with such inconveniences. I
think that my powerglare was beginning to get the attention of the poor schlub
sitting at the desk pretending to ignore me.

But let me confess that there's a danger inherent in the glare, because if your
lower lip quivers ever so slightly, you're no longer glaring, you're pouting.
Of course I didn't want to be seen as a pouter. So I concentrated all my energy
into my glare. I think I had it under control, but after a while, without making
a conscious decision to do so, I escalated from glaring to seething.

The seethe is more difficult to express than the glare. You can glare with just
your eyes, but you have to put your whole body into the seethe. For proper
seething, you have to cross your arms and hunch over. And once you're in that
posture, you can then begin to move from seething to simmering. But you must be
careful not to be perceived as sulking.

And then on to fuming. Fuming is very like seething and simmering -- the same
hunched body posture -- but accompanied with heavy breathing and an occasional,
intermittent through-the-teeth hiss. You've got to make sure that your hiss is a
true angry hiss and not a pathetic sniffle.

From fuming it was only a short step to boiling, which came at about the 55
minute mark.

Good thing my name was called on the hour, because I was just about to blow my
top.

Title: The State of Ornithology in the Seventeenth Century
Date: March 26, 2019

I've just read Tim Birkhead's biography of The Wonderful Mr Willoughby, The
First True Ornithologist (London, 2018). Birkhead's thesis is that Francis
Willoughby was not merely a bird watcher, but an innovative, diligent, and
imaginative scientist, the founder of a new area of knowledge.

Ornithology when Willoughby (1635 –1672) started to look at birds was
astonishingly primitive. For example, students did not even agree that birds
migrated. Perhaps, as Aristotle had suggested, they hid in holes during the
winter. Perhaps they transmuted from a species that departed to a species that
arrived. With no observers in southern lands and no rapid communication, it's
not surprising that it was hard to imagine that birds flew south in the fall and
returned in the spring. Even now, when all is revealed, migration still seems,
at least to me, to be mysterious, miraculous, and wondrously improbable.

Before the "new philosophy put all in doubt," the assumption that governed all
"science" was that the natural world should be studied for evidence of divine
wisdom -- a practice which blinkered understanding and limited speculation.
The questions that people asked about birds were therefore not particularly
challenging. They asked which ones were good to eat, which ones could be kept in
cages, and which ones had medicinal value.

The first task of new ornithology was simply to take a census. What birds live
here, by what names are they called, and how should they be classified?  In the
non-standardized late medieval world, most birds bore regional or demotic names,
and sometimes the same name was attached two or more species of birds. It took
a while before the ars-foot came to be recognized and conventionalized as the
great-crested grebe and to earn the official designation Podiceps cristatus. It
was the same with the such regionally-named birds as the annet, bald buzzard,
the Bohemian chatterer, the copped douker, the coulterneb, the didapper, the
dun-diver, the fern-owl, the flusher, the gid, the glead, the gorcock, the ox-
eye, the pickmire, the puit, the puttock, the pyrag, the rock ouzel, the scarf,
the skout, and the witwall?  It remained to be demonstrated that the "yarwhelp"
"was in fact the East Anglian name for the bar-tailed godwit and was to be
distinguished from the similar black-tailed godwit." That the sea-pie was an
oystercatcher. That the elegug was a guillemot. "The sea-swallows they there (on
Caldey Island) call spurs, and the razor-bills are called elegugus.... This name
elelgug some attribute to the puffin, and some to the guillem[ot];  indeed they
know not what they mean by this name." Nomenclature was a thicket.

Willoughby was an energetic surveyor and classifier. But as he became more
familiar with bird life, he started to ask questions of genuine scientific
interest. What is the function of the tomial tooth? Do all birds of the same
species have the same color iris? How many birds have rictal bristles? Do birds
who lay two eggs produce one male and one female? Do female birds ever have two
ovaries and two oviducts? Can birds hold on to their eggs at will, or are they
laid involuntarily? How do birds survive the cold of winter? Why do birds molt?

While these are not necessarily the questions of a modern ornithologist, they
certainly represent a new beginning. Many thanks to Birkhead for bringing
Willoughby to our attention.

How sad that the first true ornithologist died at age thirty-six.

Title: Book Report: The End of Innocence
Date: March 31, 2019

I don't read much fiction, but when I do, it's usually one of the 19th-century
classics. However, the "international bestseller" The End of Innocence (2016)
by Benedict Wells came highly recommended, so I gave it a shot. It's pretty
good, not bad, not great, and certainly a novel for today and not for all time
-- not even for the next decade. It's thin, simple.

Egomaniac that I am, I was less interested in the novel itself than I was in
my own reaction to it, which was, in a couple of words, both resistant and
resentful.

Why the hostility,  I ask myself?

In the first place, it's a novel without any sense of style. Perhaps it's the
translator's fault, but gosh, it's written in the prose of a bad TV journalist.
And second, it's ruthlessly manipulative. The the back-cover blurb, boasts "tear
jerker." And so it is, shamelessly. Jules, the first-person narrator, loses his
parents in an auto accident, is sent to a boarding school that is depicted as a
quasi-penitentiary, is abandoned by his two siblings, suffers from paralyzing
guilt, and when he finally marries, has to watch his wife die from cancer (a
sequence which is narrated in extended, unnecessary detail).

I suppose these disasters might have been handled with enough circumspection and
integrity to teach us something about the human condition. But no, only to wring
a couple of tears from our reluctant eyes. And then the too easily won upbeat
ending -- goodness gracious!

Some parts, but not enough of them, rang true. The family dynamics among the
siblings was complicated enough to generate some heft.

Here's a single instance, one of many, to which I objected: a late middle-age
writer suffers from Alzheimer's. Our hero, Jules, puts a gun in the man's hands,
then walks away and hears the report of the weapon. He never confesses that he
assisted in the death, and suffers no psychological ramifications from doing so.
Peculiar, especially since the dead man was his rival for the love of his soon-
to-be wife. I think most people would agree that assisting in a suicide is a
fraught act and that a novelist neglects his duty and cheats his readers when he
fails to acknowledge and explore its effects. A major, compromising misstep by
Mr.Wells.

So there it is, in little: disappointed, exploited and cheated. Not a good
feeling to take away from a novel.

But I wonder at myself. The most manipulative novelist of all times is Charles
Dickens, whose writing  I revere. Dickens is on a level several orders of
magnitude more tearjerkery than Wells could possibly imagine, grasp, or emulate.
How can it be that I embrace Dickens and reject Wells?

Title: The Comancheros (1961)
Date: April 02, 2019

This reprehensible film aspires to be an "inconsequential romp," as one reviewer
suggests, but fails to meet even that exceedingly low bar.

If a viewer could swallow the buddy-movie plot (Stuart Whitman as a New Orleans
card shark and John Wayne as John Wayne), he'd still have to deal with Nehemiah
Persoff as a brutal Mexican gang-and-cult leader and Ina Balin (the worst
actress Brooklyn has ever produced) as his spitfire daughter. And also embrace
the dubious proposition that the road from New Orleans to Galveston goes through
picturesque southern Utah. And many other improbabilities.

Ok, so the film is one big joke, a comedy masquerading as a western, or vice
versa.

But if the film is a "romp," then how in the world can we justify its treatment
of Indians?

In The Comancheros, Indians have three functions. The first is to be constantly
drunk and constantly in search of whiskey. It offers a truly horrible,
inexcusable scene in which a renowned chief falls drunkenly into his soup.
Amusing? Not to any person with a modicum of fellow feeling. The second purpose
that Indians serve is to be cruel: they torture and scalp. Their third purpose
is to be cannon-fodder. Scores, perhaps a hundred are remorselessly cut down
by our white friends. Not a one of them is awarded a trace of individuality --
though, as is the custom in such films, they get to fall picturesquely from
rocky overlooks or be dragged by the foot in the stirrup when they are shot off
their horses.

Even worse than these atrocities is a scene in which a bedraggled, impoverished
line of hollow-eyed Indians, this time including women and children, trudge
dejectedly across the landscape. A mini Trail of Tears. Not to worry, says
John Wayne, they're "tame Indians." "Tame" means defeated, reduced to poverty,
neglected, dehumanized. Tame as cows or dogs. It's a painful image, hard to
ignore or to forget.

I imagine that we're supposed to say, Oh, this was 1961, we know better now. But
by 1961, John Ford had made a few movies in which Indians were depicted with not
a lot, but a bit of humanity. The Comancheros was reactionary and unenlightened
even it its day, we have to admit, and embodied a transparently racist ideology.
It's treatment of our fellow but slightly different humans is grotesque and
unforgivable.

Criminal, in fact. It is nothing less than a excuse and justification for
genocide. Not inconsequential at all.

According to the story, Michael Curtiz set out to direct the film, but fell ill
and withdrew. The actual direction was under the control of John Wayne himself,
so it is at his feet that this appalling monster must lie.

Title: Other People's Lives
Date: April 24, 2019

Three times in the last few weeks I've had the opportunity to drop into other
people's lives.

The most recent was a visit to the Mountain Men Rendezvous in Antonito, New
Mexico.

"Rendezvous," you ask?  In the 1830s, fur trappers gathered in various places
in western North America to sell their furs and purchase supplies for the coming
year. According to the story, they drank themselves silly, fornicated as much
as possible, and played at various games and sports to pass the time while they
waited for the wagons to arrive from St. Louis. Modern re-enactors dress in
1820s costumes, and, at least in Antonito, engage in knife and "hawk" (tomahawk)
throwing contests.

It was a world taken very seriously by the mountain men and their ladies. But
strange, even otherworldly to me. I learned about the proper size of a hawk
and how muzzle loading rifles work and I handled an elaborately beaded pouch
made out of a bull's scrotum, owned by our host, whose "mountain name" was Long
Tongue. But no liquor at this gathering. Lemonade only, I'm glad to say. I
wouldn't have been comfortable with all those knives and hawks whizzing around
if the guys and gals had been addled with alcohol.

And also : a few weeks ago, in New Orleans, we shared lunch with the Lords
of Leather. A scary, in-your-face name, but a more welcoming group of men
I've rarely met. Some were costumed, but most of them looked like a bunch of
accountants enjoying a weekend cookout. No doubt their fellowship engaged
private matters that I don't know about and wouldn't understand. Lives very
different from mine.

Also in New Orleans, we attended a "ball."  Not a ball that involves dancing
-- more of a pageant, a display of elaborate costuming. It was sponsored by the
Krewe of Iris, a group of women who roll their pageant wagons (floats) during
Mardi Gras. We costumed ourselves for the ball -- fancy long dress and tuxedo.
The members of the Krewe a) take it all very seriously, and b) know that it's
silly and c) take it seriously nonetheless.

There must be thousands of these cultures and sub-cultures in our rich and
various nation. I'm happy to have participated, a bit, in these worlds.

And I wonder, of course, how strange and exotic my life and culture, bland and
ordinary to me, might seem to some of the mountain men and leather-lords and
Iris ladies.

Title: Wisdom --  Part 1
Date: April 29, 2019

Now that I'm eighty (80!) years old, it's time to think about what, if anything,
 I've learned. For many years now, I've been waiting for wisdom to kick in, but
so far, no thunderbolts or grand illuminations. Yet I seem to have accumulated
a number of maxims and cliches, which leads to the dispiriting conclusion that
perhaps there's no difference between ordinary commonplaces and sophisticated
wisdom. On the other hand, it is undeniably the case that I am a different
person now than I was twenty or forty or sixty years ago, so perhaps all these
years have produced some changes in attitude and behavior. What follows is the
first installment of either "wisdom" or "commonplaces" -- take your pick.

Although it is true that there are psychopaths and sociopaths, there are very
few of them. Almost all the people I've known over the years have been poor
struggling mortals, like myself, trying to act decently and respectably. The
difficult people with whom I've had to deal are pathetic rather than villainous.
They act badly because of their own inadequacies, anxieties and fear, not
because they are innately vicious. A surprising number of people have endured
dreadful traumas and most of them have recovered to live satisfactory lives.
There are some poor souls who compensate badly. They cause pain to us, but more
to themselves. It's not true that to know everything is to excuse everything,
but knowing people's stories certainly helps you to become more empathetic and
understanding. My younger self was much harsher and less compassionate toward
difficult people than my present self.

Genuine understanding between individuals is difficult and misunderstanding is
rife. It's hard to translate what's in your head to your friend or neighbor,
and just as hard to understand what's in someone else's head by words alone.
If you're going to be surprised because someone misunderstood you, then you're
going to spend half your entire lifetime in a state of dreadful shock. Although
irony and understatement are most useful figures of speech, beware of them.
There's nothing more awkward (and sometimes dangerous) than an ironic remark
that is taken seriously, or a serious remark that is understood ironically. A
meaningful exchange of ideas or insights can't be brief, because it takes time
for a shred or glimmer of understanding to grow and ripen. If you want to have a
real friend, make the time. Understanding someone else's brain is akin to Zeno's
Paradox;  you get halfway there but you never get all the way.

Everyone is engaged in "presentation of self." You meet someone new, and they
tell you about themselves, but they're not really doing so in any profound
way. They're not trying to. They're acting out the "presentation" that they've
devised over the years. They offer you a handful of anecdotes which they think
represent themselves. But the fun and the satisfaction only begins when that
first mask drops away. In order to know someone, you have to ask a question that
is not truly intrusive but manages to take your new friend (or old friend, for
that matter), a hair's breadth apart from their usual style of presentation.
Sometimes it's not worth the effort,  but there are occasions when it can
precipitate a worthwhile friendship. Too many conversations are not exchanges
of information.  A says something from his repertoire of self-presentations;
then B, impatiently waiting his turn to talk about himself, responds with a
nugget from his own store. No genuine communication takes place. This kind of
exchange is disappointing and almost useless. We all generate these forms of
presentation partly as a defense against revealing too much of ourselves and
becoming vulnerable, and because we all have our own follies and weaknesses. So
we act a role. The further the contrived role is from the true self, the more
transparent and even offensive it becomes. It's hard for people to be true to
themselves;  it takes work.

More wisdom (or commonplaces) coming soon. Stay tuned.

Title: Amnesia on Film:  Shadow on the Wall (1950)
Date: May 29, 2019

Another day, another amnesia movie. This one, Shadow on the Wall, is  different
only because the amnesiac is a child.  The poor dear has witnessed a murder,
and has been traumatized, which we know because her wooden perkiness transforms
into wooden woodenness. In the vulgar reductive Freudianism to which the film
pays full credence, the little girl won't be cured until she remembers what
she has repressed. Which she does, unsurprisingly and predictably, in the last
scene, thereby freeing her father (Zachary Scott) from the threat of execution
for a murder he didn't commit. More turbid amnesia waters flowing under the
Lethean bridge.

I don't now why I have such a dislike for Zachary Scott. True, he's not a good
actor, but it's not that. It might be his mustache, which is far too tidy and
trim and which says (to me), "this person can't be trusted."  Or perhaps it's
his receding chin.  Or his hairpiece. His awkward movements. His pathetic
attempts at comedy.  I can't say for sure.

I think that I must have been mistreated by a Zachary Scott lookalike in my
childhood, events that I've forgotten but have retained in my subconscious.

If I could just remember what happened I might be able to free myself of this
irrational hatred. Meanwhile, I'm sorry the movie turned out the way it did. 
I would have preferred it if Zachary Scott had been executed, mustache and all,
even if it was for a murder he didn't commit.

Title: Written for My Grandchildren;  Your Great-Grandmother, Lillian Green
Date: June 13, 2019

My mother, your great-grandmother, Lillian Green, was born in New York City,
probably in Harlem, on June 9, 1905.

Her parents, Sonia Chafetz and Joseph Usilewski, were part of the great
migration to America of Eastern European Jews. According to my mother, Sonia and
Joseph were both engaged to other people when they eloped, he deserting from the
Russian army. They arrived at Ellis Island mid-August of 1904 without a kopeck
in their pockets and only one pair of shoes between them. I used to think that
my mother had been conceived aboard the ship from Rotterdam, but the dates don't
bear it out. Moreover, It's a melancholy fact that passengers in steerage were
segregated by sex and kept apart.

My mother was born Lilly Usilewski but when she entered public school, which is
where she acquired English, she was enrolled as Lily Solawisky. When her younger
brother was enrolled as Daniel Oslofsky, my grandfather Joseph realized that it
was time to Americanize his name. The judge before whom he appeared was named
Green, so Green he became. Lilly became Lillian when she married, my father
insisting that "Lilly's not a name." He and everyone called her "Lil" but she
was always "Lilly" to her mother Sonia.

Lil's upbringing, I am afraid, was impoverished and harsh. I was told that her
father raised her and her younger brothers Dan and Ellis (Bub) "with the belt."
Her mother Sonia was chronically ill from goiter and from the consequences
of her five home-made abortions, so against her wishes Lil was taken out of
school six weeks into high school to run the house and to raise her brothers, a
sacrifice for which she received no appreciation either from them or from her
father. For her, it was a disaster and a source of bitterness.. Her life from
age thirteen to age twenty-six, when she married my father, Emanuel, is almost
entirely blank to me. I know that she worked in the printing industry and was
a skilled proofreader. She was not at all athletic or artistic but she was
musical -- she played the piano and sang. At some point in early adulthood she
started to take vacations at one of those camps for young Jewish adults in the
Catskills. She sang in camp musicals and it was there that she met my father, a
law clerk studying for the bar. My grandfather Joseph Green disapproved of her
independence and refused to speak to her for two years -- a wound from which she
was still suffering when I came to know her. Lil and Manny were married on June
19, 1930 and had four children:  Eugene (1935- 2006), Susan (1937-1938), Elihu
(1939 -    ), and Jonathan (1942 -    ).

Her hard early life and the death of her daughter at the age of nine months,
along with a chronic, agonizing stomach ulcer left her a troubled woman. She was
what used to be called "difficult" -- acerbic, rude, insensitive, thoughtless.
She once said to me, "I was a good mother until you boys were six years old;
after that, I couldn't cope." I think it was honest and insightful of her to say
so. Yet my very earliest memories are pleasurable. She kept us warm and fed and
loved; otherwise I don't know how my brothers and I would have been able to have
lived satisfying lives. But I also know that I have no memories of touching her
or being touched by her, although sometimes she would demand a quick peck on the
cheek. She was not at all "supportive" -- "assaultive" would be a better term.
There was no praise, only incomprehension or disdain.

I can't remember any particular words that she said to me, but here's a sample
of her language. I remember that when my two or three month old firstborn
suffered noisily from colic, she proposed to my wife, "Maybe your milk is
poisoning him"  -- which not a sentiment likely to endear her to a struggling
new mother.

It took me into adulthood to recognize that my mother's peculiarities were not
villainy but the product of her emotionally impoverished early years and of her
almost constant pain.

After her children were grown, she resumed her piano playing and turned
herself into a stalwart of the League of Women Voters. In 1960, during JFK's
presidential campaign, she gathered fifty or sixty women and welcomed Eleanor
Roosevelt herself to our home on East 9 Street. A most memorable and important
contribution.

She did not mellow with age. Yet I would have to say, that all things
considered, she did well.

Lil died at age 74 from the consequences of her then-incurable ulcer. In the
hospital, dying, "intubated" and incapable of speech, she scribbled on a scrap
of paper, "I love you all,"  and I know that she meant sincerely what had
always been so difficult for her to express. I retain that piece of paper as a
relic.

Here's a picture of Lil at her best. Me and my mom, c. 1940.

Title: For my Family: West Bradford History (I)
Date: September 29, 2019

This is a photograph of the buildings on the West Bradford property as they
existed when we made the deal in 1967. As you know -- children, grandchildren
and other interested parties -- we are no longer in possession of this part of
the property. It passed to Phyllis and Bruce in 1977 and then to Bruce entirely
when he and Phyllis divorced in 1984 or thereabouts.

But this is how it looked to the photographer, whom I believe to be my brother
Jonathan, when he stood on the near knoll looking westward.  Much remains
superficially constant but everything is different.

Still in place: the house and barn, the Red Duchess apple tree just to the left
of the house and closer to the camera; the big sugar maple on the left, near
South Road.

But to my eye, there's much that has changed. Hanging over the house is a very
large, very dead elm. There's another infected and doomed elm to the right
of the barn. Indeed, the property was sometimes called by us "Dead Elm Farm"
when we spent our first summer there, in 1968. There's a chicken house, barely
visible, to the right of the white clapboard milk house; there is also another
outbuilding once used as a garage and a storeroom for wood visible between the
house and barn; there's a porch of sorts at the street side of the house -- all
these elements have been removed though they remain vivid in my memory.

But what you can't see, grandchildren, is more interesting than what is visible.

The property was owned for forty years by Tom Roberts, who was probably as old
in 1968 as I am now. He knew that he was too tired and probably too resource-
poor to maintain ownership. His wife, eight years older than he, was mortally
ill, and Tom himself had only a couple of years to live. It was time for him to
move on.

The house itself (supposedly built in part in 1856) was out of an earlier era.
It lacked a septic system (it had only a cesspool, which was an open sewer into
which untreated waste flowed and stunk.)  There was a 15-foot deep dug well
(you can see a bit of the topmost well tile and the concrete well cover just to
the right of the apple tree) from which a very old electric pump pushed water
up to an open copper-lined tank on the second floor of the house. There was no
water pressure (because there was no pressure tank) but only a "gravity feed"
to the faucets and toilet. The plumbing was rusted iron (in) and lead (out).
There was no heating system -- the wood stoves that had heated the place were
sold at auction before we took up residence. No insulation either, except (we
later discovered) the piles of hazelnut shells that generations of squirrels and
chipmunks had deposited in the spaces between the split lathe-and-plaster inner
walls and the outer sheathing. The sills were rotten and the house was sagging
in places -- although, as you can see, the roof line was still deceptively
sound.

The barn was in even worse condition than the house. Its partial collapse was
the reason -- the last straw -- that Tom Roberts sold out. During the previous
winter, the rotted-out floor on the east side of the barn had given way,
strangling three of Tom's eight cows in their stanchions. Tom was heartbroken --
he dropped more than one tear when he told us about the disaster. "I hooked them
one by one to the tractor and dragged them out into the field, over there, and
buried them."  He pointed to a spot that would be just about the lower right
hand corner of the photograph.

The barn, at first, was a scary place.  It took us (Bruce and me) a couple of
weeks to get up the courage to enter. It was a disaster area: giant spider webs,
peeling whitewash, jumbled and distorted structures for dairy use, piles of
twisted lumber. It's now been repaired and remodeled -- completely transformed.
But I still treasure the memory of the way it was, at least after it wasn't in
danger of further collapse. I miss the majestic 16' by 16' hemlock beams, the
spacious haylofts, the hand hewn tree that served for a ridgepole.

Despite the fact that the buildings were way past their prime, barely
functioning, I didn't think for a second that we had made a mistake in buying
the place. I never thought of reversing course and selling out. I was totally at
home from the first breath. I fell in love with the buildings, and even more so
with the land.

When Althea took her very first walk on the property, just as we passed what
we call the "meander" and crossed over the spill (now enclosed in a culvert)
through which water from the swamp (now a pond) courses into the Baldwin Brook,
she said, "This is too beautiful to be in private hands."

It's even more beautiful now.

[Addendum October 24, 2019.  I suppose I should mention that the decision to buy
the property was controversial. My father in particular, ever cautious, was
adamant: you don't buy a second home until you've bought your first home. You
have no idea what you're buying. The land has never been surveyed;  you don't
know the boundaries."  His reasoning was perfectly correct, but all wrong.
Buying the property was the best financial decision of my life.]

Title: A New Building on Hackett Hill Road, 1978
Date: October 05, 2019

It shouldn't take more than a moment, dear grandchildren, to figure out exactly
what building is under construction. It's the early spring of 1978 and the house
that we've lived in these last forty or so years is rising out of the ground.
It may be a little difficult, but if you scrutinize closely, you'll notice the
space that has been left for the familiar sliding door (with its prominent
header), and also the spaces for the front door and the kitchen windows. The
workmen (is that Jimmy Perry up there?) are just starting on the second floor.
There's also a large boulder which came out of the basement on the lower right,
sitting where it remained for 30 years or so until it was replaced by a much
more handsome piece of granite. (The boulder in the picture can now be found,
part buried, at the entrance to the new waterfall garden.)

It's a very small house (the footprint is 20' x 28') not because we were in
love with small houses, but because we were working with an extremely limited
budget.  Believe it or not, the house (including foundation, roof, well,
electricity, and septic) cost just $33,000 --very little even in 1970s dollars.
That's because we cut every corner that could conceivably be cut: unfinished
lumber for framing, second-hand doors, used plumbing fixtures and appliances,
plywood flooring in some rooms, etc. etc.  (Almost all these elements have been
replaced and upgraded over the years as the family has become more prosperous.)

Also important: the house site. It might seem natural and inevitable to you,
grandchildren, that the house is where it is. But in fact, there was a long
serious debate about where to put it. And here you must remind yourself that in
1977 the area that now contains a house and a garage/barn and three cabins and
an orchard of sorts and three or four different gardens was a blank space, a
tabula rasa -- just a meadow behind the old West Bradford cemetery.

Four sites were under consideration and three were rejected : the first where
Cabin #3 is located, the second, where the barn sits, the third in the back
field (but that would have involved a prohibitive investment in a road and the
undergrounding of many feet of electrical wire). I made the decision to put the
house up on the knoll, with a good view of pond, forest and field, accessible
to the road, and with the hope and possibility of a dry basement. The right
decision, I still think.

There was only one road in at the time -- the one to the south of the cemetery .
Thedriveway we now use came the next year                                      .

There were many adventures and many anxieties in the building of the house, most
of them a consequence of the limited budget. It was not an enjoyable experience,
but it didn't sour me on the land or the property. I learned a lot.

Title: Estelle Fendrick's Chicken Soup
Date: October 08, 2019

Here's a marvelously instructive tale about culinary practice, custom,
superstition, religion and how knowledge passes from generation to generation.

We're in the 1940s.

My mother was sitting with her childhood friend, Estelle Fendrick, who was
preparing a chicken soup. My mother (this is exactly how she told me the story)
noticed that Estelle broke the long bones (the "drumstick") of the chicken
before putting them into the cooking vessel. She asked Estelle, why she broke
the bones. And Estelle replied, well, it's what my mother did. I don't know why
but I'm going to see her next week and I'll ask her why she broke the bones. So
the next week, Estelle asked her own mother why she broke the bones, and her
mother answered in the same way as Estelle: I do it because my mother did it.
But look, tomorrow I'm going to visit my mother in the Hebrew Home for the Aged
in Riverdale and I'll ask her. So, and here my mother's narrative comes to its
climax, Estelle's mother went to visit her own mother and asked her, why did
you use to break the bones of the chicken before you put them into the cooking
vessel, and Estelle's grandmother thought for a while and then said (and here
you have to imagine a very strong old country accent), We had a very small pot.

Title: Silo (1968)
Date: October 11, 2019

When we arrived at Dead Elm Farm in 1968, we were confronted with a derelict
silo. It had not been used for many years and displayed a Pisa-like lean. We
thought it was a hazard and decided to take it down, which we did by the simple
expedient of tying one end of a rope to one of the metal rings and attaching
the other end to a car bumper. The silo offered little resistance. But once it
was removed, we discovered that decades of leaking at the junction of silo and
barn had engendered massive rot in the uprights and sill and that the side of
the barn was hanging by a thread and would need even more reconstruction than we
could possibly have imagined.

The picture makes it all very clear, but there's a small structure visible at
the top and to the right of the silo which I don't remember. What was it? 
Perhaps it was part of the primitive venting system that was used to keep hot
air from building up in the hayloft. Or a cricket to keep the rain off?

And when did that vent or cricket disappear? What became of it?  I have no
recollection.

It was not a functional or useful silo, but it was beautiful in its own way    .
Though doomed                                                                  .

Title: Another Film Noir:  The Brothers Rico (1957)
Date: October 21, 2019

It's not the most artistic poster (way too crowded a field) but it's a heck of
a movie. It's a familiar film noir subject: guy (in this case), Eddie Rico, a
former mobster, tries to go straight, but his past catches up with him. The
first couple of scenes establish him as legitimate businessman and husband. In
fact, the director, the ever-reliable Phil Karlson, pushes the Code envelope
when Eddie and Alice (Dianne Foster) wake in separate beds (as required by the
Legion of Decency) and he reaches over and lays his hand just an inch  or so
from her benightgowned right breast. (Makes me wonder how much negotiation was
required with the censors: "Can he put his hand here? How about here? Above?
Below?") And then when Eddie playfully asks Alice why  she married him, she
answers rather forthrightly, "I was a girl. I wanted to be a woman." Whoa, how
did Karlson slip that one through?  Did the censors not understand?

Discussion of prudery is relevant, because censorship spoils the ending of the
film. It's grim gangland world into which Eddie is reluctantly thrust. Everyone
lies, no one can be trusted, every conversation reeks of menace, and violence
is ubiquitous and casual. In the showdown, Eddie is wounded and survives, but
every element in the logic of film requires that he die. The tacked-on happy
ending, in which a headline proclaims that the gang has been destroyed and Eddie
and Alice enjoy connubial bliss, is false, and, I think, even insulting to the
intelligence of the viewer. Better to ignore it, or, better still, turn off the
tv just three minutes before the end, because the first 87 minutes are just
terrific.

Title: A Few Words About My Father
Date: October 21, 2019

Here's a memory from my youth. Let's say it's the early '50s. I'm a thoughtless,
self-absorbed adolescent, nominally studying at Erasmus Hall but in fact not
paying much mind to schoolwork. It's a Sunday dinner, so I've probably just come
home from playing several hours of schoolyard basketball or softball. We're at
the dining room table. Roast beef, possibly. There's a desultory conversation,
but then my father, Emanuel, savoring the loaded table, observes, right out of
left field I thought then, "I don't think we could eat better food." He paused.
"Perhaps fancier, but not better."

I didn't know what has prompted his observation but it made enough impact on
me that I retained it in memory for now these seventy years. I doubt that any
of the five of us dissented and I suspect that we continued to stuff ourselves
with meat and roasted potatoes and (inasmuch as it was the 50s), some sort of
soggy canned vegetable. But now, almost seven decades later, I think that I
have a better understanding of Dad's spontaneous celebration of the roast. I
also think that I know why that particular moment has stayed in my mind when so
much else has long since evaporated. After all, Dad was not given to gratuitous
compliments, certainly not to the food on the table. My father was neither a
gourmet nor a food critic (I've written about his eating habits elsewhere). I
now know that he wasn't commenting on the preparation or the presentation of the
food. He was savoring its inherent quality -- its grade A choiceness -- wait,
not just its quality so much as its abundance. But even more specifically, when
I think back, he was enjoying the knowledge that he was able to provide such a
bountiful dinner for his family.

To understand Dad's spontaneous overflow of emotion, it's necessary to recall
the facts of his own childhood. From what I've gleaned, the family in which he
grew up must have been among the poorest in America, the very bottom of the
economic ladder. His father worked in a factory -- which was just a large room
behind a storefront -- as a roller of cigars. It's well documented that in the
first part of the 20th century, cigar-rollers were one of the most exploited and
most underpaid of American workers. Grandpa's wage when Dad was growing up, he
told me, was $9 per week. The family, the six of them (the parents Isaiah and
Eta, the children Max, Sol, Mollie, and Manny) lived in a sixth floor cold water
walk-up flat -- that is, in an apartment in a tenement up six flights of stairs
(no elevators), water but no hot water. I don't know how many rooms in this
apartment but it didn't matter much, because, Dad said, they all spent their
time in the kitchen, which was the only room they could afford to heat.

Dad's mother, my grandmother Eta (she's Yetta in her naturalization papers)
didn't speak much English and I can only remember one conversation with her --
just a short while before she died in 1962 at age 89. It was a struggle for her
to speak my language but she managed to say two memorable sentences about her
early years in America. She said, with pride, "we was poor but we was clean,"
and (very relevant here) "we always had what to eat."  That sentence of hers
--"we always had what to eat"-- was said with almost exactly the same valence
as my father's "I don't think we could eat better food." For grandma, putting
food on the table for six individuals was achievement enough. It was a triumph.
Grandma didn't speak of her diet in the old country, but from her height (4'10")
and that of her husband Isaiah's (5'1"), I can guess that food was an issue and
that dearth was common. I also suspect that the sixth floor walk-up might have
been luxurious compared to the standard of living in StaryConstantin in Ukraine.

But to my father. He had no difficulty acknowledging the poverty of his early
years. I think, looking back, that he had some pleasure in knowing that he had
overcome the hardships of his youth. If he didn't have a jacket in the coldest
of winters, well, he had a sweater, and that was enough. I only remember one
complaint, and it wasn't about his family. During World War I, students in P.
S. 122 were lined up on the side of the room and were instructed to offer their
donations for the purchase of War Bonds. When they surrendered their dimes
or quarters, they were allowed to sit down.  But Dad was required to remain
standing because he didn't have even a nickel to donate. "Wasn't that a cruel
thing to do to a child," he said to me.

But poverty did not distort my father's personality. He was the precise opposite
of the stereotype of the upwardly mobile overachiever, grasping for more and
more.  He was actually rather contemptuous of such people. He said to me once,
"Anyone can make money if he makes it the whole business of his life to do
so." And I also remember an instance when I overheard a conversation among his
friends about how much their stocks had gained. After they left, my father
said, "When the stock market is going up, everyone's a genius." He himself
never had an extra dollar to invest in stocks. But enough is as good as a feast.

He was the person least interested in material goods that I have met in my
entire lifetime. He had no possessions and craved none. He was a real estate
lawyer in a world where clients squabbled over inches, but his opinion was
"Nobody owns anything. Maybe you can say you have a lifetime lease, but that's
all."

Here's another piece of wisdom that offered, and one from which I've profited. I
think I can quote this verbatim. "Never omit an opportunity to do a favor for a
friend. And never be embarrassed to accept a favor from a friend. People like to
help each other."

Title: Jot and Tittle
Date: October 28, 2019

First of all, let us dismiss the notion that Charles Dickens invented a pair of
persnickety punctilious accountants and named them Jot and Tittle. Sorry, it
could or should have been the case, but it's not so. Nevertheless, both "jot"
and "tittle," often found in each other's cozy company, have stories to tell.

Take jot, for example. In the masterful "seduction scene" in Shakespeare's
Othello, Iago first torments the Venetian general and then pretends sympathy: "I
see this (i.e. his nasty sly hints that Desdemona has been a-bed with Cassio)
hath a little dashed your spirits." Othello responds defensively, perhaps a tad
dishonestly: "Not a jot, not a jot."

Professor Google tells me it's none of those things and that I am entirely off
track. "Jot" is alphabetic; it translates the Greek "iota," the smallest letter
-- no more than a single straight line, a minimal minim. And therefore Othello
might just as well have said (the words are cognates), "Not an iota, not an
iota." He might have said it, that is, if he hadn't spent his dearest action in
the tented field engaging exclusively in broils and battles, but instead had
studied at some North African classical academy.

In fact, Shakespeare either didn't know or didn't use the word "iota," which
seems not to have entered English until a generation after he ceased putting
quill to paper. On the other hand, Shakespeare was mighty fond of the word
jot, which he employed at least twenty times (though never so notably as in
Othello), always to denote a small quantity and frequently to appear as
a partitive: "jot of promise," "jot of ceremony," "jot of color," "jot of
pleasure," "jot of blood.'" Shakespeare's "jot" can even signify a moment in
time: "No, faith, I'll not stay a jot longer." (His "jot" is always a noun,
never the converted verb meaning "to write a few words quickly.")

Shakespeare undoubtedly knew the word "jot" from its famous and mysterious
appearance in Matthew 5:18. Here's the familiar King James Version (1611): "For
verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall
in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled." The phrasing is almost the
same in the Geneva Bible of 1576 -- the translation that Shakespeare himself
knew and used. "For truly I say unto you, Till heaven and earth perish, one jot
or one tittle of the Law shall not escape, till all things be fulfilled."

I don't know what "all things" are and I certainly don't know what is meant by
"fulfilled." But why should I, since Jesus's prophesy has long baffled trained
professional theologians. But I do know that the pairing of "jot and tittle" has
become proverbial.

What, then, is a "tittle." No, it's not a very small female breast. Nor is it a
diminutive seabird, though it's not difficult to imagine a rocky south Atlantic
island frequented by the "Lesser, or Little Tittle." In actual fact, it's a
stroke of a pen -- and one that's even smaller than an iota. Specifically, it's
the dot over the lower case "i" or lower case "j." Or, in an extended sense, any
simple diacritical mark.

Shakespeare used "tittle" just twice. The first was in Love's Labor's Lost in
a passage in which Shakespeare makes game of affected language. Pompous Don
Armado de Adriano compares little things (the woman he woos) to greater things
(himself) "Shall I entreat thy love? I will. What shalt thou exchange for rags?
robes; for tittles? titles; for thyself? me." What a difference a "t" makes!
"Tittle" makes its second, almost inadvertent, appearance in The Winter's
Tale as an element in the dismissive reduplicative "tittle-tattling." Both of
Shakespeare's tittles acknowledge that the word is an inherently silly one.
Is it accidental that a number of words that resemble tittle are frivolous or
infantile: babble, toddle, tattle, prattle?

Title: More About My Father
Date: October 28, 2019

My father had many admirable traits. He was absolutely honest -- "honest to a
fault" even. He had a fine sense of humor. He was compassionate and though he
affected stoicism, he was deeply romantic and emotional -- tears came easy to
him. He was a self-effacing but diligent worker. He was a fine, graceful athlete
-- basketball, tennis, baseball (a catcher!) His social views were progressive.
I never detected a jot or tittle of bigotry in his conversation (in fact, words
that denigrated racial or religious groups were unknown in our home. When I
heard words like "goy" on the street, I had to do some research to find out what
was meant.) He was a thoughtful man, a wise man, a realist and not an ideologue.
He was an affectionate father and husband. He never provoked a soul and had no
enemies. He enjoyed his life.

I profited immensely from observing these excellent traits in action.

But perhaps because of his impoverished first-generation beginnings, he
was never at ease in the world. Yes, he was comfortable at home and in his
backyard garden and among his circle of friends, many of whom he had known from
childhood. He was comfortable walking to the BMT at Newkirk Plaza, taking the
subway to Court Street in downtown Brooklyn, and practicing his profession,
where he was much respected. But he did not like to step out of his milieu.
He couldn't fend for himself. Here's an extreme but telling example: one day,
when I was ten or so years old, as we were walking home, probably from the
schoolyard, he stopped in front of the local A & P and said to me, "Your mother
wants a quart of milk; you go in and buy the milk. I'll wait outside." Which I
did, of course; I was used to running such errands. My father couldn't go into
a market without stress. He could buy a newspaper at a candy store or kiosk,
and he could bring home a loaf of rye bread from Ebinger's bakery, but I never
once saw him in a vegetable market or a fish store or a butcher shop. When my
mother died in 1978, he had to hire people to shop for him. And someone to cook,
because, as the saying goes, he couldn't boil water. Because of his discomfort
when out of his routine, he was a classic stick-in-the-mud. He couldn't travel.
He never learned to drive a car. In his relations with others, he was totally
passive. He allowed my mother to organize his social life and after she died,
he became completely isolated. He hated change. Once when I visited him late in
his life, when he was in serious arthritic pain, he complained about the station
to which his radio was tuned. It was one of those "twenty-four hours of news"
stations that repeated itself every few minutes. I said, "Why not change the
station?" He said, "Aw, it's already set there."

I tried very hard not to imitate these less-than-admirable habits.

Title: Amnesia on Film: Hangover Square (1945)
Date: November 01, 2019

It's a play on Hanover Square in London, where, apparently, there were many
drinking establishments. It's also still another variety of amnesia. This time
the victim knows he's lost his memory, but his friends and relatives don't
notice.

George Harvey Bone, a composer played by the immense (300 lb) and immensely
talented Laird Cregar, experiences what he calls "moods" where he can't remember
what he did or where he did it. It being a film noir, what he does is kill
people. An elderly Scottish antique dealer for one, and Netta Longdon, a wicked
exploitative chantoosie  (Linda Darnell at her best), who's been playing Bone
for a sucker. But he doesn't remember, so it's not his responsibility, say some.
In the event, he carries Netta's newly-strangled body to the top of a Guy Fawkes
bonfire and then returns to his own house where, melodramatically seated at his
piano and playing his concerto while fire blazes around him, he's burned to
death. As far as I can tell, he never does discover that he's a murderer when
he's "in the mood." Nor must he be punished by the law; the fire does the job.
"It's better this way" says George Sanders, Bone's ineffectual psychologist.

Fascinating addendum: Linda Darnell, consumed by fire in this movie, died twenty
years later in a house fire in Glenview, Illinois. (Laird Cregar, 31, died of a
heart attack after Hangover Square was completed but before it was released.)

Is it a good film?  It's fascinating for sure and there are many good scary
scenes, but the plot is so compromised by the inexplicable designer amnesia that
it's hard to embrace, hard to recommend.

Title: "Vaulting Variable Ramps"
Date: November 22, 2019

Let me guess that a modern reader coming upon Shakespeare's euphonious phrase
"vaulting variable ramps" would be baffled as to its sense. Just WS being
willfully obscure, one might complain. But it's not so; it's just that the
language keeps on changing, making things difficult for audiences and readers.

The most obvious meaning  of "vaulting various ramps" -- hurdling a
miscellaneous series of inclined planes, as in a steeplechase -- won't fly.
"Ramps" takes us down a wrong path, because its modern meaning (a wood or
concrete construction leading from one level to another) was unknown in 1611.
It didn't enter the English language until 1778 -- as a borrowing from French
rampe. (The entrance to a highway, as in "take the ramp on the right" is an
Americanism dating only to the 1950s.)

A "ramp" is also a vegetable. It's an uncultivated, wild member of the onion
family lately celebrated by fad foodies (or food faddies) as a great delicacy.
But why Shakespeare would want someone to hurdle an individual ramp or even a
field of ramps is less than obvious. Another false start.

Let us therefore examine the context of the phrase "vaulting variable ramps."

It occurs in Cymbeline, the most magical of Shakespeare's last plays. Nasty
Iachimo ("little Iago") tries to persuade Innogen that her virtuous husband
Postumus has been unfaithful -- that he has, in another splendid Shakespearean
phrase, "partner'd with tomboys." The situation excites Shakespeare's exuberant
pen. Iachimo embroiders "tomboys" and claims that Postumus has consorted
with "with diseased ventures/ That play with all infirmities for gold/ Which
rottenness can lend nature; such boil'd stuff/ As well might poison poison."
Should she, that is, Innogen (and here Iachimo's rhetoric soars)

Live, like Diana's priest, betwixt cold sheets,

While he [Postumus] is vaulting variable ramps,

In your despite.

"Ramps," therefore, are the opposite of Diana's priestesses, who live chastely;
they are in fact loose women. Ramps who are neither architectural nor vegetable,
but sexual and promiscuous. At least, they are so in this instance, because
otherwise "ramp" carried a meaning closer to "virago" -- in 1611 an overbearing
woman but not necessarily an unchaste one. The word "ramp" in this signification
has disappeared but has bequeathed us "rapscallion" (which was earlier spelled
both "ramscallion" or "rampscallion.") There is no evidence to support the easy
inference that rapscallion combines "ramp" and "scallion."

"Vaulting variable ramps" means "to engage in a series of athletic sexual
encounters."

To vault into a lover's bed might seem to border on the comic but I don't think
that it does so in this case. Shakespeare elsewhere seems to imagine intercourse
as a vigorous event. A brothel is in his language a "leaping house." And surely
it's not comic when Juliet hopes that Romeo will "leap to [her] arms."

The conception behind "vault" and "leap" reappears in the contemporary demotic
phrase "jump his/her bones."

Title: Wisdom II: Proverbs, Anvils, Hammers.
Date: November 23, 2019

In the back of our fourth-grade "reader" at P. S. 217, there was an appendix
containing proverbs and other jots of wisdom. Most of these were commonplaces:
"look before you leap"; "a stitch in time saves nine"; "empty barrels make the
most noise."  Many of these gnomic bits mystified me. For example:

For all your days prepare,

And meet them ever alike.

When you are the anvil, bear.

When you are the hammer, strike.

I had no idea what an anvil was (now I own a beauty!!) but I understood that it
was something to beat with a hammer. For what purpose? I had no clue?  But I
was a moderately progressive youth and I couldn't grasp why we anvils were being
urged to "bear." It seemed like a reactionary idea then and still seems so now.
Way too passive, I thought. Why shouldn't the anvils join together and form a
united front against the hammers, or whatever capitalist oligarch controlled the
hammers? Why did my grandparents come to America if not to free themselves from
the perpetual anvilhood of sorry Ukraine?

Moreover, I completely missed the mark on "strike," which I interpreted to mean
"go on strike." An easy mistake, because the only other meaning I knew of strike
was the "three strikes and you're out" of basebalI. Even naif me knew that
baseball had nothing to do with anvils and hammers or fourth-grade readers.

The poem was therefore incoherent. Endure and suffer when you're an anvil, but
get on the picket line when you're a hammer.

Why couldn't anvil and hammer unite and resist their oppressors together?

I should also confess that anvil and hammer fused and mingled in my youthful
brain with a Phillies shortstop of the period named Granville Hamner.

Title: Wisdom from Cynomys ludovicianus
Date: December 08, 2019

For twenty-two of a day's twenty-four hours, I'm a contented kind of guy. Not
self-satisfied by a long shot, but by and large reconciled to both my modest
achievements and to my inadequacies. Yet between 2AM and 4AM, in the dark
insomniac gloom, I'm a different person. I struggle with "what ifs," with
"should have's," with alternative life choices of every ilk, however trivial.
Although I am well aware that (in 80's pop psychology) one shouldn't "should" on
oneself, I "should" relentlessly. I become a classic second-guesser, a merciless
self-critic, a shrill Monday morning quarterback of my own life.

So because "dark is the dawn when day is nigh," with sleep or the coming of the
sun, I revert to my normal, equable self.

A parable: yesterday we went for a walk on one of our town's many lovely open-
space trails. This walk took us right through an extensive prairie dog village.
It was a sunny day and the little plague-bearing rodents were outside -- cute,
furry, squeaky, sitting or standing, each one asserting possession of his or her
own burrow.

I said to my companion, "If I were a prairie dog, I'd probably be saying, 'I
should have chosen a different spot for my burrow. If I had just dug it a yard
or two north, or fifty feet away next to that tree, or even over the hill, I
would have led a much more productive life. Who knows, I might have had a better
burrow. I might have eaten more forbs and fescue. I might have had more mates,
I might have achieved more. My kits would have been more advantaged. I could
have made better use of my brief time on earth. I could have been better prairie
dog.'"

Don't laugh, please! This is serious stuff.

I don't need to underline the lesson of this tale. It's plenty obvious.

But will its wisdom and perspective console me tonight?

Title: Vagaries of Memory; Fear
Date: December 10, 2019

We watched the last ten minutes of an early 30s James Cagney crime film. I don't
know its title because we came in very late and didn't catch the name. The
concluding bit of the film was very good: a chase scene (rather tame by modern
standards) and then unrepentant Cagney in the hoosegow, facing a long stretch.
A gloomy prison cell. Cagney's girlfriend (a familiar face but not one I can
identify) comes for a visit. She promises, as is the custom in such films, to
wait patiently for him until he's released. An empty promise?  I don't know.
But Cagney perks up and delivers the film's last line: "If I had the wings of an
angel over these prison wall I would fly." Followed by a fade. The End.

I immediately said to my companion, "I know what he's quoting;  it's "The
Prisoner's Song" by Vernon Dalhart." I looked it up and I was correct: the lines
are right there in stanza 5.

Now if I had wings like an angelOver these prison walls I would flyAnd I'd fly
to the arms of my poor darlin'And there I'd be willin' to die.

"The Prisoner's Song" (1924) was a big hit;  in fact, according to Wik, the
first "country" song to sell a million copies. I imagine that Cagney's 1930s
audience would be expected to recognize the allusion. But ninety years have
passed and the lyric is pretty much forgotten today. Except, of course, by me.
An amazing recall. What a guy!

I have to tell you, I wallowed in self-congratulation. Preened. Demanded
extravagant praise. For twenty-four hours I was the cock of the memory dunghill.
But how quickly glory transits.

The next afternoon, I watched, with my 6-year-old grandson Luke, the re-play of
an NBA basketball game. Houston versus Toronto. I had seen the game a couple of
days before, so I knew it was a good one. But (and here comes the memory horror)
I couldn't remember who won. True that I remembered various plays and players,
but true also that I thought the game went into overtime and Toronto won. Not
so; James Harden, one of my least favorite players, "took over" the last couple
of minutes and Houston won decisively. I had simply forgotten. Blanked.

I was deflated, memory-wise. And scared. One day you can remember Vernon Dalhart
and the wings of the angel, and the next day you can't recall James Harden and
who won and who lost.

Here's the fear: it's obvious that the moments of memory-triumph are going to
be fewer and fewer and the moments of memory-failure are going to increase. And
continue to increase. Burgeon. Yikes. Double yikes.

This is Vernon Dalhart.

But who the heck is this?

By the way, has anyone  seen my keys?  I left them right there on the desk.
Didn't I?

Title: Me and Critters
Date: December 19, 2019

An old friend reminds me that I once kept a cat as a pet. I had forgotten.

Here's the story. There was a cat and I was overfond of her. We left the cat
with a friend when we went on a three-week vacation. She refused to eat and
starved to death before we returned. I've never owned another animal since. Too
much responsibility.

Besides, I was a city boy who had lived a concrete and chain-link-fence
childhood. No room for animals except maybe squirrels and pigeons. But because
I've owned some rural land in Vermont since the 1960s, a surprising number of
critters have passed through my life, though I've never owned a single one of
them. Some have made an impression.

There was the pair of geese, Brady and Lady, who liked to peck at the backs of
my knees and also liked to frighten the children. I once watched my older son
(when he was a small boy) mount a chair and in revenge leak all over Brady, who
was sunbathing. A primitive assertion of dominance. There were chickens, many of
them. I enjoyed the eggs but I was repelled by chicken sexual mores. And then
the ducks. I remember once saying "Those ducks (there was mother and a dozen or
so ducklings) are so loud they could be right in the kitchen." And they were.
The heifers, July and September; I was very fond of September. I loved the way
she cleaned her nostrils with her long tongue. Jackson the runaway horse. A
nameless piglet, whom we boarded one summer, and whom the kids tried to teach to
play soccer with his nose. Despite being assiduously tutored, he never improved.
Rabbits, many of them; pets, not food. The next-door-neighbor's horses, all
noble Morgans, both chestnuts and bays, all pastured on our fields: Gillian,
the lead mare, Liz a wayward rule-bender; Gabe, an ex-boy, very friendly;
Harmony, beautiful as a foal, who liked to look in my pockets for apples.
Also in the back pasture: sheep, Scottish Blackfaces, many of them but no
more than twenty at a time, with none of whom I ever established a proper
one-on-one relationship. Occasionally I helped to track down a stray, but that's
the extent of it. Goats, my favorites, with personality to spare -- dwarf
Nigerians mostly. Excellent pets, excellent playmates for the grandchildren. The
glamorous mysterious rooster who came out of the woods, adopted us, and liked
to  tom-peep into our bedroom. And then these last few years, the miniature
donkeys, Big Joe and Little Joe, who winter in Connecticut and whom members of
the family love for their beauty and the music of their braying.

In a lifetime with pen in hand  or with fingers at the typewriter (or,
latterly, at the word processor), I've written a lot of bad sentences and a
handful of good ones. But last week, I composed my absolute best sentence ever.
It's pure Olympic gold; a bottom-of-the-ninth walk-off bases-loaded HR; a
sensational buzzer-beater. Deathless prose.

Let us pause to savor this extraordinary sentence. "I could have been a better
prairie dog."

Aficionados of Vivian de St. Vrain (fit audience, though few) will remember that
this mellifluous sentence appeared just a few days ago, right here. You can
appreciate it in context, if you will, but heck, the sentence stands alone.

It is beautiful in itself but one can only marvel at its delicate but meaningful
irony. Moreover, (bonus) it's near-perfect iambic pentameter.

It's become, for me, a mantra of sorts. Whenever I start to bemoan my fate, or
deplore my state, or bother myself over some missed opportunity or long-ago
failure, I mumble, "I could have been a better prairie dog."  And I immediately
regain perspective. So it's a sentence that's utile as well as dulce -- as
useful as it is sweet. Classic.

I'm absolutely confident that "I could have been a better prairie dog" will
help me through episodes of middle-of-the-night self-laceration. In fact, it's
working just as I write this.

Title: Slavery in Brooklyn, Oh No!
Date: January 05, 2020

Of all human institutions, slavery must be the most loathsome and soul-
distorting (although wars, genocides, massacres, pogroms, and wrongful
executions are certainly contenders for worst of worst).

It's easy to think that slavery is something ancient and foreign. Not something
to concern ourselves about -- not part our life, nor my life. And yet American
slavery was only eighty years into the past -- the blink of an eye -- when I was
growing up in the 1940s in Flatbush. At P.S 217 or at Erasmus Hall, neither our
textbooks nor our teachers made much of its recency. Slavery was not our past;
not here, not in Flatbush. It was a crime of the distant South -- of Mississippi
and Alabama, long ago. In the land of cotton, not the land of Coney Island and
Jackie Robinson. Slavery was distant chronologically and geographically.

What an unpleasant revelation, then, to encounter the story of Flatbush slavery
in Thomas J. Campanella's painstaking and eloquent history, Brooklyn, The Once
and Future City (Princeton, 2019).

The facts: "slavery was an essential element of New York life in the 17th and
18th centuries." "Only Charleston, South Carolina surpassed New York (i.e.
Manhattan) in the number of enslaved residents." Campanella reports that there
was "no place in New York that had more slaves per capita than Kings county,
where one in three residents was in bonded servitude." One in three? In my
neighborhood?  How could we not have known this?  How have we remained
oblivious?

Slavery, I now learn, was especially established in "Dutch towns like New
Utrecht, where 75 percent of white households owned slaves." And also "in
Midwout [our Midwood] where African-Americans constituted 41 percent of the
population in 1790."

In 1790, the population of the town of Flatbush -- my Flatbush -- included 378
enslaved people, 12 free black people, and 551 white people – 75% of whom
were slaveholders.The farmers of Brooklyn "formed a Southern planter class in
miniature."

And it was the farmlands of Brooklyn -- Flatbush, Flatlands, Gravesend, and New
Utrecht -- that supplied Manhattan with grain and fruits and vegetables raised
with slave labor. No slaves, no Brooklyn; no Brooklyn, no Big Apple.

In 1799, the New York state legislature passed the Gradual Manumission Act:
all children born of slave women after July 4 were to be free though they must
remain indentured to their masters until the age of twenty-five for women and 28
for men. Though it seems a weak and toothless compromise, the new laws led to
the rapid decline of slavery. In 1827, one hundred and ninety-three years ago,
slavery was declared illegal in New York. (Vermont, to its credit, had abolished
slavery two generations before, in 1777).

Here's a Brooklyn bill of sale for "one certain neger girl called Anna" to Jan
Lefferts for thirty-eight pounds. Her owner, Gilleyam Cornel, was illiterate. He
signed with "his mark."

From what I've learned in the past about the history of Brooklyn, and with these
revelations, it's undeniable that the haunts of my childhood (East 9 Street, P.
S. 217, St. Rose of Lima, Newkirk Station), were not very long ago farmed with
slave labor. It's horrible and disillusioning, but it must be acknowledged.

Title: Sleep, difficulty with
Date: January 09, 2020

The hardest part of my day is the night. Sleep does not come easy -- has never
come easy. I regularly wake at 2:00 am, and stay awake for two or three hours.
I use this time to fret about the state of the Earth (precarious), the state of
the nation (doomed), and whether that new black spot on my left ankle will lead
to agonizing death, or perhaps (best case scenario) merely to amputation at the
hip. I then sleep fitfully until dawn, the last hours of the night crowded with
grotesque, humiliating nightmares, worse by a long shot than anything Gregor
Samsa could possibly imagine.

Last night, up again, I experienced a moment of clarity -- a revelation, an
epiphany. Here it comes:

My mattress is just the right degree of firmness -- I sleep neither on the hard
earth nor on a gunny sack of corn husks. My blankets are soft Egyptian cotton
-- not leaves or newspapers. I rest my head on an authentic goose-down pillow.
There are no rats scrabbling under my bed, no poisonous spiders descending
from the ceiling, no lions roaring outside the door. No bedbugs or parasites
or mosquitoes or scorpions. I'm dry and warm. The temperature of my bedroom
is well-regulated: forced air heat in the winter, cooling breezes or air
conditioning in the summer. I'm well fed, not kept awake by gnawing hunger. No
noxious smells or hideous shrieks. No pains, cramps, headaches, or wounds.

I know that my situation is luxurious and is certainly superior to all of my
ancestors and to 99% of the human beings on the planet,

I am thankful that I have nothing whatever to grumble at, but I feel that I'm
unappreciative. To lie awake as I do, not sleeping, is to scorn society's gifts.
How my forebears would have reveled in my taken-for-granted comforts!

No question but that I should be much more grateful.

"Lack of gratitude" will be the principal worry during tonight's insomnia.

Just when you think that the movie industry has run the amnesia well bone dry,

great disease for screenwriters! a disease that keeps on giving -- and with no
end in sight.

This time, Dr. Martin Harris, ostensibly a biotechnologist but in reality a
professional assassin, is involved in an automobile accident. Harris wakes up
in the hospital but of course without memory. He comes to believe that he's
actually the scientist he's pretending to be -- and so do the amnesia-naive
among the audience. (I'm giving away the gimmick, but it doesn't matter because
no one is going to see this movie ever again. No audience, therefore no spoiler.

Implausible, derivative, threadbare. No cliche left unborrowed: two separate car
chases, a coma, a mysterious new girlfriend, double agents, an international
assassination syndicate, a sadistic hit man, doctored photos, phony passports,
suspenseful countdown to the explosion of the terrorist bomb, etc. The usual
stuff.

On the other hand: Unknown is slick, expensive, well acted, well paced; well

prefer psychological credibility. Candy for connoisseurs of the infinite variety

Title: Frequentatives Perplex Me
Date: January 24, 2020

Frequentatives perplex me. Even on good days, I can't tell a frequentative from
an iterative or what used to be called a present progressive or even from a
simple present that expresses a continuing action, such as "he walks to work" --
in the sense that he walks every day or many days, not just once. So instead of
struggling with definition and nomenclature, I'll confine these paragraphs to
old-fashioned frequentatives formed in the traditional way -- by the addition of
an "-er" or "-le" suffix.

"Wrestle" is a gold star, certified frequentative. The verb "wrest" means "to
grab" or "to snatch." The verb "wrestle" implies that the grabbing or snatching
does not occur in one unique instance, but continues over a stretch of time.
Wrestle is therefore the frequentative of wrest. In the English language, such
frequentatives were once upon a time regularly produced. No longer, apparently;
more's the pity. Frequentative productivity has hit rock bottom.

Frequentatives in "-er" are not always obvious, inasmuch as the "-er-" suffix is
also used for agency and for comparison. But frequentatives do follow a pattern:
blab yields blabber; gleam yields glimmer; climb, clamber; float, flutter; put,
putter; slide, slither.

"-le" frequentatives are more common and more varied. Consider the relation
between "fond" and "fondle". '"Fond" meant something like "to be in love, to
dote." Somewhere before its first appearance in print in 1796, fond acquired an
-le to become "fondle" = caress.  (Fondle in its turn generated "fondlesome" --
a word which went from neologism to obsolete in an 18th century flash, and whose
extinction is much to be regretted. Let's revive "fondlesome".)

Here's a short list of intriguing -le frequentatives: crumb, crumble; drip,
dribble; nose, nuzzle; prick, prickle; daze, dazzle; joust, jostle; prate,
prattle; spark, sparkle; spit, spatter; stride, straddle; suck, suckle. Not all
of these frequentatives are as obvious as wrest-wrestle and some cases must be
confirmed with the help of a good etymological dictionary.

Frequentatives have a long history. Why can't they make a comeback? Take a verb
such as "jump." Doesn't English need "jumple," a word that would accurately
describe the deportment of my twin 4-year-old grandsons. They don't just jump
-- they jumple. Sometimes they leaple. Other useful suggestions: hit, hittle;
throw, throwel; run, runnle; hop, hopple. Scream, scrimmle. The possibilities,
obviously, are endless.

The time has come for a Frequentative Renaissance.

minute subway ride away, trust me, no tourists ever made it to our isolated
grimy neighborhood.

In the middle 50s, when I was a pupil at Flatbush's semi-famous Erasmus Hall
High School, I worked after school shelving books in the McDonald Avenue branch
of the Brooklyn Public Library. I worked two or three days a week from 3 pm to
6 pm and earned seventy-five cents large an hour. A frugal young fellow (cheap
as dirt, some say), I saved every penny, and I was proud to be able to pay
my first year's Cornell tuition ($900). It was a good job for me; I handled
a lot of books and because I was an omnivorous reader and an autodidact by
nature, I borrowed and chewed over many a volume that I wouldn't otherwise
have encountered. Plus I was able to sneak peeks at the contents of the 612.6
shelves.

It was at the McDonald library, which was barely more than a storefront, that I
experienced the first glimmer of an idea that there might be a world elsewhere.

The library staff was organized hierarchically. At the very bottom were the
part-time shelvers like myself. Masters of the Dewey Decimal System, we had no
greater qualification than the ability to remember the order of the letters
in the alphabet. A long step up were the clerks, who checked books out and
in, issued library cards, and collected fines. Clerks, like shelvers, were
native to the neighborhood. But then there was the "professional staff" -- five
people with degrees in "library science" who answered inquiries at the reference
desk, advised borrowers, and purchased books. The "pros" were not from the
neighborhood; they lived across the river In Manhattan and took the elevated
Culver Line to the stop at Ditmas, and they intrigued me.

Miss Owen -- Alice Owen -- head librarian, imbued with gloom, was an extremely
small, thin, clipped, austere woman with an unBrooklynish Maine or northern New
England accent. Archetype of the proper maiden lady -- sexless in my view, but
then, as I learned later, who can ever tell?  Miss Owen was, how shall I say
this respectfully, detail-oriented. There was Miss Warren, from South Dakota, a
fan of Senator McCarthy, who explained to me that the world's brown and black
people had benefited enormously from colonialism. Exotic Mr. O'Shea, obviously
gay (but of course I didn't recognized it at the time) from North Carolina,
a young man with more hip sway than Miss America and who actually -- hard to
believe -- referred to our borrowers of color as "jungle bunnies." I was stunned
and horrified. Miss Kyvelos, whose parents were Greek fishermen and who was as
round and warm as Miss Owen wasn't.

And then, another kettle of fish entirely, Bob Reisner, a 30ish bearded
Greenwich Village writer (not an entirely successful one, or he wouldn't have
been working at the library) who hung with jazz musicians and who was writing
a biography of Charlie Parker. He was a type entirely new to me -- skeptical,
disrespectful, "anti-establishment." Borderline hipster. In strong contrast to
the McDonald convention, his demeanor and language were lecherous, and he was
more frank about his desires than anyone I knew, though whether his lusts and
triumphs were real or imaginary I don't know. He was compiling a book called
"Show me the Good Parts" -- a catalog of the sex scenes in contemporary novels.
Pornographically speaking, he was way in advance of his time.

On the whole, the McDonald library was quite an eye-opener for provincial me.
I stayed on through the summer of 1956, then headed for Ithaca, where more
surprises awaited.

February 10. Thinking over what I've written, I can now correct my initial
memory. Miss Owen wasn't the head of the library. That position was held by
Miss Boies. Miss Owen was a figure of authority because she was in charge of
the part-time shelvers like myself. Miss Boies was also a librarian who came to
us directly from central casting by way of Ohio. At some point, she retired and
was replaced by much younger Mrs. Gerstner, who contracted cancer and died only
a few months after her arrival. I clearly remember her valedictory words to me,
"Get the most out of life."

And also, I wonder why Mrs. Gerstner and Bob Reisner took the time to talk to
me. I had nothing to offer them. Is it possible that they saw me as a youth of
promise. If so, they were over-optimistic.

Title: Dreaming Noirly
Date: February 11, 2020

I must be watching too many 1940-50s film noirs. They're infiltrating my dreams.

Last night, in my very own bedroom, I hosted a noir festival. Fragments of a
more intricate dream are all I can remember now, but the bits my memory retained
were mighty vivid. The dream featured an attractive young couple. He's handsome
in a Barry Sullivan way but unidentifiable; she's delicate, like Coleen Gray in
Kiss of Death (1947) or possibly like fragile young Janet Leigh in Touch of Evil
(1957). Some "mugs" want these young folks iced (the dream didn't say why) and
they want it done in the most painful possible manner. The scene then cut to a
rickety wood-framed house which replicated the building in the dude ranch run
by Mercedes McCambridge in Lightning Strikes Twice (1951).The goons break in
and sadistically slash the guy's throat and handcuff the girl to a post, then
set the house on fire (which copied the ending of Kiss Me, Deadly [1955]). Next
thing I knew, the young lady was alive (the dream didn't say how she escaped
the flames) and was being recruited and disguised by a trio of FBI or police
officers. Not plastic surgery, just makeup and a change of costume. The plan was
for her to go underground to identify and expose the hoodlums (a plot device
common to numberless noirs).

When I awoke, I was impressed by the imaginative work of my dreamatorium. "Not
a bad plot," I said to myself. "Not brilliant, but original enough to serve.
Add a car chase, a blonde songstress, a natty but corrupt district attorney, a
crusading newspaperman, some heavies (Moroni Olsen and Mike Mazurki, perhaps),
a heist gone bad, a skinny stoolie with a toothpick in his mouth, and a little
amnesia, and you've got yourself a movie."

I should add that this dream came to me in high contrast black-and-white.
Excellent camera work. Well-directed. Think Phil Karlson or Ida Lupino. With
gowns by Orry-Kelly.

Title: Even More Wisdom
Date: February 19, 2020

I have the hardest time remembering the number of stars in our home galaxy,
the Milky Way. Is it 300 million or 300 billion?  Either number is so far
out of my ken, so far beyond my ability to grasp, that it won't stick in my
head. Moreover, it doesn't seem to make much of a difference. But now I've
checked once again -- and it's 300 billion stars (ballpark --  not an exact
door-to-door census). That's three thousand millions of stars. Also, it's
130,000 light years from one side of the galaxy across to the center (the
radius). The mass of our galaxy is 1.5 trillion solar masses. Does that figure
include or exclude Dark Matter? I don't know.

That's just the start. The full story is even more astonishing still. In
addition to the Milky Way, there are approximately 34 billion galaxies such as
ours in the universe. Or there used to be until a few years ago; the most recent
estimate is 100 billion galaxies. From my standpoint, here on what Shakespeare
naively called "the sure and firm-set Earth" -- a smallish planet revolving
around the lucky old sun in one of the spiral arms of the Milky Way -- whether
there are 34 billion or 100 billion galaxies out there doesn't much change the
situation. In a nutshell: it's big; we're little.

Even seventy years ago, when I was a boy just starting to learn about the stars,
the universe was smaller and simpler. No one told me, because no one knew, about
the Big Bang, about star formation, about black holes and supermassive black
holes, standard candles, quasars, exoplanets, etc. Knowledge is expanding as
rapidly as the universe; it's only a few centuries ago that Galileo was sent to
his room for proving that Earth wasn't a still point at the center of the world.
"Eppure, si muove."

Actually, I'm glad that Copernicus and Galileo and Newton de-centered the
universe. I rather prefer being insignificant. Standing at the center of the
universe -- well, it was too much responsibility, too much pressure. It's mighty
consoling to be trivial. It helps to put our daily woes in perspective.

Is it more staggering that the universe is so ridiculously immense or that
members of our species have had the smarts to figure it out. Not only the
engineering skills to devise telescopes and spacecrafts to gather the data, but
the brains to think abstractly and mathematically. And the courage to do so.
We're an accomplished and admirable species when we're not torturing and killing
each other for no particular reason. I'm proud of us, some of the time.

When my father was the age I am now, he said to me, "As far as I can figure, I'm
just a link in a long chain going from nowhere to nowhere." He was exactly on
target. But we should also remember that the chain of which he spoke includes
Bach and Rembrandt and Einstein. And you and me  And as long as I remain a link
in that chain, I intend to make the most of my insignificant existence -- the
only one I have.

"That which we are, we are."

Title: Big Bangs
Date: February 24, 2020

Even though the universe is only 13.8 billion years old, more or less, the era
of star formation is nearly complete. Because our universe expands so rapidly,
the effects of gravity continue to lessen and therefore matter will soon cease
to clump. Existing stars and galaxies will become more and more isolated. In
a hundred billion years, the universe will be a thousand times larger than it
is now. After a trillion years, all the stars will have burnt themselves out,
except for slow-burning, feeble red dwarfs. In a hundred trillion years the
Degenerate Era arrives and the universe will be populated only by white dwarfs
and brown dwarfs, along with neutron stars and black holes, all fainter and
fainter with time. It will all be dark, except when a rare supernova erupts.
After 1034 years, atoms themselves will decay into protons and neutrons. In 1040
years, all of what we think of as matter will have become photons and leptons.
Later, black holes themselves will leak photons and disappear. It's the Dark
Era: just random electrons and positrons that rarely encounter each other -- 
an inactive universe that suffers from Heat Death. It's all dark, dead, and
cold. This sorry state will continue for all eternity.

it's a gloomy scenario, but I don't believe it. It doesn't make sense. And it
doesn't account for Dark Matter and Dark Energy, which no one knows anything
about except that they must exist perhaps in the form of neutrinos. Most
physicists seem to believe that the visible, palpable universe, which contains
the galaxies and the stars and the planets and you and me, is only about 6% of
the whole kit and kaboodle.

My own theory, unsupported by observation, evidence,  or calculation, is that
the universe will continue to expand for billions of years, and then Dark Matter
will kick in, gravity will plump up and spring to new life, and the universe
will start to contract. A few thousand billion years further on and here comes
the Big Crunch, when all matter will contract to a point and then, mirabile
dictu, another Big Bang and it's off to the races. Expand. Wait a few thousand
trillion years. Contract. More years -- expand. Contract. Expand. Again and
again. My universe pulses, for all eternity. Et saecula saeculorum; in aeternum
et ultra. No beginning, no end.

The scientific consensus universe is this: start with the Big Bang, end with
the eternal Dark Era. It's one-way ticket. My universe is round-trip. Multiple,
infinite round-trips. The astronomers have the data and the numbers and theory
on their side, but they can't explain how it all happened, or why? Why the Big
Bang? What was going on before all the Banging began? They don't have a glimmer
of an idea, not a clue; in fact, they punt and claim that it's impossible to
know what happened in the first few fractions of seconds. But my universe has no
start and no stop. It just is.

Neither their theory nor mine answers the implicit question, which some might
call philosophical or theological: "why is there something rather than nothing?"
But my idea has the advantage in that it defers that question indefinitely.
"What happened at the Big Bang? "Well, what happened is what always happens at
Big Bangs."

(Information about the end of the universe is adapted from David J. Eicher, The
New Cosmos (Cambridge University Press, 2015), an excellent introduction that
is written so lucidly that I understood maybe 60% to 70% of the whole. Well,
perhaps a little less. It's not Eicher's fault if I've gotten anything wrong.)

Title: Written for my Grandchildren
Date: February 25, 2020

Dear T, O, E, L, L, C, and A:

A friend told us that when she entered Pomona College in 1961, it was the custom
that all the newly arriving women ("co-eds" they were called in those dark days)
were "measured" by the sophomore men. She said that the women were lined up
and their measurements (height, weight, bust, waist, hips) taken and announced
to the assembled spectators. This shameful blast from the past shocked and
embarrassed me.

I'm five years older than our friend, but I'm glad to say that I never heard of
any remotely similar goings-on at the college I attended. (Maybe such things
happened in the backward, benighted frat clubs, but surely, I hope hope hope,
not in my part of the campus). In fact, I was a bit skeptical of our friend's
story -- it being so grotesque -- so I searched a Pomona alumni website for
confirmation and found this picture. I'm sorry to say that the evidence is
incontrovertible.

Tale of the tape, 1961.

Crew-cut boy is smiling, and I think I understand why. He's almost touching
shirtwaist girl's breasts. In those pre-Vietnam years, female virginity was
still a mystical virtue, mechanical contraception (there were no pills) was
near-impossible to obtain and prone to failure, pregnancy before marriage was a
life-shattering disgrace, and abortion was illegal and sometimes fatal. It might
be that taking the measure of the young lady's bosom was the sexual pinnacle of
crew-cut boy's four years in college. Nevertheless, I'm puzzled that shirtwaist
girl is so amenable to the taping. Is she actually smiling? Doesn't she realize
that she's participating in an absurd demeaning dehumanizing rite?

I asked our Pomona friend how she dealt with the ritual. "Well," she said,
"here's what I did. I went downtown and bought a large size inflatable bra.
I put it on and blew it up to monumental proportions. I brought a pin to the
ceremony. I planned to pop the bra just as I was being measured, but the thing
was so tough it didn't deflate as planned. I wish it had. That was my protest.
I should have done more. It was difficult to buck tradition. When things are
customary, taken for granted, it takes a lot of strength to go against the
system even when you know it's wrong."

Here's another story, young 'uns, from the same era. In 1960, your grandmother,
AGP, began teaching mathematics in Newton, Massachusetts. Her salary was $4200
a year, but if she had been a man, it would have been $4300. The district had
two salary scales, one for men and one for women. I remember studying a printed
schedule that had one column labelled M and one labeled F. The difference
between M and F was small, but it increased with every year of experience.
However small or large the discrepancy, it was still an insult and an injustice,
designed as much to assert superiority and inferiority as to make an economic
difference.

Both AGP and I knew it was wrong, but I'm embarrassed to say that we did not
protest. Before "equal pay for equal work," it was taken for granted that Fs
would be paid less than Ms. Why didn't we argue, agitate, organize?  Because we
were paralyzed, I think, by the powerful forces of custom and convention.

I wonder about crew-cut boy. Was he forever locked into 1960 attitudes or did he
eventually come to enlightenment? What sort of relations did he establish with
mature women? And did he, perhaps, have a daughter? Would he have advised her to
attend Pomona College, and if he did so, did he try to ascertain whether first-
year female students were still being measured?

I wonder also about the abuses in our society that we notice but tolerate
because they are so embedded in the culture. And even more so, by the abuses
we don't notice but will be clearly apparent in a generation or two. Which of
today's events will look as antiquated and rearward in fifty years as that
Pomona ritual?

Title: "What Wondrous Life is This I Lead"
Date: March 04, 2020

"Now for my life," the doctor* boasted, "it is a miracle of [eighty] years,
which to relate, were not a history but a piece of poetry." Sir Thomas didn't
know the half of it; if his life was a miracle, then mine is a hundred times
more so. Yesterday the miracles started first thing in the morning when I drove
(I own a horseless carriage -- a circumstance Sir T. couldn't possibly have
imagined) to our spanking new hospital to have my innards inspected. The MRI
doughnut deployed a couple of teslas worth of magnetism to spin my protons into
images, a process which, though incomprehensible to me, is a heck of a lot less
agonizing than extracting the information from my personal body with scalpel
and stand-by sponge, and is significantly more informative than inspecting
my urine, which is what a seventeenth-century doctor like Browne would have
done. Later, I took a short walk to the local bank to take care of business
and moved some, well, not exactly money but virtual or magic money from one
account to another. Back home, I conversed by cell to NGP who was on the road
to Virginia in a horseless carriage of his own. Inasmuch as he was behind the
wheel, we skipped the face time feature. Nevertheless the long-distance mobile
communication experience was plenty miraculous. The climax of my day was a walk
to a neighborhood theater where Angela Hewitt blessed us with an exquisitely
rendered performance of Bach's Goldberg Variations. She was in a zone; I was
riveted. Is it more wondrous that Bach composed the Variations, that Ms. Hewitt
performed them with such delicate power, or that the concert took place right
around the corner, almost at my doorstep?  After the Bach, the day being
now almost over, along came still another miraculous moment when I watched,
supine in my own bed, in real time, the last minutes of an NBA game beamed in
from Boston, Massachusetts, two thousand miles to the east, and almost at the
Atlantic Ocean. It was an excellent game -- a stunning win for the Brooklyn
Nets, and an equally remarkable triumph for my pixel-rich widescreen TV. It was
a long day and a varied one, and I was beat, so while snuggling a-bed with the
lady friend (an intimacy that is not only a miracle but a piece of poetry to
boot), I instructed Alexa to give us a little opera. Alexa complied and chose
WQXR in NYC, and for a drowsy hour we were grateful operavores.

No question but that my day was comprised of a series of miracles, each one more
incredible than the other.

Nor do I even bother to tally daily miracles so commonplace that we cease to
notice them: water in (both cold and hot) and waste out, electricity, central
heating and A/C, refrigeration, natural gas to cook by, big bright cheerful
windows, etc.

"What wondrous life is this I lead."

Title: First Days at Cornell, September 1956.
Date: March 07, 2020

Early in September of 1956, I found my way from Flatbush to Hoboken and there
boarded the old Lehigh Valley Railroad (the 'Leaky V') for the eight-hour ride
to Ithaca. Surely I was the most naive and callow lad ever to set foot on the
grounds of Cornell University. I was ignorant and provincial and I had never so
much as visited a college campus. Although I lived a bicycle ride's distance
from Brooklyn College, I had never been either enterprising or curious enough
to ride by and take a gander. What I knew of higher education was what I had
gleaned from 1940s black-and-white movies in which mature-looking but prankish
fellows in raccoon coats smoked pipes and harmonized and made fun of the 'prexy'
and of the bespectacled 'profs' and who were unworthy of the attractive coeds
they pursued until just before the final fadeout when they reformed themselves
enough to earn a kiss and a wink. Nor did I have the slightest idea what was
signified by the wink.

I arrived at Cornell a few days before classes began. During those first days I
had three separate mind-shattering experiences.

The first: one morning, I took my newly-purchased map and set out on a long
walk (probably to avoid one of those atavistic rah-rah events which Cornell
favored and to which I was constitutionally averse). Sometime during the day's
wandering I came across a road sign that read "CITY LIMITS." It was as if I had
been struck by lightning. Until the moment that I encountered that sign, I had
no idea that a city could have limits. Regular readers of this blague know that
I spent my first seventeen years in the interior regions of darkest Brooklyn, a
large borough in an even larger city from which there was no exit and certainly
no "limit" -- especially not while on foot. My family, my family of origin, was
automobile-free and I myself had left the neighborhood precincts only a handful
of times. Although unworldly, I was nevertheless capable of extrapolation.
If it was possible to pass beyond the city limits, then perhaps it was also
possible to re-negotiate other limitations that I had assumed were eternal
or unalterable. I walked past the sign and transcended the city of Ithaca. I
couldn't go very far because my map went blank, so after a hundred or so feet I
hustled back -- but for the first time in my life I had stepped over the line.

The next day: terra incognita of an entirely different order. I wandered into
the McGraw Library and found myself in the periodical room. Until the moment
that I entered that space, I was acquainted only with magazines that would be
found in a barbershop or in a dentist's office -- Life and Look and Collier's
and The Saturday Evening Post and, for profound intellectual stimulation, the
National Geographic. And yet here was a room with an apparently limitless number
of periodicals: Journal of Physical Chemistry, Journal of Theology, Journal of
Metaphysics, Journal of Medieval Studies, Journal of Biblical Archeology. I had
no idea that there were such periodicals nor did I know that there were such
areas of knowledge. Was there in truth a subject called anthropology?  and
various shades of anthropology -- cultural, physical, linguistic? To say that
I was wide-eyed does not do justice to width of my eyes. I spent hours leafing
through these publications. I didn't understand much of what I read, but I did
realize that there were things going on in the world for which P. S. 217 and
EHHS and Flatbush had not prepared me.

A third and most miraculous occurrence. My assigned roommate arrived. His
name was Harry Wallace Blair II. He was delivered to campus by his parents
and his grandparents. I was introduced to his family, and, wonder of wonders,
his grandparents spoke English. Coming from immigrant Brooklyn, I had never
encountered grandparents who spoke English. Or imagined that there could be any
such. Italian, yes. Polish, certainly. Yiddish, of course. But English, never.
I was totally flabbergasted. I wonder whether Harry's grandparents noticed my
repeated gasps.

Oh, yes, I forgot one other event of the first Cornell week. Classes began.
I enrolled for introductory chemistry -- a big mistake. Chem, I quickly
discovered, was not where my talents lay. It was a large lecture class --
possibly 300 or 400 students. We all sat for a math screening test. Quite
in error, I was assigned to a special advanced section of twenty students
supposedly talented in mathematics. In the class were nineteen men and one
woman. Can you guess, grandchildren and regular readers, who was that woman?

Title: Amnesia on Film: The Vow (2012)
Date: March 17, 2020

Amnesia movies are not absolutely fettered to reality, nor should they be.
Hollywood amnesia, as has been frequently noted, is the most flexible and
variable of illnesses. Nevertheless, The Vow (2012) breaks new ground in want
of integrity. One reviewer called it a "heartless, soulless jumble," but that's
letting it off easy.

A young woman, played by perky Rachel McAdams, suffers an automobile accident
and forgets the five years of her marriage to a young man, played by wooden
mumbling Channing Tatum. The couple stumbles around for ninety bumbling minutes
but eventually he wins her back in cliche date-movie, rom-com tearjerk fashion.
Loss of memory, which in any close-to-reality situation would be psychologically
troublesome if not utterly disabling, proves to be of no more consequence than
the loss of a pair of shoes or eyeglasses. Simplistic, superficial, offensive.

The film advertises itself as based on real events. Loosely based, I'd say,
because in actual fact, there was an accident and she suffered loss of memory,
but he had an affair, the marriage crumbled, and they divorced. But that was in
another country, one in which real human beings might dwell.

"No redeeming characteristics" says another reviewer. The film is especially
not redeemed by expressionless Channing Tatum, who fumbles and garbles a higher
percentage of his dialog than any actor in the history of Hollywood.

In this one, I see two deer (it's not clear whether they're mule or white tail)
lolling on the ridge line. They're semi-anthropomorphic -- they look like deer,
but they're sprawled on the ground as if in a reading position, each supporting
his head with one hand (or hoof). I climb to where they are lying and join
them, but the terrain is very steep and I tumble backward  head over heel a
hundred or so feet into a swampy thicket. The deer follow me gingerly. There's
a fadeout. Next thing I know, I'm lying on the back of one of the deer just
like in the westerns when a dead man is carried back to town  horseback.  The
deer take me home -- to a log cabin, unfamiliar to me, in the woods. My friends
unload me, and one of them says, "We should do something for the deer." I say,
"OK, let's not shoot them."  End of dream.

Once again, my nighttime life is orders of magnitude more imaginative that my
daytime existence.

Title: Susan P. (1937-38)
Date: April 04, 2020

This entry is written at the specific instruction of my daughter, who says,
"your grandchildren will want to know about your birth. It's their history too."
The following paragraphs are for them and for their descendants.

My older sister, Susan, died of pneumonia at the age of nine months on March 15,
1938. If she had lived, I wouldn't exist, nor would my ten descendants, and no
one would notice.

I was born on March 11, 1939, just one year minus four days after Susan died. It
seems obvious that I was purposely conceived as a substitute for the dead child
-- and it therefore follows that I was delivered into a disrupted, stressed
family. Was I to be treasured as a compensation for past grief or to be resented
as an imperfect interloper? Or both, simultaneously? To raise the ante, it is
also a fact that during that fatal March of 1938 when Susan lay dying, my older
brother Eugene, then just shy of three years of age, was gravely ill of the same
disease that killed his younger sister, and that although he was at death's
door, he managed to pull through.

So let us consider the situation of my parents, Manny and Lil, in June of
1938, the month of my conception. Poor Susan lay a-mouldering in her tiny
grave for just three months. The Great Depression was still going strong
and Hitler's Nuremberg Laws had been in force since 1935. Father Coughlin,
celebrity Jew- hater, was agitating thirty million American radio listeners a
week. Kristallnacht was just five months away and most everyone knew that war
was imminent. Residing on East 9th Street in Flatbush were my grief-stricken
young parents, who had helplessly watched one child die and had come within a
hairbreadth of losing another. We must imagine them reeling, tearful, clinging
to one another, dealing as best they might with heartbreaking anxiety and pain.
Yet despite public and personal disasters, they made the courageous choice to
throw the dice again, and out of their anguish to bring forth another child
-- and to run the real risk, in those pre-antibiotic days, of offering still
another sacrifice to pneumonia or some other dread incurable illness.

If my parents were still alive, I'd congratulate them, celebrate them, not
because their resilience produced me, but because to beget a substitute child in
chaotic, dangerous 1938 seems to me, now, looking back from the perspective of
2020, to be an act of unfathomable courage.

Or so I would like to think. It's also possible that I'm here not because of
their heroism but because of a failure of contraception. I'll never know.
I didn't ask; they never said, and the facts are unrecoverable. Lil and
Manny wouldn't dream of speaking aloud about anything so intimate as sex or
reproduction, certainly not with their children and, who knows, perhaps not
even with one another. In that regard, they were typical of their generation.
Personal matters were kept close to the vest.

When Lil was five months pregnant, Hitler annexed the Sudetenland. Exactly three
weeks before I landed on this planet, 20,000 Nazi supporters rallied, complete
with Fascist salutes, at the old Madison Square Garden on 49th Street. Four days
after I arrived, on the anniversary --the yahrzeit -- of the death of little
Susan, while my mother was regaining her strength in Manhattan's Park East
hospital on East 83rd Street, German tanks rolled into Czechoslovakia. For Lil,
for Manny, personal and public crises intersected. Nazis foreign and domestic
were at the gates, and inside the hospital, my mother was still mourning the
loss of the little girl whom my Uncle Dan, my mother's brother, remembered as
an "exceptionally beautiful child." And lying beside Lil in her bed was the
newborn, who was welcomed with joy, I'm sure, but with ambivalence also. Not
an eternally glowing-in-memory girl child but me --an undistinguished chap, to
put it in the most favorable light. Not "trailing clouds of glory" but instead
enveloped in a fog of danger and possibly regret.

My parents, as I have said, kept their emotions tightly buttoned, so while Susan
was not mourned or even mentioned within the family, she was never forgotten. In
fact, throughout my childhood she remained a mysterious ghostly presence. In my
parents' bedroom was a simple display -- a child-size wood-and-wicker chair and
above it, on the wall, a gold-framed picture of a very pretty infant. The shrine
fascinated me, and I would sneak into my parent's bedroom to study it. Sneak?
Yes, because their bedroom was a consecrated place not to be defiled by Eugene
or Jonathan or me. Off limits. It was the sin of all childhood sins to violate
the taboo and cross into the forbidden zone. My mother made an unholy fuss about
this rule. "You are not to go into our bedroom. Ever." Which I did, regularly,
when no one was looking --- but it felt like a midnight intrusion into a deep
dark country graveyard. Very creepy. Who is that infant in the picture? And why
is she not allowed to rest in peace? I knew better than to ask.

I never thought, then, to wonder how Manny and Lil, contemplating the gilded
idol morn and eve, could fail to compare their frozen-in-time lost infant to her
scruffy successor? Of course I was aware that my "difficult" mother was a deeply
troubled woman. But never, trust me, did I have the least glimmer that the shade
of the dead infant haunted our family -- and myself in particular. No child,
certainly not me, would have been so insightful. It's transparent now, but it
was anything but obvious then. Nor could anyone possibly have predicted that
there was to be an area of study within the discipline of psychology called "The
Replacement Child Syndrome" (RCS). And that I was unequivocally a textbook case
of such.

RCS lay dormant. Forty years later, and forty years ago, when I was in midlife,
not having thought for decades about my dead sister or her shrine or my long-
departed parents, I experienced something of a revelation. It came about
indirectly, but dramatically.

I was teaching classes on Shakespeare's plays. and I found myself paying much
more heed to Romeo and Juliet than that immature early tragedy warrants. I
was especially intrigued by Shakespeare's invention of the character of young
Juliet -- which is far more subtle than is necessary for the plot. With Juliet,
Shakespeare attempted something utterly unprecedented in any previous work of
literature. He cleverly situated his young heroine in a complicated family
in which Juliet had, in effect, two mothers -- a birth mother, Capulet wife,
who is cold, distant and aloof, and a metaphorical and therefore real mother,
Nurse Angelica, who is undisciplined but sensual and sexual. The two mothers,
carefully differentiated, precipitate or echo or explain the conflict within
Juliet between propriety and passion. One mother embraces and promulgates
Verona's rigid mores, while the other is impulsive, emotional, and anarchic. In
addition -- and now it all was starting to become extremely personal for me --
Shakespeare provided Juliet with a backstory (unusual because his characters
rarely have prior histories). It comes to light that the Nurse's own natural
daughter had died in infancy, that the bereaved mother was engaged to suckle
Juliet -- and that Angelica has been Juliet's surrogate mother and companion
for almost fourteen years. So Juliet is, for the Nurse, clearly and obviously a
replacement child. How curiously relevant! How provocative!

I then remembered that William Shakespeare himself was such a child. According
to the Trinity Church records, John and Mary Shakespeare had suffered two
tragedies before April 23, 1564 when William was born. Their first child, a
daughter named Joan, had been baptized four years earlier, in 1560, but lived
only for two months. A second daughter, Margaret, was baptized in 1562 and lived
for just under one year. A full year! and then the grave! How horrible for all
concerned! Young Will therefore entered the world as the boy child who replaced
not one but two older sisters. Even in an age of staggering infant mortality,
two such premature deaths must surely have weighed on both John and Mary and on
William himself. Is it an accident that Juliet is the only certified replacement
child in early modern English literature (at least, the only one that I can
recall at this moment)?

Mulling these matters, I soon discovered that I had failed to register some
additional facts about the Capulet family that by rights ought to have set
my heart all aflutter. Listen to the Nurse nattering on about her surrogate
daughter Juliet.

Even or odd, of all days in the year,

Come Lamass Eve at night shall she be fourteen,.

Susan and she -- God rest all Christian souls--

Were of an age.  Well, Susan is with God.

She was too good for me.

How could I have missed it?  Right at the heart of the Capulet family dynamics,
and therefore at the heart of the play, is not just a dead infant and a dead
daughter, but a dead Susan.

I have to say that this discovery put my brain into quite an epiphanic tizzy.
How could I not have recognized the parallels between the Capulet family and my
own?  And also, given my near-compulsive interest in the bonds and affiliations
among Capulet wife and Nurse Angelica and Juliet -- how could my conscious mind
have ignored information that had so vexed my unconscious?

Alerted by this 1595 play to my own personal being, I set out to learn about the
Replacement Child Syndrome (RCS) in what is charitably called the "literature"
of psychoanalysis. While almost everything I read was either obtuse or so
encrusted with obscurantist jargon as to be indecipherable, it was not hard to
distill the gist. According to the experts, a replacement is always vulnerable
and at hazard, especially so if the deceased infant has not been properly
mourned, or-- as they say -- if there has not been "closure." Such a lad or lass
goes through childhood constantly judged to be inferior to the idealized dead
child. At worst, the love that is owed to the living child may be withdrawn
and the replacement resented --  less loved, or even unloved; tolerated but
undervalued.

Had she lived, the dead girl, let us call her Susan, of infinite and golden
potential, would certainly have grown up to be an exceedingly dutiful daughter
as well as a concert cellist and a world-class figure-skater who when just two
years out of Yale would have created a state-of-the-art gynecological clinic in
an underserved village in Moldova. The other, the replacement -- me -- bawls
and pukes, bites a neighbor child on the cheek, throws a colossal shitfit over
a missing puzzle piece, shatters an heirloom lamp, steals comic books from the
local candy store, wastes weeks moping in his bedroom, totals the DeSoto, and
fails trigonometry. No wonder he's a disappointment.

Well, maybe I'm laying it on with a trowel, but that's the general idea.

Now (this is still forty years ago) reconstituted as a Syndrome, I entered
into my "poor poor pitiful me" period. I wasted kilowatts of energy and eons
of precious time conceptualizing myself as a case of "wrongful birth." I
shifted the blame for all my emotional foibles onto my parents, especially,
to be honest, onto my mother. Right at her doorstep I laid low self-esteem,
intermittent depression, fear of success, disabling shyness and even (this was
a bit of stretch) procrastination. But it didn't wash and it didn't last. I'm
ashamed and embarrassed that I allowed myself to attribute my personal problems
to my willing but helpless mother. Not that there wasn't a smidgeon of truth
to the RCS analysis. Freud says that "a man who has won the love of his mother
is always a hero in his own eyes"; well, that kind of heroism wasn't going to
be my lot. Of course I would have preferred to have enjoyed intimacy with a
smiling supportive mother. Not what happened. But it was selfish and wrong of me
to dwell on slights which were trivial compared to the traumas undergone by my
parents.They, not me, were and are the heroes of this story.

The bedrock is that the RCS, though real, was only of middling significance
to me. It was devastating for Juliet, because it led directly to her suicide,
and it may have served as a spur to Shakespeare, who became Shakespeare and,
incidentally, fathered a daughter named Susannah. For me -- well, it was it only
important for the moment. I was a wounded child -- no, not wounded, scratched
--but not a disabled one. I was healthy enough to pursue if not a distinguished,
certainly a respectable career, to become a reliable father, to meet my
obligations to my extended family and community and to form a long-lasting
marriage -- and when that first marriage was cut short by disease and death,
to achieve in old age a second mature and satisfying relationship. My parents
must have done a great deal right, for I became what my father used to praise,
without a shred of irony, as a "proper, tax-paying citizen." At this point in
my octogenarian life, there's no room for that old self-pitying me; instead,
there's great admiration and regard for both Lil and Manny, who endured. And
who, in the successes of their grandchildren and great-grandchildren, continue
to thrive and prosper.

An addendum: in the psychological "literature", I found no mention, neither jot
nor tittle, of the family configuration in which a male child replaces a female.
No doubt such situations have by now been thoroughly researched by trained
analysts, but not back then, when such a discussion might have been useful to
me. The case of Juliet, where one girl replaces another, has been explored,
but not Shakespeare's situation, or mine. I wonder sometimes whether the case
of a boy succeeding a girl might lead to gender confusion, or as they now say,
"fluidity" (if, for example, the parents unconsciously favor female traits in
their son). I don't mean sexual practice, because I myself have never been (or
wanted to be) anything other than a vanilla heterosexual. But I'm not even
slightly macho; I am strongly domestic, comfortable with roles that have been
traditionally reserved for women. I'm a gatherer, not a hunter; not the kind
of person who goes to the fights with the guys or plays rugby and eventually,
shunning the entrapment of wife or family, rides off on his horse into the
sunset. I am much more likely to clean the bathroom, weed the garden, make some
bad rhymes, play casino with the grandkids, and whip up a beef stew for dinner.

Another addendum: I always wondered why Lil and Manny decided to give me an
awkward obscure Biblical name. They had no interest in anything remotely
smacking of religion. So why choose the name of one of Job's false comforters? 
What were they thinking?  During my pitiful period, I imagined that they chose
the name because they were disappointed with me. We can't name him Susan, said
their joint unconscious, so let's give him an ugly name the diminutive of which
is female. That was my theory, but now I have another idea. Perhaps, in March
of 1939, to resurrect an obscure biblical name was to give the middle finger to
Hitler. If so, it was an act of defiance. I hope I'm right.

And finally: my younger brother Jonathan, who was as equally improbable a
replacement as I, was born in July of 1942, seven month after the Day of
Infamy. He too entered in troubling times. Jon was an extremely handsome youth,
regularly gushed over by friends and family -- and slightly envied by me. One of
his shaping childhood experiences is of my mother holding his head in her hands
and saying, "You would have made a very beautiful girl."

Jon too is a gatherer rather than a hunter, and when I'm in the kitchen slicing
the potatoes and carrots for a big pot of beef stew, it's his excellent recipe
that I follow.

Title: What Are the Odds?
Date: April 07, 2020

It's a commonplace that every one of us is improbable and accidental -- a fluke
of all flukes. The odds against you or me or any particular person being born,
of coming into life, are infinitesimal -- a positron's dimension (if positrons
have dimension) shy of nothing, of zero.

Why is any birth so unlikely?  To begin, while every sperm is sacred (as we're
told on good authority), every sperm is also unique. There are 200 million or
more of the little whipper-snappers in the normal ounce or so of human male
ejaculate -- each one a quirky unique assemblage of genes. Both your and my
individual existence depends on one particular sperm lashing itself into a
lather to be the first to break the tape. If the sperm with your name on it had
foundered, and the dark horse sperm in the next lane had penetrated the egg, you
yourself wouldn't have been conceived, wouldn't have existed. An entirely other
human being would have suckled at the breast, cried in the crib, perched in
the high chair. If you're a boy, your "other" might have been a girl, and vice
versa.

So we are all many-millions-to-one long shots. But multiply the odds against
you yourself being welcomed to the world by the even more remote odds against
the conceptions of your four grandparents. Your grandmas and grandpapas exist
only because in each case two people out of all the potential great-grandparent-
generation cohort on earth chanced to meet and find a particular opportunity
on a particular day and particular spot of time to copulate so that those
remote grandsires could launch their own flotilla of swimmers upriver. How many
accidents had to occur to compile the particular DNA which comprises your own
identity and individuality?

Then we must add factors such as the strife and wars and migrations and diseases
that united or separated our great-grandfolks and their great-great grandfolks
and yea, even unto our Olduvai forebears and to the pliopithecoids who preceded
them, and then back through the early mammals and to the dark backward and abysm
of time. Gosh, it makes you wonder how anything at all ever happens to happen in
this random chancy aleatory world -- and yet remarkable things (such as you and
I being born) continue to occur. And a good thing, too.

Title: Innogen
Date: April 10, 2020

In Cymbeline (1611?), Shakespeare, still innovating even at the end of his
career, deepens the character of Innogen by supplying her with an unusual
psychological trait. He presents her to us as an escapist or fantasist who leaps
to imagine herself a different person in a different world. Here's Innogen
early in the play, when she realizes that her cross-class marriage to Postumus
(she's a princess, he's a poor but worthy gentleman) is at risk: "Would I were/
A neatherd's daughter, and my Leonatus/ Our neighbor shepherd's son." She
fantasizes herself surrendering her nobility to become a peasant. A few moments
later, she learns that her lover Leonatus and his rival the clotpoll Cloten have
been in a sword fight and that Cloten has retreated. Innogen's reaction: "I
would they were in Afric both together/ Myself by with a needle, that I might
prick/ The goer-back". Why Africa? Because, among other reasons, it is far from
the British court where Innogen's activities are heavily restricted. So in two
short speeches Innogen has expressed willingness to being transformed in both
class and geography. Shortly afterward, Innogen describes (in another "would
that" imagining) how she would have stared at the retreating ship which takes
Postumus into exile: "I would have broke mine eye-strings, cracked them,/ To
look upon him till the dimunition/ Of space had pointed him sharp as my needle."
Indifferent to physical pain, she now imagines herself transcending not only
class and space, but also the limitations of her own body.

It was no accident that Shakespeare gave Innogen such freedom to re-invent
herself, because in the scenes that follow, she will undergo a series of radical
transformations -- from princess to a "franklin's wife," into a boy cooking
fancy food for three cave-dwelling mountain-men, and then a dutiful page to
the general of the invading Roman army, all the while avoiding betrayal,
attempted rape and apparent poisoning. It's a lot for Innogen to deal with,
but Shakespeare knew exactly what he was doing when he started her off with an
imagination equal to the task.

Title: Amnesia on Film: The Unsuspected  (1947)
Date: April 11, 2020

This time, amnesia minus the amnesia. Heiress Matilda Frazier, presumed to have
perished in a shipboard fire, returns home where she's met by Steven Howard who
claims to be her recently-wedded husband. She fails to remember him for the
good reason that she's never met him and hasn't lost her memory. It's a case
of "attributed amnesia." Not a disease at all -- merely a handy plot device,
credible in black-and-white 40s murder mysteries where amnesia is as common
as a slight cold. Matilda is temporarily deceived by Mr.Howard. So are the
spectators.

Terrific direction by Michael Curtiz, fine performance by luminous Joan
Caulfield, reliable work by steady Fred Clark, effortful ventriloquism by
Constance Bennett in a part originally written for Eve Arden.

The Unsuspected borrows much too much from Laura (1944). In addition to the
prominently-displayed portrait, there's Claude Rains channeling Clifton Webb.
Plus the heroine's return from presumed death, the curious sexless relationship
between an older man (the murderer) and a much younger woman. A smitten
investigator. Good thing there's a dollop of fake amnesia to help differentiate
the two films.

Title: Ten Things I Dislike about Films
Date: April 17, 2020

I'm a movie lover, but I'm not indiscriminate. Here follows a list of common
movie occurrences that compel me either to seek out nineteenth-century novels or
force me to bury my head under the blankets.

1. Cute puppies, especially when the boy and the girl kiss for the first time, and the director, unfazed by cliche or rank sentimentality, cuts to the pooch's just darling head-tilt. Even worse when the doggie covers his cute eyes with his cute paw. Aaargh.

2. Child actors, with rare exceptions. Some few gifted children know how to be natural, but most just make me cringe.

3. Gratuitous killing of "redskins," especially when aestheticized. How gracefully, when shot by the cavalry marksmen, do the Comanches plummet from the face of the cliff or tumble down the scree. In Western after Western, they take huge losses -- presenting themselves as targets while they ride crazily around the circled wagons -- a strategy that is cinematic but nonsensical. And also: all the retrogressive, antediluvian blackface and yellowface and brownface stereotypes that make us gasp with horror at our racist forebears.

4. Those far too frequent scenes, where the guy, pursued either by the police or the husband, goes out the 16th story window of his hotel and works his way across a narrow ledge to another window (always unlocked). Such scenes give me the willies.

5. Car chases. Boring, boring, boring. I've discussed this in the past.

6. Montage dating scenes: boy and girl meet cute. After the mandatory misunderstanding, they reconcile, and then we see five seconds of them sitting in a restaurant, smiling; next they're rowing in a boat in the park; then they're on a ferry, or at a picnic etc. etc. From this we are supposed to deduce that they're in love. Predictable cut to the predictable soft-focus bedroom. Romance, which ought to be thrilling, becomes, through repetition and want of originality, almost as boring as a car chase.

7. Funny drunks. They're not funny. Alcoholism is a destructive disease.

8. The scene in which the stoic hero has taken a bullet in the shoulder and it's going to be extracted by an amateur. No anesthetics. "Here, bite on this." Even worse, if possible, when it's not a bullet but an arrow.

9. Background music that dictates the emotions we are supposed to feel. Worse still, the background noise that is currently so fashionable. Not music, just a loud drone, which sometimes drowns the dialogue.

10. Zachary Scott

Also, movies adapted from cartoons: Batman, Superman, etc. Horror films,
designed to scare the pants off you. I can't bear to watch them (I've never
recovered from Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein [1948]). Action films,
especially ones in which a retired CIA agent or detective or whatever is called
back to duty for one last assignment. And finally, anything with zombies,
cyborgs, extraterrestrials, robots, demonic children who vomit blood, or
tentacles.

Title: Amnesias on Films:  Two in the Dark (1936) and Two O-Clock Courage (1945)
Date: April 19, 2020

I've now reported on thirty-two separate amnesia movies and there are surely
many more out there to which I am unacquainted. Why so many? How come
Shakespeare didn't write an amnesia play? Why are there no classic novels about
amnesia? Didn't unsuspecting folks get themselves bopped on the head in previous
centuries? Didn't knights ever fall off their stallions and thwack their helms
and beavers?

Here's an obvious answer to the gimmick's popularity: amnesia provides three of
the major elements of all story-telling: Mystery, Quest, and Identity (or as
Lear puts it, "Who is it that can tell me who I am?") But why is it repeated so
obsessively in film?

Today a twofer, bringing the grand total to thirty-four. In Two in the
Dark (1936), an amnesiac (Walter Abel) comes to awareness on a street corner
and suspects that he has committed a murder. Rest easy; he didn't do any such
thing. But he needs the help of a good-looking out-of-work actress (Margot
Grahame) to establish his innocence. His amnesia is garden variety, "bang-bang".
One blow to the old bean and he forgets who he is; later a second whomp and it
all comes back in a flash (in the form of a flashback). Very convenient, very
tidy, but not very imaginative. The film is languidly paced, almost slow-motion.

Curiously, Two in the Dark was remade nine years afterward as Two O-Clock
Courage with the director of the earlier film serving as the producer of the
later. It was a good idea to try again, because the later film was directed by
Anthony Mann, who keeps things brisk. Although the plot and a great deal of
the dialog was copied wholesale, it's a much better and different film, mostly
because the amnesiac's fellow investigator is now a wise-cracking female taxi-
driver -- a character straight out of the screwball comedies. When she's on
screen, the film becomes a feast of badinage. Tom Conway as the amnesiac is
dignified and expressionless, but Ann Rutherford steals the show as the fast-
talking cabbie.

"Bang-bang" or "thwack-thwack" amnesia arrives and departs easily. It comes
with an on-off switch. Contrary to human psychological experience, it leaves no
residue except for a couple of neat Band-Aids -- one on each side of the head.

Another automobile accident and another hospitalized amnesiac. Once again, the
poor guy might have committed a murder, but he's not sure. And once again,
there's a loyal young woman (Gina McConnell, played by Jennifer Jayne) to help
him reconstruct his past. As well as a beguiling dangerous femme fatale and a
double-dealing psychiatrist. Knockout drops, hallucinations, an escape through
a window, a clever detective, a disappearing corpse, multiple flashbacks. The
usual stuff, another day at the noir office.

The gimmick this time: Chris Smith (Robert Webber) has recovered his memory but
keeps up the pretense so he can solve the murder. Everyone is kept in the dark,
including the befuddled audience. It's a tricky move and highly unpersuasive.
The last line of the Wiki plot summary tells you all you need to know in the way
of cliche: "Chris is reunited with Gina."

Title: Blood and Lust
Date: April 26, 2020

There are so many overlaps between Richard III (1593) and Macbeth (1606) that
it sometimes seems as though Shakespeare pillaged and reformed the earlier
play when he composed the later. Both plays feature cynical upward strivers
("hellhounds," the playwright calls them both) who risk damnation to murder
their way to the throne, and then lose their kingdoms in battle and are
succeeded by spotless young heirs. Both Richard of Gloucester and Macbeth
kill innocent children and both are haunted by the ghosts of those they have
murdered.

Yet the two plays are very different. Macbeth is a tidy economical play
(Shakespeare's second shortest), while Richard III (his second longest) is
sprawling and repetitious, sometimes even bewildering, stuffed to the gills with
incident and declamation. Moreover, Richard III lacks witches, moving forests,
young Malcolm, Macduff's mysterious birth, and above all, ambitious Lady
Macbeth. While Richard is famously amusing, Macbeth hasn't the slightest sense
of humor even though he can be unconsciously ironic.

When similar circumstances arise, as they must, it becomes obvious that the
rhetorical strategies of Richard III are rudimentary compared to the richer and
more satisfying language of Macbeth.

Here is one passage in the earlier play that has an echo or correspondence in
the later. Richard instructs a follower to slander King Edward ("luxury" means
"lust")"

urge his (i.e. Edward's) hateful luxury,And bestial appetite in change of
lust;Which stretch'd unto their servants, daughters, wives,Even where his raging
eye or savage heart,Without control, listed to make a prey.

In Macbeth, Malcolm slanders himself.

There's no bottom, none,In my voluptuousness. Your wives, your daughters,Your
matrons and your maids, could not fill upThe cistern of my lust, and my
desireAll continent impediments would o'erbearThat did oppose my will.

Unbounded lust is the subject of both speeches - "servants, daughters, wives,"
expands into the even more inclusive wives, daughters, matrons, and maids.
Richard's statement is strong, its power strengthened by the litany of allusions
to the uncivil wild: "bestial," "raging," "savage," "prey." Macbeth's is
considerably more powerful, primarily because of the extended metaphor in which
lust is conceived as some sort of fluid. Many an acre foot of lust could be
contained in a "cistern" without a "bottom."  Yet in fact a bottomless cistern
would impound only a portion of Malcolm's sexual gusher which, it seems, is many
times more abundant than a single cisternfull; it's a deluge that "continent
impediments" such as embankments or dikes or dams cannot restrain. It's a
tsunami.

A second correspondence occurs when Richard engages in a moment of self-
evaluation. "But I am in/ So far in blood that sin will pluck on sin;/ Tear-
falling pity dwells not in this eye." Macbeth's improvement: "I am in blood/
Stepped in so far, that should I wade no more/ Returning were as tedious as go
o'er." Blood in both, to be sure, but there are improvements. In the earlier
passage, the key terms are sin and pity, abstractions which are rooted in the
antecedent allegorical drama. "Sin" becomes a personage: "sin will pluck on
sin." And pity or perhaps Pity, is also vivified through the use of the modifier
"tear-falling." But these harkings back to allegory hint at the less abstract
and more imaginative figure adumbrated in the phrase "so far in blood." It would
be more ordinary and idiomatic to say not "stepped in so far" but "stepped in so
deep." Unless, of course, the playwright had an idea lurking in the recesses of
his brain which he didn't quite articulate. Ten years later, Richard's puddle
became Macbeth's river or lake or even ocean, deep enough that it required
the usurper king to "wade" in it. Shakespeare pursues the metaphor to its
completion: "should I wade no more/ Returning were as tedious as go o'er" -- a
figure which makes it clear that Macbeth is overshoes, knee deep -- or even hip
deep --  in a nightmare swamp of his own making, There's no side channel, no
bridge, no way out.

So apprentice "sin" and "pity" are superseded by masterly "cistern" and "blood "
and "wade.                                                                     "

It's not by accident that Macbeth is so deeply unsettling.

Title: Amnesia on Film: The Third Day (1965)
Date: April 28, 2020

I don't know why, but It's surprisingly common, in movieworld, that if a man
stumbles away from an automobile accident, he must cotract amnesia and he must
suspect that he's murdered someone. On top of that, it's required that he will
take full ninety minutes to prove that he is innocent of killing anyone. The
Third Day hits these notes right down the middle. But The Third Day is not just
an amnesia/murder mystery/police procedural. It's also a soap opera/marriage-on-
the-rocks movie; it's a save-the-small-town-factory from corporate raiders
story. And it's a maniac-on-the-loose horror film. The Third Day is a crowded
conflation of genres which doesn't quite succeed in finding a concord to its
redundant discord.

The first ten minutes are the best. Steve Mallory, played by George Peppard,
returns to pre-amnesia life only to discover, and be dismayed, that he's a lout,
barroom brawler, a drunk, and a womanizer. Peppard is perfectly cast because
"baffled" is his default expression. It's his gift.

Sally Kellerman, later Hot Lips Houlihan, is the vamp. Arte Johnson, later
Laugh-In's Wolfgang is the maniac. Herbert Marshall has the worst role of his
career, but if there were a lifetime achievement award for finger-acting, he
would win it. Robert Webber is the detective hot to prove that Steve Mallory is
guilty, but he should have been more empathetic because earlier that same year
he had himself suffered a full ninety minutes of amnesia in Hysteria (1965).

I could almost bring myself to admire this picture. It's well-paced, well-
directed, beautifully photographed, mysterious in parts; a couple of luminous
supporting roles. It flagged somewhere half way through. So did I.

alone," the alligator pear, a mustard plaster, "you owe your crowning glory
to,/ your something something shampoo," "L-A-V-A," "and away-y-y we go," House
Jameson, cod liver oil, Adrien Baillargeon the Canadian strongman, J. Scott
Smart, "close but no cigar," "the call letters of the stars," Mrs. Calabash, a
"rhubarb," bluing, "Well, King, this case is closed," Spider Jorgenson, Horn and
Hardart, "Pow, right in the kisser."

Alas for a youthful population who imagines that the Pontiac 13 was a group
of anti-government demonstrators or that Apples Kudelka was a middle European
dessert. And doesn't know the difference between Sparkle Plenty and Good 'n
Plenty.

No question but that he's a serial liar: just think of the birther thing, the
attendance at the inaugural, Sharpiegate, "the best economy in the history of
the world," that Hilary Clinton received 3 to 5 million illegal votes, "total
exoneration," the 16,000+ lies and misstatements since 2016 that the Washington
Post has catalogued. Enough falsehoods to circle the earth several times, or
more likely, stretch from here to Alpha Centauri.

Nevertheless, all these falsehoods pale in comparison to the latest revelation.

He repeatedly boasted that he was such a baseball star at the New York Military
Academy that he could have gone to the majors. Someone finally investigated. Box
scores from the 1950s show that he batted .138, with 3 rbi's and scored one run.
Said one baseball guy, “You don’t hit .138 for some podunk, cold-weather
high school playing the worst competition you could possibly imagine" and go
pro. “It’s absolutely laughable. He hit .138—he couldn’t fucking hit."

OK, he lies about everything. But about baseball? Some things should be sacred .

Title: Shtisel
Date: May 14, 2020

The Israeli TV program Shtisel, about an ultra-orthodox, Haredi family, is soap
opera, but with a hair fetish.  It's all about beards, peyot, and sheitals; one
female character cries the whole night through because her wig slipped and an
inch of her own natural hair was visible -- to men. Sometimes it's taxing to be
empathetic to the Shtisel clan.

But even fanatics are people, and the business of the program is the same as the
business of all soap operas -- getting married, staying married, and healing
frayed marriages.

Shitsel sustained our interest through 24 episodes because the characters are
recognizable human beings and their problems were familiar and real. What is
different and foreign about the Shtisels and their Haredi compatriots is their
triumphalism -- they are correct and everyone else is wrong -- and the many ways
in the silly rules of doctrinaire religion constrict the characters' choices
and inflict upon them unnecessary misery. Shulem, the family patriarch, enjoys
funny radio shows, but he stops doing so because it's wrong. Zvi Arye is a
splendid singer, but he can't join a musical group because joy in music might
lead him in a secular direction. Uncle Nuchem loves classical music, especially
Mahler, but he destroys his tape of the Tragic Symphony because it is worldly
and therefore endangers his piety. The lead character, attractive young Akiva,
is a gifted painter, but his father and his uncle and his fiancee pressure him
to chuck his talents and become respectable, and pious, and a travel agent. Will
he give up on his genius?  Perhaps Season 3, if it ever gets made, will tell
us. I have nothing against travel agents, but Akiva's painting touches his soul.
The writers of Shtisel are right to see art as a danger to orthodoxy. It's a
solvent. Put religion up against art, and religion might dissolve. Which would
be a very proper outcome, in my opinion.

Here's my favorite line from a week of watching:  "When you see a Jew with a
dog, either he's not a Jew or the dog is not a dog."

Title: A Dream of "Agency"

I think it was Oscar Wilde who said that the most terrifying words in the
English language were, "I want to tell you about my dream."

Nevertheless, I persist.

Last night, I came out of a train station in Berlin (a city I've never visited
in my daytime life) but instead of a valise or luggage I had only a banjo case,
with a banjo inside and room for a couple of pair of socks at most. But I
thought, I have cash and I can buy clothes. Then I looked in my wallet and found
only a couple of one-dollar bills. I thought, now I'm in trouble. Nevertheless,
I persisted, and set out for my hotel. Then it started to rain, pour actually,
and I realized that I wasn't wearing proper shoes, just flimsy slippers. Next I
came to understand that I had no idea where to find my hotel.

So there I am with a banjo on my knee but nowhere to go, no cash, no proper
clothes, no hotel, in an unfamiliar strange city.

But now comes the "agency" part. I announce, to no one in particular, "I don't
want to be in this dream." And I woke up.

I'm very proud of myself for taking charge. A good precedent for tomorrow's
nightmare.

Title: Petruchio and Othello?
Date: May 26, 2020

It's an unlikely pairing -- what possible connection could there be between
Petruchio, a creature of farce, and Othello, distinguished general and tragic
victim of the green monster. Yet there is a surprising point of contact -- two
similar (but very different) reminiscences. It's not usual for Shakespeare's
characters to have a "backstory," but both P and O attempt one.

Petruchio brags that a shrew can't scare him, because he's been there before.
"Think you a little din can daunt mine ears?"

He riffs on the word "din." He's inured to noise, he claims -- and how he came
to be so adds a new and improbable dimension to his character.

Have I not in my time heard lions roar?Have I not heard the sea puff'd up with
windsRage like an angry boar chafed with sweat?Have I not heard great ordnance
in the field,And heaven's artillery thunder in the skies?Have I not in a pitched
battle heardLoud 'larums, neighing steeds, and trumpets' clang?

I, for one, don't believe a word that Petruchio utters and I doubt whether
Shakespeare expects us to do so. It's all bluster, the words of an accomplished
bullshitter. Petruchio is a youthful fortune-hunter, full of bravado and
effrontery to be sure, but except in this passage, he lacks an adventurous past
or a military history. When did he hear lions roar?  While on a Roads Scholar
tour of Scythia or central Africa? And where was the sea like an "angry boar?"
Where was the "great ordnance" and "loud alarum?" More likely at Saturday
afternoon serials than in the tented field.

Othello's story, on the other hand, though more extravagant and fantastic, is
grandly persuasive. Here's a piece of it:

I spake of most disastrous chances,Of moving accidents by flood and fieldOf
hair-breadth scapes i' the imminent deadly breach,Of being taken by the
insolent foeAnd sold to slavery, of my redemption thenceAnd portance in my
travels' history:Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle,Rough quarries, rocks
and hills whose heads touch heavenIt was my hint to speak,—such was the
process;And of the Cannibals that each other eat,The Anthropophagi and men whose
headsDo grow beneath their shoulders.

Othello veers into the mythological yet his story comports with what we
otherwise know of him.

Petruchio's tale is an instance of "just-in-time" characterization. Shakespeare
needs to display Petruchio's bravery in the face of a scolding woman -- so he
produces a soldiership story. It doesn't accord with Petruchio's history, but
it doesn't need to, because it serves an immediate necessary dramatic function.
Othello's speech is part and parcel; Petruchio's is a loose end.

And the language! The first passage, in early The Taming of the Shrew, is
perfunctory; the second, in the mature tragedy, is simply magnificent. Anyone
looking for evidence of Shakespeare's progress of a poet could do worse than
compare these two passages.

Everyone has their favorite 1940s "bad girl." Some of mine: Ann Savage in Detour
(1945), Jane Greer in Out of the Past (1947), Joan Bennett in Scarlet Street
(1948), Yvonne de Carlo in Criss Cross (1949), Rita Hayworth in The Lady from
Shanghai (1947, and Lana Turner in The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946) but for
my money the baddest of them all, the baddest of the bad, is sultry homicidal
Lizabeth Scott as Jane Palmer in Too Late for Tears (1948). It's not just that
she murders her first husband, shoots her second, and poisons her accomplice. Or
that she sleeps with blackmailer Danny Fuller (Dan Duryea) to enlist him to her
cause. Or that she betrays friend, foe and family.Or that she's manipulative,
vengeful, hedonistic ("I want money") and depraved. It's that she's utterly
soulless, conscienceless, and heartless. Not a tinge of fellow-feeling. She
could out-Goneril Goneril, bad girl of the canonical classics.

The ending of the film is a disappointment. Instead of Jane Palmer sent to the
electric chair or locked in the hoosegow for life, she's allowed to fall out of
a window and die. Not fair -- I wanted retribution.

On second thought, if she had been arrested, she would have corrupted the
police, compromised the judicial system, and caused the death of a handful of
fellow prisoners and prison guards. Maybe it's just as well to kill her off and
be done with it.

Here's Lizabeth Scott holding a gun on her nemesis (Don DeFore). Is she bad or
what?

Title: My Two Alter Egos
Date: June 02, 2020

Famous literary doppelgangers include Mr. Hyde, William Wilson, the picture in
Dorian Grey's attic, Leggatt, and Golyadkin Jr. In film, there are the sisters,
or twins, Kate and Patricia Bosworth, both played by Bette Davis and no doubt
many more that I don't know or remember that professional movie historians could
add. Doubles abound in the world of make-believe, but also occur in "real life."
I've had two doppelgangers of my very own. They are not official or clinical
doubles but they definitely manifest or "outer" fears that are embedded in the
less accessible parts of my brain -- they're my own personal Sir Smiles. They
have haunted me because they embodied the terror of what I might have been or
what might have happened to me if I dropped my guard. I never spoke to either of
these individuals -- only observed them at a fearful distance.

Many decades ago, when I was a graduate student, there was a rumor in
circulation among my peers that 50% of the students who finished their classwork
and comprehensive exams never completed their dissertations. Naturally, I was
afraid that I that I might fall into that ABD black hole. In those days, I
haunted Widener Library's vast reading room and there it was that I encountered
my first dreaded doppelganger. He was a bespectacled gloomy fellow, not unlike
me, but taller, ganglier, and, I think, homelier. The story was that he had been
working on his dissertation for 17 years. After I would sit I down to work in
a morning, he'd wander in, choose a place, open his briefcase, spread out his
books and papers on the table, sharpen his pencils and then, after a quarter of
an hour, get up and walk out and come back a few minutes later with a copy of
The New York Times. He'd read the paper in a leisurely manner, then put it aside
and turn to his dissertation. After a while, he would check his watch and then
go out for a cup of coffee. Shortly afterward, it was lunchtime; then it was
time for tea, and then came the hour to pack up and go home. Did he do an hour's
work during the day; not much more, maybe less.

Of course I feared that I could turn into this fellow. I suspect that it was
good for me to be presented with such a scary doppelganger. His negative example
forced me to keep my nose to the grindstone. Without Sir Procrastination, who
knows, I might be sitting at that library table to this day, pretending to write
that damn dissertation.

My second doppelganger is equally frightening but more contemporary. He's a
pathetic guy who lives right here in Boulder -- somewhere nearby, because he
frequently passes my window on his way to the mall, where he hits people up for
spare change. He looks alarmingly like me -- same size, same shape, roughly
of my age, though grayer and balder and dirtier. I could have been him if a
single one of my genes on a single chromosome had failed. There I would be,
living alone in a small room stacked to the gills with newspapers and magazines,
living off welfare and emerging only to shout leftist slogans at passers-by.
Doppelganger #2 is a crazy defective version of myself; a secret sharer who
embodies my deepest fears.

I confess that I hate these two guys, not for themselves but because I know that
I could have been them if I hadn't been lucky.

Title: Money
Date: June 09, 2020

I don't know much about economics and never did --it's an area of knowledge
that has lived up to its reputation as a dismal, arcane science. It's not only
economics -- I don't even understand money, which has become more ethereal and
symbolic during the course of my lifetime.

In my first real job, at Sears, Roebuck during the now-historical 1950s, I was
handed, come Friday at 4:00pm, an envelope containing a few bills and coins.
Money as I understood it.

A guy had bills in his wallet and put some in the bank and blew some on
CrackerJacks at Ebbets Field.

That was before credit cards and electronic transfers and bitcoins, whatever
they are. Of course I understand that money is not just currency. It's a
mysterious commodity -- much prized, but  also the root of all evil. It has
no value until you spend it, and then, once you spend it, you don't have it.
The monetary value of things is often inversely proportionate to their utility:
diamonds, pearls, paintings. To have money in the bank gives you a sense of
security. Then you die.

Most people have way too little money, but some people have more money than is
necessary and more than is good for their souls. I'm enthusiastic about taxing
wealth. Let's say a guy has $100,000,000. Suppose there's an annual 2% wealth
tax and he has to contribute $2,000,000 a year to promote the general welfare.
How is he harmed?  He now has $98,000,000. What can you do with $100M that you
can't do with $98M? And moreover, how incompetent must you be if you can't make
your $98M generate a few million and restore you to $100M. You can do good and
still stay rich -- what a blessing!

In my opinion, many Americans think about wealth and money incorrectly. They're
like the Johnny Roccos who always want "more." I was fortunate to be taught by
my father, who explained to me that "no one owns anything. The most you can
say is that you have a lifetime lease." He believed in this maxim even though
he spent his life negotiating real estate deals. He wasn't much concerned with
money and it didn't seem to harm him a bit. He had enough, and "enough is as
good as a feast."

To me, wealth means very little, but standard of living means a great deal.
My standard of living is very high because my town has an excellent public
library and a thriving public school system. And fine mountain trails and other
recreational possibilities. These amenities aren't "mine" -- they're not money
in my personal bank. But they contribute immensely to my standard of living.

What would improve my standard of living? That's an easy question. I would enjoy
my life more if other people lived better. If there were no homeless people
panhandling on the mall or sleeping under bridges. If unregarded old folks
weren't thrown into corners. If refugees were welcomed. If medical help was
available to all as a birthright. Etc., etc., etc.

I would gladly pay more in taxes if my tax money was spent wisely. I'd be
"better off." There would be less money in my personal pocket but more joy in my
life.

Title: Shakespeare at Work: the Oxymoron
Date: June 18, 2020

The oxymoron, a figure of speech in which there is a sharp contradiction
between modifier and noun, has become a boon to humorists: "business ethics,"
"military intelligence," "pretty ugly," "jumbo shrimp," "Christian Science,"
"Utah Jazz."  But it's a figure that has a serious side as well. The oxymoron
expresses very well the contradictions inherent in literary and also human
life.  Life is a mingled yarn, is it not?  Both fair and foul, sometimes
in the same moment; sweet sorrow. Because Shakespeare tried to convey the
complexity of things, he employed oxymorons  throughout his career -- in simple
straightforward formulas at the early plays, but in his maturity in innovative
and sometimes startlingly beautiful ways.

The oxymoron has a long pedigree. It may go as far back as to a classical trope
called the adynaton, or collection of impossibilities. There is a treasure-trove
of oxymora in Alain of Lisle's thirteenth-century poem (or, more exactly,
prosimetron) De Planctu Naturae in which "amor" is described as "pax odio,
fraudique fides, spes juncta timor... mistus cum ratione furor,/ Naufragium
dulce, pondus leve (peace in hatred, faith in fraud, hope joined to fear,
madness mixed with reason, sweet shipwreck, light heaviness); there is a similar
passage, from the same century, in Guillaime de Lorris extremely popular Romaunt
of the Rose that begins "Love is a hateful peace and loving hate."

The oxymoron was given new life and vitality by Petrarch, whose sufferings for
young Laura famously caused him to freeze in summer and burn in winter. Many
sonneteers, continental and English, were indebted to Petrarch, among them
Thomas Watson, a poet who flourished in the years of Shakespeare's adolescence.
One of Watson's poems, which contained the lines "Love is a sour delight, a
sugared grief/ A living death, and ever-dying life" lay behind young Romeo's
modish and easily parodied oxymoron-rich rhetoric: "O brawling love, o loving
hate,/ O heavy lightness, serious vanity,/ Misshapen chaos of well-seeming
forms,/ Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health.... " Romeo was so
besotted by his own rhetoric that Juliet couldn't resist a joke at his expense:
"You kiss by the book." Romeo in 1595 owes a lot to Will in 1580.

Shakespeare knew that Romeo indulged too much of a good thing. Half a decade
later, in All's Well That Ends Well, Helena imagined her perjured promiscuous
lover Bertram at the French court dancing attendance on the ladies in a series
of tired oxymora: "his humble ambition, proud humility,/ His jarring concord,
and his discord dulcet,/ His faith, his sweet disaster."  In these lines,
Helana, and Shakespeare as well, repudiated fashionable oxymoronic couplings. On
the other hand, it is not love but hatred and anger that give rise to Timon's
oxymorons. For him, the loathed Athenians, those "smiling smooth detested
parasites, are "courteous destroyers, affable wolves, meek bears."

In Hamlet, Claudius's insincere but brilliantly accomplished oxymoron          s
camouflage his sin. He ha                                                      s

as 'twere with a defeated joy,With an auspicious, and a dropping eye,With mirth
in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,In equal scale weighing delight and dole

taken Gertrude as his wife. The pairing of "auspicious" (the root meaning of
which is looking to the heavens to prognosticate by the flight of birds) with
"dropping" is especially wonderful.

Claudius's "delight and dole" were anticipated by Richard II's rhetorical
theatricality upon his return to England:

As a long-parted mother with her childPlays fondly with her tears and smiles in
meeting,So, weeping, smiling, greet I thee, my earth.

And there's the "wholesome iniquity" of the bawdy house in Pericles -- a play
in which calm comes in the form of "litigious peace."

In King Lear, a play about, among other subjects  a "precious unprized"
daughter, there is a submerged but stunning oxymoron when (in Edgar's words)
Gloucester is at last released from his suffering: "his flaw'd heart.../ 'Twixt
two extremes of passion, joy and grief,/ Burst smilingly." "Burst smilingly" is
a phrase which the younger Shakespeare could not reach; nor could any other poet
before or since.

Title: "Bisson Conspectuities"
Date: June 18, 2020

"Bisson conspectuities" is one of my all-time favorite Shakespearean oxymorons.
Although it's not as transparent as, say, "hot ice" or "living death," it's
much more quirky and colorful. "Bisson conspectuities" appears in Coriolanus in
one of the scenes in which Menenius banters with the Roman crowd. They attack
and he parries by enumerating his own strengths and weaknesses. He concludes
with an insult that flaunts his patrician education: "What harm can your bisson
conspectuities glean out of this character?" (In this case, a "character" is a
summary statement of a person's habits or nature, a "characterization".)

The odd word "conspectuities" is an invention of Shakespeare's. He derived it
from the participial form of the Latin verb "conspicio" -- to observe, gaze,
or watch. It's a nonce word, a hapax legomenon; unlike some of Shakespeare's
more inspired coinages, conspectuities never domesticated into English -- the
OED lists only this sole appearance. "Bisson," on the other hand, which means
"blind," was not new to the language but was in fact an ancient word of Germanic
origin -- and already obsolescent in 1608, although the venerable proverb "the
bysom ledys the blynde" might still have been current in the provinces. In
Hamlet, the deliberately archaizing First Player uses the expression "bisson
rheum" for "blinding tears."

"Bisson conspectuities" means "blind sight" or "blear vision." It's an
especially striking oxymoron because its component parts are drawn from opposite
ends of the word hoard -- old and new, plain and polysyllabic, Germanic and
Latin, rustic and citified.

But there's a complication. The word "bisson" doesn't actually appear in the
Folio; there it is "beesome." "Beesome, usually spelled besom, meant and
still means, "broom." But in the context of Coriolanus, broom is meaningless;
and so, beginning  with Lewis Theobald in the 1720s, editors have uniformly
substituted "bisson" -- an inspired conjecture but still a guess. It's possible
that Shakespeare wrote "bisson" and a scrivener or printer incorrectly read
'beesome" -- but perhaps not. An oxymoron of transcendent genius might be merely
an illusion -- a creation not of Shakespeare but of editorial tradition.

"Bisson conspectuities" puts quite a burden on members of the Blackfriar's
audience. It's hard to believe that Shakespeare thought his first hearers
would grasp the phrase's meaning on the fly. It's easy for us to understand it
now, four hundred years later, with a treasury of annotations at the foot of
every page. Perhaps Shakespeare didn't care if the audience comprehended? Is
it possible that he was writing just for his own delight, for his pleasure in
words? For readers rather than playgoers? Or perhaps he had already divined that
he was writing for enthusiasts and scholars of a latter age.

Pitfall is just shy of sensational. Error and evil intrude into a normal postwar
American suburban family. Jay Dratler and Andre de Toth, writer and director,
hit all the necessary film noir notes but without descending to cliche. The
beautiful blonde, is, for once, neither a temptress nor a gold-digger, but a
decent, troubled young lady; the private eye is not a lonely warrior for justice
but a brutal stalker; the police are not jerks; the wronged housewife is not
simple and materialistic but strong and resilient. Moreover, the plot is not
predictable and its ending neither pollyanna-ish nor disastrous, but balanced,
credible and inconclusive. There are no car chases.

Lizabeth Scott, Jane Wyatt, and Raymond Burr are terrific; Dick Powell is, alas,
Dick Powell.

Title: More Oxymora; Love's Labour's Lost
Date: June 23, 2020

I'm detecting oxymorons in everything I read. Perhaps I'm even imagining them.
Love's Labour's Lost is a "great feast of languages" and also a savory banquet
of rhetorical figures. Here are some of the oxymorons (or "cross-couplers," as
Puttenham called them) that I came upon in my latest re-reading of the play.
Some require explanation.

"Civil war," not 'civil" as in the American Civil War but civil as in "civility"
or good manners (like the "merry war" between Beatrice and Benedick). "Trencher-
knight" because a trencher was generally a wooden dish, not suitable for knights
-- and therefore a trencher-knight would be a low-born knight. "Living art,"
where the art is a portrait or a statue, and therefore not living and breathing.
"Loose grace,' where "loose" means worldly rather than spiritual. "Profound
simplicity." "Evil angel." "Dainty Bacchus," because Bacchus was notably
disorderly. "Sweet misprision," because misprision is a dereliction of duty and
therefore not sweet but sour or bitter. "Rational hind," whether hind refers to
an animal or to a person of exceedingly small intellectual gifts. In addition,
two near-oxymora: "merry days of desolation," "as swift as lead."

These figures of speech are not as obvious as those in Romeo and Juliet, but
they allow us to observe Shakespeare at work, experimenting with the ingredients
of language, just as he was hitting his stride.

Title: E & L Chafetz Family Circle c. 1946-1952
Date: June 29, 2020

When I was a boy in the 1940s and '50s, I was -- yearly or semi-yearly -- hauled
off to gatherings of the E & L Chafetz Family Circle. "Chafetz" was the maiden
name of my maternal grandmother, Sonia Green. "E" and "L" were Sonia's parents,
but the names that the initials abbreviated are gone for good. At the Family
Circle, twenty or thirty or sometimes even forty Chafetz siblings, cousins, and
spouses would share snacks, schnapps, and gossip. No question but that, selfish
and un-empathetic lad that I was, I very much resented being scrubbed and
fancied up to attend these meetings -- especially on a summer Sunday afternoon
when the Brooklyn Dodgers might be playing a double-header. Why would a young
scamp want to miss out on Red Barber and Connie Desmond in order to hang from
a subway strap for an hour and a half while the stifling IRT rattled to some
obscure corner of the Bronx -- just to while away the afternoon with a bunch of
old folks?

The Chafetz relatives were all immigrants from Belarus and thereabouts, born,
like my grandparents, in the 1870s or 1880s. They were small people -- tiny
really -- the men topping out at or 5'3" or  5'4", the women at 5'0" or
somewhat less -- their stature a consequence of their impoverished "old country"
childhoods. They spoke Yiddish or Russian to each other and very rudimentary
English to me. They smelled peculiarly -- of chicken soup overlaid with moth
balls, their "good clothes" having been retrieved from the storage closet for
this annual adventure. They assembled, if I remember correctly, at the second-
floor apartment over someone's store. (It seemed as though they were all keepers
of small shops -- newspaper kiosks or vegetable markets or candy stores or
perhaps a delicatessen or an "appetizer." One enterprising Chafetz cousin was a
glazier.) They seemed to be mostly childless -- or, at least I can't remember
encountering any other youths at these events.

Who were these people? Why were they so asymmetrical? Bent and twisted, most of
them, their faces marred by blackheads and lumps and swellings. Their mouths
were dental nightmares. Must I admit that my ten-year-old self was repelled and
disgusted, unconscious that their distorted bodies were a testament to their
arduous troubled lives?

Who was Uncle Joe Pessin? How was he related to me? What was his livelihood?
I remember only a small dark bald man with a grating voice. Did he have a
family?  And who were indistinguishable Lifscha and Leah? Were they twins or
sisters or sisters-in-law? Why did Uncle Usher smell so pungently? Was he in the
pickle or sauerkraut business? I know only that he had a great expanse of face
and outsized shoulders and that he longed to visit his brothers and sisters in
Winnipeg.

At these gatherings, I was put on display. My mother (my father refused to
attend) would take me around the room and introduce me to the various cousins
and uncles and aunts. It was a torment, frankly. "This is your uncle Nahum."
Uncle Nahum would shake my hand. I had nothing to say to him, but Uncle Nahum
asked the question that was every uncle's question. "How are you doing? You
doing well in school?"  "Yes, I'm doing well in school." And so this uncle
would smile beneficently upon me. And then on to the next one.

Because of what I perceived as their limited communication skills (though
English might have been Uncle Nahum's fourth or fifth language), I definitely
felt superior and condescending -- an acute embarrassment to me now. In my
heart, I silently patronized these strange people.

What I didn't know, and is so obvious now, was that I was much more important
to them than they were to me. That I was "doing well in school" were words
that they dearly wanted to hear. It was for my generation and for me that they
had braved the Cossacks, sold the farm, deserted from the Russian army, left
backward Belarus or Ukraine behind, endured the miseries of steerage, slept four
to a bed for years and half-acclimated themselves to a new world utterly foreign
to them. For me. They had sacrificed themselves to invest in me. So that I could
"do well in school," go to college, live a better life. I was their emissary to
America, to the future.

What could a ten-year-old have possibly known?  It's too late to regret that I
didn't learn their language and learn their stories. That world of theirs, that
universe represented by E and L Chafetz --- it's all gone now, vanished, present
no where else but in my failing memory.

Title: North and South (1854)
Date: July 01, 2020

I read Elizabeth Cleghorn Stevenson Gaskell's North and South (1854) on the
Kindle. It's a long novel, but I don't know how long because when I don't have a
book to heft, I don't know how many pages I've read and how many more are left.
I can only say that I became impatient after a couple of days and started to
think that Mrs. G. was being paid by the word. But just when I thought the novel
would never end, I stroked the Kindle one more time, and by gosh and by golly,
Mr. Thornton finally proposed to Margaret and bam! it was all over in a flash.
I was unprepared. If I had been reading an old-fashioned "book," as we used
to call them, I would have known that I was approaching the last page, and my
reaction would have been much different. Instead of shock, closure.

North and South was originally published in parts, twenty of them, and therefore
was consumed over a period of months. Later it appeared in book form, so that
enthusiastic readers might binge for a long day or two -- a very different
experience than reading in discrete chapters, and one I prefer. Kindle-reading
is a third way. It's less satisfying to me because I want the weight of the
book in my hand and I want to track my progress by means of the physical act of
turning the page. Electronic reading will no doubt become the norm; something
gained, no doubt, but something also lost. I think I would have been more
satisfied with the novel if I had a solid object in my hands rather than words
on a screen. Strange to say, but I honestly feel that it would have been a
better novel.

North and South is self-consciously "progressive." Those money-hungry northern
industrialists turn out to be decent people after all. The strikers may be
misguided and impatient, but they have a genuine grievance. Women might be able
to live richer lives with a dollop of liberation.

I confess that I am troubled when I read books that were progressive their
own time but that seem reactionary now. I know, and I've been taught, that I
should be more historical, less time bound, less, as they say, "presentist."
Nevertheless, I was astonished, even offended, that Margaret Hale was to be
branded a loose woman because she was seen with a guy at a railway station,
unchaperoned. Good thing the man who was with her turned out to be not a
potential lover, but her brother, otherwise her gross impropriety would have
banished her, lifetime, from the list of the eligible-for-marriage.

I know that Mrs. Gaskell wanted us to think well of the mill-workers, but why
the heck did she make them speak in an impenetrable provincial lower-class
dialect which makes them seem sloppy, and ignorant-- another species entirely,
less than human?  Even though I tried to resist, the characterization of the
masses left me alienated and angry.

And then there's a problem particular to me: every time one of her characters
failed or suffered grievous injury or died (there are a number of spontaneous
deaths in North and South), Mrs Gaskell felt obliged to invoke an all-purpose
explanation -- "God's will!"  "God's will" whether thoughtful or just a tic,
becomes, in this ostensibly progressive novel, a justification for political
passivity and quietism.

I like this novel better when I read it the first time -- in 1963. Although it's
unchanged (except for the kindling), I myself seem to have become much less
empathetic and more cantankerous. Age?

Title: "In This Our Life" (1942)
Date: July 07, 2020

Talk about movie "bad girls"-- here's one of the most sordid. In this Our
Life is a doppelganger story of two sisters, one good and one evil. Roy (sic)
Timberlake, played by Olivia de Havilland, is too good to be true. Stanley (sic)
Timberlake, embodied by Bette Davis in an eye-popping, raucous performance, is
wicked at the Lady Macbeth or Goneril level. She steals her sister's husband
just for the heck of it and then drives him to suicide. Quite the scandal
anywhere, but especially in 1940s class-conscious suburban Virginia. Her very
good sister Roy marries the decent man whom Stanley betrayed -- and then Stanley
tries to seduce him back. It doesn't work, I'm glad to say, and Stanley,
failing and frustrated, runs her car into two pedestrians, killing one, and
then frames a young "colored boy" (we might say "black man") for the murder --
and almost gets away with it. There's more in this competent soap-opera romance
melodrama: a touch of incest, some distasteful bigotry, crass materialism,
morbid hypochondria. A couple or three weak, enervated men, upon whom we wait
for ninety minutes to grow backbones.

The movie was directed by John Huston and Raoul Walsh and written by Howard Koch
(Casablanca), so it has classy bloodlines. It's so overcrowded with events and
loose ends that I guessed that it must have been adapted from a novel. And sure
enough, according to Wik In This Our Life was adapted from a famous-in-its-time
Pulitzer prize book by Ellen Glasgow -- which I should have known but didn't.

In This Our Life piqued my curiosity enough to download the novel onto my
Kindle. I'm intimidated, though. Kindle says 745 pages.

Title: "In This Our Life" -- the Novel by Ellen Glasgow
Date: July 08, 2020

In this Our Life, the novel by Ellen Glasgow is richer, deeper, and less bound
by convention than the film.  Film Life follows the inherited story for its
first forty-five minutes but then sharply diverges.

In the film version, bad daughter Stanley is less conflicted and complicated
a character and eventually devolves into a stereotypical noir "bad girl."
Novel Stanley doesn't drive Peter to suicide, nor does she she bring the film
to convenient closure by driving her car down a cliff. Novel Craig is far
less worthy and more passive than film Craig and doesn't redeem himself by
transforming into a sleuth who exonerates Parry.

Needless to say, the novel offers no Hollywood ending; in strong contrast, novel
Roy rejects Craig's offer of marriage because she knows that Craig is still
carrying the torch for Stanley. Instead, she tries desperately to leave town
and start life anew -- but it's not clear whether or not she will make a clean
getaway. We hope that she will.

The most extensive revision is to the character of the sisters' father, Asa
Timberlake. In the film, he's a uxorious martyred browbeaten milquetoast who is
the long-suffering caretaker of his hypochondriacal bedridden wife. In Ellen
Glasgow's novel, much of which is seen through his eyes, Asa loathes his wife,
knows that he's wasted his life, craves affection, and even admits to himself
that he wants her dead so that he can be free. It's Asa, not Craig, who unravels
the mystery of the automobile accident. Moreover, glory be to the proper gods,
Asa has a secret lady friend, a widow/farmer a dozen years his junior, whom he
visits on his occasional day off. And he nurtures an escapist fantasy that keeps
him sane -- he wants to end his life as a simple farm laborer. He doesn't quite
get there at the novel's end, but there's hope. Kaye, his very healthy, very
appropriate mistress (we think sexual partner, though Glasgow hedges) assures
him that she will always have an opening for a hired hand.

Title: Lucasta
Date: July 13, 2020

The "plot" of the lyric is simple: the "speaker" leaves his beloved in order to
"fly" to battle (he fought, naturally, on the royalist side). He loves "honor"
more than he loves his mistress. In fact, and perhaps paradoxically, honor has a
multiplier effect on his love. And yet, although honor enhances love, honor is
always primary, love subordinate. It's a curious kind of love lyric in which a
suitor says to his beloved, I like you, but only second best.

What is "honor" for Lovelace?  It's a word with a spectrum of meanings --
nobility of soul, magnanimity, scorn of meanness, reputation, privilege of
rank or birth, even chastity or virginity. But none of these possibilities
seem to specifically apply in this poem.  For Lovelace and his Lucasta,
honor is military. It is something won on the battlefield. About this he is
uncompromising: the "new mistress" he will now "embrace" is "a sword, a horse, a
shield" -- "war and arms." Not the "arms" of a lover, but weapons.

A cynical being might therefore rewrite the last two lines of the lyric thusly:
"I could not love thee (Dear) so much,/ Lov'd I not warfare more." Flat,
imperfect poetry, but the parody is perhaps what the demystified poem actually
asserts. Make war, not love.

What sort of war?

The primary weapons in the battles of the 1640s were mortar, cannon, musket,
caliver, carbine, harquebus, and pistol. Sword, horse and shield had not
entirely disappeared. Edge weapons were still in use, and the horse would remain
the primary engine of war until it was supplanted in the twentieth century by
internal combustion vehicles. But it would have been suicidal folly to go into
1640s battle with Lovelace's museum of weaponry. For "honor" and for the benefit
of Lucasta, Lovelace evokes a romantic nostalgic world of tilt and tourney.
Single combat, knight versus knight, hot horse against horse.

Lovelace imagines himself glorious in single combat, his mistress's favor
(handkerchief or scarf) streaming from his helmet. It would not be so glorious
to be mutilated by a cannon lugged into place by a base pioner.

Lovelace easily conflates love, which is a private emotion, with military
honor, which is clearly a public achievement. Very public, indeed, which is
what led Baruch Spinoza, Lovelace's younger contemporary, to note that "honor"
is not intrinsic, not an act of personal realization, but rather "a slavish
subordination to the opinion of others."

"I could not love the (Dear) so much,

Lov'd I not a slavish subordination to the opinion of others more."

The rewrite has a different ring.

Title: The Whole Town's Talking (1936)
Date: July 14, 2020

Why was I surprised that this was such a fine film? I should have done some
research before viewing. It was written by Robert Riskin and Jo Swerling. Riskin
had It Happened One Night to his credit and collaborated with Frank Capra on
Mr. Deeds Comes to Town. Swerling wrote It's a Wonderful Life and Lifeboat. The
Whole Town's Talking was directed by John Ford, venturing, for once, out of
Monument Valley and into comedy.

It's an amusing doppelganger movie, with Edward G. Robinson playing both Jekyll
and Hyde. His Hyde is a monster gangster of the Little Caesar variety; his
Jekyll is a meek apologetic clerk. Both of his manifestations are interested
in Jean Arthur, the wise-cracking babe, but Jekyll doesn't get her until he
assimilates some hydeishness and gets Hyde killed. That's America for you; until
you're willing to resort to violence, you're not going to land the lady.

Title: The Way We Shop Now
Date: July 18, 2020

The last time, a decade ago, that I needed a rug pad, I went hunting at various
malls and shops that might stock such an item. After a few exhausting hours, I
located an appropriate-size rug pad at one of those large import stores -- it
may have been Pier 1 or WorldMarket. The quality wasn't quite right, and the pad
was too large and too costly, but it was there --  and I do possess a utility
knife with a very sharp blade. So I bought it, struggled with it, but -- it
worked, and it's still there, doing its job, padding the Heriz.

This time, covid-time, I'm not allowed to search around town, and I don't want
to, so instead I did some internet sleuthing for "rug pad."

It's a revelation -- there are many, many vendors very anxious to satisfy my rug
pad needs: RugPad USA, Mr.RugPad, RugPads 'R Us, Rugpad-orama, eSaleRugPads,
RugPadStock, RugPadHome, RugPadSolutions, Dr. Pad, RugPad World, Royal-T
RugPads, Underfoot-Inc, and My Rug Pad, among others. Costco sells a "Mohawk"
rug pad made of "100% post industrial recycled synthetic fibers with all natural
rubber with SBR latex backing," whatever that is, not cut to exact size, and you
have to buy a shrink-wrapped package of four.

I choose RugPadUSA not only for patriotic reasons but because its site featured
a lengthy explanatory essay on the potential disasters, hazards and glories
of various species of rug pads. Are you not shocked to learn that that some
inferior rug pad manufacturers pad out their fiber with clay?

RugPad USA is a company that takes its rug pads very seriously. I am now up to
snuff on Grip, Cushion, Longevity, Sustainability, Safety, and Made-in-America-
ness. And also on materials: rubber, jute, felt, Pure Wool, hemp, and memory
foam, in their various forms and combinations (and prices).

I went with an "eco friendly Nature's Grip 100% natural rubber and plant jute."
It arrived in four days, cut to exact measure. Perfect. This rug pad is so
beautiful, let me tell you, that I'm thinking of laying it on top and putting
the old tribal Turkish Varamin tent rug underneath. Well, maybe I'm getting too
enthusiastic about my glorious new rug pad.

Advantages to internet shopping: it lets your fingers do the walking, there are
an infinity of choices, and after a while the item appears miraculously outside
your door. Disadvantages: you can't see or feel the product before making a
decision; it's a pain to return mistakes; your cash goes to an absentee merchant
(RugPad USA is located in Connecticut); local shops suffer, and also, slightly
delayed gratification. But the electronic mall is definitely the way we shop
now.

Title: Where I Stand
Date: July 19, 2020

I stand, like most in my cohort who have lived ordinary, conventional lives,
at the midpoint of a continuum stretching from grandparents to grandchildren
-- at an imaginary apex looking backward and forward, Janus-like. I remember
my grandparents, though only at the end of their long lives, and I know my
grandchildren, though only at the beginnings of theirs. Two generations back,
two generations forward and with 81-year-old me at the fulcrum.

It's been a long eventful tramp from there to here. My grandfather Isaiah
was born in 1863, a hundred and sixty seven long years ago, and my youngest
grandchildren, the twins Caleb and Asher, joined us just five years ago, in
2015. Although it was only an instant in geological terms, nevertheless, the
interval from my grandfather's birth to this moment has seen glaciers melt,
rivers change their course, cities arise, plants and animals go extinct,
governments and empires grow and decline, wars and epidemics rattle the planet.
He lived in a world of serfs and rabbis and pogroms; the grandchildren live in a
world of nuclear proliferation, global warming, threats to democracy.

There have also been tectonic shifts in the microcosm of my own family. My
Ukrainian-born grandparents would not recognize my third-generation American-
born grandchildren, and my grandchildren would have an even more impossible task
to understand or appreciate the lives of the great-great-grandparents. It's a
long leap from StaryConstantine, old Constantine, in the nineteenth century,
where my family originated in backward village Ukraine to Washington DC or
northern California or Boulder Colorado in the twenty-first. Rural to urban,
agricultural to technical, provincial to worldly, religious to secular, inbred
to genetically various. My grandparents were born into a world of carts and
horses; my grandchildren play with computers in their cribs. Yet here we are.

We're the same, but different. According to family legend, my grandfather Isaiah
left StaryConstantine and his family of origin because of a dispute about
religion. They, his father and family, were devout but he was a non-believer.
In this regard, Isaiah was a true patriarch, because he established an enduring
family template. Over the generations, we remain hostile or sometimes only
indifferent to religion -- and in its place we embrace the evidence of the
senses and the primacy of reason. Looking backward and forward from my pinnacle,
I cannot identify a single lapsed atheist or backslider in the family landscape.
I know that my father never attended a house of worship except for a rare
funeral or wedding. For him, the sabbath was sacred only to his roses and
azaleas. I once asked him if his father, Isaiah, had ever visited a synagogue.
He said, "I can't swear about what happened in the Ukraine, but I know that once
he got here he never did." For Isaiah, atheism would have been a revolutionary
fracturing; for subsequent generations, not even slightly stressful. The
precious gift of atheism I once called it.

What has replaced religion? Our extended family remains a people of the book.
Among my grandfather's forty-seven direct descendant, thirty-five of whom are
alive, six have written books, another is a journalist, and five others have
earned law degrees, where not unlike the older generations of Talmudists, they
can engage in disputations over nice sharp quillets of the law. There are
no rabbis, but I can count at least ten teachers of one secular subject or
another. My grandfather had no official schooling, but every one of his great
grandchildren is a college graduate and many of them have post-graduate degrees.

There are some families that can boast of painters or violinists or actors
in their old world heritage; not ours. Nor have we become creative or
imaginative in the new world. I count no poets, no musicians, no actors, and
except for my outlier brother who once wrote a novel and now makes bricolage
sculptures, no artists. If we make anything, it's useful. Furniture or pottery
-- not paintings. But then, no criminals or alcoholics or wastrels either.
We're substantial reliable citizens -- firmly nouveau bourgeois. We may be
conventional and dull, but we are what my father used to call, without irony and
with great pride, solid, tax-paying citizens.

Title: "Negative Bouyancy"
Date: July 27, 2020

Mogambo (1953), directed by John Ford, is an eternal-triangle story in which
earthy Ava Gardner and prim Grace Kelly compete for white hunter Clark Gable.
Unfortunately, it's less engaging as a romance than as a travelogue -- it offers
spectacular footage of African megafauna (hippos, giraffes, lions, gorillas,
etc.).

Whenever I watch classic films set in "the colonies," I'm fearful that the
native people will be exoticized and orientalized and trivialized, but I'm happy
to report that Mogambo is less offensively Tarzanish than most -- setting aside
a couple of embarrassing "fakelore" episodes. I would have been even happier if
the Africans weren't just animated wallpaper -- bearers or rowers or dancers
or spear-throwers -- and that they weren't depicted as entirely subservient to
their white overlords. Mogambo is based on Victor Fleming's pre-Code Red Dust
(1931) -- a much more sensual film than Mogambo and one which allowed Jean
Harlow lots of room to wink and flirt. It's most odd that the glamorous sexy
hunter in both Red Dust and Mogambo is played by Clark Gable - a rare example
of filmic auto-reprising. He's hyper-masculine, at age 30, in Red Dust but in
Mogambo it's too too obvious that his hair has been dyed a shiny black. When he
pounces on Ava and Grace and mashes their mouths with unpersuasive 50s kisses,
it is taken for granted that both ladies will immediately grow weak in the
knees.

I grew even less Gable-dazzled when I discovered a weird anecdote in Donald
Sinden's recollection of the filming of Mogambo. (Sinden played the part of
Grace Kelly's spineless, intellectual, oblivious husband). Sinden reports that
(prepare yourself to be stunned and disillusioned):

before leaving camp on the first morning [of shooting] I had been told to report
to the hair-dressing department's tent, where I found the make-up men armed with
electric clippers: 'I have to remove the hair from your chest.' 'Whatever for?'
I asked, 'Orders.' It transpired that Clark [Gable], whose chest was completely
devoid of hair, had always insisted that no other actor should appear on film
exposing a hirsute breast. This included any member of the crew not wearing a
shirt as well. He considered it a slight on his masculinity.

Surely, this is one of the most bizarre anecdotes in movie history. The King of
Hollywood, the legend whose mere presence famously set roomfuls of maidens all
a-quiver, was so sexually insecure that he required mass depilation of cast and
crew! Follicular fragility! Big-time nuttiness?

Question: was it in Clark's contract that he had the right to dictate the degree
of chest shagginess of cast and crew -- or was he just throwing his weight
around?  Suppose Sinden or some sweaty best boy had refused the electric
clippers. Would the production have ground to a halt?

It's well known that since the time of Samson and probably before, male hair
has been associated with strength, but even Delilah didn't set out to defoliate
every man in Gaza.

But Clark Gable's chest hair insecurity is only Donald Sinden's second most
curious anecdote. Even more astonishing, at least to me, is that Sinden suffered
from "negative buoyancy." Negative buoyancy is a condition in which a person is
unable to float in water. In Sinden's case, negative buoyancy was discovered, he
says, while filming a shipwreck scene in The Cruel Sea (1953). Sinden started
to sink and was rescued from drowning by his co-star Jack Hawkins.

Almost all human beings float. Bob like corks. I don't, and neither did my
father nor my male descendants. As a family, we're sinkers. I don't know why,
except that perhaps we have an eccentric specific gravity or because our swim
bladders go on the fritz, like sick fish. We regularly and uniformly plunge to
the bottom, like a stone or a heavy lump of lead.

How wonderful to know that there is a dignified name for our peculiar family
trait: "negative buoyancy."

And now we can be consoled that we're not alone.

There's got to be a support group for the negatively buoyant out there,
somewhere.

Title: "The Small House at Allington" (1863)
Date: July 29, 2020

The nation is in an uproar -- the Covid-19 pandemic, mass unemployment, racial
reckoning, disorder in the streets, Russians sabotaging our elections, ignorant
authoritarian leadership.

We ourselves are sheltering at home, and are healthy, thanks to the masks and
the cooperation of friends and neighbors, but there's little hope of a getaway.
We certainly can't travel. What to do for an escape? There's no frigate like a
book, so it's time to read a long leisurely novel by Anthony Trollope.

The Small House at Allington is the fifth of six in the Barsetshire series. Had
I read it before? Certainly, but it doesn't matter. To read a Barset novel is to
put on well-worn old clothes. Loose slippers. The Small House is comfort food.
It's the mac and cheese of novels.

It's not 2020, it's 1863. Outside of Barsetshire, millions of working-class
Englishmen are living in grinding, soul-destroying poverty. Cholera is rampant.
India is being pillaged. Ireland is trying to recover from famine and mass
emigration. There's a second Opium War in China. British ships are running
the Union blockade of Confederate ports. But all is as ever in the perennial
untouched Allington microcosm.

Should the Dales continue to stay in the dower house even though the squire is
sometimes impolitic?  Should Adolphus Crosbie choose to marry Lily Dale (yes!)
or Lady Alexandrina de Courcy (big mistake)? Will Plantagenet Palliser run off
with Griselda Grantly -- don't do it, Planty Pall!  Should Lucy Dale accept
a dinner invitation from the Earl de Guest? Why won't Isabella Dale agree to
accept her cousin Bernard as a husband? -- everyone in the family thinks it's a
good idea, except Bell herself, who prefers poor but faithful Dr. Crofts.

Political and economic problems do not intrude into the small world of the Small
House. Finding a mate, keeping a mate, repairing a frayed relationship is its
subject; equally important for men, is to locate a woman of means, so that one
can support a comfortable style of life without stooping to real work.

Adolphus Crosbie, although far from our favorite, accurately describes the
three things that he requires in a wife: that she be of a good family, that she
have money, and that she be beautiful. Does Mr. Crosbie possess these qualities
himself?  No. But he does have a handsome set of whiskers, which seems to be
sufficient.

I bought these water glasses (sometimes called tumblers) about 35 years
at a long defunct antique shop in Lafayette, Colorado. They fall into the
large category known as Depression Glass in the trade and they were probably
manufactured in the 1940's or 50's -- but that's just an unsupported speculation
on my part. I don't know the name of the manufacturer so they are works of art
without provenance. I love the clean lines -- straight at the base and then
slightly flared at the top -- and also the way the glasses fit so elegantly into
the human hand. The tumblers are entirely unadorned and if they have a style
other than vernacular I suppose they might be called Art Deco. I once had a few
more of these tumblers -- perhaps as many as eight, but because they are in
constant use there have been losses. There's no saying how long these beauties
will survive -- the rims are a bit fragile and vulnerable in the dishwasher.
Although they have no monetary value, they are in my opinion both classy and
classic.

Date: August 10, 2020

This appealing pitcher and vase set were thrown by Ben Owen II, a potter
who lived and worked in Seagrove, North Carolina. In September of 1966, we
visited Tom and Margaret in Chapel Hill and they took us on an excursion to
Seagrove, where we bought these fine works of art. Ben Owen was very much a
traditionalist, sticking closely to tried-and-true shapes and glazes. He was
"old-fashioned," and I am equally so. Lots of weird things have been done with
clay during the last sixty years, but these shapes are more pleasing to my eye
than modernistic distortions and abstractions.

The glaze is called "frogspit" but "frogskin" would make more sense.

When I moved to a new home in 2009, the Ben Owen pots disappeared. I thought
they had been lost in the move, but after a couple of years of searching, I
located them. In fact, I had packed them so carefully and securely that they
were virtually buried. But I persevered.

These splendid objects have now (except when they went AWOL) been on prominent
display wherever I've lived for more than half a century. It's curious, and a
fact, that not one guest has ever asked a single question about them. They've
not been noticed. Are my friends unobservant?

I think that the pitcher and the vase are so discreetly beautiful that they
don't demand attention, a fact which makes me love them all the more.

Title: Words of My Life -- Umpire
Date: August 10, 2020

Despite its marvelously odd sound, there was no word more familiar to me as
an infant than "umpire." "Umpire!!"  Say it, savor it, roll it about in
your mouth. It's a downright peculiar word. Am I exaggerating when I say
that "umpire" came into my ken right along with the initial acquisition of
language? And that it was accompanied by such other linguistic weirdnesses
as "inning,""fungo," "shortstop," "blooper," "rosin bag," "balk" (pronounced
"bawk,"),"dugout," "fan","knuckleball," "southpaw," "mitt," "bullpen," and
"slump" (among many others). Common baseballese words, all of them -- but
"umpire" is the strangest of them all, so foreign-sounding that some of the
lesser lights in the PS 217 schoolyard pronounced it "empire." The abbreviation
"ump" ("Kill the Ump") sounds less like a word than a stifled snort or
eructation.

The word came to us by a devious roundabout route. The "p" and "r" in umpire
descend from the Latin "par" (equal). Old French had nonper which came into
Middle English as noumpere. "A noumpere" became "an umpire"; it lost its "n" by
the same process of rebracketing or resegmentation by which "a nadder" became
"an adder" and "a napron" became "an apron" (and "an ewt" became "a newt").
"Noumpere" was not a sporting term; it signified a neutral arbiter of a dispute.

So Don Adriano de Armado in Love's Labor's Lost,  a man of "fire-new words," is
an "umpire" of mutinies, where mutinies simply means disputes. And Juliet says
that "twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife/ Shall play the umpire" -- a
phrase which Samuel Johnson glossed as "this knife shall decide the struggle
between me and my distresses."

Umpire did not acquire a sporting turn until 1861, just in time for the arrival
of the national pastime.

Most American sports feature a judge or a referee rather than an umpire, though
American football, which is highly policed, offers a referee, a head linesman,
a line judge, a back judge, a side judge and a field judge, in addition to an
umpire, who does not call balls and strikes, but instead counts the number of
players on each side, checks their uniforms, and watches out for an offensive
lineman who might illegally wander downfield. Because umpires are positioned
behind the defensive line they are subject to inadvertent concussions and
dislocations -- still another justification for my personal boycott of football.

In 1950, Beans Reardon and Jocko Conlan and Al Barlick were names as familiar as
Hodges and Campanella. Nowadays I could not name a single major league umpire.

Title: My Life in Objects -- III (Rug)
Date: August 11, 2020

Althea bought this rug at an auction in Warren, New Hampshire in 1968 -- and it
is the first rug we ever owned -- the first of many. I was startled when she
bid on it because we were in the market for crockery and glasses and chairs,
not for decorative objects, but she saw and appreciated its beauty. It's a rug
for a wall because it's too old and fragile to be tread upon by the shod. Rug
expert MP says that it's from the Caucasus -- specifically it's a Konaghend
Kuba -- from the late nineteenth century. Of course we didn't have the faintest
idea of its provenance but we knew that it was very appealing. In fact, I
was so inattentive that I owned and admired the rug for forty years before I
noticed that it was a prayer rug -- the mihrab is not much pronounced. Nor did I
appreciate the abrash; the indigo blue ground disappears two thirds of the way
down. It's probable that the woman who wove it ran out of wool from a particular
dye lot, but it's also possible that the weaver was nomadic.

When Althea lived in Washington for a year in the 1990s, she took this rug with
her -- the only personal possession (aside from clothes, of course) that she
brought. And then many years later when she entered the Alzheimer's institution,
I hung it on the wall facing her bed. I thought it would be a comfort to her --
but alas she did not remember or recognize it. When she died I  brought it back
home where it belongs.

Title: My Life in Objects -- IV (Pottery)
Date: August 12, 2020

This sugar and creamer are the only objecs I own that deserve to be in a museum.
They were made by Bauhaus potter Marguerite Wildenhain at her Pond Farm studio
in Guerneville, California, near the Russian River, sometime around 1972. I
don't think that the picture captures the strength or beauty of the workmanship.
They're beautifully thrown, beautifully glazed. To eye or hand they convey
almost magical power.

My charismatic, chaotic sister (technically sister-in-law) Phyllis brought these
to us from Guerneville, where she studied pottery for three or four summers with
"Marguerite." We sent her some cash to buy pots by the artist but these were
the only ones that we actually received. Phyllis bought many but she couldn't
bear to part with them. And then one by one her treasured possessions would slip
out of her hand or be knocked off the shelf by her cats or otherwise wind up as
shards. For many years after Phyl's untimely death I preserved in a shoebox the
shattered bits of one of Marguerite's most magnificent creations -- a landscape
pot which depicted  a dozen or so cavorting animals. Where is that shoebox now?

I rarely use these works of art -- they're too magnificent to put at risk.

On the bottom of the creamer, still visible next to the words "Pond Farm,"
Marguerite has pencilled a price: $12.50. But it's priceless.

Title: Pure Religion
Date: August 12, 2020

For me, the summer and autumn of 2010 was a bad period, even though it led
to the only moment of prayer and reverence in my entire life. Readers and
fans of this blague know that I have more than once reported that I was born
into a purely, even aggressively, atheistic family and that have remained an
unquestioning atheist to this day. So what happened, you ask, in 2010 to cause
me to lapse once and only once from a lifelong want of belief?

It began with a ruptured disc, which is, as fellow-sufferers know so well, an
extremely painful condition. Surgery was recommended, but by every statistical
measure, surgery works only half the time, and therefore I was reluctant and
frightened to be cut, and instead figured that if I could just wait out the
pain, perhaps the affliction would heal itself, as, I was assured, it usually
does. So I lay on my back, crawled to the bathroom once a day, and started
taking drugs. Powerful drugs: oxycodons every four hours, those big 600 mg
ibuprofens several times a day, lots of valium to deal with the agitation,
steroids (some by mouth and some injected directly into my back), and because of
the insomnia, more ambien than was absolutely necessary along with some other
miscellaneous pills and tablets, the names of which I can't quite recall. It
was my fault, in part -- I had too many doctors and no one was in charge, so
various medical people prescribed various pills, and because I was in such pain,
I gobbled them all.

After two months, I was still in acute debilitating pain and I had to face the
fact that my plan wasn't working and that something had to be done. I submitted
to surgery at the end of August down there at the Mary Hitchcock Hospital in
Lebanon. Relief was instantaneous -- why had I waited so long? But I was now
faced with the problem of drug withdrawal. Not having good medical advice, I
became the coldest of turkeys.

My digestive system went completely out of whack. For days, perhaps two or three
weeks, I could tolerate only the blandest foods. I survived on baked potatoes
and very little else. My heartbeat was very high and settled to an even 110 for
six weeks. I was agitated and nervous.I suffered from dramatic night sweats
-- two or three times I woke up with nightclothes soaked and dripping. Muscle
cramps.

And also severe constipation which led to badly bleeding hemorrhoids. For six
weeks, whenever I had to "honor a call of nature," I'd look into the pot --
bright bright red. Day after day. "O no! When is this going to end?" And then
one blessed day -- and here at last comes the moment of pure religion -- I
hesitantly inspected the bowl, and miracle of miracles-- no blood. And I cried
out, spontaneously, without forethought, these words: "Glory be to God."

What god? I wasn't in a theological frame of mind, but in retrospect, it may
have been Cloacina, the Roman goddess of sewers, to whom I directed my fervent
thanks. Or possibly Sterquilinus, although he was more a god of manure and
fertilizer than of the toilet bowl.

The good old Romans -- a god for all occasions! Even for me.

Title: My Life in Objects --VI (Settle)
Date: August 13, 2020

When we moved to Manhattan, in 1965, for a first real job, we had hardly a stick
of furniture. We thought we needed, in addition to a bed and a kitchen table, a
bench for an entrance hall. Wandering around Greenwich Village (Althea was very
big with child), we stumbled into an antique store, one of scores that populated
the area in those pre-Ebay days. Pisces Antiques, it was called and it was owned
by a young English woman named Kim Sylvester. (Isn't it astonishing that I
remember these details?) This bench (properly a settle) caught our eye, not the
least because it cost half as much as a functional bland modern equivalent at
Macy's or Wanamaker. "What is it?, I asked. Kim said, "English, Jacobean, about
1650." And so it was. A surprise.

I've since learned a bit about seventeenth-century English furniture and I'm
convinced that the large back panel is genuine. It's late medieval in style and
exhibits all three of the kinds of carving that are typical of the age. The four
central panels (stylized poppy on the outsides, stylized thistle on the insides)
are called "recessed ground." Separating the flowered panels are pieces that are
"gouge" carved. The crosspiece at the top is "incised." As for the body of the
settle, I suspect it's not very ancient, but instead assembled from old wood by
a furniture maker who had respect for the carved back and wanted to re-use or
re-purpose it. When was this reconstruction accomplished? It might have been
anytime before 1965, but most probably during the long 19th century. Possibly
during the so-called gothic revival period in the 1880s and 1890s.

I've admired this settle for 55 years. Nowadays It sits proudly just to the
right of our entrance door. I like it that our guests pile their coats and bags
on the Jacobean settle when they enter our home, not noticing that this discreet
piece of furniture is old and rare and singular. No one asks about it and I
don't tell. It's my secret.

Title: My Life in Objects -- V (Bell)
Date: August 13, 2020

This unassuming object played, and continues to play, a consequential part in
my life. It's a plain brass bell, unadorned, maker and age unknown. It's not
musical but when properly agitated it can make a helluva loud noise. It was
given to my mother in 1947 by her mother, my grandmother, Sonia Green. How my
grandmother came into possession of the bell, I don't know and can't imagine. A
mystery.

I begged it sometime in the late 1960s and have owned it ever since,

My family spent the summers of 1947-48-49 at Makamah Beach on the north shore
of Long Island. It was the high point of my childhood; I've written about those
glorious summers right here. The function of the bell was to call me and my two
brothers in for lunch or dinner. The clang traveled well even against the whoosh
of the wind and the rhythm of the surf. There I'd be, all alone, studying shells
or snails somewhere along the shore or on a sandbar, hungry, and I'd hear the
insistent jangle and hurry home. My brother Jon says that to this day he can't
hear the peculiar noise of this bell without salivating.

The bell was equally useful, a generation later, when my own independent,
wild children wandered freely around our Hackett Hill property. It rang,
they returned. I wonder if they associate its sound with corn-on-the-cob and
hamburgers. They have ample reason to do so.

And even now, of summers, when it's the hour for food, or just time to call the
day to a close, out comes the bell, and children, grandchildren, and guests
respond to its harsh but historic call.

Title: My Life in Objects -- VII (Tibetan Rug)
Date: August 14, 2020

I

It's not a very good picture, but then, I'm not a very good photographer. It's
a Tibetan rug, monochromatic and undramatic, but in my opinion, extremely
handsome. Sometime during the 1970s, a store selling Tibetan antiques opened in
Boulder, stayed with us for a very few months, and then closed. I fell deeply
and passionately in love with this rug, all the more so because its price was
greatly reduced during the closing fire-sale.

The rug is supposed to be "old" and it certainly wasn't recently knotted. It was
represented to me as being made of yak hair, but MP, our rug expert, fingered
it and said, "No, that's wool." MP wouldn't hazard a guess about its age, but
he did enlighten me about the symbolism: the three cranes in the center panel
signify longevity; the four corner figures are "happy bats," and happiness is
also figured by the four very small, almost unnoticeable, swastikas. So it's a
joyful rug. There are also many snakes and a number of figures that MP couldn't
identify. It's remotely possible that this rug was originally some sort of
monastic bench cover and that each of the crane figures represented a place to
sit. I doubt this theory because the sitters would have had to be very small
monks with tiny tushies.

Title: My Life in Objects -- VIII (Silverware)
Date: August 15, 2020

It's a place setting, sterling silver, "Diamond" pattern," manufactured by Reed
& Barton of Taunton, Massachusetts in 1958. I own nine such place settings as
well as a few miscellaneous serving pieces. I like them now but I didn't back
then.

In the 1950s, dear grandchildren, it was considered ideal for respectable
middle-class women to marry at a young age; if possible right after university.
Or even sooner -- when Althea graduated from high school, her Uncle Mendy, who
was never the absolute epitome of tact, said to her, "Don't worry, you'll meet
someone in college."

Despite her intelligence and experience, Althea was at heart a conventional
small-town girl, and she wanted a wedding with all the trappings -- and the
trappings included not just a cheese tray and a fondue pot, but a long white
dress and bridesmaids and a bridal registry and china and especially silver.

Althea chose "Diamond." If I was consulted -- I don't remember -- it wouldn't
have mattered. It was her decision. All I knew was that Althea and I were
moving from Ithaca to Massachusetts, I to graduate school and she to a teaching
position at Warren JHS in Newton -- and that if I wanted to wake up in the same
bed as my beloved, I had to be married (remember, grandchildren, this was the
retrogressive Eisenhower era, and men and women did not live together without
legal sanction). Apparently, in order to get married, it was necessary to go
through a series of utterly mystifying rites, all of which were arranged by
Althea and her mother. I was completely indifferent and oblivious to formal
wedding invitations and to seating charts and to the choice of music (a piano
player I believe) and most especially to the rabbi (who drowned himself in a
local lake a month after officiating at our ceremony). Honestly, I felt as
though I was just an extra who was trundled onto the set to stand next to the
bride and, when called upon, to say "I do."

But I console myself by remembering that I was not alone --that I was one
of an entire generation of bewildered half-grown gawky 1950s bridegrooms in
tortoiseshell glasses and borrowed suits.

Once I got my adult legs, I could admit to Althea and to myself that I resented
the "Diamond" silver. For 1970s me, it embodied and symbolized everything that
I disliked about the conservative prudish postwar culture into which both of
us had been indoctrinated. With the advent of the war in Vietnam, the civil
rights movement, and the series of ghastly assassinations, the silver became, to
me, an index of bourgeois conformity and pretense. It offended me, deeply. And
therefore the silver utensils went into the closet and remained there for 35 or
40 years.

When we shifted to this new address, in 2009, I took the silver out of its
banishment. I looked with new apolitical eyes. "Wow -- these things are
beautiful." The utensils were not elaborate, or fancy, or pseudo-baroque like
most such tableware, but clean, modest, spare, understated, and not at bit
pretentious. In retrospect, Althea had astonishing judgment and extraordinary
taste.

Upon investigation, I discovered that Diamond silverware is highly regarded
and much prized. It is, in the language of enthusiasts of mid-century
modernism, "important." It was created by Gio Ponti, who was, one might say,
the Frank Lloyd Wright of twentieth-century Italian designers. Among his other
achievements, Gio Ponti was the architect of the celebrated Denver Art Museum.

So now, at long last, I've restored the Diamond silverware to a place of honor,
and I enjoy setting the table with these sleek utensils. And I'm as pleased as
punch that none of my guests realize that when they spear that last fragment of
barbecued chicken, they do so with a fork of distinction.

Title: Yellowstone
Date: August 16, 2020

We watched the first season of Yellowstone (eight episodes, or about 350 full
minutes, all told). It's not our usual fare, but because a close relative, an
accomplished actor, has just contracted to appear in Season Four, it seemed
important to investigate. Yellowstone sustained our interest but in my opinion
it's mighty derivative. I think the title should be changed to The Sopranos
Go West. The principal character, played by Kevin Costner, isn't precisely a
Mafia don, but he's modeled on one. He owns a Rhode-Island-size slice of Montana
and he protects his property with gangster tactics. Like Tony Soprano, he
fights with his family, feuds with his consigliere, corrupts public officials,
strong- arms his enemies, and doesn't hesitate to bribe or ice his opponents.
Yellowstone creates a nasty dog-eat-dog Hobbesian universe that offers only an
occasional redeeming event and, among a huge cast, only two or three sympathetic
characters.

Yellowstone is not at all pastoral. The spectacular western landscape is brimful
with events common to gruesome noir and urban crime films. In the episodes we
watched, two tourists fell from a cliff and splattered, a woman was impaled by a
steel fence post, a teacher who tried to intervene in a playground scuffle was
accidentally struck to the ground and developed a brain hemorrhage, a cowboy
trying to leave his job was shot in the head and his body dumped in a ravine, a
new Yellowstone employee was branded on the chest with a red-hot iron, a woman
was crushed to death by a horse, two brothers-in-law were shot and killed in a
gunfight, a 10-year-old boy was stranded in a culvert with a rattlesnake twice
his size, a real estate developer was kidnapped and hanged, and a meth house
blew up and burned its occupant to death. I didn't keep a running tally of the
various atrocities so there were probably a few that I've forgotten.

We're hoping that our relative has a continuing part in the series (he's
supposed to play a doctor), but we're fearful that he'll be on screen for a
minute and a half before he gets his throat slit or loses a limb or two to an
enormous John Deere harvester. We won't know for a year.

Title: My Life in Objects -- IX (Shovel)

It's called a transplant shovel, and it's manufactured by Sneeboer, a company
located in Holland. If you want to buy a garden tool from Sneeboer, you get on
the virtual line, and then wait until your number comes up. Worth waiting.

I have a weakness for well-made garden tools. This one might be the best I own,
my favorite, although the Felco #2 hand pruner is also a work of art.

Note the construction. The V-shaped blade is one piece of solid steel. It's not
screwed or bolted to the ash shaft, but rivetted, twice. The "D-handle" itself
is carved out of a single solid piece of hardwood, so it can't fall apart.

I use the shovel to dig plants from crowded areas of the perennial garden
to transplant or to separate. It's also ideal for poaching ferns from the
forest. The shovel is the only tool that lets you easily divide a woody clump of
Siberian irises (or any other clumping perennial). With a standard spade, when
you try to get a little purchase, you fall to left or right or to the ground,
endangering your cranky old vertebrae. It's a superbly balanced tool, a pleasure
to use. It's going to be around for many more years.

We call it the "magic shovel."

I own no more genuine nor no more dated an artifact than these frames. I wore
them during high school, college, and for a few years afterward. They were
mighty conventional, but no more than I. In retrospect, I can't say that they
enhanced my manly beauty. The glasses made me, like all my contemporaries,
look rather like an owl. For me, the design was camouflage. I was trying to be
invisible, but if I had to be seen, I wanted to look as much like everyone else
as possible. The frames speak to the moment -- bland, ordinary, ugly.

But a few years later, during that period in the 60s and early 70s when there
were the bombings on the CCNY campus, anti-war marches and riots, and constant
social upheaval, I went rimless:

These were frames that I inherited from my father, so my new presentation was
part an anti-establishment statement, part paternal homage.

However, rimless glasses were not a good choice for a new father with three
active grabby young children. They required far too much repair and attention,
and so were always in and out of the shop. Eventually I was forced to switch to
glasses that were less political but much sturdier  -- titanium, in fact, which
is where I have remained for several decades, resisting design fads such as
huge, tiny, aviator and spangled.

Title: My Life in Objects -- XI (Typewriter)
Date: August 19, 2020

This is a picture, found on the internet, of the Underwood portable that was my
dear companion for many years. I bought it for $20 in the summer of 1956 at a
second-hand shop on Flatbush Avenue and I brought it with me to college. I even
transported it to Vermont for many summers and depended on it until the 1980s
when it was superseded by the word processor. In my mind's ear, the clickety-
clack of all those letters home as well as undergraduate and graduate-school
essays, and later, typed and re-typed manuscripts, still resonate. My fingertips
remember the cupped, pseudo-ivory keys.

It was a sturdy machine, only needing repair once, when, in a moment of
compositional enthusiasm, I hit the return bar so hard that I snapped i off.
Many were the ribbons that I wore to a frazzle.

I had enrolled in a course in "touch typing" at Erasmus Hall HS -- asa, ada,
afa, sdf, for twenty weeks. I took only the first semester of a two-semester
sequence because I was interested in the letters and not the numbers. My typing
has always been distinguished more by rapidity than by accuracy. I once claimed
that I typed so fast that my ribbon would break into flame -- a slight hyperbole
(but I admit that have always been a trifle vain about the speed of my fingers).
I am a noisy power typist and to this day I bang the keyboard of my computer
many times harder than is advisable or necessary. But heck, I learned my craft
on an imperfectly lubricated old monster of typewriter, probably purchased by
the NYC school district in the 1920s.

Where is that old Underwood now? Most likely buried in a landfill somewhere.
I should have reverenced it for all the hours we spent together. Given it an
honorable retirement.

Rest in peace, partner.

This is my favorite chair. It's made of solid oak and was constructed at the
turn of the last century, possibly as early as 1880. In style, it's cross-
cultural, a hybrid -- part European and part pure American. The top rail, the
apron and the central splat are Gothic or Renaissance Revival, though they
are not carved as they would be if authentic, but pressed. Attached to the
stiles are matching extensions, the formal name of which I don't know, which are
pierced with what looks like a double keyhole -- an element of medieval style.
But it's a rocking chair -- and rockers are distinctly American in origin --
sometimes credited to Benjamin Franklin himself. I think it's a handsome chair,
but I must admit that it's not at all graceful. It's foursquare and clunky. Tho
body sits awkwardly upon the rockers. It's appropriate for me but it's not a
chair for the dainty.

I bought this misbegotten Gothic rocking chair at an auction, either in Fairlee
or Thetford, Vermont, in 1970, for $3.75.

The armrests are darkened from fifty years of supporting my sweaty forearms.

There's been lots of good sitting in this chair.

Title: My Life in Objects -- XIV (Puppy)
Date: August 21, 2020

This woebegone object was once a plump and thriving stuffed animal -- a bear, in
fact, though for some reason my children always called him "Puppy." Their only
other stuffed animal, a snake, was named "Snakey." Pedestrian nicknames to be
sure. I admit that our family wasn't very imaginative about naming our mascots.

Even though Puppy is past his prime, he's still a most treasured critter. If
the house broke into flames, and I could only rescue one item, I'd have to grab
Puppy and leave to their fates the jeweled goblets, the ancient diamond tiara,
the Stradivarius, the Vermeers, and the First Folios. Puppy is more valuable.

Puppy looks as though he was abused, but it's not so. He was only loved to
death. Because he was our only bear, the three children struggled for ownership.
Poor Puppy was a field of combat. He was pulled, stretched, thrown, dunked,
employed as a soccer ball, and in at least one memorable instance, voluminously
vomited upon. Over the course of the decades, the sad fellow lost almost all his
fur, his corneas, his entire snout, two-thirds of his stuffing, and both of his
original ears. I myself attached two prosthetic leather ears, only one of which
survives -- and also sewed on his asymmetrical leather mouth. In addition, early
in Puppy's career, I performed a delicate musicboxectomy.

Why only one stuffed bear to be struggled over? Why not three -- one apiece --
as would be sensible in families that hope to avoid sibling strife? Why the
paucity of stuffed animals? Because both Althea and I came from families that
were ideologically opposed to such indulgences. Grandma Anne, Althea's mother,
wouldn't allow stuffed animals in her home because they were "unsanitary."
My parents didn't much believe in toys of any kind -- kids were supposed to
make their own entertainment out of pots and pans. (My father came from so
impoverished a family that a stuffed bear would have been an inconceivable
luxury.) Therefore my brothers and I grew up deprived of warm, furry, reassuring
"transitional objects," which had no consequences whatsoever, for me, setting
aside the periodic gloom and the vast existential void in my soul.

Puppy is now in my care because my children can't decide to whom he properly
belongs. I hope they don't fight over him after I die -- he can't take any more
pummeling. I stow Puppy in a drawer of the old Irish desk, but because of his
long service to the family, he deserves much better. Rightly, Puppy should lie
in state, ensconced in an illuminated lucite display case atop a stately jasper
or malachite plinth.

This is the most unusual and perhaps the most beautiful object I've ever
owned. It's a rawhide or leather puppet used in traditional Siamese theatrical
performances. On the reverse, it's dated 4 IX 85, or September 4, 1885,  which
I presume is the day the puppet was acquired (or "collected"). I purchased it
from an antique store in Denver in the early 1970s. The dealer explained that he
bought from the estate of a local man who had been a foreign service officer in
Thailand in the last part of the nineteenth century. I had never seen anything
like it, didn't know anything about it, but fell for it in a big way, and have
enjoyed it ever since.

It's called a Nang Yai puppet, and I've written a bit about it here.

She's a musician who plays a mandolin-like instrument. She wears an elaborately
decorated outfit with long sleeves and pants. For many years, she hung in a
north-facing window (our fierce Colorado sun would destroy her in a summer if
she faced south). Now she has a light box all her own, and when she's lit, she
dominates the room, but only in a benign way. She's harmoniously proportioned,
graceful and not without a touch of majesty. To my eyes, she's radiant. She
ennobles her surroundings.

Although my mother loved classical music and listened daily to WQXR, our family
did not own a phonograph. Eventually, sometime around 1953 or 1954, a record
player appeared courtesy of my older brother Eugene, who set it up in his
bedroom and also bought a few albums. His collection consisted of a few Broadway
musicals and some pop standards (Sinatra and the Mills Brothers for sure). He
allowed me to use his machine when he wasn't at home. What an opportunity! I
memorized Oklahoma and Guys and Dolls, among others.

When I was eleven or twelve years old, I was home from school of a week. Was it
whooping cough? The radio became my constant companion (no TV in those years).
Every day for a week, I listened to a "dramatization" of a novel by Dumas. I
believe it was Twenty Years After, but I can't be positive. The story was not
memorable, nor were the performances, but the "background music" was to my ears
astonishingly beautiful. On Friday, when the story came to conclusion, it was
announced that the music that had entranced me was the New World Symphony.

After I gained access to Eugene's record player, I saved my nickels and for
$1.98, the standard price of LPs at that time, I bought a copy of the Symphony.
It was an expenditure of significance, even for someone who was pulling down
$.75 an hour shelving books at the local public library.

Having discovered that one could buy and own recorded music, I little-by-little
added to my collection. By the time I graduated from college, I owned ten or
a dozen recordings. I remember Dennis Brain's performance of Mozart's Horn
Concertos, Paul Kletzki's version of Mahler's Symphony #1, an Angel recording
of Bach's Magnificat, and a Prokoviev Lieutenant Kije Suite. There were a few
others that I can no longer remember. But none of them were as important as the
Szell Dvorak, which was my gateway to the classics.

Title: My Life on "The Hill," 1969-2009
Date: August 26, 2020

We settled on University Hill by lucky accident. Shortly after accepting a
teaching position, I received a letter from my then-chairman Harold Kelling,
urging me to write immediately to Professor J. D. A. Ogilvy, who had a house to
rent near the University. I jumped to follow instructions and in August, 1969,
the four of us (ages 30, 29, 4 and 2) took up residence in a small and lovely
jewel of a Craftsman bungalow at 9th and College. It was not only a splendid
home in which to start life in Boulder but it was also conveniently located:
walking distance to Norlin Library, to the bus to Denver and to the Boulder
Public Library, as well as just a block and a half from Highland Elementary
School. We lived in that fine house contentedly until January of 1973, when
(we were now 5, Eve having joined us in June of 1970) it became clear that we
needed room to grow. The boys, Nathaniel and Ben, were adamant that we must
remain in the Flatirons school district (Highland had been closed and abandoned
-- a significant loss to the community). The children had good instincts;
Flatirons Elementary was a wonderful school. It was led by Robert Rea, the
finest principal I've ever known. During the winter of '73, we migrated from 9th
all the way to a 10th street house that had, as they say, "good bones" but which
had been "modernized" -- actually brutalized -- by a succession of owners who
had trashed almost all of its Arts and Crafts splendors in favor of oversized
mirrors, bright green shag rugs, beaded curtains, flocked wallpaper, and plate
glass (replacing stained glass) windows. But heck, it was spacious for a family
of five even though fabulously expensive ($46,500). We felt fortunate. There was
a bonus: when Althea returned to work after a seven-year interval of pregnancy,
birthing, and nursing, she was able to walk back and forth to Boulder High
School, where she taught mathematics for many years. With the purchase of the
house, our commitment to the Hill strengthened.

10th street was our home for 35 years. Over the course of the decades, we
restored our abused home to the extent that our resources permitted. We
added insulation (its first) and a modern kitchen, refinished the oak floors
and stripped the paint from the warm fir woodwork, replaced the wallpaper
and allowed the ornate brass registers to glow once again -- and moreover,
transformed a backyard wasteland into a pleasing peony-iris-daylily garden.
I'm proud to say that we left the house in much better shape than we found
it. Meanwhile the neighborhood, sad to say, did not improve along with us but
spiraled downward. In 1973, when we arrived, three quarters of the 24 houses
on our street were owner-occupied; when we departed in 2009, only four or five
houses remained in family hands and the rest had devolved into rentals --
occupied and often over-occupied by CU students. Our block was representative
of developments that took place on the Hill during our years of residence.
While the Hill had once been an essentially peaceful place, with only a rare
disturbance, by the turn of the century, it had deteriorated into a combat zone
where we and our adult neighbors engaged in constant struggle with graffiti,
overflowing trash bins, weedy untended lawns, noisy late night and early morning
sleep-obliterating parties, neglected barking dogs, gratuitous intermittent
fireworks (explosions, actually!), thefts, vandalism, as well as fraught face-
to-face encounters with rude entitled young malefactors.

What had happened between 1969 and 2009? What caused the decline from a thriving
pacific neighborhood to a disorderly student ghetto? There were a host of
factors, a few of which I can enumerate. Probably most important is that the
University added at least 10,000 students during those years and did not provide
housing for a single soul. The Hill, just across Broadway, was easy pickings for
enterprising landlords, many of them decent but some unscrupulous, who bought
advantageously, and (inasmuch as rental licensing codes were largely ignored and
unenforced), maximized their income by dividing dignified, solid old Victorian
or Arts and Crafts homes into rabbit-warrens. Many of the new occupants were
first-time-from-home students who came from far away, spent a semester or two
boozed up and hung over, failed out, and left behind their tuition money, their
damage, and their trash. What might have been profitable for CU was disastrous
for the neighborhood. Along with the increase in the absolute number of students
came a resurgence of fraternities. During the late 60s and early 70s, when
many students opposed the Vietnam war and conceived themselves to be anti-
establishment, fraternities were among the institutions that were disfavored.
Membership in the frat clubs declined significantly, but then recovered with
the coming of the more conservative, less troubled Reagan era. I need not dwell
on the fact that the burgeoning fraternities, flaunting an ethic that was anti-
intellectual and pro-alcohol, were a major cause of increased neighborhood
disruption. Along with these factors, came the replacement of marijuana, the
drug of choice during the antiwar era, with beer. Marijuana, at least in the
mild varieties of the 70s, is a contemplative drug while beer is a noisy one.The
turn to alcohol had the effect of increasing the number of bars at 13th and
College; while there had only been a couple of drinking establishments when I
arrived (Boulder had been "dry" until 1967), by the time I left, there were
more than twenty such, and the area had become a drinking "destination" that
attracted outsiders to the street and inevitably also to Hill fraternity and
house parties. And then sometime during the 70s or perhaps early 80s, the
University moved many classes from a Monday-Wednesday-Friday to a Monday-
Wednesday schedule, which meant that the weekend, and weekend drinking, now
began on Thursday night and continued until Monday morning. It was sometime
during this period that a couple of national magazines proclaimed CU as the
nation's Number One Party School, which I must assume negatively impacted its
pool of applicants. In addition, the welcome liberation of women from oppressive
social restrictions had an unintended consequence: it led to much more alcohol
consumption by female students. What had once been a rarity -- a drunken woman
-- became, I'm sorry to say, commonplace. (I had become accustomed to male
revelers untrussing and pissing on my roses, but I was genuinely flabbergasted
to see young women pull down their panties to squat on my front lawn). Still
another factor was the advent of the cell phone, which made it easy for small
nomadic bands of young people to find each other and rapidly coalesce into
sprawling alcoholic hullabaloos. Both the city government and the university,
two institutions that should have noticed these developments, remained supine
and indifferent.

Then came the riots. In 1971 there had been a protest, which turned violent,
against Nixon's secret bombing of Cambodia. But the scary riots of the 80s
lacked a political or social agenda -- as far I or anyone else could tell,
they were meaningless expressions of anomie, anarchy, and vandalism. Asked
for justification, students claimed that "there's nothing to do in Boulder
but drink" -- an unpersuasive argument about one of the most prosperous small
cities in the nation, one in which gymnasiums, theaters, libraries, hiking and
climbing trails, swimming pools, and other recreational opportunities abound.
The Hill experienced four riots in three years -- associated, if I remember
correctly, with Hallowe'en or homecoming. Sloppy, reeling revelers crammed the
streets, overturned vehicles, and hauled couches off porches to set dangerous
street- corner fires. I remember one instance in which rioters on the prowl for
fuel appropriated a substantial section of the wooden fence at the alley side
of my lot. At last, the city took notice. A commission was empaneled to study
and make recommendations. I attended a few of these meetings and was impressed
by the seriousness with which the panel took its responsibilities. Members from
the Hill neighborhood were Terry Rodrigue and Annie Fox. A report was issue and
recommendations were made, but to no perceptible effect, and the deterioration
continued.

The riots led to the re-founding of the University Hill Neighborhood Association
by the late Jane Stoyva, Rosemary Crowley, Steven Walsh, Lisa Spaulding, and 
Eleanor DePuy, among many others. With my children now departed for college,
I was able to become a contributing participant. Simply put, the Association
was divided into two camps, which I thought of as the "enforcers" and the
"socializers." The enforcers (among them Terry Rodgers, Gregg deBoever, and Ken
Wilson) patrolled the neighborhood on Friday and Saturday nights, calling in
violations to the police. The "socializers" (myself and many others) tried every
which way to integrate the students into the community. In retrospect, neither
the one nor the other technique had much of an impact.

Nevertheless, the effort to socialize the young folk had very beneficial social
side-effects, at least for me. For example, I was a member of a small group
(with Kathy Tucker, Terry Rodrigue, and LeRoy Leach) that established the
annual Beach Park Party (does it still exist?). Not only did these neighbors,
who had been until then no more than faces to me, become my friends, but I
had the delightful experience, several years in succession, of dishing out
free ice cream to both adults and children. It was my best job, ever. On 10th
Street, Althea and I initiated an annual block party, where, for many successive
Septembers, we explained to new arrivals over hamburgers and beans that they
were welcome to the neighborhood but that they should respect the people with
jobs and young children who also lived on the street. For three or four years
I was part of a group that met monthly at The Academy, trying to figure out
how to make use of that institution's resources to benefit the community. I
made a lasting friend with one of the participants, Ron Roschke, then pastor
of Grace Lutheran. I edited an upbeat, cheerful bi-monthly newsletter that
was distributed throughout the hill to permanent and new residents alike. In
addition, I represented aggrieved neighbors at restorative justice hearings,
where young scamps were counseled by their practiced attorneys that to clear
their records and escape punishment, all they needed to do was to grovel a bit
and feign remorse. I attended and spoke at many City Council meetings. I made
many friends by patrolling our street on Sunday mornings with a black plastic
bag, picking up beer and soda cans, empty cigarette packs, those ubiquitous red
beer cups, and various pieces of discarded clothing. (If there's a good reason
why a bra should lie in the gutter on a weekend morning, I can't imagine what
it might be.) I made my best Hill friend, Vin Scarelli, when we met at 2 AM,
both of us on the hunt for "trumpet man" -- a student who like to pop out of his
house in the wee hours, blow his trumpet (it might have been a bugle) as loud
as possible, and then scurry inside before anyone could nab him. The reward for
these activities was that I became member of a vibrant community -- and there's
nothing like a common enemy to bring people together

I left the Hill in 2009 in part because I was exhausted by the fight but also
because Althea's illness had progressed to the point that we needed to live on
one floor, with an elevator.

I reside now in an age-appropriate downtown condo, but I regret that I can no
longer walk around the block and enjoy a brief "how are you" with neighbors with
whom I've collaborated on one project or another. I miss the society of the
Hill, but not its disorder. Among its other virtues, there could have been no
better place to raise children.

One might succumb to nostalgia -- except that when I sit on my Walnut Street
balcony on a summer evening, I can hear distant booms coming from up there on
the Hill, and I remember that they were exceedingly jarring and disturbing.
The far off blasts remind me why I relocated and they cancel out any longing
to return. But let me confess that if I were to come back to the Hill, I would
return as a committed "enforcer."

Can the Hill be saved, or is it doomed to further decline?  There's no better
location -- everything is at your doorstep -- schools, libraries, Chautauqua,
foothills, all the diverse riches of a large University. It's a neighborhood
of great architectural integrity -- an outdoor museum of 1900-1920 American
design, almost as interesting as antebellum New Orleans or Art Nouveau Riga.
Its housing stock is unparalleled in Boulder; in a better world, it would be
a tourist destination. UHNA does a wonderful job of advocacy, but it's in an
unequal contest with powerful political and business forces. I think it was
during the 90s that a few of us, the late Neil King most prominently, tried
to engage the university in an improve-the-Hill project. We proposed that
the neighbors and the university (we hoped also for grant support) pitch in
to create an entity that would buy houses on the Hill and rent them to, say,
newly-arriving professors or staff who would otherwise be forced to commute
from Lafayette -- nowadays, Erie or Ft Lupton. And by doing so little by little
to undo and reverse the tipping point and rebalance the ratio of adults to
students. Although Neil was persuasive and influential (he had once been city
attorney), he could not develop any traction with either the city or CU. I am
not sure if our plan was workable, but I learned that to save the Hill will not
be easy and will require big money, big thinking, and the coordination of many
disparate groups.

In the meanwhile, the struggle between the  enforcers and the socializers
continues. Should police educate or should they arrest and ticket our student
hooligans?  Let's do both. If a new first year student arrives in Boulder on a
Thursday, misbehaves during the weekend, and the following Monday forwards to
his mommy and daddy the news of a $5000 fine -- well, that will certainly be
educational, will it not?

Title: My Life in Objects -- XVI (Cart)
Date: August 27, 2020

It's a lawn mower, or as the John Deere people like to call it, a lawn tractor.
We call it a "riding mower." I've spent a thousand hours upon it and upon its
used-to-death predecessor. Keeping up the lawns take just about three hours --
twice a week in May and June, bi-weekly come a dry September. It's a useful
machine -- uncomplicated, rarely out of service, finely engineered. With its
wide cutting deck, I can maintain the lawns with minimum of fuss. It's a royal
pain when it does break dow. You can read such a failure here.

But it's not the mower but the #10 cart that has changed my life for the better.
I came into possession of the cart twenty years ago, and have used it, hard,
every summer since. Sometimes it develops a flat tire, but otherwise, it's
perfect.

In the pre-cart days, from 1968 to 2000, I possessed only a battered old
wheelbarrow. If you want to move manure from the pile to the garden, you can
fill a wheelbarrow with about two cubic feet of material. Then you use your own
personal arms and legs to haul the wheelbarrow to its target, always uphill, and
dump it. But if you  use the cart to move manure, you can fill it with a full
cubic yard or perhaps more of the "well-dried." Then you hop gracefully onto the
lawn tractor and let the mower pull the cart to your garden. The machine does
the hard work and your back doesn't "go out." (The rear panel of the cart is 
removable and with not much effort the front of the cart can be raised to dump
stuff out the back). You drive away a few feet and the cart empties itself.

Same thing with brush. If you've accumulated a couple of hours worth of brush
and weeds, and you want to move it to the brush pile -- why then, a trip's worth
is only what you can carry in your arms. But with the cart, you can stack and
compress the stuff and move ten times as much, especially if you've learned how
to make use of bungee cords. And again, you don't have to carry or drag; you
let the machine do the hard work. Some decry the gasoline engine, but I'm all
gratitude.

The cart allows me to do many times the amount of work as a wheelbarrow, and at
much less cost to my aging body. It's a gol durn miracle.

(Those are NGP's miniature donkeys, Big Joe and Little Joe, in the background.
They may not be aware of it, but they've also made important contributions to
garden fertility.

Some very serious contributors to film art created this almost forgotten
whodunit. Deadline at Dawn was adapted from a novel by Cornell Woolrich and
the screenplay was written by Clifford Odets. Cinematography was by Nicholas
Musuraca and direction by Harold Clurman. That's some pretty good bloodlines.
Moreover, the principal roles were played by young, sparkling Susan Hayward and

Title: My Life in Objects -- XVII (China)
Date: August 31, 2020

These very pretty pieces of china mean nothing to the world at large but they
have great importance to me.

When I was a boy, the only holiday that was celebrated at 539 East 9 Street was
Thanksgiving. Why was it not forbidden along with all the others? The reason, I
suspect, is that it was the holiday least tainted by religion.

My parents were not sociable people and Thanksgiving was the only time of year
that our house ever saw a guest or that I experienced conviviality -- which is
why this particular china pattern of became important to me. My parents owned a
broken set -- perhaps a dozen or so pieces. I don't know how or when they were
acquired, or why, but I do know that they appeared, annually, in November. To me
they said, and still say, not only turkey and sweet potatoes, but friendship and
laughter.

I'm still surprised that they owned such handsome pieces -- far too fancy and
decorated for our modest utilitarian household.

I inherited these remnants because neither of my brothers expressed any interest
in them. For the record, they are Charles Field Haviland, commissioned by
Macy's, and originally manufactured in 1938, so they would have been newish
when acquired by my parents. I once knew the name of the particular pattern,
but I've forgotten it. In the catalogue they're listed as "Head 174".They are
terribly respectable and have "establishment" written on their faces, but they
have almost no monetary value. Less than nothing, in fact -- you'd have to hire
a couple of guys to cart them away.

One day, on ebay, I found on auction a full set of of what I had come to think
of as "my family pattern."  A hundred or so pieces -- three different size
plates, soup bowls, cups and saucers, serving dishes, sugar and creamer, a
butter dish -- the works. Needless to say, it was not difficult to outbid the
competition. I "won" the auction -- a small triumph which I choose to regard as
tribute to my heritage.

Now, whenever we have guests, which is a lot more frequently, believe me, than
it was in my family of origin, out come the Charles Field Haviland dishes.
Especially at ceremonies and Thanksgivings.

I'm sad that my children show not the least interest in this chinaware. But why
should they? They were not a mysterious feature of their childhoods.

Perhaps, some day, one of the seven grandchildren will be intrigued. But I'm
doubtful.

Title: Amnesia on Film: The Secret Fury (1950)
Date: September 09, 2020

t

There are amnesia movies and there are gaslighting movies. The Secret Fury is
both, and, I'm sorry to say, it fails to hit two separate marks.

A bad bad lawyer and cadre of hired subordinates contrive to gaslight rich Ellen
Ewing (Claudette Colbert) into believing that, while amnesiac, she killed a
man. In any recognizable universe it would be impossible or at least extremely
difficult to persuade a sensible, mature woman that she suffers from a loss of
memory. Not in NoirThrillerMysteryLand, where amnesia is just about as ordinary
as a case of summer sniffles. So Ellen takes the amnesia bait and gets herself
consigned to a mental hospital until her boyfriend David McLean (Robert Ryan),
who is not the swiftest, finally figures out what's going on, and after a
frantic fistfight, rescues and vindicates his lady.

I myself was thoroughly confused by the multitude of loose ends in the plot. Who
was it who strangled the hotel maid, played by Ethel Mertz aka Vivian Vance? And
why?

Bosley Crowther of The New York Times, who hardly liked anything at all, was
more-than-usually outraged by this film. He called it "wantonly unintelligible"
and "cheap and lurid trash." I rarely agree with BC, but in this case he he went
easy on The Secret Fury. I was equally infuriated -- The Secret Fury is a film
without a shred of integrity. But what's to be expected when a phony case of
false induced amnesia is at the heart of the matter?

I feel for Philip Ober, who put his heart into playing the villain and was
forced to mouth with a straight face some of the most ludicrous dialogue ever
composed. I feel also for Jane Cowl, a graduate of Erasmus Hall High School,
who played bland Aunt Clara. Jane Cowl had a long career and appeared in many
respectable films. This one is an embarrassment.

So is the crowded, unartistic poster.

Title: My Dreamatorium
Date: September 14, 2020

The house was surrounded by bears. They were, I must admit, not very convincing
bears -- my dreamatorium didn't seem to be able to generate realistic grizzlies.
Instead, these bears looked like actors in bear costumes. Even though they were
silent, they were menacing and I was frightened. I remained inside the house
trying to protect some children who may or may not have been my own offspring. I
thought, if I just fire my pistol into the air a few times, I should be able to
scare the bears and drive them away. So I started to look around for my pistol,
but no luck. I searched the drawers, several of them, and also looked through
my luggage. No weapon. Then I had a revelation. I remembered that it's not in
this dream that I have a pistol -- that was in an earlier dream, a few days or a
few weeks ago. If there's no pistol, how do I deal with the bears?  I was out
of ideas, but just then a woman, not someone known to me,  but middle-aged and
blonde, appeared, and inquired, do you want me to get rid of the bears? What is
your plan, I asked, and she responded, with the "performance." A "performance"?
She added that it would cost me a bit of money but that we would settle about
the payment later. I agreed with the plan and told her to go ahead with the
performance. Which she did -- she gathered a number of people, including some
very young children, who formed themselves into a circle and sang a song (more
like a chant) and danced. The performance chased the bears away, so I woke up. I
never did settle with her about the fee.

It wasn't my best dream -- but it's not entirely without interest. I'd give it a
B-plus at most. I admire the details about the wrong-dream pistol and about the
"performance."  By the way, I've never owned a pistol and haven't had a weapon
in my hands since ROTC in college, and I have no idea why my dreamatorium is so
convinced that I did so.

I continue to be amazed that my nighttime life is so much more inventive than
my daytime. In actuality, I'm not at all an imaginative person. When I set out
to write fiction or poetry, which I have done at various times in my life, it's
a disaster. The truth is that I have nothing to say. No plots, no situations,
no dialogue, no wit, no insights. And yet, night after night, I find myself in
crazy, bizarre but also imaginative situations. I wake myself out of dreams,
like this one, that refer back to past dreams -- as if Tuesday's dream, were a
continuation of Monday's and Monday's a piece of a continuing narrative -- as if
my dreams were chapters of a long novel or perhaps episodes in a TV serial.

My dreams are almost always nightmares. I'm lost in a strange city, can't find
my way back home. Surrounded, defenseless and alone, among enemies. Infinite
variations on themes of helplessness and hopelessness.

The pleasant dreams are very few but they can be inventive and fun. Once I
dreamed that I could swim like a fish, not by flailing my arms but rather by
swiveling my entire body. I was as as quick as a pickerel. And several times, I
had gravity-defying dreams in which I compete in the long jump, but don't come
down, just skim along the surface of the earth like a Greek goddess. A very
liberating fantasy.

It wouldn't be difficult to interpret the bear-pistol-performance dream. Life is
dangerous (the bears), there are possible remedies (the pistol), but community
support (the performance) is more effective than individual action. If I were
feeling Jungian, I could find all sorts of bear or half-bear archetypes in the
folklore. I'm absolutely positive that sometime during the long haul from the
Olduvai Gorge to Ellis Island, one or more of my ancestors, living in a cave or
a daub-and-wattle hovel, faced off against carnivorous creatures. Perhaps the
dream emerges from some atavistic portion of my brain or is embedded in my DNA.

But I don't believe it. I attach little meaning to dreams. Surely, they reflect
one's anxieties, but they don't predict the future or explain the deeper
mysteries of life. I think that they're nothing more than the chemical circuits
of the brain going haywire. It takes a lot of effort to keep the synapses
under control, and when we sleep, those controls are compromised. We become
unhinged. Didn't WS say something like lunatics and dreamers are of imagination
all compact?  Or did he?  Well, lunacy and dream and imagination are closely
related, whether he said it or not.

Title: New Light on Vikings
Date: September 19, 2020

I read all 599 pages of Neil Price's just-published Children of Ash and
Elm, a detailed history of the Vikings, and I'm mighty proud of myself for
persevering.  It's a long book bristling with details and data. The author,
an archeologist, has made his own original contributions to Viking research.
To produce this synthesis, he seems to have read every relevant article and
monograph of generations of scholars. An impressive feat. I wonder, how much
will my intermittently faulty memory retain?

Has my understanding of the Vikings changed? Yes, I think it has. I knew that
the Vikings were famous for cruelty, plunder, pillage and rape, but I had no
idea that they were so deeply involved with human sacrifice and slavery. 
"The Vikings," says Price, "were not only slavers, but the kidnapping, sale,
and forced exploitation of human beings was always a central pillar of their
culture." Slaving was "the main element" of commerce with Russian and Ukraine.
The chapter on Viking slavery is grim reading indeed. It won't make you proud of
your species.

or burdens. A "skald" is a Norse poet. "Theophoric" refers to words, often
place names, that embed the name of a god or goddess. "Futhark" is an early
or older form of the runic alphabet. A "quern" is a simple mill for grinding
grain and consists of two stones, one on top of the other. A "dirham" is an
Ottoman coin; the word derives from the Greek drachma. "Tephra" is fragmental
material produced by volcanic eruption. A "sigil" is a symbol used in ritual
magic. "Lamellar" is the adjectival form of "lamella," which is a thin flat
overlapping scale, in this case used to describe a kind of leather armor. A
"hydrarchy" refers to the rule of a piece of land from shipboard, and also to
"a pseudogovernmental system of law between pirates at sea." "Emic," a fire-new
word, describes the analysis of a culture from the perspective of a member
of that culture. And my favorite (how could I not have encountered this word
before?) -- an "ogonek" is a diacritical hook placed under the lower right
corner of a vowel.

Title: Bleak House Once Again
Date: October 01, 2020

I just completed another long stroll through Bleak House. It's either my fifth
or sixth time through -- or almost once a decade since 1958. During this
reading, which will no doubt be my last, I felt that I was imprisoned by the
novel, hogtied; that I couldn't do anything or read anything else until I made
it to the end of entire 900 pages. Dickens took over my life, and not for the
first time. It was a struggle, perhaps made worse because my eyes are not as
good as they once were and because the print in my Oxford Classics edition seems
to be growing tinier and grayer.

It was a willing surrender and I was a willing captive. How can I not be dazzled
and impressed by the profusion of Dickens' imagination and by his genius at
keeping a dozen plot-balls in the air.

Nevertheless, I don't ever remember being quite so angry and impatient at Mr.
Dickens.  "Let 'em wait." Well, I waited for five days, which as fast as i can
trot nowadays.

The good parts of Bleak House are as good as anything in the language. The death
of Jo the crossing sweeper ("And dying thus around us every day") remains the
single greatest paragraph in the long history of the English novel. "Dead, your
Majesty." The encounter of Sir Leicester and Rouncewell was much better than I
remembered it. Mr. Chadband, the oleaginous preacher, was, this time, remarkably
pertinent. Mr. Bucket is a triumph. Lady Dedlock's long repressed love for
Captain Hawley was more poignant.

But I've lost my admiration for some other parts of the novel. I could hardly
bear Esther Summerson's goody-goodiness; and, this time, I have to say that
Esther's relationship with her dear darling Ada seemed suspect. Far too
sentimentalized. Ada herself, still in mourning seven years after the death of
her misguided weak husband -- unbearable.  The Jellyby and Pardiggle satires
seemed misguided, excessive.  I was not amused by Mrs. Snagsby's jealousy or
by the relentless pillorying of poor Mr. Guppy. Harold Skimpole's infantile
nattering has lost its charm.

There's never been a novelist with more heart or less intellect than Dickens. He
is the best of novelists, the worst of novelists.

This standing stone might look like an ordinary piece of granite, but it has a
rich history. If you look very closely, you can almost see the two deep holes
that have been drilled into it. Though it's now merely a garden ornament,
decorating a perennial border, it was once a working fence post. Hinges would
have been hammered into the holes.

We found this post up on the hill, deep in the second-growth forest, very close
to the remains of what was either a well or a cesspool and beneath the giant
senescent maple that must date from pre-Colonial times.

There's also a second megalith, also drilled but not visible in this picture,
that now guards a parallel perennial border. Long ago, the two posts flanked
an old farm road but the wooden gate that once stood between them had already
rotted and disappeared fifty years ago when I first happened upon the posts.

The area where the post stood is surrounded by numerous substantial stone walls
that once delineated the boundaries of various fields. Tom Roberts, who farmed
the property from 1926 to 1967, told me that he grew apples and potatoes on the
hill. There's no need for a gate for potatoes, so the posts must date from a
previous era when the land was used to pasture sheep.

We decided to honor the posts by placing them in a more prominent position, so
one day we loaded them into the bucket of the Deere tractor and brought them
down. We dug a hole about a third the length of the post, chained it to the
bucket, and lowered it into place. NGP is getting to be mighty skillful at
maneuvering the tractor. The posts are handsome in their new situations. Robins
like them too, as places to perch.

Title: "My Week": the Secret Diary of D*n*ld Tr*mp
Date: October 06, 2020

Dear Diary: why is everybody always picking on me? It's been a really bad month,
even before someone deliberately gave me the virus. Sometimes I want to cry,
it's been so tough, but Daddy Fred would hate me for that. The press, the TV
people, some of those losers at Fox (not Hannity). Even my own niece, Mary, who
claims that I cheated her out of millions of dollars. What an ugly bitch she
is!  And then someone leaked that I called American soldiers losers and suckers
for dying -- I never said that, and if I did, it was private. They claimed that
I wouldn't visit that frog cemetery because it would mess up my hair -- well,
I paid $70,000 for my hair and they want me to go to some foreign cemetery for
some war that nobody's ever heard of -- in the rain. Fuck, not me. That's for
dummies. Then I went to Tulsa for a celebration of me me me and nobody showed
up. Parscale was responsible for that mess;  I got rid of him. Someone will try
to get him to rat on me, but he won't. I've got him by the pecker because of
all the money he's embezzled. And then some disloyal son of a bitch leaked that
I said that the virus was good because I could get away without shaking hands
with donors, Of course I don't want to touch them, they're disgusting losers,
full of germs. But I got to take their money, I don't want to spend mine. I'm
already into Putin for millions. My pussy advisors tell me I have to pretend to
be friendly, when I'd rather relax at Mar-a-Lago and eat cheeseburgers and spend
time with Hope. Then, a couple of days ago the nasty, failing New York Times has
a big story about my income taxes. Fake. Fake. Fake. I pay plenty, of course a
lot less than loser teachers and nurses who don't know how the system works.
Then Woodward, who I thought would give me good press, says that they're all
ganging up on me behind my back. Cowards and losers. Woodward says that wacko
Mattis, the turncoat, said that I had the understanding of a fifth or sixth
grader. How can that be -- my uncle taught at MIT? Plus I had great SAT scores.
Dummy Kelly thinks I'm an idiot and unhinged. That blimp Omigault says that I'm
a racist, a misogynist, and a bigot. Wacky nut job Gary Cohn says I'm as dumb as
shit and corrupt McMaster called me a dope. Publicity-seeker Bannon says that
I'm like an 11-year old child. Lightweight grandstander Tillerson called me a
moron. What's with all the name-calling? Good thing Jeffrey Epstein pulled his
own plug, if he really did, he had me worried for a while. Then all these dumb
women! All out to get me!  Katie Johnson and Summer Zervos and Jean Carroll and
twenty others. They all wanted it bad and then they changed the rules and now
they're out to cash in. Sad! Low IQ slut Stormy still trying to make me look
bad. And Rudy lobbying me every day to pardon Manafort and Roger Stone and his
other friends. Sometimes I just want to go to Russia and move in with Putin. God
I love that guy. I wish Roy Cohn was still alive. So much smarter than disgraced
idiot Michael.

Why is everybody always picking on me?

Title: Natural Disasters, Fear of
Date: October 11, 2020

It's unlikely that I will be killed by a tsunami. I just don't get to the
seashore very often -- the last time was five years ago -- and I happen to
reside most of the year at an altitude of 5300 feet. It would have to be one
heck of a tsunami that would find me here -- 1200 miles inland. An ordinary
rainfall-caused flood is a more likely cause of death. We have a big one every
decade or so. But still, I live on the second floor of a concrete and steel-I
beam building and even a thousand-year event wouldn't touch me. I might be in
danger if I happened to be hiking in one of our many narrow canyons, where you
see signs that say "in case of sudden flood, climb to safety." But I'm not
much worried about a narrow canyon situation because I like to stay home and
in bed when it starts to rain or even when there's a threat of rain. For the
same reason, I'm not afeard of dying in an avalanche. I don't ski and I don't
climb mountains, especially in the winter. In fact, I tend to stay at home,
sipping hot cider, on cold days because I'm afraid of slipping on the ice and
busting an arm or a leg or a hip. A volcano, then? Not likely. There are no
active volcanoes nearby and those hotspots under the geysers in Yellowstone
aren't scheduled to explode for a few hundred thousand years. I just can't
see myself racing ahead of a pyroclastic flow. A forest fire? Always a danger
because they've become more frequent with global warming. Nevertheless, I don't
think a forest fire is likely to kill me because even though I live less than a
mile from the mountains, there's enough buffer between my home and the forest
that it's pretty impossible for a fire to cross into my zone. (A house fire is
even more unlikely, especially because of the up-to-date built-in sprinkler
system and the cinderblock-enclosed staircase). I suppose I could be killed by a
lightning strike but I'm not likely to be outside dancing during a sudden storm.
A hurricane -- well, we don't have any here and although I spend a significant
amount of time in New Orleans, I limit my visits to the late winter or early
spring, so I'm not in residence during  the bad season. A tornado is a remote
possibility. Once again, I'd have to go far to find one, because they don't seem
to come into my city. I once identified a funnel cloud out to the east, but it
didn't touch ground. A blizzard? Well, I've certainly experienced blizzards
and once I was caught in one, but frankly, unless I should happen to drive the
Subaru into snowbank and freeze to death, or go out for a long walk in the
open space in the midst of a storm, I'm not likely to perish. Then there are
earthquakes, which would be a real possibility if I lived in California or along
a fault, but not here in the stable Rockies. So on the whole, I don't think I'm
going to die in some natural disaster.

Wait, what about a meteorite falling from the sky and bopping me on the head?

Actually, that sounds like a good way to go. No long period of fear and anxiety
waiting to drown or burn or be buried, just instant death while strolling in the
park on a sunny afternoon. A perfect ending.

Which reminds me of the death of Aeschylus, who, according to the story, while
walking on a beach, was killed when an eagle picked up a turtle, and trying to
break its shell, dropped it on him, thinking that his bald head was a large
rock.

Death by falling turtle -- ridiculous. Death by meteorite -- glamorous and
romantic. A story for latter generations to savor.

Oh, oh. I just thought of another natural disaster. Sinkholes. I don't want to
be swallowed by a sinkhole. Not at all glamorous. Memorable, yes. Glamorous, no.

Title: Montaigne, Kinship with
Date: October 14, 2020

There is no author with whom I feel greater kinship than with Michel de
Montaigne and there's none with whom I've passed more hours and days, except for
Shakespeare. For many years, Montaigne's Essais has been my bedside companion,
first in the old Everyman Library edition as translated by John Florio, a book
which I early discovered among my father's small collection, and latterly in the
1958 version by Donald Frame. Of the two writers, Shakespeare is the greater,
but he is unknowable and certainly not a comrade. "Negative capability" --
and all that. Shakespeare, the human being, lies hidden behind a profusion of
characters and borrowed stories. Sometimes I think I can catch a glimpse of the
man himself in recurring images or in a repeated motif, but how can I be sure?
It's all guesswork and supposition. Shakespeare is an auctor absconditus. He can
be admired, even revered, but he's too mysterious ever to be a pal. Montaigne,
on the other hand, is insistently present. He talks directly to me, guy to
guy, teaches me, argues with me. Even though there's a universe of differences
between me and this astonishingly erudite sixteenth-century French Catholic
skeptic, I feel that we are good friends.

Why the kinship? Montaigne is so various, so mutable, so inconsistent, that he's
difficult to define, but nevertheless exhibits traits with which I l am in deep
sympathy. Of all the important thinkers, he's the least systematic -- which is a
benefit, at least for me. I can't make heads or tails of his near-contemporaries
Spinoza or Descartes because both are too orderly and logical for my unsubtle
head. But Montaigne works differently -- he advances an idea, modifies it,
retracts it, illustrates it with a dozen anecdotes, and then announces that
he can't come to a definitive conclusion -- which is the way my mind works,
although obviously at a much lower order. And then Montaigne's brain is a
hodgepodge, a gallimaufry of formidable learning strewn in heaps, like the last
scene of Citizen Kane. So is mine, although it's a cramped attic compared to
Montaigne's warehouse. And of course, Montaigne writes almost exclusively about
himself, as I do in these fragmentary blague entries.

Moreover, we both seem to be at least in part writing for the same purpose.
I compose these essaylets for what I conceive of, pretentiously, as dynastic
reasons. Because I I so much wish that I had some artifacts or writing of my
grandparents or great-grandparents, who left nothing behind, no scrap remaining,
I want my descendants to have something of mine. Montaigne agrees: "What a
satisfaction it would be to me to hear someone tell me of the habits, the face,
the expression, the favorite remarks, and the fortunes of my ancestors. How
attentive I would be. Truly it would spring from a bad nature to be scornful
of even the portraits of our friends and predecessors, the form of their
clothes and their armor." [Montaigne came from a family with a strong military
tradition, unlike mine, which is epitomized by grandfather's desertion from
the Russian army.] "I keep their handwriting, their seal, the breviary and a
peculiar sword that they used, and I have not banished from my study some long
sticks that my father ordinarily carried in his hand." I have no "sticks," but
as I sit here pecking at the word processor, I see out of the corner of my eye
my father's library ladder, used for retrieving just the right law book.

Montaigne is not done with the topic. He continues by exploring an idea about
which I also have ruminated. For whom do I devote these hours, if not for
myself?  He is eloquent upon the subject.

"If no one reads me, have I wasted my time, entertaining myself for so many idle
hours with such useful and agreeable thoughts. In modeling this figure upon
myself, I have had to fashion and compose myself so often to bring myself out,
that the model itself has to some extent grown firm and taken shape. Painting
myself for others, I have painted my inward self with colors clearer than my
original ones. I have no more made my book that my book has made me -- a book
consubstantial with its author, concerned with my own self, an integral part of
my life....  Have I wasted my time by taking stock of myself so continually, so
carefully. For those who go over themselves only in their minds and occasionally
in speech do not penetrate to essentials in their examination as does a man who
makes that his study, his work, and his trade, who binds himself to keep an
enduring account, with all his faults, with all his strengths."

I wish I could say that I'm as honest as Montaigne; I'm not. I recognize that
the "me" that appears here is to some degree different from the me that is
me. Although I do not lie about myself, I conceal some of my most flagrant
deficiencies. Nor do I blow my own small trumpet. As a result, the portrait that
has emerged is solider and also less troubled than the true-to-life person.
Don't say I didn't give you notice, unwary descendants.

Title: The "Yips"
Date: October 16, 2020

The yips have been big news this week because Jose Altuve, Houston's golden-
glove second baseman has made three throwing errors in two games. Glaring,
costly errors. He's bounced balls to first base and to second base -- throws of
twenty or forty feet which he has made successfully thousands of times in his
outstanding career.

The "yips" is sports jargon for the sudden, inexplicable inability to make
an ordinary or routine play. It's commonly used by golfers when they start
missing short putts --but baseball has its famous yippers -- Steve Saxe, Chuck
Knoblauch (both of them second baseman who have the shortest, easiest throws) 
and now, possibly Altuve. Sometimes a good pitcher will lose his control and
start to miss badly; the retired pitcher at the microphone will say, "he's
lost his release point," which is a yippish diagnosis without using the word.
Athletes think that the problem is psychological but it's possible that the
condition is merely neurological - a "focal dystonia" or muscle spasm in the
wrist. Basketball yips? Yes, sometimes a good foul shooter will miss four or
five in a row.

I suspect that the yips may not be a sports-only syndrome.

Once, a decade or two ago, I was driving across the country on a four-lane and
needed to brake. For some reason, my feet (I was driving a standard transmission
so both feet and the clutch pedal were involved) couldn't remember which was
the brake pedal. I flailed with both feet and was utterly panicked for about
five long seconds. Then I came to my senses, put the correct foot on the correct
pedal, and continued on in normal fashion. Life continued. But if I had crashed
the car and killed myself, which was certainly a possibility, investigators
would have thought that I had fallen asleep at the switch. They'd have been
wrong; it was just the yips -- a failure to perform a task that should have been
entirely routine.

I wonder how many road disasters are caused by undiagnosed yippishness.

Do actors get the yips? Do musicians? Dentists?  Airline pilots? Surgeons ("You
know, I've done that back surgery hundreds of times but three out of the last
four, I've sliced entirely through the guy's spinal cord").

Title: George Raft. Why?
Date: October 20, 2020

TCM, the indispensable channel, has been delivering us a raft of old George Raft
movies. They Drive by Night (1940) of course, but also such unmemorable noirs as
Johnny Angel (1945), Race Street (1948), and I'll Get You (1952) as well as a
couple of others so unsubstantial that, although viewed during the past month,
they've already evaporated from my tired old brain.

This last while, whenever a George Raft picture began, we'd set a challenge:
will Mr. Raft's face show an expression? Any expression! Will he smile, smirk,
pout? Will he be angry, contemptuous, happy, lustful, disappointed? Anything at
all, any human emotion? After painstaking study, I can now report that although
we've examined every single frame, slowly and carefully, not once in any of
these films has George Raft exhibited the slightest discernible human feeling.
Moreover, on even more diligent examination, I can now affirm that he has
delivered every single one of his memorized lines without the least variation in
speed, volume, pitch, or intensity. Every sentence, no matter its significance,
exits his mouth with the exact same cadence. It's all low affect, all the time.

It's a puzzlement. What was George Raft's appeal? Certainly not his skill as a
thespian. Nor his negative charisma. He's not handsome, and because of his oddly
short legs, he walks funny (and he walks at exactly the same speed when crossing
the nightclub floor to question a "canary" or when prowling a dark alley, gat in
hand.

Even more astonishing -- in a couple of these movies he's cast as a romantic
lead who gets the girl in the last scene -- a girl who is younger, prettier,
taller, and a much better actor. There's nothing more embarrassing or
impossible-to-take-seriously than a George Raft kiss and fade. The End.

Title: Where I Live, 2020
Date: October 27, 2020

For the last eleven years, I've lived in a downtown Boulder condominium. I much
enjoy living here -- it's age appropriate. The rooms are all on one floor;
there's an elevator; underground parking for the new Subaru; no snow shoveling;
hardly any upkeep. It's quiet inside and out -- but right around the corner,
just a block away, is the semi-famous Boulder Mall, with all the urban stuff
that one could want. A music venue. Restaurants, shops, a bank, a drugstore,
a barbershop, and just a half mile to the west, the very resourceful Boulder
Public Library. In season, a farmer's market. Tourists and natives peacefully
strolling. A good place for a guy my age to "hang."

There is, however, a small fly in the ointment. This past January, Ms. Reynolds,
my consort and odalisque (we don't use the W word, or the H word either) bought
a condo down the corridor from mine. As a result, both of us traverse the short
distance (75 feet) between hers and mine multiple times a day before ending
up in my place for dinner, perhaps a movie, and sleep. The difficulty is that
there's a quirk in this building's heating system. The corridor is always
frigid; for some reason that no one seems to understand, the air-conditioning,
need it or not, is always turned up to 11. The temperature stands at 58F, summer
and winter. The people who manage the building say that nothing can be done
about the arctic blasts. Hard to believe, but apparently true.

We call our passage from one apartment to the other, "braving the polar vortex."
The corridor itself is "the tundra                                            ."

In an effort to remedy this situation, I have written the following letter to
the authorities.

"Dear Managers of the Building:

Inasmuch as it has proven impossible to raise the temperature of the corridor
higher than 58F, I propose that we attack this flaw with a new and, I dare to
suggest, more imaginative strategy. If we can't raise the temperature, let us
lower it. With a little effort we can get it down to a consistent 48F. We could
then make some money by using the corridor as a sort of root cellar. I envision
a series of individual wooden boxes, say, perhaps 6' by 4', where residents at
modest cost could store their beets, carrots, onions, and potatoes (bought in
bulk at the Farmer's Market). It might even be possible to rent some of the
boxes to outsiders and bring a little extra income into the building. What a
marvelous (and ecologically sound) solution to our problem!!

Wait. On further thought, I have an even better idea. Let's lower the
temperature another couple of degrees, to 37F, the ideal for storing dry-aged
beef. The corridor could then be re-configured as a meat locker. I doubt it
woulds cost more than $100 to install a series of hooks in the ceiling, from
which residents (and outside renters) could hang their sides of beef. Everyone
knows that dry-aged beef is premium eating. I think this could be a real money-
maker for the property.

I don't see any possible objection to either of these ideas, but I'd want the
board to decide which one seems most promising and most lucrative.

And by the way, I noticed the other day that a pair of arctic foxes seem to have
taken up residence in the corridor. We'd probably have to do something about
them before we hang the beef, or there could be complications.

Also, I might be mistaken but I think a saw an ermine skittering right near the
elevator."

Title: Overmanaging, 2020.
Date: October 28, 2020

The 2020 World Series is over, and I'm in a royal snit.

It's Game 6, the Dodgers are ahead 3-2, and Tampa Bay has a chance to win and
make the series go to seven, which is what I'm rooting for (I don't have a dog
in the hunt, because I disapprove of both teams: the Dodgers, are the despised
simulacrum of the organization that abandoned Brooklyn 50+ years ago and Tampa
Bay is from Florida, the Nowhere State -- plus it's an American League team,
but that doesn't matter this year because for some phoney-baloney covid-related
reason both leagues are using the DH. Tampa Bay is ahead 1-0 on a first-inning
home run by Randy Arozarena, who has a great short powerful swing and is either
the second coming of Henry Aaron and the centerpiece of the best trade in
history (the worst for St. Louis) or the most spectacular flash-in-the-pan in
major league history. It's the fifth inning, and Blake Snell has been pitching
a masterpiece. Nine strikeouts and not a ball hit solidly. He's throwing 95 to
the corners and his sinking curve is keeping the Dodger hitters completely off
balance. He's looking almost like Koufax, for goodness sake. So what does Kevin
Cash, Tampa Bay's manager do?  He takes out Snell and brings in Nick Anderson
and two batters later, it's 2-1 Dodgers and the game is over and the Series
is over. Removing Snell is the worst decision in baseball history, perhaps in
sports history, perhaps the worst of any human decision since the emergence of
homo sapiens.

Why was Snell relieved? Because of some bullshit trumpery statistics about
pitchers being less effective going through the lineup the third time. Not
applicable in this case; Snell had lost nothing off his fastball, he was still
hitting his spots, and he was still demoralizing the Dodgers, who looked like
dejected losers. Until -- that is, they were invigorated by the prospect of not
having to hit against Snell any longer.

Is there a word "overmanaging?"  There ought to be. Both teams were over-
managed. Too many pitching changes, too many absurd fielding shifts -- even
putting four men in the outfield--, too many pinch hitters. Baseball used to be
a players' game, and the job of the manager was to put his nine best players
on the field and let them do their jobs, perhaps calling for a sacrifice or a
steal or an intentional pass, or replacing a tired pitcher with some ex-starter
or never-was from the bullpen. But now, baseball has turned into a manager's
game, like (gasp) football. And when it backfires, as it did last night, what a
disaster! What does Kevin Cash deserve, besides firing. If I were a Tampa Bay
fan, I'd be outraged. I'd want revenge or his scalp, perhaps both.

I'm a baseball fan, and I'm outraged, livid, angry. I wanted to see what Blake
Snell could do with the Dodger hitters, third time through. More reliance on his
slider, more on the slow stuff? Could he keep getting them to swing and miss at
his fastball at the top of the zone, or just above the zone?

I'm a fan;  baseball should try to please me and the 90% of the spectators in
America who knew that Cash was making a major blunder to pull Snell. I didn't
watch the end of the game. Left the room. Boycotted.

Baseball is not as exciting as it was in the days of my youth. The players
themselves are bigger, faster, stronger, and better trained, so it's not their
fault. But because the hitters are so powerful, there are too many home runs.
Home runs are only exciting when a batter catches all of it and blasts one 440
feet into the upper deck or 40 rows back into the lower.  There's nothing more
boring than a muscular guy swinging under it and popping one up 340 feet onto
the short porch. A travesty home run. The fences should be moved back 20 feet
and raised to a mandatory 10 or 12 feet. A triple is much more exciting to
watch than a Texas League homer. When was the last inside-the-park homer with a
relayed throw to the plate, just a hair too late?

And let's put the statisticians in their place. Tampa Bay is the only team
in the league with a professional statistician on the bench -- one who never
advanced past T-ball. Is he responsible for the manager's monumental gaffe? 
And for goodness sake, let's get rid of the DH. When the pitcher is in the
batting order, there's strategy in the game. It becomes a test of intelligence,
not just a home run hitting contest. I want to admire a well-executed sacrifice
bunt.

My father had been a catcher in his younger days and had the busted fingers
to prove it.  When he was dying, I went to visit him in the hospital. He was
watching the Dodgers on the TV.  The next day, when I returned, he wasn't
watching. I said, "Dad, there's a Yankee game on the TV; you could watch it." 
He said, "Yankees. American League. DH rule. Not baseball."  He died soon
after.

I'm scared that baseball, greatest of all games, has become "not baseball."

Title: Douglas Bush's Milton Course
Date: November 12, 2020

In the mid 1980s, thirty-five years ago, I was 'in residence' for a week at the
Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, D.C., researching an article on one of
the lesser English Renaissance dramatists -- a pleasure as well as a condition
of employment. The article that I completed turned out to be not a bad piece of
academic prose, if I do say so myself, but not something for the ages either. It
was a mere twenty years since I had completed my degree in "English and American
Language and Literature" at a Large Eastern University, specifically Harvard. I
was not drawn to the Folger for professional reasons only. It was a delight and
a great privilege to hold in my very own hands and to read dozens and scores of
four-hundred-year-old ephemeral books that -- more than the canonical literature
-- helped me to understand the age of Shakespeare. Sermons by the wagonload,
biblical commentaries, almanacs, political pamphlets, poems by minor and unknown
versifiers, broadsides, medical textbooks, collections of jokes, how-to-write-a-
letter-in-Latin trots, schoolbooks. The library possessed inexhaustible troves
of such material. The Folger's plenty licensed my dilettante brain to follow its
own naturally wayward inclinations.

While doing my duty and also having some fun, I fell in with a fellow Folgerite
named Boyd Berry who was visiting from Virginia Commonwealth University in
Richmond, Virginia. Over cups of coffee, Boyd and I discussed some of the less
well-known writers of the period in whom we shared a mutual interest. I remember
that we also talked about the teacher's perennial frustration at engaging the
interest of our sometimes less-than-enthusiastic students. I do not remember
what prompted me to ask Boyd this question: "what was the worst course that you
ever took either as an undergraduate or graduate student." He replied, without
hesitation, "Douglas Bush's lecture course on Milton at Harvard in 1961." I
was flabbergasted, in part because I hadn't guessed that Boyd had been at
Harvard during my years there, but more because I had enrolled in exactly the
same course -- same time same station same year -- and because Douglas Bush's
Milton course was also my own nominee for the worst course ever. Parallel
lines had accidentally and miraculously met, so to speak. Although Boyd and
I were the same age, he was one year behind me and had taken the course as a
senior undergraduate while I had been a first-year graduate student. It seemed
an astonishing coincidence, but then, the universe of students of English
Renaissance literature is a small one. Nevertheless, the fact that we shared
the same opinion about Professor Bush's course was comforting and, as they say,
"validating." Boyd said out loud words that I had only speculated upon in petto.
Perhaps I wasn't the only outlier.

Why were we in such accord? The obvious answer is that Professor Bush, then
in the tail end of his much-celebrated career (he had uttered his infant
cries during Grover Cleveland's second presidency), was tired and bored
by his teaching and put little heart into the work. In brief, he droned,
unconscionably. Not only did he drone, but it seemed as though there was an
invisible shield between his podium and our seats. He didn't speak to us --
he addressed the empyrean. His lectures consisted of a superficial running
commentary on Milton's poems. "There's a particularly lovely passage starting
on line 695," -- as if a challenging idea would be beyond our collective
capacity. If a student broke into the drone to hazard a question, Professor
Bush's characteristic answer was, "Well, that seems self-explanatory." But
Bush's classroom style was not the only reason for my unhappiness; I had more
substantive concerns.

Let me interject a few words about Professor John Nash Douglas Bush. Although
almost forgotten today, Bush was by all odds the most formidable and learned
literary scholar of his generation. He knew everything there was to know about
English, Romance, and classical literature and had written a dozen comprehensive
critical and historical books. If the gossip can be trusted, he greeted the
dawn of each new day by reading two hundred lines of Latin poetry and a hundred
of Greek. I am sure that he knew more about John Milton than Milton knew about
himself. He had edited the volume of Milton's complete poetry (English, Latin,
Greek, and Italian) and, astonishingly, had memorized the entire twelve books
of Paradise Lost. He was an exacting scholar and a stylish and witty writer.
Moreover, he was a kindly, gentle man, cordial and generous to his students --
even to me. If he had flaws of character, I didn't know of them. To my mind,
he was an unimpeachably excellent person and scholar -- and at the same time a
teacher from whom I learned just about nothing.

I was once invited -- along with a clutch of my ambitious graduate-school
classmates -- to some sort of reception at Professor Bush's Cambridge residence.
His home was exactly as it should have been -- that is to say, if one were
making a movie about a distinguished Harvard professor, one's location scout
would not rest until he discovered the Bush quarters. It was a spacious and
civilized home presided over by gracious Mrs. Bush, who was also exactly as she
should have been. I remember that the giant main room in the house -- which
must once have been two or more large rooms that had been sutured together, was
Professor Bush's enormous study. It was more like an institutional library than
something to be found in a private home. Just as one would expect, the study was
lined floor to ceiling with handsome wooden bookcases chock full of an enviable
display of publications in many languages, some of which I could identify. I
remember being served sherry, I think, and also something preternaturally green
and fishy on an unfamiliar but I'm sure very elite kind of cracker. This dream
of an academic utopia filled me with envy. It also scared the living blazes
out of me. Why? Because for all Professor Bush's elegance and his library, and
his lovely deferential wife, his movie-set home struck me as soft, fey, self-
satisfied, and bloodless. I was dazzled and intimidated by its splendors but
at the same time wary and resistant. Only five years beyond crowded Erasmus
Hall High School in darkest Brooklyn, I knew myself well enough to know that,
however seductive, his style of life was not for me. I would have to find a more
appropriate path.

Now I want to step further back and report on two cases in which I was in
conflict with Professor Douglas Bush. Actually, the conflicts were only on my
side; Professor Bush, Olympian and serene, did not notice -- nor should he have,
frankly. These incidents continue to haunt me to this day, sixty years after
the fact. Both occurred not in the Milton course, but in an "advanced" seminar
called "Science and Humanism in the Seventeenth Century." I must explain that
the word "humanism" did not carry the meaning that it does today, as in the
phrase "secular humanism" -- an approach to the natural world that is allied
with agnosticism and which sometimes resolves into pure atheism. Professor
Bush's humanism was the altogether different "Christian humanism." It was, in
brief, the noble but ultimately unsuccessful Renaissance attempt to fuse the
"inspired" and "revealed" truths of Christianity with the thoughtful, upstanding
but unfortunately "natural" morality of the Greeks and Romans. If "Christian
Humanism" could be distilled to a sentence, it would be Desiderius Erasmus'
daring speculation -- that he would like someday to be able to say, "Sancte
Socrates, ora pro nobis", or "Saint Socrates, pray for us."

I was a humanist of the secular variety -- by birth, inclination, education
and because in my brain there was no place, not even a lone neuron, where
"faith" or "prayer' or "worship" might in more standard heads be lodged. Bush,
on the other hand, was not just a scholar of Christian Humanism, he was an
honest-to-god trapped-in-amber Christian Humanist -- and a devout one, deeply
rooted and entirely comfortable in late medieval/early renaissance thinking. In
his seminar on Science and Humanism, humanism was right and just, and science,
its antagonist, was, if not altogether bad, at a minimum a very dangerous
alternative. Did not both Bacon and Descartes assert that "nature" -- the
real world -- could be studied directly, on its own terms, rather than as
an entity infused with god's being and majesty. That we mortals might study
nature not to reaffirm the goodness and omnipotence of god, but to accumulate
objective knowledge and to reap practical material benefits. It's a fact that
the separation of nature from the "truth" of religion has over the centuries
unquestionably led to the marginalizing of Christian thinking and therefore,
according to Bush's view of the world, to the steep decline of civilization. The
world, no longer driven by revelation, has been going to hell in a heathen hand
basket, as Professor Bush said or implied every Tuesday at 4:00 pm.

Regular readers of this blague as well as Dr. Metablog's family and friends
will recognize that Youthful Me did not accept Bush's premises. In fact, in
those days, I was probably even less open to religious ideas than I am now. And
therefore, each Tuesday was a day of discomfort.

And then, one afternoon, Professor Bush began the allotted two hours by
launching a surprise assault on the then-new and controversial Third Edition
of the Merriam-Webster dictionary. The Third had shocked traditionalists.
Until 1962, dictionaries had been "prescriptive "-- that is, they explained
how language "should" be used and they stigmatized as colloq. or subst.
[substandard] those words or expressions that fell beneath the bar. The Third
forsook tradition and was not prescriptive but descriptive. It aimed to record
the language as it was really used. The Third therefore included many words
hitherto banned as slang or vulgar and it was loose and permissive with regard
to "shall" and "will", and "imply" and "infer," etc. For Professor Bush, the
Third was a plunge into darkness -- another example of the collapse of Western
Civilization as we know it, or should know it. So he excoriated the new
dictionary and its editors and its supporters. The tirade having been completed,
he turned mildly to the class and asked if anyone present had a different
opinion. Now I had learned a little about modern linguistics at Cornell, and I
was a descriptivist both by education and democratic instinct, and I knew that
Bush was completely out of step with contemporary thought. I was astonished to
discover that I knew more about this particular field of knowledge than he. But,
alas, I was totally intimidated and did not open my mouth. What abject cowardice
on my part! Nary a word did I say, and so the class segued to a discussion of
the Cambridge Platonists and their vain attempt to tame and assimilate Descartes
and Spinoza. I still wonder if any of the other 2G's around the table were aware
of my shame. Probably not -- did my peers, the late Arthur Oberg, the late Jake
Mills, the late Brian Hepworth, the late Terry Logan, the late Bill Godshalk,
and others whose names I have forgotten, notice my moral collapse? I suppose
that it's too late to worry. Nevertheless, my failure to raise my hand and voice
still humiliates me, still rankles.

Another Tuesday, another surrender. In 1961, William Empson published his
innovative study, Milton's God. While Empson was not as learned as Professor
Bush (no one was) he was a much more imaginative and challenging reader. Some
say that after Johnson and Hazlitt, Sir William has been English literature's
most insightful critic. Empson was an intellectual and social dissenter (he
had been banished from Magdalen College, Cambridge when a condom [horrors!]
was discovered among his possessions). He had written two highly influential
critical books that every serious mid-century student of literature studied
-- the first on ambiguity, the second on pastoral. Empson read Paradise Lost
through a very different lens than Bush. He was not a Christian; in fact,
he confessed himself anti-Christian because he judged there to be a serious
moral flaw at the heart of the religion -- that the sacrifice of Jesus was a
highly elaborated form a scapegoating. About Paradise Lost, he concluded that
God (that is, the character God in the epic) was confused and contradictory,
repeatedly tying himself into logical and rhetorical knots in order to justify
the unjustifiable. He also argued that irrespective of Milton's intention,
the character God became more complex and interesting when he became less
ideological and more dramatic; more, so to speak, human. He revered Paradise
Lost, but for his own, not Bush's, reasons. Milton's God was trashed by
Professor Bush, who dismissed Empson as a simple "village atheist." I was
stunned. True enough that Empson was an atheist, but true also that he was a
powerful thinker, not someone to be given the back of the hand with a flippant
ad hominem. Bush's review came out in The New York Times on a Sunday; the
following Tuesday, our teacher was lauded by my fellow seminarians. He basked
in their admiration. Did my young colleagues genuinely agree with Bush, or were
they egregious sycophantic toadies? I don't know and will never know. And then,
after the celebration, Bush asked, as if he were open-minded, "Does anyone here
have a different opinion?" If Empson had been summarily dispatched, what chance
had I? So once again, I fled the field, remained mute -- and slunk deeper into
my expensive leather chair.

Title: How I Came to Hackett Hill Road -- I
Date: November 17, 2020

What factors led a city boy, age 28, to purchase a rural property where he has
now passed fifty glorious summers? Where he is as happy as a lark with a packet
of seeds and a pruner, rake, and hoe.

It all began with my father's love for his backyard garden. "Have you ever
seen a more perfect flower than this?" he would ask, pointing me to one of
his splendid hybrid teas. During the growing season, he'd come home from work
at 6:00 p.m. on the dot, hurry through supper, change out of his lawyer suit
into his old clothes, and get to work. I never saw him more contented. He
cultivated his 30' by 40' plot with the assiduity of a Javanese terrace farmer.
I watched him carefully and participated when he would let me. I studied, with
the concentrated attention of childhood, the growth habits of snapdragons,
sweet peas, and marigolds. Then one year I was allotted a square foot of
space, right next to the dwarf peach, in which to plant seeds of my choice. 
I chose a pumpkin, a vine that did not recognize boundaries, and produced two
astonishingly large fruits. The die was cast.

There was also my maternal grandmother Sonia, originally a country girl, who
never bought an orange or a grapefruit but that she planted its seeds on the
window sill -- in one of those old wooden Philadelphia cream cheese boxes. Her
tiny apartment had a pleasant hothouse-y odor. She loved her seedlings.

And then there were the three summers ('47, '48, '49) which my family spent on
Makamah Beach near Northport on the Long Island Sound. It was my original rural
experience, and the earliest hint that there were places other than concrete and
chain-link-fence Flatbush. It was the first time in my life that I felt at ease
in the landscape.

I must not forget the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, where I spent many a happy hour.
I remember in particular its famous Japanese garden. There was also a bank of
colorful bottlebrush buckeyes that caught my youthful fancy. Many years later,
I tried to reproduce that bloom in my Vermont garden. The curve and slope of
the land were ideal, but the plant itself was not for our subarctic winters.
The buckeye has survived, barely, for forty years now and has never produced a
single flower, nor ever will.

It was at the BBG that I learned that gardening was not just about growing the
biggest pumpkin -- it was about aesthetics and design. I started to read about
the history of gardens and whenever I traveled I detoured to visit the great
examples: the Huntington, Dunbarton Oaks, the Winterthur in Delaware. And scores
more, all intimidating because they were created with the help of enormous
fortunes, huge spaces, and unlimited supplies of labor. Good thing I had my
father's example of "much in little."

Title: Brown Recluse
Date: November 29, 2020

Last night, I was lying in bed comfortably reading Michael Kulikowski's
excellent new book on the last years of the Roman Empire. I was concentrating
very hard, because it's difficult for me to retain the decisions made at Nicaea
in 325. I can read a paragraph about the Arian or some other "heresy" and five
minutes later I can't remember who was on what side, or why it matters, except
that those on the wrong side were liable to be burnt alive. What part of the
brain is supposed to retain this stuff?  In any case, I was lost in the book,
quite content, comfortable -- supportive mattress, soft pillow and all that --
while, unbeknownst to me, a spider was making its way up the backside of the
book cover. Why? Where did it come from?  All I know is that it rounded the
bend, so to speak, nonchalantly strolling into view at the very top of the verso
page.

Immediately the most primitive part of my brain was activated, I elevated out
of the bed like some sort of 1950s cartoon character, hovered for a second or
two, and then found myself on the floor, frantically flapping the sheets and
blankets, searching for the offending arachnid. Get him before he gets me!

If I understand what happened, the amygdala, the part of the brain that's in
charge of fear, governed my actions. The amygdala has been producing fear and
flight responses long before it came to be incorporated into homo sapiens.

After a few minutes we (I had called in auxiliaries) located the offending guy,
and he's now sitting on my desk in a tightly sealed Bonne Maman jam jar.

I think it's a brown recluse. It sure looks like one. The color and shape are
right out of the official catalog. According to the authorities, the only
foolproof way to ascertain if it's a brown recluse is to count its eyes -- six
rather than the usual spidery eight. But anyone who thinks that I'm going to get
close enough to this spider to count its eyes has another think coming. Brown
recluses are rare in our part of the world, but they're not unknown. My book
came via interlibrary loan from Laramie, Wyoming; perhaps the spider came along
for the ride.

Why be frightened of a brown recluse the size of a quarter, legs extended? 
"Brown recluse bites can inflict significant or even life-threatening damage.
Bites may cause severe pain, ulcers, fever, chills, nausea, joint pain, or even
seizures."  Also, necrosis. Scars from necrotic flesh can last a lifetime. A
friend of a friend lost a few months of his life and a hunk of gluteus maximus
to a bite on the butt.

The spider is quite active now in its new home -- the jam jar. It's a
beautifully engineered little creature and very industrious, unceasing in its
determination to find the way out. I admire it, behind glass, and I probably
share a lot of DNA with it -- though it's hard to feel a close kinship.

The "take-away": even though some parts of my brain have deteriorated, my
amygdalae are in splendid working order.

Title: Pairings
Date: December 09, 2020

"Kith and kin" is an excellent example of a "pairing" -- sometimes called a
"coordinate pair." A pairing is a linguistic event in which two words join to
produce a single meaning.

"Kith" has no independent existence nowadays and only exists as an element of
the pair. "Kith and kin" means "family." Originally, back then, "kith" meant
"known" and therefore signified "friends." "Kith and kin" was "friends and
relatives." No longer; now it means "family and family." "Time and tide" is
another fine pairing; "tide" meant "time" centuries before it came to refer
to the moony fluctuation of the seas, although its older meaning survives in
"eventide," "Yuletide," and similar words. Now "time and tide" seems to evoke
the inevitability of both clock and waves -- both of them joined to wait for
no man. "Kit and kaboodle" is also a lovely pairing, because "kaboodle" lacks
independent existence. It may derive from "boodle' -- a thief's bundle -- with
the "ka" added just for the fun of it. "Dribs and drabs" is more obscure in
origin and may not be a true pairing. "Dribs" is probably a variant of "drip"
but "drab" was in times past not a small amount of something or other, but an
untidy or unchaste woman. It's possible that "dribs and drabs," now a rather
neat pairing, is better thought of as a reduplicative like mumbo-jumbo or
hoity- toity. "Nook and cranny" is a pairing in which both elements survive
independently; "nook" originally a corner of a room, and "cranny" a narrow
space in which a brown recluse might hide. When someone or something grows by
leaps and bounds, it's hard to tell which is the leap and which the bound. The
same with "hot and bothered" -- the two words simply reinforce each other.
Similarly, a person might want to "pick and choose" between alternatives, but
to do so requires only one action. "Flotsam and jetsam" is an amusing pairing
of uncertain origin. It is often thought that flotsam lies on the surface of
the water and jetsam is thrown into it, but such a definition might be merely
a folk etymology derived from the words "float" and "jettison." A "hoot and a
holler" both refer to shouting, but now they mean "shouting distance." "Stuff
and nonsense" is obvious, but what sort of "stuff" is nonsensical? Perhaps
it's the very vagueness of "stuff" that it allows it to pair up and reinforce
"nonsense." "Alack and alas" is a weary but euphonious pair. "Wrack and ruin"
becomes more transparent when it's remembered that wrack is a variant  form of
wreck -- as "beck and call" becomes clearer when it is recalled that "beck" is a
foreshortened version of "beckon." The cry in "hue and cry" is obvious; the hue
is thought to derive from the OF verb huer (shout).

Null and void, bag and baggage, prim and proper, vim and vigor, are self-
explanatory.

Bits and pieces are sometimes called odds and ends. That's the long and the
short of it. Jot and tittle have been thoroughly researched and explicated
here.

Is "footloose and fancy-free" a pairing. Yes, I think so. An energetic and
imaginative pairing.

Once again, I was lost, this time in a strange city -- apparently, I was trying

and my companion (a guy totally unknown to me, by the way) asks a traffic cop
the name of the city at which we've arrived. The policeman says to my friend,
"ay, ya" and my friend says to me, and I quote this lunatic absurdity absolutely
verbatim, no embroidery whatsoever, 'He says we're in  ay-ya, which is West

"West Indian for New Brunswick, New Jersey?"  Goodness gracious, is that

It's been a rough year what with the madman president and the covid pandemic.
And also deaths and diseases among my close friends. I have at least ten male
friends who've lost their wives after long marriages. Some have bounced back,
some will never get over the grief. At the beginning of 2020, I made a joke: 
"it's going to be the year of the ophthalmologist." It turned out to be the year
of the thanatologist.

Nevertheless, I can honestly say that my dominant mood is one of gratitude.

Grateful that I've lived a long life, mostly healthily, and that my children and
grandchildren are thriving. I'm not rich, but I've never missed a meal for want
of cash.

When my father was my age, he was crippled with arthritis and he was widowed,
living a sad solitary life. I take long walks in the mountains and have a new
love in my life.

As of today, 1.1 million Americans have been vaccinated against the virus. There
will be errors and disruptions and scandals, but in a few months we'll be mostly
back to normal. And I believe and hope that our wonderful country will survive
this accidental lunatic presidency.

Title: A Scots Quair
Date: January 12, 2021

I've given over the last week or ten days to Lewis Grassic Gibbon's A Scots
Quair and I'm very pleased to have done so. And I'm embarrassed that I've only
now read this strange brooding wondrous series of novels. How could I not have
known? For those equally as ignorant as I, the Quair is a trilogy -- Sunset Song
(1932), Cloud Howe (1933) and Grey Granite (1934). Together they tell the story
of Christine Guthrie from childhood -- about the turn of the century -- through
the years of the Great Depression. I can't remember reading a piece of fiction
that has so thoroughly engaged me, or encountering  a fictional character so
fully realized as Chris Guthrie Tavendale Colquhoun Ogilvie.

Here's a picture of Gibbon (birth name: James Leslie Mitchell) who died at age
34 from a botched surgery.

The novels do for the northeast corner of Scotland what Thomas Hardy did for
the southwest of England. Gibbon's corner of Scotland is traditional agrarian
society beset by doctrinaire religion, industrialization, war, and the Great
Depression. The novels range from extremely brutal to marvelously lyrical. They
are not without defect: sometimes too long, often too preachy. Occasionally, I
felt that I was being treated to a Scottish version of "orientalism": Scotism,
perhaps. The books want condensation, editing; sometimes I felt that I was
reading a first draft -- but Gibbon wrote fifteen books in seven years, so signs
of haste are inevitable. Gibbon might be called a local colorist or a social
realist, but he's much more. His feel for the landscape and for history is
unparalleled.

In subject matter and tone, A Scots Quair reminds me most of Halldor Laxness's
great Icelandic novel, Independent People. It's also like one of Hardy's Wessex
novels, but funnier, more playful, and yes, more sensual. There are stream-of-
consciousness speeches that recall Faulkner and passages that might have been
written by James Joyce (not the Joyce of Ulysses but the Joyce of Portrait).  A
much neglected masterpiece.

Title: The "Dreaded American Hug"
Date: January 13, 2021

The coronavirus has been sorely inhibiting. It's no fun for me to keep a
distance from members of my family with whom I'm not podded up. But there's
a benefit, because for a year now I haven't had a single anxiety attack over
what a European acquaintance calls "the dreaded American hug."  My needs
for acknowledging friends and acquaintances have been well satisfied by an
occasional and discreet elbow bump.

I'm not a hugger either by nature or by training -- my family of origin was,
well, whatever is the diametrical opposite of "touchy?"

When did the hug creep into our lives? I suspect it had its origins in late 60s
early 70s counter-culture. At least in my social circles -- that is. For all
I know, the Brewsters might have regularly hugged the Bradfords back there in
Mayflower days. Although not without massive attacks of disabling guilt.

When males want to hug me, I tend to shrink backwards. I don't want to give
offense, so I offer as much hug as my hug-averse nature can tolerate. With
women it's much more difficult -- because of the bosom problem. Too quick an
embrace and you're unsociable, but one that lasts a second too long and you're a
pervert. The best solution, I've found, is the sideways hug -- just throw an arm
around the lady's shoulder and briefly touch your right ribcase to her left. And
then beat a retreat.

Let's bring back the straight-on traditional handshake. It's sensible and
proven. And for goodness sake, no kissing each other's cheeks "like them
foreigners do."

Title: Tails
Date: January 22, 2021

Most animals, mammals included, sport tails. As well they should. Tails are
truly excellent appendages -- essential equipment for survival in many cases.
Most primates have tails, but alas, the apes, our most immediate cousins, lack
these useful "limbs." Some random mutation, way back when, and zap, no more
tails. As a result, we humans live in a tragically diminished universe. And deep
down, we feel the loss -- it's a fact that humans have been desperately trying
to grow tails for countless millennia. Embryo after embryo puts his or her whole
heart into the effort. Tails are there, prominently, between day 31 to 37 of
the gestational process, but then they disappear -- leaving the poor embryo
dispirited and regretful. In mourning! How much happier a species we would be if
we could only wag.

Tails have many uses. For locomotion, obviously. We'd be much better tree and
monkey-bar climbers if we had good prehensile tails. We wouldn't be nearly so
earthbound. There would be fewer dangerous falls if we had tails -- they're
essential for balance. Just watch a cat or a squirrel. Plus a human with a tail
could grab on to something to keep himself upright. A tail can also be used for
defense. Grab the bad guy's arm with a good strong grasping tail. Think about
how much more interesting the martial arts or wrestling would be if were were
betailed. Imagine how useful a prehensile tail would be at a cocktail party;
both your hands are occupied spreading the green stuff on the cracker, so you
hold your wine glass with your tail.

Tails are also good communicators; they're expressive. Observe canis
domesticus: submission, aggression, defiance, excitement, puzzlement. Tails
would be important for parent child interactions. "Don''t you dare swish your
tail at me, young lady." If dogs can do it, why couldn't we do it better?

And also sexual activity. Imagine the possibilities.

Style: "how are you wearing your tail this year?" Billion dollar industries
revolve around haircare. Tailcare offers even greater possibilities. I'm sure
that the expense of tail grooming, tail coloring, tail enhancing, and tail
bejeweling could lift us out of most recessions. Tailcare would be one of the
major drivers of the economy.

Human life would have been infinitely richer.

And so my dreamatorium continues to exceed expectations.

[February 13.  Still another "I am lost" dream, but this one with an unusual

so I can board the train, and the attendant says to me, "do you want your change

of dry spaghetti, wrapped in cellophane or plastic, but already falling apart. I
walk away with the pound of spaghetti and try to get rid of it by placing it on
a window ledge, but a passer-by retrieves it and hands it back to me. "You
forgot your spaghetti," he says. Soon after I find a garbage can and stow the
spaghetti, and the dream continues in predictable channels.

I think the question, "Do you want your change in money or in spaghetti?" is one
of the best sentences my dreamatorium has ever generated.]

Title: Today Let Us Celebrate the Blanket
Date: February 07, 2021

What an excellent invention! Imagine life without the blanket. At night, we'd
still be keeping warm with hay and leaves. Yeesh, defective insulation. Hay and
hayseeds in our noses and mouths. Leaves, leaflets, thick main ribs and petioles
poking and imprinting our skin. Constant renewal problems: "Have remembered to
fetch the hay for tonight yet?" Cleanliness problems -- small insects in the
hay and leaves, however carefully processed. And then frequent trips to "Hay
and Leaves" -- the chain of stores that dominates the market. "Do you know what
they're asking this year for a half bale of leaves?"

When we pull that luxurious blanket over our shoulders, do we remember to thank
the inventor or inventors of the cotton or woolen blanket?  Are we sufficiently
appreciative of the luxury in which we live?

Title: More on the Old West Bradford Cemetery
Date: February 11, 2021

In September of 2014 I wrote about a horrible tragedy that is commemorated in
our cemetery -- the old West Bradford cemetery on Hackett Hill Road. Inasmuch
as I've lived adjacent to it these last 52 years, I feel a strange proprietary
connection to the people it houses. I've wandered in it, tended it, studied it,
and cleaned up the trash left behind by visitors. I know that old burial ground
very well.

Here's what I wrote seven years ago:

"The old West Bradford cemetery, which is carved out of our land, is peopled by
the Worthleys, Hacketts, Kidders, and Sleepers who first settled this part of
Vermont. Some of them were long lived, some wandered through this thoroughfare
of woe only briefly. There are o-so-many of those sad stone lozenges at the foot
of a grave that represent infants who died too young to be christened.

Our most disturbing gravestone, in my opinion, is the the one for Stanley
Franklin Dwinell, M.D., born in 1920 and who died along with James Scott Dwinell
(age 7), Peter Dewey Dwinell (age 6), and Jonathan Dwinell (age 2) all on the
same day, December 11, 1952.  What a horror, I thought -- a man and his three
young sons all gone at once. A tragedy. But what sort?  A plane crash?  A
boating accident? House fire?  Perhaps even an infectious disease.

An internet search came up empty-handed, so I enquired of our longer-tenured
neighbors. Here's the local legend as it was reported to me. "Oh yes, the vet,"
I was told (although the tombstone distinctly says M. D., rather than D. V. M).
 "He was driving along Route 5 in Fairlee one winter morning and it was an icy
road and foggy and he went out of control and all four of them died instantly.
His wife was at home drinking a cup of coffee when she got the phone call. She
left the coffee half-finished on the kitchen table, left the house without a
word, and was never seen again. Didn't even take her clothes. Just disappeared."

It's a dramatic, heartbreaking story that sounds like the plot of a short
story by Alice Munro -- but I don't believe it, not a word of it. The same
gravestone that records the four simultaneous deaths also asserts that Constance
S. Dwinell, wife of Doctor Stanley Franklin Dwinell, died January 25, 1985, at
age 65.

I'm trying to imagine the remainder of poor Constance's life. It's hard to
construct a scenario that isn't completely dreadful. Most likely, Constance
returned, shattered, to the small town in New Hampshire, let us say, where she
must have been born. She moved back into her parents' house and took a job as a
town librarian, her life blighted by the tragedy. She never remarried.

But I prefer to imagine that after a period of intense mourning, she moved to
Paris (she had majored in French at Wellesley, I'm guessing,) and never told
a soul about her first family. There she was wooed and won by Baron Guy de
Condorcet de Noialles but could never conceive a child. It was a long happy
marriage. After Guy died, crashing his motorcycle on a winding Riviera road, she
returned to the States a rich woman, and lived out her life in a Park Avenue
apartment in New York. Friends and neighbors who had no idea of her first life
were shocked when they read the will which specified that she be buried, along
side Stanley and the children, right here in West Bradford.

That's my story and I'm sticking with it though I would very much like to know
the truth."

Then a year later, I was contacted by Larry Coffin, president of the Bradford
Historical Society. My local informant, it turns out, was all wrong about the
circumstances of the accident. Mr Coffin wrote this: "I would like to correct
your information on Dr. Stanley Dwinell. He and his three sons were killed in a
collision with a train on a crossing in Newbury, VT as he was going to treat a
patient at Woodsville (NH) Cottage Hospital. His father Dr. Franklin Dwinell was
in a car following."  Mr. Coffin did not comment on the half-finished coffee
cup.

[February 11, 2021.  I've now received the following communication from a
correspondent who calls him/herself "R". He or she is a "descendant of Stanley's
brother" and has sent me the link to this article In the Rutland Daily
Herald.  How could I have missed it?

So that's a slightly different version of the horrible story. The details are
different, but it's the same story in essence.

"R" also refers me to a letter in the Bradford Opinion by attorney Bud Otterman
of Otterman and Allen. It offers other details from the prior accounts but it's
no less tragic. "Franklin Dwinell was a a longtime doctor in Bradford when I
opened my law office in 1951. His son, Dr. Stanley Dwinell, had come home from
World War II and joined his father's practice.Their patients went to the old
Cottage Hospital near the railroad tracks in Woodsville. One of the doctors
would visit their patients each morning. When Stanley went, he would often take
his three pre-school sons with him. They would play in the waiting room while
their dad made his rounds. The morning of December 11, 1952 was overcast with
cold rain and snow in the air. About 11:30 am Dr Franklin Dwinell was called to
an accident at the grade crossing south of Newbury Village. When he arrived,
he found his son and his three grandson dead as a result of a collision with a
southbound train. There were no warning lights at the crossing."

"R" also says that Constance (Stanley's wife and the mother of Dwinell children)
"wasn't alone after Stanley and the boys passed. They had an older daughter who
was 7 and in school at the time of the accident. She's moved away from the area
and is reportedly somewhere out west now."

The older daughter, Hannah Dwinell, would therefore be 76 years old, as I write
this, if she is still alive. I feel for her. She had to overcome the loss of her
father and three younger brothers. Such an event would leave an irremediable
scar. I hope Hannah has had a good life. I wonder if she has ever returned to
West Bradford. It would be most painful for her to do so.

[I've also written about "my" cemetery here.]

Title: Anadromous or Catadromous?
Date: February 12, 2021

Until this last week, when I read Patrik Svensson's Book of Eels (2019), I
had never encountered either of these lovely and mysterious adjectives. I'm
delighted to add "anadromous" and "catadromous," along with their cousin
"diadromous" to my vocabulary, though when I'll be able to drop any of these
words into my quotidian or even hebdomadal discourse is not immediately obvious,
especially inasmuch as I'm not all that confident about their accentuation.
Moreover, I rarely get into heart-to-hearts about icthyic migration.

Anadromous fishes hatch and spend their first months in freshwater streams and
rivers but then they migrate to the vasty deep, where they grow and mature.
When they feel ready, they return to the streams in which they were spawned
to deposit and fertilize their eggs. Salmons are famously anadromous (as well
as romantic and celebrated), but equally so are less-heralded smelt, herring,
and shad. Eels, on the other hand, are catadromous. They are hatched deep
in the ocean and then drift and wander to freshwater streams and rivers.
European eels may spend, according to Svensson, as many as fifteen years in the
shallows until they get the urge for going. No one knows what calls to them,
but they plain have to go. Then they set out for the dangerous Sargasso Sea
in the mid- Atlantic. Eel reproduction has entirely evaded the eyes of human
investigators.  Nor has a single eel egg ever been identified. Eels are modest,
private, discreet. No one  knows if or how eels select their mates. Do they
enact elaborate courtship rituals, or do the females simply lay their putative
eggs amidst a cloud of eelish milt?

Eels are not kosher, but not because they are catadromous. The rules, as set
out in Leviticus, are very clear: "Everything in the waters that has fins and
scales, whether in the seas or in the rivers, you may eat. But anything in the
seas or the rivers that has not fins and scales is detestable to you."  Why
the Lord of Hosts set His face against shrimp and clams is unknowable -- but it
worked, in the sense that the religion survived and, some say, prospered for
lo these three thousand years. Food taboos are a common feature of religions
-- they help to separate us from them. But shouldn't taboos be minimally
consistent?  If the author or authors of Leviticus had said, don't eat eels,
they're slimy, ugly and tasteless to boot -- well that would be a religious
prohibition I could honor. But the scales thing, I don't know, because it's now
clear that eels do have scales (as well as fins). Eel scales are very small.
They are embedded in the skin, and they are smothered with eel slime. They are
difficult to find, but they're definitely, unquestionably present. Yet the
authorities continue to deride eels as treyf and have added the distinctly
unBiblical gloss that the fish's scales must be visible and detachable without
harming the skin. Unjust to eels, I say. I think they deserve a retrospective
pass and a full rabbinical apology.

My reasons for not eating eels are plain and sincere: eels are hideous beasts.
Even Svensson, who loves eels and eel-fishing, admits that they are loathsome to
any sensible palate.

Query: my daughter was born and lived here in her home town until she was
eighteen years old. Then she left for California, where she birthed and raised
her two fine children. Now she's returned home to her native streams at last. So
is she catadromous or anadromous?

From August 1976 to summer 1977, we lived at this odd, modernistic house at 1
Leycroft Close in Canterbury, Kent. The small tree, something in the prunus
line, wasn't there at the time so the house was more visible. The house wasn't
suitable for a family of five, but we made it work, barely. Two blocks away
was St. Stephen Protomartyr School, which the kids attended for a year. The
boys learned to play soccer and the daughter learned how to speak with an
English accent, which she forsook after two weeks back in the USA. The abandoned
railroad embankment behind the house, loaded with blackberries and wild plums,

Title: My Life in Objects XIX -- Jacquard Coverlets
Date: February 14, 2021

A coverlet is not a small cover. The "let" is not a diminutive -- it's let as in
copire lectum (L) or "cuivre lit" (Fr).  A bedcover. Neither a blanket nor a
bedspread, but both -- a decorative but warm item of bedclothes.

"Jacquard" refers to the Jacquard attachment, which was a series of punchcards
(the ancestor of the IBM cards) that controlled the weaving and allowed a
skilled workman to produce complicated patterns relatively inexpensively.
Jacquard coverlets were produced in large quantities (about 700 craftsmen are
known) in villages and small towns in the US between about 1820 and the coming
of the Civil War. Weavers were mostly immigrants from the old country whose
skills had already been rendered obsolete by factory-based manufacture. Weaving
was a cottage industry -- many weavers wove in the winter, farmed in the summer.

This coverlet was woven by Benjamin Hausman of Allentown, Pennsylvania, in 1842
-- it says so in the "corner block." It's in amazingly good shape for a weaving
that's 180 years old. The colors, especially the madder red and indigo blue
wool, are still vivid. The coverlet is impressive and beautiful and keeps us
mighty toasty at night.

Title: My Brain -- for my Grandchildren, etc.
Date: February 22, 2021

(This entry is written for my grandchildren and any subsequent descendants,
should there by any, who might like to know how and where their brain anomalies
originated. Whether they will revere or curse me for what I've bequeathed them,
I'll never know. Just as well. The further they are removed from me, the less
they have to worry, for I'm only a one-fourth donor to my grandchildren, only
an eighth to the greats. With progressive diminishment they have less and less
reason to be concerned. But they'll never arrive at zero --there's no escape
from me or from a genetic Zeno's Paradox.]

I've lived with this brain for 80-plus years now and have a pretty good idea of
its strengths and weaknesses and peculiarities. I'll try be candid about the
poor pink mass.

I have a very good memory but little capacity for synthesis or organization. I
imagine that the contents of my brain look like the last scene of Citizen Kane.
A warehouse of stuff strewn in heaps, nothing organized, everything disorderly
and random. A great twisted miscellany of jumbled information. Nothing where
it should be, everything a mess. I "know" lots of facts and data, but I've
never had the capacity to make sense of them. When I read, for example, a
well- organized book of history, I'm regularly dazzled by authors who are able
to discover and explain patterns of change or to compare one century or one
civilization with another. My brain can't do such things -- or anything remotely
similar, even at a much lower order of achievement .

I have almost no imagination or creativity. Over the year I've tried to write
stories and poetry, but the stuff that emerges from my brain is piss poor. I'm
only comfortable dealing with facts and evidence. When I'm asked to invent
stuff, to make things up, I falter badly. I'm reminded that when I was a youth
in college, many of my friends enrolled for courses in "Creative Writing." I
couldn't take such a risk -- creative writing terrified me. I was conscious,
even then, of my total want of invention or artistry. On the other hand, I'm
quite a good detective. I can follow clues. I'm a good researcher. Strange to
say, though I'm without imagination in real life, I experience spectacularly
fanciful dreams. There's hardly a night goes by that I'm not transported to some
vividly brilliant alternative world. Why can't I access my nighttime imagination
during the waking hours?  I could have been a pillar of neo-surrealism.

I'm good at arithmetic but a total bust at mathematics. I can do mental
arithmetic much better than most -- add, subtract, multiply, or divide quickly
and accurately without pen or paper. But once things become even the slightest
bit abstract, I go blank. When there is something to count, I'm your man; when
there's something to extrapolate or imagine, no go.

I have a strong aesthetic sense, especially about visual beauty. Museums or
gardens can move me almost to a swoon. I've even experienced Stendhal syndrome
a few times. Majestic mountains and spacious landscapes move me less than a
well- designed garden. Yet my delight in human artistic achievement does not
cross over into anything that might be called spirituality (as it does for many
people). I entirely lack what Charlotte Bronte called the "organ of veneration."

I have a woeful disabling case of directional dyslexia -- worse than anyone
I've ever known except my younger brother. I can't follow directions and I get
lost even in familiar territory. I believe that my inability with left right
east west (I'm brilliant with up and down!) has contributed to my general lack
of daring. Inasmuch as I've always been afraid to go a step too far in space,
I became too cautious to strike out intellectually. Perhaps my inability with
directions is also tied up with my sometimes disabling shyness -- but that's
a guess. I do know that it's the reason that I am regularly bested a jigsaw
puzzles by five-year-olds -- I can't deduce the relationship between pieces.

I'm not prone to guilt but I'm devastated by shame. I suppose I would feel guilt
if I killed or harmed someone, but I've never done much in the pure villainy
line. Though largely guilt-free, I suffer dreadfully from embarrassment. I think
that I've retained in my memory every foolish fatuous pretentious thing I've
ever said or done. I live with a highly punishing shame superego -- which is
good, because it limits the number of times in which I might make an egregious
fool of myself, but it's bad because it's kept me from taking risks that might
have been productive or liberating or just simply pleasurable.

I have a good sense of humor. I can occasionally be witty. I also appreciate the
wit of others. I've learned, over the years, not to be witty at others' expense.
I'm articulate and occasionally, but rarely, eloquent.

I'm observant. When I walk in the woods, or walk down the street, I see and
interpret more clearly than most people. Sherlock said, "You see but you do not
observe." I'm no Holmes, but I do observe. Perhaps it's false pride but I think
that I "read" people pretty well. And I read relationships well. I'm curious
about people and about things, which is why I am happier reading non-fiction
rather than fiction. I'm more interested in the facts than in "make-believe." 
An odd admission for a person who spent a lifetime teaching and studying
literature.

I'm a good listener.

I love music but I have as inadequate a sense of rhythm as anyone on earth. My
dancing is pathetic and ludicrous. My sense of rhythm is so bad that as a youth
I could never learn to pump a swing -- even though in bat and ball games I was a
passable schoolyard athlete.

I'm impatient, easily bored. If I don't get it quickly, I'm liable to give up.
But there have been times in my life when I worked with admirable perseverance
and diligence. Not often enough.

I'm fascinated by language and know more than most people about the way
languages are structured and how they work. I read foreign languages pretty
well. At the same time, I have no ear for sound. My hearing is now very bad,
except when I turn the apparatus up to 11, but even in my youth I didn't easily
distinguish "t" from "d" or "v" from "b." I seem to have to see the word in
my head before I can understand or translate it. I was good at the ancient
languages because they made no demand on ear or tongue. French was a trial
because the sounds were so distant from their spelling. In English, I'm an
excellent speller.

At this point in my life I'm more conscious of the deficiencies of my brain
than of its strengths. I feel fortunate that I had a strong memory, a feel for
language, and a decent prose style, and that those few traits were enough to
let me live a respectable life and make a decent living. But I also know that
many people perform a multitude of tasks without strain that are a torment and a
struggle for me. Which has kept me appropriately modest.

Title: Snobbery in the Verb
Date: March 02, 2021

Sometime during the hippie period, say the early 1970s, I  was driving the
big green Dodge station wagon solo from who knows where to somewhere else,
and as was my custom in those turbulent days, I picked up a hitchhiker -- a
mighty scrawny young guy. He seemed to be in bad shape -- underfed and dirty.
I suspected "speed." Compassionately, I offered him a piece of my sandwich. He
turned me down, saying, "I don't use white bread."

What an effective sentence! In a mere five words,  he managed to claim complete
moral superiority over me. I was now dismissed as a "user" of white bread. and
therefore clearly an unenlightened conformist bourgeois -- probably a rabid
supporter of the carpet bombing of Cambodia. He, on the other hand, was a
butterfly, free and liberated and a dissenter from the Loathed Establishment.

But I don't think I would remember this incident if it weren't for his
deployment of the word "use." "Use" asserts an equivalence between two habits
-- between whatever cocktail of drugs that he might be injecting or snorting or
dropping, and the white bread that I was consuming. It was also implied that my
addiction was the worser one. My emaciated pal was, in his own mind, doing me a
favor, enlightening me about the depravity of my bread habit.

But let me say a word in defense of the bread -- I don't "use" white bread in
the sense of Silvercup or Wonder Bread -- at least not since I left Flatbush
neighborhood of origin. The slices of bread in question might not have been
made of steelcut handmilled wheat berries enhanced with millet and quinoa and
baked in a hickory-fired furnace, but it would have been a perfectly respectable
bread and one that should not have been denigrated by a skinny tie-dyed trust
fund baby soon to shave his scraggly beard and rejoin his father's insurance
business.

But I sure do admire his use of the verb "use."

Here's a more recent incident. On the semi-famous Boulder Mall, not long ago,
a panhandler carrying a sign that said, "Anything Helps" held out his hand. 
Compassionately, I gave him a quarter.  He returned it to me, announcing, "I
don't take coins."

Well, everybody has to have standards.

Once again, I've been put in my place by a verb. "I don't take coins."

A third instance: I was in Boston and I wandered into a ragged antique store
that sold old and truly ancient Chinese art. The place is a mess but I notice
that the goods are museum-quality -- sculptures, mostly, but paintings and even
a few bronze pieces -- Neolithic for all I know.  Way out of the range of
my wallet or checkbook. Trying to appear knowledgeable, I ask the proprietor
if he has any Green Fitzhugh. Peering over lunettes, he says, with aggrieved
condescension, "I don't do export."

Floored again. Put in my place by Mr. Hippie, Mr. Panhandler, and Mr. Antique
Dealer -- all of them master practitioners who know how to make a simple
monosyllabic verb do a heck of a lot of snobbish work.

"There were a bunch of kids at the museum today, and half of them were

"I thought that the way he pandiculated was ostentatious and rude."

"Pandiculation can be very pleasurable, especially early in the morning."

"I wasn't aware that many kinds of mammals pandiculate. You'd never see a
reptile or a bird do it."

"Not only did he pandiculate during the concert, but he did it noisily."

"I think that people should at least cover their mouths when they pandiculate."

Title: Beffa -- April 1, 2021
Date: April 01, 2021

Regular readers of this metablague know that Dr. M. has resumed his study of
Italian. Foolish say some, but heroic say others, because to try to master a
language when one is an octogenarian is truly daunting. However, native speakers
of English, even older ones, can, if patient, slowly acquire Italian. Its sounds
are similar and sometimes identical to those of English; the conjugations, only
three of them, are on the whole regular; and many of its words have English or
Latin cognates. For me, pronouns present a problem, because they're sometimes
required when I wouldn't think to use them, and sometimes dropped when I'd
prefer them to be there -- and, moreover, they come in slightly varied direct,
indirect, and reflexive forms. And then there are the pronomi combinati or
double pronouns which are confusing in themselves and which are sometimes but
not always attached to infinitives, gerunds and imperatives as enclitics.
It's probably too late in the game for me to become a fluent speaker, but I
have hopes of becoming a competent reader. I can now read at about the 6th or
7th grade level; I have the grammar under control so it's mostly a problem of
vocabulary and idiom.

For a greater challenge, I've begun to study a little Beffa. Beffa is a
Kartvelian language with admixtures of Cascagian and Ghetti. Fortunately for me,
there's a small Beffan community here in our town. I work with an introductory
textbook -- Pathways to Modern Beffa (2012) by Divino Divano -- and with a
native speaker named Ismail Kartakov. We meet three times a week when he's
available. Sometimes I enjoy a Beffa-speaking dinner with Ismail and his wife
Soraya and their three young children. I've also been to some Beffan parties and
exuberant dances. I sometimes feel odd-man-out but it's been fun. The Beffan
community, reputedly hostile to outsiders, has been very welcoming. And the
goat, mountain oyster, and black radish stew is superb.

Beffa is a bit more complicated than English. For example, while English has
26 consonants, Beffa has 56, including a two kinds of glottal stops that sound
almost like clicks as well as a voiced glottal fricative that resembles a cat's
purr. It also has both a voiced and unvoiced bilabial trill that sound a lot
like an English "raspberry," and an unusual, possibly unique lingual-dental stop
in which the tongue is pushed firmly against not the upper but the lower teeth.
One peculiarity of Beffa is its consonant clusters -- a word may begin with as
many as six consonants yoked together before the first vowel appears. Some words
have an initial six consonants followed by a vowel and then a cluster of five
or six more consonants. This can be strange to English speakers and sometimes
I notice Ismail's younger children giggling at my feeble attempts to replicate
their plosives. (Voiceless plosives are usually aspirated and one must take care
not to insert a schwa between aspirants.) Beffa also has a varied repertoire
of vowels, including a number of diphthongs and a couple of triphthongs. There
aren't any tones, thank goodness. There's one triphthong the use of which can be
perilous, for if you get it wrong the observation "your blue parrot is pining
for the fjords" apparently sounds almost exactly like "my knife is longer and
sharper than yours."

Nouns have both natural and grammatical gender. Nouns can be masculine,
feminine, neuter, ambiguous, common, animate or inanimate. They can be singular,
dual, plural, or paucative (i.e. a few). Neuter nouns rarely have duals. Beffa
has six fully formed declensions, distinguished primarily by the fact that
plurals in declensions 1 and 3 are formed with a prefix, in 2 and 4 by a suffix,
and in 5 and 6 by an infix. There are also some fifteen cases, all useful but
some slightly unusual. There are the familiar nominative, possessive, accusative
and dative (or indirect object). There are also a series of cases that describe
motion: the locative ("the ball that is lying on the ground"), the ablative
(("the ball that is coming in your direction"); the separative ("the ball that
is moving away from you"); the commitative ("the ball that is touching your
hand"); the partitive ("the ball that has left your hand"); the terminative
("the ball that has stopped moving"); the superessive ("the ball that is on top
of another ball"); the penetrative ("the ball that is inside another ball"); the
perditive ("the ball that is lost"); the oscillative ("the ball that is going
back and forth"); the thumpative ("the ball that is bouncing"); the plungitive
"the ball that has fallen into the water"); the remunerative ("the ball that
has been bought or sold"); the joculatorative ("the ball that does not fall
to the ground"); the alfactorative ("the ball that stinks like a corpse");
the perplexive ("the ball that has disappeared"); and the insouciative ("the
ball that has disappeared and no one cares"). Nouns can be either proximate or
obviative; nouns that are central to the discourse (proximate) are declined
very differently than nouns that are of marginal importance (obviative). There
is also an unusual suffix (at least, unusual to me, for I had never encountered
it before) that indicates whether the object specified touches the earth or
is removed from the earth. And an infix which indicates whether the object is
horizontal, vertical, diagonal, spiral, or invisible.

Verbs can be singular dual, plural, paucative, or undetermined: active,
passive or middle. There are five fully-formed conjugations and apparently
remnants of three others that are retained from the past when the language was
more fully synthetic. The most commonly used tenses are present indicative,
imperfect indicative, past imperfect indicative, future indicative, future
imperfect indicative, future perfect indicative, pluperfect indicative, past
pluperfect indicative, future pluperfect indicative, future stative, pluperfect
resultative, present optative, future optative, past imperfect optative, present
subjunctive, future subjunctive, past pluperfect subjunctive, future pluperfect
subjunctive, future pluperfect conditional subjunctive, and future pluperfect
optative conditional subjunctive aorist. Curiously, there is no future imperfect
subjunctive. Moreover, there are two kinds of vocatives: one when a woman
addresses a man; a second when a man addresses a woman or an animal. There
is also votive, a tense that was formerly used for addressing the deities in
prayer, but is now reserved for tribal chiefs, heads of state or royalty. The
votive is very similar to the conditional and the erroneous substitution of
a conditional for a votive was formerly grounds for mutilation but nowadays
leads only to acute embarrassment, or, in the case of a particularly egregious
grammatical lapse, to exile.

Some verbs are ergative so that the subject of either a transitive or
intransitive verb can be in an absolutive case. Some common ergative verbs are
"to become," "to eat,", and "to gouge" (as in, "to gouge out the eyes of an
enemy").

Beffan script is known as "dabbenaggine." This passage comments on the familiar
Beffan proverb, "If you steal my horse, I will steal your wife."

.

Beffa used to be written boustrophedonically, but since the reforms of 1912
has been written right to left. For some reason which I cannot possibly imagine,
dabbenaggine leaves no spaces between words but runs them all together without
breaks, which makes it just slightly harder to master.

Pronouns and determiners are difficult and complicated and perhaps I'll describe
them sometime in the future when I'm more familiar with their multiple and
various forms.

Title: My Life in Coffee
Date: April 04, 2021

Although both my parents were dependent on their morning coffee

percolated out of a can like this one, I myself never touched the stuff until
my first year at college. In the 1950s, coffee was 10 cents a cup and I drank
gallons of it, morning, noon and night. It became essential to my well-being.
Black, no sugar or milk, but in truth, not black but barely brown, weak by
present standards. In the early 60s my hipper than I -- not much of a leap -- 
friend SDS introduced me to the coffee shop. Figaro in Greenwich Village, mighty
sophisticated for a boy from Flatbush. I became addicted to coffee shops as
well as coffee itself for many a year. I couldn't handle any routine paperwork,
or indeed grade a tedious set of papers without infusions of caffeine. With
the Starbuck's revolution, coffee became tastier and more luxurious. But,
conservative as I was, I never succumbed to fancy drinks but kept to what had
come to be known simply and condescendingly as "Americano."

During these thirty-five or so years of pleasant coffee dependence, atrial
fibrillation became an annoying feature of my life. Frequent bouts, longer and
longer. Debilitating, possibly dangerous -- there's a strong association of
fibrillation with strokes. Finally, a doctor suggested that I might consider
giving up caffeine. So I stopped on a dime. It took six weeks to get the
caffeine out of my blood and put an end to the longing for coffee -- but the
atrial fibrillation came to a total halt. Ceased. Not a single episode these
last two and a half decades. Astonishing. I had been poisoning myself -- or at
least, compromising my well being.

Do I miss coffee? Yes, I'm afraid so, every morning. I still love the odor
(which was always better than the taste). More than that, I miss the society
of coffee cup and conversation. In those days, I loved to sit with a book in a
nook, warming my palm with a bottomless cup. Once, only once, about two years
ago, I did venture to order a medium Americano -- but I couldn't stomach more
than a couple of sips. Coffee's an acquired taste, and one that I had I de-
acquired.

Tea? I haven't found one that is more than barely tolerable. Hot chocolate?
Feels juvenile. Acceptable for breakfast but not for Peet's or Ozo or Starbuck's
or the Trident.

On the other hand, a heart that keeps to a regular rhythm and doesn't go
creatively syncopated several times a week is also a pleasure.

Title: Linen, Silk, etc.
Date: April 06, 2021

I've been reading about the origin of spinning and weaving -- specifically
E. J. W. Barber's Prehistoric Textiles (Princeton, 1991), a comprehensive
and exhausting survey of everything that was known about the subject thirty
years ago. I'm dazzled -- in part by the author, who turns the story into an
adventure, but even more so by our brilliant neolithic ancestors. Some among our
forbears, starting perhaps 30,000 years ago, looked at this plant, common flax,

and figured out how to turn it into linen -- a complicated, many step process.
How did they even begin to imagine such a transformation? Did they examine
the plant and say, hey that looks like it will make a nice shirt or a pair of
pants? To arrive at such a concept seems like an act of almost preternatural
intelligence. After all, there was no template or model. It's not as though
there were other fabrics made from other plants fibers. Flax into linen was a
first. There were predecessors. Clothes, I imagine, in the form of animal skins
or furs, must have been in use. I've read that reeds and other plant materials
had been plaited into baskets and nets. But flax into linen was not at all
obvious. We can be proud of our ancestors.

Here's a picture of the oldest recovered linen garment: the so-called Tarkhan
Dress, which was found in a cemetery near Cairo in 1913 and radiocarbon-dated to
between 3482 and 3102 BCE, or 5 and a half millennia ago. It's quite stylish and
isn't in much worse shape than some of the favored garments in my own personal
wardrobe.

Title: Dumb Luck
Date: April 14, 2021

I can remember five near misses -- five times when through inattentive or
incompetent driving I put my own and others' lives at risk. I give thanks that I
avoided killing or mangling myself or the innocent victims of my failings. What
wondrous life is this I lead -- how fortunate I have been!

The first: it was 1963. I was an inexperienced, overconfident driver, traveling
westward, somewhere in southern Illinois. My first cross-country trip. A two-
lane highway, a downpour, very wet pavement. I saw, or thought i saw, an
oncoming car in my lane. There would have been plenty of time for him to pass
and dive back, but I panicked and braked hard. My vehicle, an old Rambler, not
a great handler in the best of times, swerved into the oncoming lane, then spun
out of control and landed backward in a ditch on the right side of the road. We
sat there, stunned, relieved, because I had been in the left oncoming lane long
enough to have killed ourselves self and others. (Within a minute, a man pulled
up in a truck, attached a chain to our car and winched us out. I'm perpetually
grateful to this Samaritan.)

A second instance: an icy winter day in Boulder, early 1970s. Driving the old
yellow Saab with my sister Phyllis (legally, sister-in-law) in the "death seat"
east on Arapahoe, I hit a slick of black ice and made a bad situation worse
by applying the brakes. The car spun out of control and eventually halted
facing backwards in the oncoming lane. Once again, no one injured or even
inconvenienced.

Another: driving across the USA alone in the clunky blue Camry, doing 80 in a
55 zone, I didn't quite fall asleep at the wheel but certainly lost focus, and
didn't see a car stopped in the parking lane until I was just adjacent to it.
If I had been a bit to the right or if there had been someone fixing a tire,
I would have crippled myself and murdered an innocent. Here's another one,
probably the most idiotic. Driving alone through Chicago in heavy traffic, on
one of those horrible highways where there are eight lanes east and another
eight west, I found myself in the third lane from the right and needed to exit
right. Instead of playing it safe, and continuing on, I impulsively dove across
two lanes and made it to the exit. Angry horns to the right of me, horns to the
left of me. Why did I take such a risk? I don't know but I thank the drivers
around me for being alert. What arrogance, what stupidity! The most recent
event, and most inexcusable, happened just a few years ago. I was returning
home from a very disturbing visit to the "memory care" facility. Somehow, in
my grief, I ignored a prominent red light and sailed right through a busy
intersection -- a gross violation of sense and law. But there was no crash and
no police and I proceeded blithely on my way -- only, after a few moments,
realizing with shock and horror that I had put my own life and that of others at
completely unnecessary danger.

When people two hundred years from now look back on our "civilization" --
assuming that there will be people on this planet two hundred years from now,
which is not a certainty -- they will wonder how was it possible that those
people in our century were able to survive. Dashing 70 or 80 miles an hour in
a tin can just six feet from a line of onrushing tin cans? Weaving among giant
tandem trucks and buses and cement mixers -- and expecting to survive. What sort
of brave or foolhardy individuals were these strange, death-defying people?

For myself, I'm astonished at the dumb luck that's allowed me to preserve my
life and mobility to this advanced age. So far, that is. It's not over until
it's over.

Title: The Brown Corpus
Date: April 24, 2021

Interviewing ten candidate a day for a couple of days can make a guy a little
crazy. On the one hand, you owe each candidate your thoughtful attention,
because careers are at stake. But conducting interviews is a tedious process
and everyone who has ever done it knows that faces and voices and attitudes
tend to blur into an indistinguishable lumpy mass. So much earnestness! So much
contrived presentation of self!

I remember one such endless day in a featureless room in a high floor of
a pretentious modern hotel in Chicago, or Atlanta, or perhaps Houston. We
were making an appointment to our budding "Writing Program" -- an academic
innovation that I now believe to have been a total disaster. Writing Programs
hired "writing specialists" -- experimentalist social scientists who believe in
"theory" and who generally can't themselves write a lick. Or half a lick.

I remember one candidate with whom I had this remarkable exchange:

Me:  "Could you remind me about the subject of your dissertation."

He:  "I worked with the Brown Corpus."

Me (astonished): "What the heck is the Brown Corpus."

He:  "It's a computer file of one million edited words drawn from magazines
and newspapers. It was compiled at Brown University. The idea is to study the
English language as it actually written."

(I interrupt this conversation to say that "Brown Corpus" may be the most
injudiciously-named academic enterprise in history. To me, "brown corpus" might
have something to do with decayed corpuscles, or a fecal mass, or someone or
something a-mouldering in its grave. Not a phrase with much poetry to it. But
let us proceed.)

Me: "That seems interesting. What exactly did you study in this corpus."

He: "I studied the use of the comma."

Me: "The comma. You studied the comma." (More astonishment). "What in the world
did you learn about the comma?

He:  "I learned that the comma is used to link a sequence of nouns, or phrases,
in a series."

I was already giddy and aghast when I heard this news and I had a sudden
revelation, a flash. I saw myself picking up the candidate and throwing him
through the plate glass window and watching as he plummeted painfully to the
street below. But I controlled myself and thanked the candidate and, I believe,
ended the interview politely. I didn't even indulge myself with something
snarky, like, "do you intend to do any follow-up work on a more challenging mark
of punctuation, as for example the exclamation point?"

Pictured is a variety of daylily called the Charles Johnston. Looks good,

1988 from the American daylily society. I ordered a couple from a nursery in
Tennessee because they are VE (very early), tetraploid, fragrant, and reputed
to be accomplished re-bloomers (although daylillies that rebloom in the upper
south don't always do so in Vermont). It's the VE part that interests me because
I don't have any early reds. "Rich burgundy blooms."  Sounds delicious. I think
I'll put them in the vegetable garden temporarily, where the soil is, as LERM
says, "like chocolate cake" and plant them out in the perfect place, yet to be
determined. Somewhere where the large VE blooms can make a statement.

I wonder how my gardens survived my Covid 2020 absence. We'll find out in three

Title: Overton Mystery
Date: May 03, 2021

Here's a a handsome old double-weave Jacquard coverlet in all its flowery glory,
right there on our very own bed. Extraordinarily decorative, is it not?  Cotton
and wool, and generous with the well-saturated indigo dye. State-of-the-art hand
weaving.

I especially prize this particular coverlet because of its history. It was woven
for Charity Maria Laws in 1835, as is plainly evident from the inscription on
its "summer" side. I wish the weaver had identified himself as well as his
client, but he hasn't.

Who is Charity Maria Laws?  She was a native of a part of Long Island (New
York) with which I'm very familiar and where I spent the best three summers
of my childhood. She was born in 1822 in Ridge and died in Northport in 1894.
Makamah Beach, home to as much fair seed-time for the soul as I experienced,
is located within the Northport precincts. Charity Maria was presented with
this coverlet when she was thirteen years old -- to keep her warm a' nights,
no doubt, but also, as was the custom, to serve as the centerpiece of her
trousseau. The coverlet worked its magic because in 1848 Charity Maria was
wooed and won by John Gardiner Lewis of neighboring Crab Meadow and bore five
children, all of them born in Northport or adjacent Huntington. I have no idea
where the coverlet hid out between Maria's death until it made its re-appearance
on ebay last year, but I'm happy to say that it was treated  very well during
that time -- it's in splendid shape for a textile that's pushing two hundred.

Imagine my surprise, when, a few days ago, a Jacquard coverlet in an identical
style appeared on ebay. When I glanced at the pictures, I said, out loud but
to no one in particular, I bet that one also hails from my part of Suffolk. It
didn't take an S. Holmes to confirm my speculation.The evidence is as plain as
the nose on your face: the exact same lettering, but this time, it's Harriet
Sophia Overton.

This coverlet is not only inscribed -- It's dated, too. December 1, 1845.
Harriet Sophia Overton herself is not easy to identify. There was a Harriet
Sophia in the village or hamlet of Coram, in Suffolk, just a few miles from
Northport, but she was born in 1815 and died in 1821 and therefore can't
possibly be the recipient of a coverlet woven in 1845. There must be a second
Harriet Sophia. And truly, so there is. The first Harriet Sophia had an older
brother, Sheldon Roe Overton, who fathered a girl named after the departed six-
year-old. Harriet Sophia Overton II was born in 1850 and died, unmarried, in
1868. Another dead end, alas, because HSO the second was born five years after
the coverlet was woven.

I am forced to speculate that there was still a third Harriet Sophia Overton who
was born on December 1, 1845 and didn't live long enough to get a mention in the
story or even earn a gravestone. Harriet Sophia Overton was an unlucky name.
Hardly compensated for by the long-lived coverlet.

Despite my love of Northport and environs -- of course I mean the Northport of
my memory, the Northport of the 1940s -- I didn't bid on the Overton coverlet.
But I would love to know its story, which I suspect to be one of great sadness.

Title: About James Perry Jr.
Date: May 07, 2021

From our part of Vermont comes some ghastly news. In a paranoid fit, James Perry
Jr. shot and killed Karina, his 38-year-old daughter.

According to the Vermont Digger, our internet newspaper, Perry had been holing
up in his home, convinced that "bad guys with guns" were after him. Here's part
of the newspaper account: "Perry said he shot his daughter... as she stood on
a landing outside his residence. He told police he was concerned that unknown
people were playing 'gun games' with him and he asked his daughter not to come
to his residence.... He was concerned Karina was being used as a “ploy”
by unknown individuals.... For the past couple weeks he has been unable to
sleep.... He was sitting on his couch when he saw his daughter at the door. He
picked up his 12-gauge shotgun, and could see Karina holding cookies, waving,
and trying to open the locked door. ‘I’m just so nervous… and I didn’t
want her to come in, and I didn’t want the cookies. I ordered her to stop, and
I just, I guess I, pulled the trigger. And then I pulled it more, and then I cut
her neck.'" Perry said he believed he used a pocket knife to stab her.

Could there be a more horrific tragedy? A man goes crazy and kills his own
daughter.

But yet there's worse -- in the details that don't appear in the newspaper.
Karina, Jim's older daughter by his second wife, Phyllis, is divorced and is
the mother of four children, who are now left motherless. And Phyllis, Karina's
mother, is ill with a very bad cancer -- so she had to learn, in this last phase
of her life, that her ex-husband shot and killed one of their children.

Here's a picture of James Perry Jr. as it appeared in the Digger. He looks like
a guy who's just been cast as a maniac in a chainsaw massacre movie.

He certainly does not look at all like the Jimmy Perry whom I've known for 45
years. Except for the bright blue eyes, he's unrecognizable.

I remember Jim when he was in his twenties -- a normal guy. Actually he was
quite handsome, strong, energetic, well-liked, already skilled with wood and
bricks and stones. He built the chimney in our new house and he was a more-than-
competent carpenter.

How could the Jimmy Perry that I knew and admired in the 1970s turn into a man
who shoots and kills his own daughter?

Even back then, he drank too much. And used too much marijuana. Sometime in the
1980s, he worked in Wyoming as a roustabout on oil rigs. One day he fell into a
vat of what he called "mud" but was a container for the strong chemicals used
in the oil drilling process. He was burned neck to ankle and spent close to a
year, if I remember correctly, in a hospital -- in severe pain for much of the
time. I don't think he ever fully recovered. His body was a mass of scars. I'm
sure that the beer and the drugs and the pain, and possibly the isolation caused
by the pandemic, contributed to his derangement. But nothing explains what is
fundamentally inexplicable.

I didn't see much of Jim in the last few years. I'd run into him in Hannaford's
occasionally. He appeared to be many years older than his true age. He was
emaciated, sickly-looking. Clearly someone who'd had a hard life. He told me
that he didn't know how long he could continue "crawling on roofs." The last
time I caught sight of him, I confess, I avoided him. I could see even from a
distance that he was "off" and I didn't want to engage with him.

I don't mean to excuse Jim. What he did was the worst. I wish that he hadn't
had a shotgun in the house. If he had to be armed, I would have preferred that
he shot himself. That would have been bad enough. I hope that he doesn't regain
his sanity, because if he does so, he'll have to reckon with what he's done. The
guilt will kill him twenty times over.

Jim was an ordinary man, not an evil one. The picture above doesn't tell the
whole story. He was unlucky, and crazed, and something went horribly wrong in
his brain. Those of us who are lucky and sane should thank our good fortune,
because all of us are vulnerable.

Jim did a lot of work for me in 1978. In the summer of 1979, he came to visit
and said that he had gone over his books and discovered that I had overpaid him
for about a week of work. News to me -- I had no idea. He said that he couldn't
reimburse the money he owed me, but he would take a few days and build me a nice
stone wall -- even then, he was famous for his classy stonework. So together and
with the help of my kids we poached a dozen truckloads of stone from some of our
many crumbling walls. We picked out a site and he built us about fifty feet of
handsome drystone. It's still there, an ornament to the property. The maker of
that wall is the Jimmy Perry, an honest craftsman and a reliable friend, that I
prefer to remember, even while I mourn the death of his daughter and regret the
abysmal woe that he caused his family.

Title: Words of my Life: Slouch
Date: May 10, 2021

When I was a boy, I was regularly reprimanded with these words (or some
variation of them): "Don't slouch." "You're slouching! "You're slouching again!"
"Why are you slouching?"

Apparently I was a natural sloucher.

It was a difficult criticism to absorb or to counter. I wasn't entirely sure
what the word "slouch" meant but I sure knew that it wasn't anything good. In my
mother's eyes, I believe, "slouching" was not only a physical but a moral lapse.
But to be accused of something of which my body, not me in my own person as I
knew myself, was guilty -- well, that was surely puzzling.

To slouch is to "sit or stand in a casual, lazy, drooping, or improper posture."
"Lazy?" -- I was definitely lazy. "Improper? -- I'm not so sure. Nor do I know
why being repeatedly accused of "slouching" was going to turn me into an upright
proper person.

The most famous sloucher in literature is the villainous Orlick in Great
Expectations, who was "always slouching. He never even seemed to come
to his work on purpose, but would slouch in as if by mere accident... 
and when he went ...away at night, he would slouch out.... He lodged at a
sluice-keeper's out on the marshes, and on working-days would come slouching
from his hermitage." Slouching is unquestionably a marker of evil for Dickens.
Was it so for my mom?

Then there's Yeats' "rough beast... slouching toward Bethlehem to be born." A
second coming of sorts, and not at all a good one.

So there you have three slouchers: the "rough beast," Orlick, and me.

Title: Our Visit to Beardstown, Illinois
Date: May 23, 2021

We visited Beardstown, in southwestern Illinois, because it was the birthplace,
in 1845, of one of Lynn's maternal great-grandmothers, Mary St. John DeHaven.
Even though it is Lincoln country, we had no idea what to expect, the AAA entry
being so scant, but we soon discovered that Beardstown is a place that had
its moment of glory sometime in the nineteenth century, but which has allowed
history to pass it by. While it's not entirely derelict, it's not even slightly
prosperous -- nor has it achieved quaintness. The industry of note nowadays is
the JBS meat-packing plant out on the Arenzville Road; most of its employees
come from south of the border, which is why the only indication that Beardstown
might someday be rejuvenated is the dozen or so new downtown taquerias and
iglesias.

Our first stop in Beardstown was a decaying, rather pathetic 200-foot long
peeling boardwalk along the sandy Illinois River, a waterway which in the years
before the Civil War had been a thriving commercial thoroughfare. There we
watched a solitary tug struggle to free a barge that had somehow run itself
aground. Perhaps the boardwalk had once welcomed visitors and tourists, but
during our stay the only spectator beside ourselves was a very frayed out-of-
work fellow who arrived on a beaten-up bicycle, and who seemed entirely out of
his depth when we asked if there was a place in Beardstown to purchase a cup of
coffee. To me, he seemed addled; I suspected meth or opioids.

After gazing at the sluggish river for half an hour (remembering Abraham
Lincoln's enthusiasm for river transport), we toured the few blocks of the old
downtown, in which fewer storefronts were occupied than were vacant. We looked
in at an antique store -- actually less "antique" than "junque" (unless a flashy
bejewelled Elvis Presley doll was a revered artifact of a prior civilization).
Lynn purchased an owl-decorated piece of blue porcelain for $5.00. We inquired
of the proprietor, Mrs. White, if there were a coffee shop in Beardstown.
Patricia White, we soon learned, was a recently retired public school music
teacher and a lively lady knowledgeable about all things Beardstownian. I asked
her about the intriguing storefront adjacent to hers, which proclaimed itself
to be a Grand Opera House. I was skeptical that any sort of grandeur could be
found in such dreary town, but I was wrong. Mrs. White generously offered us a
tour of the old theater. She warned us that it was in deep disrepair but she
said that she and others, led by the local chiropractor, were working diligently
towards its restoration. So up a flight of dark stairs we went, and there, lo
and behold, was revealed to us the picturesque ruins of what had once been a
remarkable structure. Here's a photograph of the remains of its ornate frescoed
ceiling and 20-foot-high windows:

The theatre had a well-proportioned stage and had once (before the balcony was
pulled down) been able to seat several hundred people. In the littered backstage
were the remnants of nineteenth-century traveling shows, including a large
painted backdrop of Venetian gondolas, left behind by a company from St. Louis.
But the building, though its bones were good, was a wreck: leaks in the roof had
caused the ceiling to deteriorate. The auditorium itself had served as a storage
area for the overflow merchandise of decades of store owners. It would take a
dozen roll-offs and weeks of work just to remove the trash and find the floor.
Nevertheless, the Grand Opera House offered us an insight into what Beardstown
had been when it was a thriving community. I was so impressed by the theater
that I decided to donate my bit to its reconstruction. I had determined on $100
until I noticed that Mrs. White had donned a red white and blue Trump 2020 face
mask. And so arose a moral dilemma: I want to support the arts, and I would love
to help return the Grand Opera House to its former glory. Opera and music should
be beyond politics -- but yet I was deeply repelled by Mrs. White's Trumpism. So
I split the difference and donated $60 to the cause. A sensible compromise to a
vexing problem?? I don't know. But it's what I did. I wanted to ask Mrs. White
what Donald Trump's ignorance, bigotry, authoritarian predilections and corrupt,
vacant life had to offer to a cheerful retired teacher in a decaying midwestern
town, but I saw no reason to provoke a controversy.

Afterward, we found some lunch up the street at Sally's Bistro. The bistro did
not live up to "bistro" expectations, and could more honestly be called Sally's
Diner, but it did make a good BLT and almost-decent coffee. We did not try the
"alligator bits" for which it is famous, even though Sally assured us that
the bits were much better than the usual alligator tail. (Beardstown has an
alligator farm but we didn't tour it.)

Mrs. White had also told us about the "old cemetery" so on a lark we went off
to investigate. We wandered about, not expecting much, until we stumbled upon
a gravestone which revealed that the late Henry Foster married the late Mary
McKeever DeHaven. Lynn doesn't know precisely who these people are, but there
are so many of her family names on the marker -- that of her grandfather, George
Foster Massey, her uncle, McKeever Massey, her second cousin, Katherine DeHaven
Milligan -- that they must  be long-departed members of her extended ancestry.
Certainly cousins of some degree.

We googled Henry T. (for True) Foster and found that he was a pillar of the
frontier community of Beardstown. He had immigrated from Maine; Mary from
Philadelphia. We were gratified by this unexpected find.

On the return trip from Beardstown to Jacksonville, we stopped at Griggsville,
which, we were astonished to discover, is the "purple martin capitol of the
nation" and the location of the world's largest purple martin skyscraper.
Skeptical?  Here's the proof:

So altogether a most rewarding day.

For many years, we've had to make do with this inferior fly-swatter:

It's made of molded plastic and extruded metal wire. It's not handsome -- a
ghastly inappropriate pink-purple color for the flapper and a small gauge
white- coated wire for the handle. Is there a name for this  styleless style,
other than dime-store cheap. Mid-century modern in its least attractive
manifestation. Not only unbeautiful, it leaves much to be desired in function.
The flapper is inflexible and rigid, which makes it difficult to kill the fly
without splattering it. Moreover, the wire handle lacks integrity and offers an
uncomfortable grip.

Now feast your eyes on this newly-acquired fly-swatter. It's a thing of beauty.

Notice the turned hardwood handle (maple, I believe, or possibly birch),
perfectly suited to the human hand. The heavy gauge shaft leading to a genuine
metal screen flapper. It's a fly-swatter to savor;  a classic. Many a graceful
swat in it.

An anniversary or a birthday in the offing? Nothing says "I love you" more than
a fly-swatter of distinction. It's also unsurpassed as a wedding present. If
you're in a generous mood, "his" and "hers" fly swatters will get that marriage
off to a great start.

Title: Birches White and Yellow;  Mutability
Date: June 21, 2021

It may not be immediately obvious or dramatic, but the large tree in the middle
of the picture is a white birch. It towers over the red maple and the beeches
that are to its left. White birches do not often attain such size, nor are they
long-lived, at least in our part of the world. This particular white birch is
old and imposing and thriving and healthy.

Yet a few years ago this birch appeared to be at death's door. It sported only a
handful of yellow leaves on its thin senescent crown.

Inasmuch as it was an old tree (as measured in white-birch years) we all assumed
that it had come to the end of its natural days. There was a vigorous family
debate on whether it should be submitted to the chain saw before it fell over --
perhaps dangerously -- of its own accord. The consensus was to give it another
year. It was a good decision -- as can be plainly seen.

I have no idea why the birch sprang from its hospital bed. Was it a victim of
some nameless illness that it had overcome? Had it been merely listless and
depressed? Had its local environment altered?  Perhaps some noxious insect pest
had arrived, gone for a kill, failed,  and then decamped. I have no theory --
it's a total mystery, as is so much in life. Nevertheless, I'm happy to welcome
the birch back into our community. May it have many more happy years.

Meanwhile, just steps away, was a young vigorous yellow birch. Yellow birches
are not as striking or famous as their white-barked cousins, but to my mind they
are by far the better tree. They are, at least in our neck of the woods, larger,
better shaped, longer-lived, and their wood is superior for either furniture or
flooring or fuel. Their bark is a splendid glistening yellow gold. A tree to
prize.

But, alas, not this particular yellow birch. Last summer it was a burgeoning
adolescent, adding more than 18 inches of growth a season. This year, I'm sorry
to report, dead as a doornail.

Not a single leaf. Not the slightest sign of life. This is an ex tree.

The yellow birch was in a perfect position and was one that I had counted on to
live for at least a hundred years, perhaps two hundred.  A tree that should
have lasted centuries and been an ornament to the property and a delight to
grandchildren and great-grandchildren -- under whose spreading boughs picnics
and  other rural pleasures would have been enacted far into the future.

But that's the inconstancy of life on earth. One tree, supposedly a short-lived
one, springs to life while another, with a grand future, suddenly and
inexplicably succumbs to the fate that awaits us all.

Mutability, they used to call it. Precarious, I'd say. "All is flux."

We are grateful that we had the yellow birch for as long as it lasted, and
grateful also that the white birch has decided to stick around -- perhaps for
another couple of decades.

Title: Red Pines
Date: June 22, 2021

Our stand of magnificent trees is composed of red pines, pinus resinosa.

Each tree is between 60 and 65 feet tall and they are all exactly 51 years old.
How can I be so sure about height and age?

Height is easy to determine with the Calloway 300 Pro Laser Range Finder. Age? 
Here's the history. In 1970, some friend or acquaintance, I can't remember
exactly who, acquired a hundred red pine seedlings for a forestry project. He
couldn't make use of all of them and so he gave us ten -- each one perhaps 4-6
inches long and the sum of their stems no thicker than a #2 pencil. I didn't
know exactly what to do with these treasures, so i planted them in a row in the
vegetable garden. Which is where they sat until 1972, when I decided to plant
them on the dike of the newly constructed pond, where they remain.

In doing so i acted in defiance of the local wisdom, which is, never plant a
tree on the dike. Why? Because the tree will eventually die, and the "water will
follow the roots" and weaken the dam. I judged this reasoning to be faulty.
In the first place, red pines, like all conifers, are shallow-rooted. The
surface of the dike is fifteen feet above the level of the water in the pond,
so when the pine eventually dies, its rootball will still be above water level.
Moreover, red pines are reported to live for centuries (some say three hundred
years), and I just can't bring myself to worry about what's going to happen to
a dike in the far distant future when, no doubt, the pond will long since have
reverted to the thick swamp that it was before we dug it out.

But why red pines rather than the white (pinus strobus) which is generally
considered to be the much superior species? Because a), I owned these red
pine seedlings and b) because at that time many of the white pines in our
neighborhood were suffering from a insect-borne disease that killed the leader
shoot and therefore deformed the tree (leader shoot disease seems to be a
thing of the past and now our young white pines are again growing up tall and
straight).  And red pines as consistently healthy.

For their first decade, the red pines made scarcely any impression on the
landscape. Now they dominate. When I sit in their shade, I am pleased to recall
their entire history, which allows me to tell them, proudly, "I knew you when
you were just a sprout!"

Title: Trees Old and New
Date: July 03, 2021

When we arrived here 54 years ago, the land was heavily forested but with a
limited pallet of northern conifers and deciduous trees. In the first category
were pines both red and white, three kinds of spruce, balsam fir, larch and
hemlock. Among the hardwoods were sugar maples and red maples, ash, beech, red
oak, black cherry, white, yellow and gray birch, quaking and big tooth aspen,
and alas butternut and elms, which have both now succumbed to plagues. Common
in the area but absent from our particular property were red cedar, cottonwood,
basswood, walnut, and black locust. In the 70s of the last millennium, I planted
cedars and cottonwoods; they are now mature and replicating themselves. The
walnut that I planted fifteen years ago is now 25 feet tall and very handsome.
I have only one basswood, which I found as a seedling and transplanted to to a
prominent place;  I've been waiting all these years for its descendants. The
black locusts that I grew from seeds harvested in Colorado are now starting to
make an impression on the landscape. I've also added some trees that might be
able to survive our warmer winters: a hickory (growing very nicely), a swamp
white oak, a bur oak (and its lone offspring) and a sycamore (which has survived
two winters).  I've also experimented and failed with some trees that grow just
a bit south of us: catalpa, horse chestnut, "Crimson King" maple, little-leaved
linden, and ginkgo. Perhaps I'll try again now that the weather has warmed. One
of my neighbors has successfully reared a metasequoia; it's tempting to try but
I think on the whole I'd rather stay with north American trees. On the other
hand, we'll need some new trees to take the place of the ash, which are soon to
be decimated.

I entered a gloomy, dark, building, perhaps a derelict church. An older woman
was sitting there, not exactly in a pew but in a large wooden chair. She said to
me, "We help dying people."  Was she a nurse or a nun  of some sort?  I said,
"Like hospice." She was adamant. "No, not at all like hospice." I said, "Can you
help me?" When I said those words I realized that I had frightened her. "Do you
plan to murder me," she askewd.  I assured her that I was not a murderer. To
make her more comfortable, I said, "Why don't we go outside where you will feel
safer." But just as we opened the heavy wooden door, a very large, threatening
man appeared. I strangled him without a weapon, with my bare hands. So I was a
murderer after all. The woman whom I was trying to protect, said, "Now I know
you're planning to murder me." I objected: "I'll prove to you I'm not a habitual
murderer. Go directly to your car and get in it and drive away. She did so (it
was a blue Ford Focus). That's when the dream ended.

In real life, I'm a peaceful person. In my dream world, I'm occasionally (not
often, but often enough) a killer. Why?  Is it some deeply suppressed inner
anger that works its way to the surface during the night?  Or I am simply a
member of a species (homo sapiens) that has a million year habit of violence?

Or perhaps the dreams are meaningless? Just the flotsam of badly-wired synapses?
If so, I wish they'd give it a rest.

Title: Cishet
Date: September 18, 2021

We watched a Netflix series called Feel Good. I suppose that the series title
must be taken ironically, because throughout the first two seasons, not
one character seemed to feel even slightly positive or healthy. Just about
everyone was miserable -- their unhappiness usually linked to romantic or more
specifically sexual dissatisfaction. The program introduced many more eccentric
varieties of coupling and frustration than I, a vanilla heterosexual, would have
imagined. The main character, Mae Martin, played by Mae Martin, is a boyish
lesbian; her on-again, off-again affair with a womanly young lady is the focus
of the story. Lots of obstacles both personal and social stand between the two
women and the achievement of genuine happiness. Let's hope that they can figure
it all out and find love at long last -- or at least by the end of Season 3.

There was one scene that I found to be particularly curious and troublesome. A
group of teachers assemble for a meeting, but before taking up business, every
one of the participants reveals or defines his or her own sexuality. One young
woman, surely the least glamorous of the set, refers to herself as "cishet." I
didn't catch the word as spoken but fortunately we had the subtitles engaged and
I was able to read the word, although in reading I pronounced it to myself as if
the sh were a digraph for the lingual palatal fricative as in shut or shun. But
I investigated the new word "cishet" -- and sure enough it exists and has become
a feature of our contemporary culture. It's "cis" as opposed to "trans" which
means not "across" but "this side" -- as the Romans referred to Gaul as either
cisalpine and transalpine. In this coinage, "cis" refer to a person who accepts
the gender designation assigned at birth by the appearance of one's genitals.
"Het" is simply a truncation of heterosexual." "Cishet" therefore means someone
who is unambiguously either male or female and is attracted to persons of the
opposite sex.

Wow, that's me. After all these years of just thinking I was an ordinary guy,
I now discover that I have a designation. I have a community, a tribe, perhaps
even an interest group. Hey, I belong,

But I think that it's mighty odd and even oppressive that members of a school
community, or any community, would feel that it is necessary or advisable to
announce their gender classification before getting down to the business of the
day. Shouldn't such information be allowed to remain private. If I want to be
cishet, it's nobody's business but my own. But perhaps such formal revelations
don't happen in real life -- only in satirical TV series. I sure hope so.

Not so for Mae Martin, the first paragraph of whose biography reads "Mae Martin
is a Canadian-born comedian, actor, and writer based in England. They wrote
and starred in the Netflix comedy series Feel Good." So it appears that "she"
is a "they" which in current modish jargon doesn't mean that she's plural but
signifies that she feels inadequately represented by the simple and specific
feminine pronoun. I can understand her motive, but frankly "they" confuses me
and sticks in my ear. I appreciate its value as a statement of resistance to
the "hetoro-normative" -- but by golly "they" sure throws a spanner into the
grammatico-normative works. It would be good if English had a set of singular
pronouns that are as gender indistinct as "they," but it doesn't, and to hijack
the plural "they" and turn it into a singular is an awkward and I hope ephemeral
innovation.

Sometimes I receive communications from people who are much more up to date than
dear old dad -- letters that are signed in the traditional way but to which is
subjoined, "My pronouns -- "he his," or "she her hers" (or "they them their").
This habit, I suppose, clears the air and perhaps forestalls some embarrassing
or awkward moments, but again, seems unnecessarily revelatory. It's limiting and
partial. It seems to me to declare that such guys and gals were acting in the
parochial interest of their own tribe or constituency -- much as if everyone
appended to his or her name his own religion or nationality. I'm not happy
with this innovation. Although it might seem progressive, it is in my opinion
ultimately dangerously reactionary.

Therefore I am not so current that I would include my pronouns on any letters
that I write. But I would like to append my adjectives,

Yours very sincerely,

Vivian de St. Vrain

(My adjectives:  "wise, upstanding, formerly debonair.")

I learned what was wrong and bad in the P S 217 schoolyard. At our corner of
the world, where Coney Island Avenue crossed Newkirk, the guy at the bottom of
the moral barrel was the "sore loser." He was the guy who, when he missed an
easy layup, always claimed, against the evidence, that he had been fouled. And
when he lost a game, he picked up his basketball and took it home -- in order to
prevent the rest of us from continuing to play. He was always whining, always
complaining, always wronged. An unpleasant member of the community, disliked by
most, hated by some, loathed by a few. A disruptive presence, only tolerated
because he was rich enough to own the basketball or the baseball bat.

No question but that the greatest sore loser in the history of the planet is our
former president. What a pathetic whiner! He lost fair and square but he can't
admit it, so instead he claims a nonexistent foul, or a series of fouls. He's
out to change the rules to give himself the advantage. And he's willing to mess
up the entire game if he doesn't get his way.

He wouldn't have gotten the least smidgeon of respect in 217 schoolyard.

What's wrong with the people who still support him? What are they thinking? How
come they can't recognize him for what he is?

I read a story in an "art of gardening" book many years ago that I will repeat
here. A famous Japanese gardener, a "national treasure," was asked, "What's the
secret of making a garden as beautiful as yours?" He didn't answer in words but
lifted his arms and made a shearing or lopping motion.

Many years ago, I asked Roy Huse, who had a most wonderful vegetable garden at
the foot of South Road how he did it.  He said, and I quote verbatim, "you
really got to put the shit to it."

And from my father: "it's all about preparing the bed before you plant."

So, don't skimp on getting the bed ready, add plenty of manure, and be ruthless
about cutting things out.

Title: Baseball Vocabulary
Date: October 22, 2021

I grew up in a baseball-saturated world. The radio voices of Red Barber and
Connie Desmond were the water in which I and my family and my neighbors swum.
It was therefore natural that I early absorbed the vocabulary of baseball and
that many words carried baseball meaning to me long before I recognized their
alternative and larger existence.

For example, as a boy, I encountered the word "mound." It signified, and
signified only, a pitcher's mound -- the ten inches of sand and clay from which
a pitcher throws a ball. I had no idea that mounds could exist in nature or
indeed, could exist anywhere outside of a stadium, there being no mounds on
Coney Island Avenue, or, at least, none that I recognized as such.

And then there was the word "pitcher." If someone had said to me, in the 1940s,
that "little pitchers had big ears," I might have thought of Preacher Roe, but I
would have had no idea that there was such an object as a pitcher for water or
other liquid. A pitcher was not jug, ewer, or crock -- it was a man standing on
a rubber fooling a batter with a slow curve.

Standing on a "rubber?" Yet another word that had a specific baseball meaning,
years before it became an eraser or a galosh or a condom.

Similarly, a "streak" was not a gash of color until many years after it was a
winning streak or a losing streak or batting streak. A "dugout" was not a canoe,
not in my corner of the universe.  Nor was a "rally" a political meeting or
protest. A rally would never have led to a "strike" -- a word which I knew only
as one of the allotted three. "Battery?" A team of pitcher and catcher, not
something of military or electrical storage interest.

And then there were the plethora, the fountain of lovely words peculiar to
baseball, like "shortstop" and "blooper."

Inning was exclusively a baseballism. Not so "outing" which was in my childhood
a pitcher's stint on the mound, and which only later became a picnic (or, even
later, an involuntary revelation of someone's sexual inclinations).

October 24:  How could I fail to include "pennant." When did I learn that a
pennant was a kind of triangular flag?  Not in the 1940s (or even 50s).

Disease, dying and death, I'm afraid. During the last month or so, the cohort of

friend of more than forty years standing, has just breathed his last. AM, whom I
know from the PS 217 schoolyard, is suffering from cancer of the esophagus, now
described as terminal. M has ALS and can no longer move or speak. LW suffered
a bad stroke some while ago and is now in "assisted living." JP has gone from
robust to frail in a few months and has been moved to a "memory care" unit. And
others.

I've taken to reading the obits. Every week the name of a former colleague or a
friend of a friend shows up. Inevitable, you say. But distressing nevertheless.

I'm healthy, but I'm old, long past my expiration date. I know that one of these

Among my circle of friends, it is a shameful thing to be called "house proud."
It's a term to be avoided, even shunned. It's competitive and flaunts the
wrong values. Conspicuous consumption. Vanity. "I own a bigger house than you,
and therefore I'm a better person than you."  "House pride" is a very badddd
feeling of the human heart. So therefore I was astonished when I opened a new
edition of Luxury Home Magazine (which should be called Conspicuous Consumption
Quarterly) to discover that in this publication shameless vanity is now not
implied, hinted at, or disguised, but flaunted. The magazine's reiterated theme:
"Make your friends envy your trophy home." It says so in so many words!  Gasp!

And indeed, from the pictures and descriptions of these homes, it's clear that
the advertised trophies are not designed o live in, but rather to let their
owners wow their friends and demonstrate how wealthy (and wasteful) they can be.

Does anyone actually require a 15,000 square feet house with three kitchens,
even if one of them is outdoors. "Main kitchen boasts two islands, multiple
refrigerators, freezers and sinks." And a wine cooler (in addition to the
wine cellar). "Five beds, eight baths, seven fireplaces?" "Massive vaulted
ceilings with a towering three sided stone chimney?" Also, a "luxurious soaking
tub, double-headed shower, and makeup vanity?" Two "indoor-outdoor pools?" An
elevator from the basement to the widow's walk?  "Large tiered media room."
Game room. Basketball court. A putting green. Five oversized garages with 20
foot windows?

Also, "breathability," whatever that is.

I'm embarrassed that I'm on the Luxury Homes' mailing list and I'm embarrassed,
once again, to be a member of the species homo sapiens.

My advice to readers whose mouths water when they yearn for a trophy home:
"enough is as good as a feast."

Title: In Praise of Hands
Date: October 31, 2021

A few weeks ago, I found myself absentmindedly working in the perennial garden.
I had wandered nearby and noted some weeds that needed emergency extirpation.
I had therefore arrived without my usual trine of implements -- the dandelion
puller, the hand shovel, and the Felco #2. Too lazy to fetch them, I began to
tend to the plants toollessly and at the same time to muse upon effectiveness of
hands alone. (Weeding often leads to musing, as every weeder knows.)  Is it not
the case that the best tool of all is the human hand?  Because my garden soil
is so friable, I was able to dig into the earth with my unaided index finger,
grasp the roots of weeds and pull them. I wondered how the hand had come to so
sensitive to small changes in soil temperature or soil moisture. Sensitive also,
to the texture of things, so that I could identify the roots of witch grass, and
remove them, while leaving untouched the very similar but different roots of the
day lilies. For no good reason, my wayward mind wandered to the Houyhnhnms whom
Gulliver outrageously claimed could grasp a needle between fetlock and pastern
in order to sew garments. Amusing but impossible. The hooves of horses are
wonderfully evolved for galloping but not for tatting or crocheting. Besides,
why would a horse want to darn a sock?

Our hands are superior implements  There's not another animal on the planet
that can tie its own shoelaces.

I've just read a fascinating book by paleontologist Madelaine Bohme called
Ancient Bones. Bohme is concerned to argue that the "out of Africa" hypothesis
needs modification. I am not knowledgeable enough to accept or deny her thesis,
but I much appreciate her effort to bring me up to date about the evolution of
our species, which is much more complicated -- infinitely more complicated --
than the story we were told just a generation ago.

Bohme includes a couple of speculative pages about the evolution of the hand.
First came bipedalism, freeing the hands for a variety of new tasks. Bohme
thinks that the development of stone tools and the development of hands went, so
to speak, hand in hand. The need to hold the tool meant that the hand evolved to
hold it properly -- with an opposable thumb of course. More sensitive fingers
conferred an evolutionary advantage. More information from the fingers caused
the somatosensory cortex, which controls the hands, to enlarge and process more
sensations.

So now we can play the piano, thread a needle, throw a ball, type a letter,
weed a garden, and perform a thousand other tasks that even chimpanzees, who
apparently do not have great sensory input from their fingers, cannot do.

Bohme does not discuss the role of hands in human communication, either everyday
or erotic.  A topic for another book, perhaps.

Title: Max Oeschger (1938-2021)
Date: November 11, 2021

Max had a long love affair with New Orleans, and he loved to initiate his
friends into the city's splendors and secrets. We were beneficiaries of his
generosity. It was because of "mad Max" that we enjoyed a series of winter
visits to the crescent city. He was a splendid enthusiastic guide as well as a
great character, with a touch of Falstaff about him: charm, flaws, girth.

For me, it was a late-onset friendship, but Lynn had known Max from the 60s,
from her Baltimore days, when Max was a doctoral student in biology at Hopkins.
The two of them reconnected five years ago when Max invited Lynn (and me) to
stay for a month in an apartment in his rental house in the Garden District.
How could we decline such an offer? His house, alas, turned out to be virtually
uninhabitable, with holes in the walls and floors that let in the light, the
wind and rain, and the critters. There was a pungent smell of decay and a tilted
bathroom that seemed about to plunge deep into the earth. Lynn was not fazed: "I
lived in Africa."  Max was only mildly apologetic. We made do.

In subsequent trips to New Orleans we took the precaution of renting a BNB.

But we often visited Max at his place in an apartment house on St. Charles.
Max owned two adjacent apartments. He connected them by busting through the
wallboard with a sledge hammer. Two kitchens, therefore, both, shall we say, far
from immaculate.

A serious and knowledgeable cinephile, Max sponsored a monthly film series
in his home. His screen had to be angled sharply to find a place amidst the
clutter, distributed among which was an exquisite collection of contemporary
American pottery. (Max was a widower; his sometime ladyfriend was a very
accomplished potter).

Max squired us about town, introducing us to both famous and out-of-the-way
restaurants. He was quite a sight, squeezing his 5' 4" and 300 pound frame
into a small sports car. He loved Adolfo's, right across the street from Snug,
because the food was excellent and the portions were enormous.

As much as he loved his dinner, he also loved the south Louisiana vegetation; a
walk with Max was a learned lecture on the local plant life.

Would we have discovered either Angelo Brocato's or the Creole Creamery without
his guidance?

I don't know what eventually killed him last August.  It could have been any
one of his many ailments; he was not healthy and was often in pain. We'll miss
him.

Max and I shared a birthday; he was exactly one year older than I. So his death
is another memento mori. As if I needed another reminder.

Title: Rio Bravo, Total Embarrassment or Great Triumph?
Date: November 25, 2021

We watched the 1969 western, Rio Bravo, and were crushed with disappointment.
How could a film with such famous actors, directed by Howard Hawks (Red River
1948), amount to such piffle?  We could not restrain ourselves from jeering
at its flagrant, grotesque failings. A thin, cliched plot, pieced out with
obvious meaningless padding. Incoherent, contradictory notions and "themes." An
unconscionable reveling in mass slaughter -- the bodies of Nathan Burdette's
gang falling as thickly as the leaves in Vallombrosa. We adjudicated what seemed
like a contest: who is a worse actor, Dean Martin or Ricky Nelson?  (Martin
plays a drunken former gunfighter (named Dude!!) whose shaky hands can only be
stilled when the Mexican band plays his favorite tune!!! Honest to goodness!!)
Nelson is a ridiculously young hotshot gunslinger who would have been better off
staying home drinking his afternoon milk and cookies under the supervision of
Ozzie and Harriet.

We hooted, I'm sorry to say, when impassive reluctant John Wayne kissed Angie
Dickinson with all the passion of a man sucking on moldy lemons. We were
offended by the racist caricatures of the Mexican innkeepers. And we guffawed
when the film allowed both Dean Martin and Ricky Nelson to burst into song --
utterly violating their screen characters but perhaps throwing a sorry bone to
the ticket-buying audience. (Allow me to confess that we fast-forwarded through
the musical interlude.) The irrelevant crooning lost the film any remaining
pretense or shred of integrity.

In short, here was a film that had no reason for being, or so we thought. A
travesty, a mere catchpenny.

Baffled, we turned to the internet for the story. Because there had to be a
story.

And now comes the surprise. Rio Bravo was the second highest ranking western
in the 2012 Sight and Sound critics' poll. Robin Wood, a generally trustworthy
critic and the man who wrote the book on Howard Hawks, rated it as his top
film of all time. What's going on here? We though the film was ludicrous and
embarrassing; others think very differently. Are we completely out of touch? Are
we nuts, intolerant. Has our taste been vitiated by age and mental decay? Are
there beauties hidden the film that are sufficiently subtle that our grosser
intellects could not detect them?  Or does this would-be emperor of a film
lack clothes and the critics and journals and the tomatoes are all blinded and
deceived.

And now comes some more internet info, which may or may not explain the opposing
views of us and them.

"The film was made as a response to High Noon," says Wikipedia. Why? Because
High Noon was thought to be a leftist movie, an allegory for Hollywood
blacklisting, as well as a critique of McCarthyism. John Wayne called High Noon
"un-American." (I've always thought of it as quintessentially American;  what
could possibly be more American than a Quaker's turn to violence, as when Amy
Kane picks us a rifle and shoots one of Frank MIller's kin. And especially when
that turn to violence is portrayed as a step toward a higher morality.

I'm wondering whether the folks who praise Rio Bravo like it not for aesthetic
but for political reasons. I'm suspicious.

Next step: get my hands on Robin Wood's book on Howard Hawks. Stay tuned,
Metablogians.

Title: Words of my Life: Spatchcock
Date: December 01, 2021

I first heard the word "spatchcock" at a Thanksgiving celebration some four
or five years ago. The turkey, I was told, had been "spatchcocked." To be
absolutely honest, I thought someone was pulling my leg. To my pure and
undefiled ears, the word "spatchcock" sounded more than a little obscene.
Certainly not something that a civilized person would do to a turkey. Or even to
a fellow human being. I admit that I was puzzled: what sort of perverse activity
is implied by "spatchcock." And just who would be the spatchcocker and who the
spatchcockee?

But further investigation revealed that "spatchcock" is not a dirty joke nor
even a slangy neologism. The word has an eighteenth-century origin and it's not
sexual but culinary: "to cut poultry along the spine and spread the halves apart
for more even cooking when grilled." Moreover, the word "spatchcock," believe
it or not, has a sibling of its own: "spitchcock": "to split an eel along the
back and then broil it." So spatchcock and spitchcock, yet as far as I know, no
"spotchcock" or "sputchcock"-- but why not?  Lots of other land and sea beasts
out there to de-spine and roast over an open fire. Spatchcocking, the process,
probably dates back to the neolithic, after the taming of fire and long before
anyone thought to call it by such a silly name.

Etymology?  Though there are theories, I'm going to stick with "origin
unknown." The common answer is that the word is "shorthand  for 'dispatching
the cock.'" An undocumented, out-of-left-field guess, in my opinion. If I were
to propose a theory, I would say that the "cock" must be a version of  "cook."
I'm not prepared to venture a guess about the spatch. A mystery, unrecoverable.
Perhaps a humorous coinage?

I'd hypothesize that "cock" might be related to the second part of common
surnames such as Hancock, Adcock, Babcock, Hitchcock or Wilcox. Some say that
the cock in these names is a hypocoristic suffix "applied to a young lad who
strutted proudly like a cock." I'm skeptical. More credible, once again, is
"cook." Hancock is Johan the cook, Adcock is Adam the cook, Hitchcock is Richard
(Rich, Hich) the cook, and so on.

The ever-unpredictable Urban Dictionary provides another meaning for
"spatchcock": "when you intentionally rub your backpack on a nearby stranger's
genitals in an effort to sexually arouse them." What can I say?  Only that I've
lived a long life and have never given a single thought to the erotic potential
of the backpack. Nor have I ever been spatchcocked either in the traditional
culinary nor the speculative contemporary sexual sense of the word (thanks be to
all the gods in the pantheon!)

Other words of my life:

slouch,

cishet,

yips

ramps

jot and tittle

worship

mucilage.

Title: A Cinematic Dream
Date: December 06, 2021

I was in the midst of the usual noir "can't-find-my-way" dream when all at once,
without warning, the scene and the genre changed. Suddenly I was in technicolor
John Ford territory, holding on for dear life to the cow-catcher of an 1880s
railroad engine. Three central-casting bad guys -- all whiskers and black hats
--were shooting at me with their pistols. Familiar with what's expected such
films, I responded by drawing my own Colt 45-- and plugged two of them. But the
third kept coming, zombie-style, even though I nailed him several times. I was
scared.

Apparently I was rattling around, because just as I decided that I'd better
shoot him between the eyes and be done with it, my faithful bedmate woke me
up.  End of dream; what a relief.

I must be watching too many Westerns.

It's fascinating that the material of this dream is not drawn from the events
of my "real life," but rather from fiction (in this case, the movies). Have I
incorporated such fictions into the deepest layers of my unconscious, from which
dreams are supposedly drawn?

On the other hand, my watching and absorbing a film is a "real life" event.

I can't remember any film in which a character clings to the cow-catcher. Did I
invent such an event?  Or just extrapolate it from various western films?

I should mention that I experienced the dream not in ordinary colors but in the
brilliant artificial color of old-fashioned garish Technicolor.

Title: "Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord."
Date: December 15, 2021

Here's a Christmas-themed picture posted by United States Representative Thomas
Massie of Kentucky. Note the cheerfully decorated tree behind them. Note also
that each member of the shit-eating-grin faced members of the Massie family
is sporting a military weapon. Massie himself, as befits the father of such a
family, carries the piece of artillery that is by far the most threatening. He's
so proud.

I must be out of the military-Kentucky loop, because when my friends send me
Christmas cards, they will characteristically include a message such as "peace
on Earth, good will toward men, or perhaps something about "joy" or "blessings."
Massie's card says, "Please Santa, send ammo," which is not, I believe, a
traditional holiday greeting.

Massie's card is deliberately provocative. It's designed to piss off the libs.
In your face, pinkos! But it's so blasphemous and misjudged that it might also
offend mainline Christians. Goodness gracious, I hope so. Though frankly, I
haven't heard much of an outcry from the pulpits.

But now it has come to pass that it's not just blue-staters that are offended.
Massie has gone and pissed off the Lord himself -- who has retaliated with a
series of tornadoes which have swept through Massie's home state. Can there
be any doubt, any possible probable shadow of doubt, that the Ancient of Days
has responded to the Massie family Christmas card with lightning and thunder?
Vengeance is mine, I shall repay, saith the Lord. It's obvious -- although I am
shocked to observe that I have not yet heard any megachurch preacher draw the
undeniable conclusion. I'm waiting.

When I first set astonished eyes on the card, I guessed that Massie, though an
important office holder, must be what I have heard called in Vermont a "local
yokel." Trash. A rube. An exterminator or mortician or gun-toting bar owner who
lucked into Congress because no more respectable person chose to run. Because
what person of intelligence, sensitivity, experience, or a modicum of education
honors the spirit of Christmas with a display of assault weaponry?  Imagine my
surprise when I looked up Massie and discovered that he has a raft of degrees
and extraordinary prizes from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He's
clearly brilliant (in a MIT kind of way). But even if he were a pure pocket-
calculator I-don't-give-a-shit-about-anyone-but-myself libertarian nerds,
shouldn't he have been exposed, in New England, to enough human beings of all
sorts to recognize that his Christmas greeting is monumentally offensive not
only to his fellows and (as we have seen) to the Lord of Hosts Himself?

Or perhaps he knows that our tearful country is so riven that an irreligious
display of such a sort will amuse and motivate his allies and torment his
opposition. And will strike gold with political donors.

Title: What I Read: 2021

I decided to keep a record of the books that I read this past 2021. It's in
roughly chronological order, starting just about a year ago. It's an eclectic
bunch; after years of being forced to be a specialist I've reverted to my
natural dilettantism. I've probably forgotten some books, both my record-keeping
and my memory not so good as before.

Here they come (long drumroll):  three novels by Lewis Grassic Gibbon: Sunset
Song, Cloud Howe, and Grey Granite (the first is a masterpiece); Derek
Wilson,  Charlemagne: a Biography; Park Honan, Christopher Marlowe, Poet
and Spy; John Heisey, A Checklist of American Coverlet Weavers; H. L. Allen,
American Coverlets of the Nineteenth Century (taught me a lot about Jacquard
coverlets); Eric Sloane, Museum of Early American Tools and A Reverence for
Wood; Rinker Buck, The Oregon Trail, Edna O'Brien, In the Forest (a forceful
novel); Evelyn Piper, Bunny Lake is Missing (which I read because I was curious
about the film of the same name); Patrick Svensson, The Book of Eels; Isabel
Wilkerson, The Warmth of Other Suns (a long important book which would have
been even better if it had been edited to 2/3's its size); Benjamin Kilham,
In the Company of Bears (a fascinating book set just south of us in Lyme,
NH); James Essinger, Jacquard's Web, Steven Vogel, Why the Wheel is Round
(which it isn't; it's circular); Elizabeth Barber, Women's Work, the First
20,000 Years; J D Schein, Coverlets and the Spirit of America; Anne Tyler, A
Spool of Blue Thread (by one of the most reliable of contemporary novelists);
Elizabeth Barber, Prehistoric Textiles (a fascinating story); Thomas Stumpf,
South St. Louis Boy, v. ii, by my graduate school classmate and friend; William
Dean Howells, The Rise of Silas Lapham, Andy Horowitz, Katrina (sad story of
governmental and bureaucratic incompetence in New Orleans); Sarah M. Broom,
The Yellow House; George Eliot, Middlemarch (what, fifth time?  or sixth?);
Kathryn Hughes, George Eliot, the Last Victorian; Shakespeare, The Winter's
Tale; Charles Dickens, Great Expectations (another perennial favorite); John
Le Carre, The Mission Song; Jane Austen, Persuasion;  Klyza and Trombulak, The
Story of Vermont (summer reading); Harry Reed, Harry, Scenes from my Life
(another autobiography by a friend); Shaun O'Connell, Assembled Pieces, Selected
Writings; Alice Munro, Carried Away; David Lee, Chainsaws, A History; Seymour
Gitin, The Road Taken (reminiscences of one of Lynn's relatives-in-law); Louis
Menand, Cold War (all 800 pages!); Lisa Genova, Remember;  Mark Harris, Mike
Nichols; H. L. Gates, The Black Church; Thomas Hardy, The Woodlanders (twice);
Madalaine Bohme, Ancient Bones; Simon Schama, The Story of the Jews (to 1492);
John McWhorter, Nine Nasty Words; two remarkable novels by Shirley Hazzard: The
Transit of Venus, and The Great Fire (read twice); Valerie Trouet, Tree Story;
James Shapiro, Shakespeare in a Divided America; Betty Smith, A Tree Grows
in Brooklyn; Joshua Hammer, The Bad-Ass Librarians of Timbuktu; Jacqueline
Woodson, Another Brooklyn; Paule Marshall, Brown Girl, Brownstones; Paula
Fox, Desperate Characters.

I've started on a reading project for 2022: books about Brooklyn. Will I
persist? The crowd is in an uproar, waiting to see how it goes. Look for a

Title: Novels Set in Brooklyn:  A Tree Grows in Brooklyn
Date: December 23, 2021

My new reading project: novels set in Brooklyn. There are, I've already
discovered, tons of them. I wonder how long I will last at this endeavor. Will
it be a sterile or a fruitful exercise?

How is it that I never read, until this very week, A Tree Grows in Brooklyn? 
It's certainly the best known novel with the noun "Brooklyn" in its title. I've
known about it all my life and just never got around to looking at a single
page. Did my parents, always tentative about sex, warn me off because the novel
has a few frank passages. Or was it anti-Brooklyn snobbery?  As a young person,
I wanted to read about far off places -- Pitcairn Island, nomadic central Asia,
and the Africa of Rider Haggard, -- certainly not familiar grimy Brooklyn. At
the McDonald Avenue branch of the public library, there were many well-worn
copies of of A Tree Grows in Brooklyn sitting on the shelf -- which I ignored
and, if I remember correctly, disdained.

What did I miss?  Tree is not much in the way of a fiction. There's nothing
like a plot, only a series of loosely-related episodes, and except for the
central figure, not much character development. It's a barely-disguised
autobiography. Francie Nolan, tracked from birth through her escape to, believe
it or not, Michigan!!, comes from a grindingly poor family ("food insecure"
before the term was invented). Much of the first few hundred pages is the
barebones account of the struggle for sustenance (and lodging). There is so much
emphasis on overcoming lack that Tree almost seems to fetishize or celebrate
poverty.

So much scrabbling for the next meal is hard to bear, painful to read. It's
especially painful for me, because Betty Smith, born in 1896 in Williamsburg,
preceded my father, also a native of Williamsburg (born in 1904) by only a few
years. He came from an immigrant family as poor as poor can be, and some of the
stories that he told me about the impoverishment of his youth echo and sometimes
exceed Smith's. The essence, therefore, of this "novel," is familiar to me,
perhaps entirely too familiar.

One blot upon the novel is its casual bigotry. Irish characters sometimes go
to "Jewtown" for clothes or food. Jewish characters are gross stereotypes.
But what can be expected from a popular novel of the 1940s, when the radio
offered us, day after day,  large doses of Amos and Andy, Life with Luigi, The
Goldbergs. How we guffawed at ethnic "humor" in those unenlightened days!

Nor was I happy about the novel's Brooklyn chauvinism. For example:

""There's no other place like it," Francie said.

"Like what?"

"Brooklyn. It's a magic city."

"It's just like any other place."

"It isn't. It's mysterious here in Brooklyn. It's like -- yes -- a dream. The
houses and streets don't seem real. Neither do the people."

I wish the novel offered some corroboration for the claim of Brooklyn's magic
and mystery. If it was there, I didn't find it in this grim novel, nor at the
corner of Newkirk and Coney Island Avenues where I first came to awareness.

The "tree that grows in Brooklyn" is the so-called 'tree of heaven," ailanthus
altissima. Smith has chosen it as a symbol of resilience, for the tree of heaven
can thrive under the most inauspicious circumstances. I, for one, can remember
playing on the roof of one of those six story apartment houses so common in
our neighborhood, and noticing an ailanthus growing right out of the asphalt.
I was astonished. But I wish that Betty Smith had chosen a different tree to
invest with meaning, because the ailanthus is, frankly, a "trash tree."  It's
generally considered a noxious weed, an invasive species. It grows rapidly
but is short- lived. Its wood is soft and useless. It suckers vigorously and
eternally, pours forth strong alleopathic chemicals upon its neighbors, invades
subterranean sewers and pipes, is extremely fecund, and stinks. It is known to
gardeners and foresters not as the "tree of heaven" but as the "tree of hell."
It's not a tree that often finds itself celebrated in fiction. Nor in pastoral.
Brooklyn, my Brooklyn, was a city of magnificent oaks, maples, sycamores and
elms. My people, my fellow Brooklynites, deserve a more distinguished avatar
than the tree of of so-called heaven.

Some will remember that T. S. Eliot once referred to the tree that grows in
Brooklyn as the "rank ailanthus."

Title: Novels Set in Brooklyn:  Another Brooklyn
Date: December 27, 2021

I read, first with irritation but eventually with appreciation, Another
Brooklyn, by Jacqueline Woodson. If I had purchased the book, rather than
borrowing it from the Boulder Public, I'd be peeved, because it's more of a
novella or long short story than a fully-grown novel. Only 165 pages of minibook
size(8" x 5"), with spacious margins, large font, and double or triple spacing
between frequent one-sentence "paragraphs." The whole could be compressed into
30 normal book size pages. I felt cheated because I want my words worth. But
quality should not be measured by quantity, or Mrs. Trollope would be twenty
times as good a writer as Jane Austen. Jacqueline Woodson is apparently a
very famous novelist, but you wouldn't know it by me, for I had never heard
of her, so out-of-date I am. It's a poetic, I think, novel, about "growing up
girl in Brooklyn" (white flight Bushwick to be precise) in the 1970s. It's
not dense with detail, so each incident has to do a lot of work. It concerns
four young girls, each frustrated by the surroundings. The narrator says,
"Brooklyn felt like a stone in my throat," but I don't think the novel makes
good on that stuck-in-the-craw assertion. It's not, in my opinion, a regional
novel; it's a coming of age story with a perennial theme: how do we get out of
this constricting space: "Everywhere we looked, we saw people trying to dream
themselves out. As though there was something other than this place. As though
there was another Brooklyn."

A paragraph that resonated with me, for as an adolescent I myself know only one
thing: "I need to get out of here."

Title: Novels about Brooklyn: Brown Girl, Brownstones (1959)
Date: January 01, 2022

Well, one might ask, how goes the reading-Brooklyn-novels project?

I've been taken by surprise. Solely by the luck of the draw, just because the
books were available at the public library, and without planning or intention on
my part, my first three novels all had the same focus: coming-of-age-as-a-girl-
in-Brooklyn. First, A Tree Grows in Brooklyn (TGB) about a Irish-German girl in
the period around WWI, then Another Brooklyn (AB) about a Black or African-
American girl in 1970s Bushwick, and yesterday, Brown Girl, Brownstones (BG,B)
by Paule Marshall, written in 1959 but neglected and then rediscovered during
the 1970s. BG,B focuses on young Selina Boyce, daughter of immigrants from
Barbados, who was raised in a West Indian neighborhood somewhere between Fulton
Avenue and Crown Heights.

The three novels, and their three heroines, share common concerns. In all three,
an intelligent young girl, a reader, tries to achieve selfhood in a challenging
environment. The young girls come from families that are led by strong mothers
and are compromised by weak, failing fathers. Religions (Catholicism in TGB,
Nation of Islam in AB, and a dictatorial new religion led by "Father Peace,"
whom I take to be Father Divine, in BG,B) are unhelpful and damaging.

Today's novel, Brown Girl, Brownstones is the most detailed, informative, and
moving of the trio. It's a substantial, rich, highly-detailed, and I would say
old-fashioned novel about self-discovery. It used to be said that "every modern
writer's first novel should be titled "my horrible adolescence.'" But BG,B is
more complicated than the stereotype. It's an "immigration novel" about the
conflicts between the foreign-born parents and the Brooklyn-born daughter. It's
also a story of regional interest, very strong in depicting the peculiarities of
Brooklyn culture.

Barbadian-Americans are depicted as an entrepreneurial class, upwardly mobile,
anxious to get ahead. The first step is to acquire a brownstone and become a
landlord rather than a tenant. And yet young Selina rejects her aspiring mother,
whom she sees as hopelessly materialistic. She fears the success of a move to
the boring suburbs -- a familiar 1950s theme.

BG,B is a novel about race, and, in my opinion, hits its stride in the last few
chapters when Paule Marshall analyzes bigotry. There are a few pages that either
anticipate or follow the powerful critiques of James Baldwin and Frantz Fanon.
And Richard Wright. I suspect that it's such pages that helped bring deserved
attention to Brown Girl, Brownstones.

Title: Novels Set in Brooklyn:  Desperate Characters (1970)
Date: January 06, 2022

Paula Fox's Desperate Characters feels to me less like a novel than a short
story, or perhaps a set of short stories sutured together. It's comprised of a
series of incidents that concern a married couple and like many fictions in the
short story genre, resists closure or resolution. Though it's a miniature of a
novel, it's still a gem.

The principal characters, Otto and Sophie, come to the end of the story just
about where they started -- not miserable but not happy either. They are
immigrants to an incompletely gentrified, downtown Brooklyn neighborhood.
Their house -- all pocket doors, cedar floors, highly polished Victorian
furniture even a Meissen cat dish -- as well as the houses of their neighbors
are vulnerable to violation. Otto and Sophie, and their friends, are attacked
by the sort of intrusions that are familiar from horror films -- the bite of a
stray cat, a threatening phone call, a stone thrown through a window, unwanted
visitors, vicious inexplicable vandalism, mysterious goings-on in the house next
door. These attacks on the home are intermittent but unending; in fact, the last
image in the book is of a self-inflicted wound -- an interior wall splotched and
stained by the black ink of a thrown inkwell. Stasis, not progress.

Should I have been surprised that the Brooklyn novels that I have now read are
so concerned with the acquisition, improvement, integrity, and preservation of
the homestead?

To tell truth, I have been a bit startled -- but I should not have been.
Brooklyn has always been the most mutable and fluid of cities. Outsiders --
Irish, Italians and Jews in my part of Flatbush, as well as southern Blacks
searching for the warmth of other suns, West Indians, Russians, Hispanics from
central and south Americas, Asians of all varieties, and nowadays midWesterners
-- arrive and alter the neighborhood. For the worse, according to the prior
inhabitants, and for the better, according to the new arrivals. It's a repeated
and perpetual dance -- and certainly one that was a feature of my own family
history.

My immigrant grandparents never had the resources even to imagine the purchase
of a home. They were renters of a cold-water sixth-floor walkup in Williamsburg.
Nor had they owned property in the old country, where they were even poorer.
I imagine that when my parents purchased the house in which I was raised (in
1936, for $4500) they were the first in my ancestry dating back to the spear and
atalatl eons ever to own a piece of real estate.

Re-reading these Brooklyn books has reminded me how important that home on
East 9 Street in heart of  Flatbush was to my parents. And why my father, in
his last years, solitary, crippled by arthritis, but intransigent refused to
leave it though it would have been much more sensible and convenient to live
elsewhere. He was determined to die in his own precious home, and he did so.

Here's a picture of 539 East 9 Street, a big old undistinguished Victorian,
taken sometime around the 1939, the year of my birth. The second and third
stories were rented; we lived on the ground floor. The house, long since
demolished, lives on in my memory.

Especially in my nightmares, where at least once a month, I defend myself
against the savage bows and arrows, the cavalry rifles, and wild dogs that
attack the property.  And wake up in a sweaty terror.

Title: Art, Elephants
Date: January 09, 2022

Here's a photograph of a "work of art" that has adorned the lobby of the
condominium in which I've lived since 2009. It is unsigned -- the creator hasn't
been courageous enough to inscribe his/her name. I think it's a ridiculously
ugly smear, and In the privacy of my aggrieved mind, I attribute it to a
painter-of-my-imagination whom I call Fango Nero (Italian for "black mud"). I
conceive Fango Nero to be an innovator in the sense that he employs not brush
or palette knife but rather a standard Home Depot 6" paint roller. I don't
find fault with Signore Nero for leaving his painting unnamed and unsigned.
It's a wise choice on his part. After all, the set of smudges is a patently
disgraceful, reprehensible piece of trash that has no business masquerading
as art or being affixed to anyone's walls, let alone mine. I don't know what
prompted the architects or the contractors of this building to purchase this
thing and hang it in my lobby. Perhaps it was bequeathed to them, or possibly
they were supporting a needy uncle.

So many accomplished artists in this world and I must be afflicted with these
splotches! What a waste of space!

That's what used to think, these last twelve years --  until I had a sudden
epiphany.

This painting is not the work of my imaginary painter Fango Nero, or any human
being. No, not at all. It's got to be the production of a talented elephant.

Some of my readers will have seen videos of elephants painting. If the professor
of art or the mahout offers an artistically-inclined elephant paint and brush,
by golly, he or she will grasp the brush handle with the ever-useful trunk and
create you something in the abstract impressionist line.

Here is a genuine pachydermal production.  (I'm not aware of the name of the
particular artisit.)

It's quite a bit more interesting than my black and white paint roller job, is
it not? I like the cheerful interplay of the two well-chosen colors and the way
that the long pink lines, almost imprisoned by the green, suggest both freedom
and delight. A superior production! It would be a greater pleasure by far to
encounter this canvas several times a day than the muddy black one that ambushes
me every time I pass through the lobby.

The bottom line: Fango bad, Dumbo good.

Title: More Brooklyn Novels: Summer in Williamsburg (1934)
Date: January 13, 2022

Daniel Fuchs was known to me only as the writer of the screenplay of Criss-
Cross, a noir that epitomizes "gritty."  Or perhaps grimy. I was not aware
that Fuchs  began his writing career with three Brooklyn novels, the first of
which is Summer in Williamsburg. It's a novel that hits home, because Fuchs was
born in 1909 and grew up in exactly the same part of Brooklyn, and in the same
circumstances, as did my father, who was born there in 1904.

The novel comprises a single summer of tenement life and it's not optimistic
or cheerful: "people in tenements lived in a circle without significance, one
day the duplicate of the next until the end, which occurred without meaning but
accidentally." Fuchs' Williamsburg is filled to the brim with anomie, petty
criminals, violent teen gangs, multiple suicides, harridan wives and unfaithful
husbands, ungratified sexual longings, business failures and consequent poverty.
Even a fatal fire. In some Brooklyn novels, it is through books and reading
that a character stumbles upon a clue to another and better world; not in this
one. Fuchs' tenement world is claustrophobic and imprisoning. And yet, Fuchs
occasionally offers a touch of poetic language -- sometimes even breaking the
novel's "fourth wall" and intruding a bit of inventive authorial charm into the
narrative. Redeeming moments, for the most part, but few and far between.

Other elements that might offer hope to a hopeless world: athletics, either
participatory or spectator; religion, not a shred, even though almost all of the
characters are Jewish; music; any sort of aesthetic concern. No beauty in Fuchs'
Williamsburg.

I wonder how my father managed to survive his many Williamsburg summers without
bitterness and with such a cheerful, optimistic demeanor.  Why was he not
soured and jaded by his grim environment?  Or perhaps Williamsburg had its
particular glories while Fuchs had an eye only for nastiness.

Yesterday, while reading this book, my browser took me, by chance, to a travel
site that advertised a stay at a 4-star hotel in Williamsburg, "New York's
coolest neighborhood." Fuchs (and my father) would have been flabbergasted. 
"Coolest neighborhood."

And so, it appears, the whirligig of time continues its whimsical way.

Title: Another Brooklyn Novel:  Last Exit to Brooklyn (1964)
Date: January 14, 2022

I read the first fifty pages of Hubert Selby's Last Exit to Brooklyn and then
decided, No More. It's an ugly, brutal book, not one that's going to offer me
either instruction or pleasure. I read two chapters -- the first about the
murderous gang wars and the second the transsexual who dies of an overdose of
benzedrine. Then I looked up the wiki article and realized that I was about
to come face to face with "the novel's most notorious scene, in which a young
prostitute is brutally gang-raped after a night of heavy drinking and is left
for dead in a vacant lot." Sorry, not for me.

Not much about Brooklyn either in this grim novel; no local color, though the
story is reputed to be set in Sunset Park or Red Hook.

Selby crosses William Burroughs (whom I also can't read) with Jack Kerouac. Plus
innovative grammar, confusing punctuation, and inventive orthography.

Not my cup of tea. Sorry, life is too short,

Title: Still Another Brooklyn Novel:  Motherless Brooklyn (1999)
Date: January 17, 2022

Jonathan Lethem nominally sets Motherless Brooklyn in downtown Brooklyn, but
it's more accurate to say that it takes place in the world of Dashiell Hammett
and Raymond Chandler and Elmore Leonard. Or, to be even more precise, in the
Land of Noir. It's a textbook example of superior detective fiction, with all
the trappings: a clever gumshoe (who, of course, gets himself bopped on the
head), a bad girl, two (count 'em two) car chases; a mysterious international
crime cartel (on loan from Ian Fleming), a scary assassin, seedy all-night
joints, endless stakeouts, even a police detective who's always just a step
behind our guy. It's so self-consciously, unapologetically derivative -- less
plagiary than homage. One character even quotes Sam Spade: "When a man's partner
is killed, he's supposed to do something about it." The novel is suspenseful,
clever, and occasionally witty.  It kept me engaged and guessing, so I have no
complaints. Of course I couldn't follow the intricacies of the betrayals and
counter-betrayals, but then, I never can.

It's a Brooklyn novel in the sense that it recognizes the astonishing
provinciality of the borough. Lionel Essrog, our detective, thinks of New Jersey
and Connecticut as exotic territories. Most of the action is specifically
located in downtown Brooklyn, which happens to be a neighborhood that I know
rather well. The investigators have their office on Court Street, where I often
visited my father's law offices, first at 125 Court and later on the 13th floor
of a tall building at 66 Court (the floor was listed, believe it or not, as 12A,
so as not to alarm the triskaidekaphobic). Also mentioned is Joralemon Street,
where Dr Irving Pollack, my smooth-faced orthodontist, painfully tightened
the metal braces on my teeth every other week for the entire duration of my
childhood and youth.

Motherless Brooklyn seems to be designed for the big screen. In 2017 a version
appeared that was written and directed by the rather brilliant actor Edward
Norton, who also plays Lionel Essrog. On a whim, we rented and watched the film
last night. It's an engaging film, very handsomely rendered. I watched it, I'm
afraid, with a chip on my shoulder, because I came to it with the novel fresh
in my mind and resented the liberties the film takes with the novel. In fact,
after just a few introductory scenes, Norton left the novel behind. Instead,
he crossed it with the Towne-Polanski Chinatown. It's a mistake, but not a
bad one, because if your intention is to imitate a film, you might as well
imitate an excellent one. Into the film, Norton imports a series of elements
that are utterly foreign to the novel. There's a dictatorial character who is
modeled on Noah Cross, a child of mysterious origin similar to the daughter of
Evelyn Mulwray ("she's my sister and my daughter") and a contrived plot device
that brings us deep into impenetrable Harlem. I'm sorry to say that Motherless
Brooklyn, the film, doesn't escape the gravitational pull of Chinatown.

Title: A Second Brooklyn Novel by Daniel Fuchs:  Homage to Blenholt (1936)
Date: January 20, 2022

Of the ten or so novels that I've read since I began this project, Homage to
Blenholt is certainly the most regional and the most "Jewish." It is positively
marinated in local color. Even in the first few paragraphs, we encounter the
"dirty cobbled streets" of Williamsburg, a milkman's plodding horse, the
subway and the trolley, "gutters," "seltzer," and a "stoop."  Kids play
Johnnie-on-the- pony, punchball, and ringolevio. There's a pickle man and a hot
corn man and a peddler selling imitation pearls. Even when characters are not
kvetching outright, they speak in a thick dialect that ladles English words onto
Yiddish structures and inflections.

The thin but adequate plot concerns young Max Balkan, who yearns for a more
glamorous, more powerful life. -- but every reader soon realizes that despite
his ambitions he's doomed to a life of slicing pastrami behind the counter of
someone else's delicatessen. Max admires Blenholt, a corrupt politician whose
graft has earned him a shiny suit and an extravagant funeral, -- but in his more
romantic moments he dreams of being an Alexander, a Caesar, or, his favorite
role model, Christopher Marlowe's Tamburlaine the Great, the Scythian shepherd
who rose from poverty to become the scourge of God and conqueror of Persia.

In the novel's finest phrase, poor Max's unromantic mother dismisses her son's
fantasies: "Tamburlaine, Schmamburlaine."

The bell of nostalgia rang most powerfully with the appearance of a word, well
known to me but no doubt unfamiliar to most readers. The word is "Forverts." It
was my task, on Sunday mornings, to buy and deliver a copy of the Jewish Daily
Forward to my Yiddish-speaking grandparents, who lived around the corner on
Coney Island Avenue. So with 50 cents in hand, I purchased the Times and the
Eagle for my parents and for my grandparents, the "Forverts." Until Homage to
Blenholt, I had not seen or heard that strange foreign word in 65 or 70 years.
My thanks to Daniel Fuchs.

I should add that, like Balkan, youthful me was dazzled by Tamburlaine. Marlowe
-- a young man's poet -- was my first serious literary love. He offered me
romantic escapism of a high order. But I was far too unimaginative to see myself
as the conqueror of the known world. For me, it was quite enough to appreciate
Marlowe's exotic landscape and still unsurpassed poetry.

Title: Another Brooklyn Novel:  A Meaningful Life (1971)
Date: January 25, 2022

I had never heard of L. J. Davis until I searched out his black-comic novel, A
Meaningful Life.  It's about a young man named Lowell Lake from Boise, Idaho
who moves to Brooklyn (as did the author himself) and buys a decrepit mansion
in a newly gentrifying section of Bedford-Stuyvesant that was eventually
to be dignified and upgraded into Boerum Hill. In his endeavor to repair
the building, everything that could go wrong, goes wrong -- and does so in
inventive, unpredictable ways.

If it's a satire, as it's sometimes called, A Meaningful Life is not gentle,
Menippean or Horatian, but, rather, far beyond the outer limits of Juvenelian.
It's nasty, and sometimes falls into just plain ugly.  It reads less like a
novel than as an extended turn by a stand-up monologist or comedian. Plot and
character are regularly sacrificed to jokes. It has the saddest ending of any
novel I can recall reading

Lowell Lake is afraid of "Negroes" and doesn't much like Puerto Ricans or Jews
or gays (whom he calls "fruits," and "fags") or old people, and he, and the
author, indulge themselves in brutal stereotyping.

It's one of the bleakest books I've ever read, and, if you hold your nose, one
of the funniest.

Title: Not Another Brooklyn Novel:  The Hand that Feeds You (2015)
Date: January 28, 2022

I was steered to A J Rich's The Hand that Feeds You by a pair of websites that
listed books set in Brooklyn, but I'm sad to say that there's almost nothing of
Brooklyn in the novel -- a considerable disappointment to expectant me. It's a
murder mystery in which various places in and around Brooklyn are mentioned, but
in fact the novel takes place in a cliched fictional city in which murders are
committed, red herrings are liberally strewn, police are not very bright, and
the actual perp is lo and behold revealed in the last chapter.

I'm not a great reader of crime fiction, but I found this one "suspenseful" and
"gripping." Against my better judgment, I swallowed it in one gulp.

I would have liked it even more if I had any affection or even interest in
dogs, because in The Hand that Feeds You, the mystery is whether it was
Morgan Prager's or Billie Badgirl-Richbitch's dogs who ripped out scamming
boyfriend Bennett's throat. The novel might also have been more up my alley if
protagonist-narrator Prager had been able to form warmer bonds with humans than
with canines. The novel concludes with Prager receiving a chaste peck from her
human crush and a sensual roll in the grass with her devoted doggy. Borderline
perverse, in my opinion. But what can be expected of a novel in which dangerous
"pitbulls" are re-branded as "pitties."

It's odd and something of a curiosity that scenes in the novel are located
in Rangeley and Oquossoc, the only towns in rural Maine with which I'm even
remotely familiar.

Title: Coulrophobia
Date: January 29, 2022

My bedmate informed that last night, in the wee hours, I uttered the strange
words, "fear of clowns."

Thanks to her I then remembered doing so (I had forgotten). But why those words?
I had no context. Was I in the throes of some sort of clownish nightmare       ?

Or was it merely a vocabulary exercise?  Perhaps, in my dream, I searched for
the English word for "fear of clowns." I know there is such a word, and in the
morning, I tried to recall it, but without success. I then tried to re-invent a
word, but the best I could do was "bozophobia," which is clearly an undignified
and inadequate invention. The existing and correct word, I soon discovered, is
coulrophobia, a curious modern coinage, dating only to the 1990s. Coulrophobia
is, for some mysterious reason, derived from the Greek word for "stilt-walker."
(There's a modern Greek word for clown, κλόουν, transliterated as klóoun,
which I suspect to be a recent borrowing from American English.)

Coulrophobia can be a serious affliction. According to the Cleveland Clinic,
coulrophobia can lead to hyperhidrosis. I myself am neither coulrophobic nor
hyperhidrosic.

The nighttime mystery remains. Why in the world would a semi-normal guy blurt
out the words "fear of clowns" at 2 am in the morning. In the long history of
human sleeping and dreaming, has such a thing ever happened before? Or will it
again?

Truly, I am a fascinating individual. Especially during the night. During the
waking hours, not so much.

Title: One More Brooklyn Novel:  Fortress of Solitude (2003)
Date: February 02, 2022

I grow all weak-in-the-knees sentimental when novelists write about such icons
of my childhood as spaldeens and stoopball.

Such delights abound in the first half of Jonathan Lethem's novel Fortress
of Solitude. The novel's Boerem Hill (newly upscaled from Gowanus) in the
1970s was as rich in such street games as my Flatbush in the 1940s and 50s.
Nevertheless, it' can't be said that these elements of nostalgia redeem Lethem's
huge undisciplined sprawling novel. Fortress of Solitude is crazily inventive,
profuse, uncontrolled. I have rarely read a novel by a respectable author so
in need of a dictatorial editor. Surely, there's enough material here for four
or five fine novels, each of which would deliver more bounce and impact than
this door-stopper. If Fortress of Solitude were a building, it would be called
overdecorated; if it were a piece of music or a film, it would be overproduced.

Some of my Flatbush cohort like to think that 1950s Brooklyn was a paradise for
children. I am not of that opinion. To me, Brooklyn was frequently menacing
when it wasn't just plain boring. The so-called "melting pot" was a cauldron
a racial animosities. But it wasn't all bad -- there were the Dodgers and the
camaraderie of the schoolyard. The public schools were crowded and disorderly,
but there were great teachers and enthusiastic students. Not so in dystopian
Fortress, a lord-of-the-flies world of vicious adolescents, incompetent adults,
and dysfunctional government. Far worse than I remember; and worse, I think,
than the reality.

The author of Motherless Brooklyn, a much finer novel, presents us this time
with two motherless youngsters, one white and one black, who through thick and
thin maintain a deep abiding friendship. But alas the novel veers into territory
that some might call magic realism, but to me was neither realistic nor magical
nor even remotely credible no matter how much disbelief I tried to suspend. To
read the last embarrassing third of the novel was a sad chore.

I don't think that I have ever read a substantial and ambitious novel that paid
so little attention to female characters. Where are the ladies of Boerum Hill? 
Not only are the mothers missing, but the occasional inadvertent woman who
wanders unto the page remains an unrealized cipher, a nothing.

Title: Love
Date: February 08, 2022

Some years ago, I wrote about meetings of the E & L Chafetz Family Circle, a
biennial gathering of my immigrant grandmother's family and also of her many
cousins, spouses and descendants. I recalled that Youthful Me objected to being
dragooned into attending these sessions. I also confessed that I hadn't a
glimmer of understanding of what those meetings meant. Here's what I wrote:

What I didn't know, and is so obvious to me now, was that I was much more
important to them than they were to me. That I was "doing well in school" were
words that they dearly wanted to hear. It was for my generation and for me that
they had braved the Cossacks, sold the farm, deserted from the Russian army,
left backward White Russia  or the Ukraine behind, endured the miseries of
steerage, slept four to a bed for years and half-acclimated themselves to a new
and utterly foreign world. For me. They had sacrificed themselves to invest in
me. So that I could "do well in school," get an education, live a better life. I
was their emissary to America, to the future.

It is still painful to admit how little I had appreciated these diminutive and
ancient but very brave people.

As it happens, I was not the only person to come to the same conclusion.

In A Walker in the City (the city is the Brownsville section of Brooklyn), the
distinguished man of letters Alfred Kazin had long ago (1951)made the identical
point:

My [immigrant] father and mother worked in a rage to put us above their level;
they had married to make us possible. We were the only conceivable end to all
their striving; we were their America.

Kazin proceeded to analyze his parents' marriage (he's a generation older than
I so his words are relevant not to my parents, but to my grandparents and those
of their Chafetz generation). "Love" became his subject. As I type his words, I
think of Joseph and Sonia, Isaiah and Etta:

Our parents, whatever affection might offhandedly be expressed between them,
always had the look of being committed to something deeper than mere love. Their
marriages were neither happy nor unhappy.; they were arrangements.

Powerful words, I think. Their marriages were "arrangements" -- certainly not
the touches of sweet harmony.

Not "love." Love was not for such as his parents (or, to continue the argument,
my grandparents).

I am perfectly sure that in my parents' mind, love was something exotic and
not wholly legitimate, reserved for "educated" people like their children, who
were the sole end of their existence. So far as I knew, love was not an element
admissible in my parents' experience. Any open talk of it between themselves
would have seemed ridiculous. It would have suggested a wicked self-indulgence,
a preposterous attention to one's own feelings.... They looked on themselves
only as instruments toward the ideal "American" future that would be lived by
their children.

I have the same sense about my forebears. I never heard any of them use the word
"love" and I don't think it would have been a comprehensible value for them.
To fall in love, to be in love, was not their expectation. Their aim was more
elemental: simply, to survive.

Moreover, not only did they not recognize romantic love, they also, as far as I
can remember, attached little importance to "happiness."

What an oddity!  They had left the dark backward of eastern Europe, lands of
dearth and pogroms and cholera, and traveled to a country in which the "pursuit
of happiness" was inscribed in its founding documents. But their aim, I am
absolutely sure, was not to achieve ephemeral happiness; their aim was to put a
roof over their heads and put food on the family table.

Life and liberty, yes; the pursuit of happiness -- an utterly alien concept.

Title: A Contemporary Brooklyn Novel by Emily Gould:  Friendship (2014)
Date: February 14, 2022

Friendship is definitely an urban novel, but there's little in it that
is particular to Brooklyn. Certainly not to my Brooklyn. It's a modern,
contemporary coming-of-age novel, but, unlike prior-century works, adolescence
is delayed or postponed, because the two thirtyish women about whom it revolves
would have solved their problems when they were a decade younger if they
weren't so rich and spoiled. It's healthy that they try to maintain a profound
friendship in a world of meaningless temp jobs, bad boyfriends, inchoate
ambitions, voluntary poverty, and impulsive and irresponsible sex.

It's an amusing novel, well-plotted but written without much in the way of flair
or style. Not weighty. Perhaps I was a little put off by the indulgences of
first world difficulties.

For one of the characters, Williamsburg was a "hotbed of youth and culture." For
another, it was a "hotbed of European tourists and restaurants with thirty-five
dollar entrees." Wow, Williamsburg is two distinct hotbeds. It's hard to imagine
how Daniel Fuchs would have reacted. Is there another part of the U. S. so
fundamentally altered in a couple of generations?

Amnesia is perfunctory in this "pre-Code" melodrama. Comes and goes without much
stress.

Rich snotbucket monocle-wearing attorney Charlie "Beauty" Steele is beaten,
thrown into a river and presumed dead. He is rescued and wakes up without a
glimmer of memory but is otherwise entirely functional. In his new, raccoon-
skin-hat personality he falls in love with shopkeeper Rosalie Eventural (played
by 18-year-old Loretta Young). Eventually it comes to light that he has left a
wife behind. His memory returns in flash and in a flashback, and things go from
bad to worse. Bigamy and all that.

The Right of Way has not aged well. It's a silent film with words. Conrad Nagel,
acting in a superseded tradition, is all exaggerated gestures, eye rolls, and
heavy lipstick. Loretta Young is so young that she hasn't even started to look
like Loretta Young.

Astonishing to think that the film is now pushing a hundred years old and that
amnesia was there right from the start. Before the start, actually, because
there were two silent Right of Ways (or Rights of Way) before this all-talkie
version.

Title: Astonishing Dream; Idea for a New Technology
Date: February 19, 2022

Another long troubled night, another astonishing dream. This time, I found
myself lurking in a primitive cabin inhabited, it seemed, by a big happy family.
There were a bunch of kids and a cheerful be-aproned matriarch cooking on an old
wood stove what looked to me like a cauldron of soup. Immediately, the scene
shifted to a hall or a church basement. There were eight or ten long tables at
which a couple of dozen unfamiliar but clearly delineated folks were seated,
waiting for their dinner. But first, some singing. An unidentifiable patriotic
song, and then, a hymn. I recognized it as a hymn because it included the line,
"He died in vain." Still in the midst of the dream, I said to myself, I have to
remember this verse, so I took out pen and paper, and wrote down these words:
"he died in vain." As I did so, a large, bearded, slightly threatening man
accused me of "making fun" of the proceedings. He demanded to inspect what I
had written. I showed him my writing and explained to him that I thought "he
died in vain" was theologically wrong, because according to the usual Christian
interpretation, Jesus did not die "in vain."

End of dream.

In the morning, awake, I did some research to see if "he died in vain" appears
in any familiar or remote hymn. Just as I anticipate, no soap. However, I
discovered that the most frequently cited use of the phrase comes not from a
hymn or from the Bible but from the Gettysburg Address: that "we here highly
resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain." Why should my dreamatorium
think to quote Abraham Lincoln? But why not, especially since there's been a
lot of Lincoln talk in our household this last while what with Lynn reading a
biography and also Team of Rivals. Then I wondered, could the cabin in the first
part of the dream be a reference to Kentucky log cabin in which Lincoln was
reputedly born. A long shot, but not impossible. Anyway, it's my dream; I can
interpret it as I want.

These mysterious dreams inspire in me an idea for a stunning new technology.
I think it would be very helpful if someone would devise a recording device
for dreams -- so that they could be saved and then played back on the TV
screen. It would be fascinating, I think, to see not only the fragments that
one remembers but the whole multi-hour experience laid out there in full
color and stereophonic sound. What a boon to mankind! What a convenience for
psychoanalysts!

I imagine something like an applewatch with an app for recording a month or so
of all-nighters. I know I'd buy one.

Impossible, you say?  Well, did they not laugh at the Wright brothers?

I think I need to present this idea to Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos. Bill Gates.
Someone with imagination and a history of achievement. Someone who would know
how to monetize so brilliant a conception. I myself am willing to invest my
entire income tax refund, however large it turns out to be.

Title: "Give Me Your Tired, Your People Who are Experiencing Poverty"
Date: February 21, 2022

At lunch yesterday, a friend of long standing mentioned that the conglomerate
that now publishes his American politics textbook has hired a new employee, a
vice-president for diversity and inclusion. It's a well-intended decision, I
am sure, but it carries a potential downside. The new v-p has instructed my
friend to make some changes to his prose. For example, he will no longer be
allowed to report that Lyndon Johnson got his way by "arm-twisting" recalcitrant
legislators. The metaphor, though commonly used back in the LBJ era, and still
picturesque, is disrespectful to people who suffer from broken or withered arms
and is especially discourteous to those who are missing one or both upper limbs.
No more arm-twisting, therefore. My friend was also told that it is no longer
permissible to say that in the U. S., "the poor tend to vote at lower levels of
participation than the general population." The new v-p insists that the phrase,
"the poor" denigrates various people by reducing them to a mere category. "The
poor" should therefore be updated and altered to "'people experiencing poverty."

In our peaceful and prosperous midWestern town, we've had a continuing and
difficult debate about homelessness. Some while ago, our extremely correct local
newspaper ceased to denominate those without regular domiciliary appointments as
"the homeless" and began to call them "people experiencing homelessness."

Such a circumlocution, I believe, though well-intended, misses the mark. The
word "homeless" has a poignancy and immediacy that the bloodless bureaucratic
euphemism "people experiencing homelessness" lacks. Rather than making
homelessness more palatable; it makes it more painful.

Let us thank all the gods in the pantheon that Emma Lazarus did not write,
"Give me your people experiencing lassitude, give me your people experiencing
poverty."

I wonder what the v-p for inclusion would say about Jesus, who famously advised
that "when thou makest a dinner or a supper, invite not thy friends, nor thy
brethren, neither thy kinsmen, nor thy rich neighbors; lest they also bid thee
again, and a recompence be made thee. But when thou makest a feast, invite the
poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind." Such a forceful series of evocative
nouns! But would "the maimed," "the lame," "the blind," overleap the diversity
and inclusion barrier and enter a 21st century textbook? I think not.

Although Jesus may have had some good ideas, he was definitely not "woke."

Just when I was beginning to think that the Hollywood memory-loss well had run
dry, along comes Whirlpool and another variant of the world's most flexible
mental affliction. This time: loss of memory by hypnosis.

It could have been a good film: Ben Hecht, Otto Preminger, Gene Tierney, Jose
Ferrer. But it's gimmicky and the psychology is vulgar pseudo-Freudianism.

Malignant David Korvo (Ferrer) hypnotizes poor Ann Sutton (Tierney) into
imagining that she's committed a murder. Will she recover her memory in time
for the true murderer (Korvo himself) to be discovered? Yes, she will. The
film turns into something like a police procedural but might better be called
a psychoanalytical procedural. Richard Conte plays the Tierney's husband, and
he's the psychoanalyst, but frankly he's so surprisingly dense that he's an
embarrassment to his entire profession. The audience is led through a series of
melodramatic twists and turns, many requiring wholesale suspension of disbelief,
before all turns out well, or pretty well, because poor Ann Sutton (Tierney) is
reunited to her doltish husband.

Here's a picture of Iago-like hypnotist Jose Ferrer staring into the deer-in-

Title: Ex-Wife (1928); Divorcee (1930)
Date: February 22, 2022

Through the continuing miracle of TCM, we watched Divorcee, a 1930 "pre-Code"
drama of marriage and adultery. It's a film that was shocking in its own time
and still carries a bit of an edge. Jerry Martin (Norma Shearer) and Ted Martin
(Chester Morris) attempt to create a marriage of perfect equals, but Ted strays.
There's a great understated scene in which Jerry, the betrayed wife, cold-
bloodedly tells her unfaithful husband, that "I've balanced our accounts."
Ted, though he has proclaimed a commitment to equality, does not, let us say,
handle the revelation of his wife's adultery with grace. The marriage comes to
a disastrous end. But alas after an hour or so of travail and weeping, Jerry
loses her nerve, succumbs to propriety, pursues her erring husband to Paris, and
promises to be true. The assertion of equity has turned out to be just so much
blather. The double standard has been tested but has held firm. The film flirts
with radicalism but reverts to a Hollywood ending in which love conquers all and
an adventurous woman accepts her subordinate place.

I was sufficiently intrigued by the film to investigate its background. The
source is a novel called Ex-Wife (1928) by Ursula Parrott, which sold 100,000
copies and was a sensation in its day. I confess that although I'm supposed to
know something about literature, I had never heard of this scandalous piece of
fiction. Ex-Wife sunk like a stone and has been out of print for many years, but
our interlibrary loan department managed to locate a 80s reprint in Fort Lewis,
Colorado. (Thanks, Interlibrary Loan!).

Ex-Wife is an inartistic piece of writing -- hectic, repetitive, padded, but
one that obviously struck a nerve. In this novel, a young divorced woman does
not just pine for her wandering husband. Instead, she enjoys her independence,
and "sleeps with more men than [I] can count." She then she falls deeply in love
with the wrong man, and finally opportunistically marries a third fellow whom
she doesn't love but to whom she promises to be faithful (we are skeptical).
The novel is marinated in speakeasy bootleg liquor and easy morality. Much
wilder than the rather tame film version, it is also more challenging and
revolutionary.

In the course of the novel, our heroine has a baby (who conveniently dies) and
also an abortion. The babies are important to the larger backstory. In 1922, the
then Katherine Ursula Towle, a recent Radcliffe graduate, married Lindesay Marc
Parrott, a young reporter for The New York Times.

They had a son named Lindesay Marc Parrott Jr. two years later. However, his
existence was kept a secret from Ursula's husband, as he never wanted to have
a son. So, Ursula left the child in the custody of her father and sister and
returned to Lindesay, still not speaking a word about the son. It was not until
1926 that Lindesay found out that he was a father. As a result, he immediately
divorced Ursula, rejected the existence of his son, and never once went to see
him.

It's an astonishing revelation that certainly does not speak well for Lindesay
Parrott, but adds some autobiographical interest to the plot of Ursula Parrott's
Ex-Wife. Suddenly, the deceased child and the abortion make a certain kind of
sense.

I should add that Lindesay Parrott was a name well known to me in the days of my
youth. I was then a diligent reader of The New York Times and Lindesay Parrott
covered the Korean War, so I encountered his name every single day from 1949 to
1955. And then in the 70s, I learned that Lindesay Parrott had retired from the
Times and had purchased a small farm on Kidder Road in Bradford, Vermont, a bit
more than a mile, as the crow flies, from where we lived on Hackett Hill Road. I
gave thought to knocking on his door, but I heard through the local gossip chain
that Parrott was a recluse and a terrible alcoholic. Whether true or not I don't
know. Of course I had no idea that Lindesay Parrott had once been married to a
notorious novelist.

As for Ursula, after her divorce from Lindesay Parrott, she married three
more times, and was also rumored to have had affairs with F. Scott Fitzgerald
and Sinclair Lewis. She died in 1957 "in the charity ward of a New York City
hospital."

Here's Ursula Parrott's Radcliffe graduation picture:

Title: A Contemporary Brooklyn Novel:  Adelle Waldman, The Love Affairs of Nathaniel P. (2013)
Date: February 24, 2022

This curiously named novel, The Love Affairs of Nathaniel P. (no relation, thank
goodness), concerns a 30-year-old Baltimorean become Brooklynite who drifts from
bed to bed but is incapable of achieving lasting love.

Adelle Waldman takes a scalpel to Nathaniel P[iven] and also to his various
lady friends. Her analyses are sharp, incisive and sometimes painfully close
to the bone. She is not above devoting paragraphs, even pages, to dissecting a
minor event or brief conversation. Sometimes the intricacy of her observations
resembles those of Henry James, though I can't remember The Master ever
discussing either the scrotum or the anus of any of his characters. Waldman
put me in mind of a sentence with which Horatio admonishes Hamlet: '"'twere to
consider too curiously to consider so."

Reading this novel, I was relieved that I am not a 30-year-old on the hunt --
and that I never was. There's lots of sex, some of it precipitous, but not much
discussion or examples of genuine intimacy. Waldman's landscape is unfamiliar to
me -- a foreign culture or, rather, an alien civilization.

Set in Brooklyn, almost all the action takes place in Williamsburg or environs,
certainly within sight of the Manhattan skyline -- although I remember that once
or twice characters may have ventured into the Brooklyn hinterland for a pizza.

The author is amusingly aware of the way the new Brooklyn has superseded the
old:

the two groups (i.e. older residents and newcomers) might have existed on
different layers of the earth's atmosphere that only from a distance appear to
be on the same plane. A store called National Wines & Liquors, Inc, where both
liquor and cashier were enclosed behind bulletproof glass, was not actually a
competitor to the much newer Tangled Vine, which specialized in organic and
local wines and exhibited the work of area artists at its Thursday-evening
tastings.

Which reminds me that I started to read but failed to comprehend a novel called
Class (2014) by Francesco Pacifico in which Williamsburg was regularly referred
to as "Willy." Again, I ask, what would Daniel Fuchs think?

The more of these novels I read, the more Brooklyn seems like a multiply layered
palimpsest -- one culture imposed upon another, generation after generation. 
My own Flatbush neighborhood, now upgraded to "Kensington," was farmland right
through to the end of the 19th century, then a suburb for prosperous old
Protestant families, next a haven for Irish, Italian and Jewish immigrants and
now an ethnic stew of Hasids, Turks, Arabs, Russians, and South and Central
Americans of all kinds but also with an strong admixture of Tangled Vine dinks,
yuppies and midWestern computer geeks. It's a complex piece of urban Americana
-- one facet of which is well-illustrated by the story of unhappy Nathaniel P.

Title: Two Very Fine Brooklyn Novels
Date: March 01, 2022

I liked Paul Auster's The Brooklyn Follies (2006) so much that I read it
twice. It was even better the second time. Even though it begins scary ("I
was looking for a quiet place to die. Someone recommended Brooklyn..."), it's
a cheerful and warm-hearted novel. Auster's gift is to make barely credible
events seem commonplace and normal. So Follies packs in a mute nine-year-old
girl who journeys many miles to find her uncle, and then a forger of paintings,
a noir-y blackmail scheme, a wacky pseudo-Christian religious cult, a Jamaican
transvestite who mouths "Can't Help Loving that Man" at a sad funeral, and so
on.

The Brooklyn Follies is a comedy not because it labors at one-liners but because
everyone who should get married or at least find a mate, manages to do so by the
last page. Plus it's rich in Park Slope locations and lore.

I also enjoyed Colm Toibin's Brooklyn (2009), which is another version of
the immigration novel. It's set back in the 1950s but the 50s might as well
be the '20s as far as oppressive social customs are concerned. Although the
central figure, Eilis, travels to Brooklyn, she never quite frees herself from
provincial Ireland or the interventions of transatlantic priest Father Flood.
Young, inexperienced, she falls hard for a boy of Italian extraction -- and her
doing so turns out to be more of a problem that it needs to be. Eilis must make
some important, life-determining decisions, but whether she makes the right
choices is left to the reader to decide (I myself think she loses her bearings).
It's a lovely, understated, carefully wrought and admirable novel.

Title: On the Mall
Date: March 04, 2022

On our prosperous Boulder Mall, where all the men are handsome, all the women
are good-looking, and all the mendicants take Venmo, there are 44 separate and
distinct signs that declare, No Pets. Such clear instructions do not inhibit our
infatuated dog owners, who can't bring themselves to believe that the injunction
applies to their particular o-so-lovable canine. They cannot fathom that not
every recreational mall-walker is in love with Bowser. As a result, the No Pets
law is widely and defiantly flouted.

There's a second mall rule: no amplified music. Acoustic guitars, string
quartets, bluegrass bands, accordionists, and singers are all allowed and
encouraged. But every once in a while, some itinerant assembles an appallingly
large apparatus on our otherwise peaceful Mall and produces sounds that can be
heard for half a mile. Rude, ear-shattering noises.

Canines and amplifiers are everyday commonplace violations. But yesterday,
walking on the mall, we observed a remarkable and unprecedented novelty. Along
comes a nondescript scruffy guy walking an oversized nondescript dog, and lo and
behold, onto the beast is strapped a boombox. Honest to Pete, I'm not making
this up! The attached mechanism is a powerful one and it generates an extremely
loud noise. Unidentifiable sounds, possibly though not certainly some sort of
music.

A woofer with a woofer, so to speak.

The man and his faithful friend proceed shamelessly along the mall, bass notes
vibrating the shop windows and oscillating my pancreas.

I was floored, frankly. One dog, one amplifier; two concurrent violations.

And then I watched in amazement as the big ol' dog dropped a big ol' deuce. A
double deuce, actually. Two long brown glistening, smoking turds. Lurking right
there on the bricks, preparing to ambush the pretty white shoes of the next
three-year-old princess-in-a-pink-tutu to come tripping by.

In our town, it's the inviolable custom that every dog owner carries a plastic
bag and politely disposes of his pet's droppings. Not this guy. He just kept
on walking, pretending that he didn't know what was going on at the end of his
leash -- which was, as a I have said, 1) a pooch, 2) an attached amplifier, and
3) pooch poop. A jackpot -- a perfect trifecta.

Do I have a theory to account for such contemptible misbehavior?  Well, I've
been thinking and mulling and contemplating, and I'm aware of the talk of the
breakdown of civil society, but all I can come up with is this: some people are
royal jerks.

Title: Yet Another Brooklyn Novel: Jean Kwok, Girl in Translation (2010)
Date: March 08, 2022

Girl in Translation is the story of a young, impoverished immigrant from Hong
Kong. I may be wrong, but it reads as if it were less a novel than a barely
fictionalized autobiography (Jean Kwok, the author, made her way from an
unheated tenement to Harvard; Kimberley Chang, the central figure, escaped
to Yale.) Mutatis mutandis, and all that. It's a familiar kind of work:
a bildungsroman, of course, but also an immigrant novel, a coming-of-age
adventure, and thanks to an inartistic tacked-on ending, an H. Alger rags-to-
riches saga. Sometimes I felt that I was reading a century-later re-imagining of
A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, things Irish replaced with things Chinese -- except
that there is not a single tree in this novel's bleak landscape, not even a
symbolic one. Plus ca change, plus de meme chose.

While it's not original or innovative, nor written with any particular flair,
Girl in Translation is nevertheless valuable for the world it opens up to us.
Plus it's on the whole uplifting, even if there are some unfortunate moments in
which "triumphant" shades over into "triumphalist."

There's not much to admire about the Brooklyn of this novel; it's an unpleasant
place. Manhattan's Chinatown, where much of the action takes place, is no
better.

Title: Sid Luckman's Cortelyou Road Childhood Home
Date: March 11, 2022

Of course everyone knew that Sid Luckman was from Brooklyn and that he had
attended Erasmus Hall High School and Columbia University before becoming one
of the first superstars of the National Football League. To football fans, he
was as renowned a home-town boy as Sandy Koufax was to followers of baseball.
But until I read R.D. Rosen's new biography of Sid, called Tough Luck, I didn't
know that football's first T-formation quarterback was a neighborhood guy, and
that his modest childhood home was just four blocks off the route that Stephen
Lewin and I took every morning for four years to EHHS. And that his house was
just around the corner from the Sears department store where I spent the summer
of 1957 pulling down $1.25 large an hour.

The above is a modern picture, drawn from googlemaps. I suspect that the house
is not much changed from the way it appeared in the 1930s but that the bars on
the windows and front door are later additions. According to Zillow, the House
of Sid is 1664 sq. ft. and is now priced at c. $750,000. I'd bet $2500 was the
number in the 1930s, when the Luckman family was in residence.

Shouldn't there be a bronze plaque on the property?

It's a measure of the chanciness of the old neighborhood that Sid's father was
convicted and imprisoned for a gangland murder and that he died in Sing Sing.

Title: When Eleanor Roosevelt Visited 539 East 9 Street
Date: March 14, 2022

It should be remembered and recorded that in October of 1960, Eleanor Roosevelt
herself visited the home of my parents --my childhood home (539 East 9 Street in
the Flatbush section of Brooklyn).

I myself missed the occasion, alas. I was then living in Massachusetts,
undergoing the first disorienting days of graduate school. But I know the story.

During the 1960 presidential campaign (John F. Kennedy versus "Tricky Dick"
Nixon), JFK's Catholicism emerged as a divisive issue. It's hard to believe what
a fuss was made about his religion, especially nowadays, when no one bothers
themselves that Joseph Biden is not only a Roman Catholic, but a serious one at
that (JFK's personal commitment to his religion was, let's say, nominal).

Among Jewish voters, some of whom had grown up in Brownsville or Williamsburg or
the Lower East side where Jewish-Irish conflict was a fact of life, there was
a great deal of resistance to voting for JFK. And other Jewish voters, harking
back to the old country, remembered Catholics as their antagonists and were hard
put to vote for a candidate of that persuasion.

It fell to the task of Mrs. Roosevelt to persuade these reluctant voters that
they could and should cast a ballot for Kennedy. At the time, there was no one
in America who had more credibility with Jewish populations than she. It was
well known that Mrs. Roosevelt had lobbied her hesitant husband for more lenient
policies toward "displaced" Jews

I don't know how it came about that our living room was chosen as a site for
Mrs. Roosevelt to meet with voters. I suspect that it was through my mother's
extensive contacts with members of the League of Women Voters, an organization
of which she was a stalwart volunteer. I know that my mother assembled 50 or so
voters, almost all Jewish women, and seated or stood them in our very crowded
second floor living room. Mrs. Roosevelt arrived, and as my father said to me
later, she "dragged her ass" up two flights of stairs, spoke for 20 minutes,
presumably in that upper-class nasal twang for which she was famous, answered a
couple of respectful questions, and then limped back down to her car. And went
on to the next venue. And the next. (She was 76 at the time, and not in great
health.) Apparently she followed this same arduous routine for months.

That's how elections are won.

Eleanor Roosevelt died two years later, in 1962.

Title: A Heart-of-Flatbush Novel: Big Man (1966), by Jay Neugeboren
Date: March 30, 2022

Of the many Brooklyn novels that I've read this last while, Big Man, by Jay
Neugeboren, comes closest to home. Neugeboren was newborn in 1938, just a
year before me, and he attended fabled Erasmus Hall High School, most likely
graduating with the class of 1955 (I was '56). It's a mark of my ignorance of
modern American letters that I had no idea that my near-classmate was the author
of 24 books, most of them novels. Big Man was Neugeboren's first novel.

Close to home? Here are couple of sentences that will shiver the nostalgia
timbers of wistful ex-Erasmians.

I walk down Church Avenue, past the Kenmore Theater. Across the street the
old church, used to cut classes and sit in the graveyard....  In front of
Garfields's Cafeteria all the guys hanging out with their broads and their
puffed hair.... Guys with Erasmus jackets on. I keep walking. Past the firehouse
and the Holy Cross schoolyard.

Wow, it's a guided tour of the old neighborhood as it was in the 1950s. Who from
Erasmus hasn't sprawled on the steps of the Dutch Reformed Church?

The novel revolves around the 1951 basketball scandals, which were world-shaking
news at the time. A number of New York City college players (CCNY, St. Johns,
Fordham, LIU) fell into the clutches of shady gamblers and were paid to shave
points.  A few were indicted and convicted. I wrote a few melancholy and
disillusioned paragraphs about the scandals some years ago -- here.

In Big Man, Neugeboren tells the story through the eyes and mouth of a
character named Mack Davis, who had been an upcoming star but is now, because
he missed a couple of baskets, stuck in a dead-end job at an automated carwash.
It's an ambitious conceit and a promising plot. Big Man, I regret to say, is
not a very artistic piece of work, but what the heck! Neugeboren was only 25 or
26 when he wrote it and had had only a few years to recover from uninspiring
Erasmus Hall English classes.

I confess that I was uncomfortable that Neugeboren wrote the novel in a black
voice. I don't object in theory, because there's no earthly reason why a
white novelist can't impersonate a black person, any more than male novelist
can't speak as a female (or vice versa), or a young writer speak in the voice
of an old. So wny was I troubled? I think it was because the voice that the
novelist invented didn't seem genuine. It seemed "literary" -- as though the
Davis character had been heisted out of a  blaxploitation film. Occasional
inadvertent lapses in the dialect were particularly painful to my ever-sensitive
ears.

Big Man reminds me how central basketball was to my adolescent life. I think
if I had spent as much time and effort on my schoolwork as I did practicing my
foul shots I might have been somebody. But I think I learned as much about life
from basketball and its scandals as I did from any other 1950s phenomenon (such
as the antics of "Tailgunner Joe" McCarthy). I'm grateful to Jay Neugeboren for
preserving an important piece of my history and especially for bringing the old
neighborhood right to the forefront.

Title: Senior Romance
Date: April 02, 2022

Young 'uns, I don't know that you entirely grasp the glamor and mystery of
maturity (which in some jaded circles is called "old age.")  Let me tell you,
the golden years are just chockablock full of sensual romance of a kind that you
might not now appreciate.

Just the other day, for example, we were both instructed to make another visit
to the phlebotomist (it seems hardly a month goes by that some specialist or
other doesn't need to inspect a sample of our personal sanguineous fluids).

Being economical people, we scheduled our appointments for the same time, same
place.

Her blood draw was in anticipation of a knee replacement; mine for routine
monitoring of my half-a-dozen annoying senior conditions.

So there we were, side by side, in adjacent cubicles, stripping our sleeves for
the venipuncture.

I ask you, is there anything on earth more romantic than a senior couple
experiencing simultaneous blood draws. Rapture, rapture! Joy and jollity!

In a merrier world, the instant of venipuncture would have been accompanied
with an orchestra of swelling music, perhaps Brahms. And there would have been
candles; next time this happens, we'll surround ourselves with a whole Liberace
of candelabras. Dozens of long stem red roses. Beakers of Veuve Cliquot '42. 
An applauding audience of family and friends.

It would have been even more thrilling if my technician hadn't taken three tries
to hit the mark. "Your vein rolled," she said accusingly, compromising ever so
slightly the transcendent moment.

Title: Henry James, Portrait of a Lady (1963-2022)
Date: April 20, 2022

I read James' Portrait of a Lady in 1963 but never again until last week,
so there has been a hiatus of almost three score years. During the interim,
glaciers have melted, continents have subducted and conventional notions about
what constitutes a "lady" have shifted quite marvelously.

After such an interval, it's not disgraceful for me to confess that I remembered
very little of the novel and that even major plot points came as a shock and
surprise. Moreover, I re-read the novel with a bit of prejudice, because I had
recently learned that Theodore Roosevelt once met James and dismissed him as "a
miserable little snob." Even if I hadn't been alerted by Roosevelt's back-of-
the-hand slap, I would have recognized that Portrait of a Lady generates enough
snobbery to power a nineteenth-century locomotive from Rome to Florence even
while hauling the book's entire cast of frequent travelers. It's a class-ridden
novel in which lesser sophisticates are out-snobbed by superior sophisticates.
Despite this unfortunate failing, Portrait of a Lady is a rather wonderful piece
of writing.

Let me further confess that I brought a second and more deeply-rooted prejudice
to my re-reading. In the early 1960s, when I was a graduate student of "English
and American Language and Literature" at a New England university, Henry James
was at the apex of his critical reputation. He was "the Master." In fact, an
appreciation (or devotion) to James became a sort of ticket of admission to
the coterie of the literary elite. A touchstone. If you (that is, me) were
able to appreciate and adore James's extraordinarily subtle judgements and
discriminations and his sustained and intricate analyses of the velleities
of social interactions, why then, you were one of the elect. But if you were
baffled by his niceties and sometimes could not divine what the heck he was
going on and on about, why then you weren't what James calls in Portrait "a
person of sensibility." And if you weren't a person of sensibility, why in
tarnation were you studying literary history at a university that had been home
to establishment sophisticates since 1636?

Not a James devotee, I managed to slip through the system without the
disgraceful lacunae in my preparation coming to anyone's attention. And until
this past week, I managed to keep my distance from Mr. Henry James.

But I may have made a mistake to have done so. I'd still say that Portrait of a
Lady isn't up there in the stratosphere with Bleak House and Middlemarch, but
it's still a darn good novel. It's not conventionally exciting; in fact, it's
talky and static in the extreme. Nothing much happens. Isabel Archer talks with
Henrietta and HJ analyses the conversation. Then someone goes to Gardencourt and
has a long conversation with Lord Warburton. Then Lord W meets Countess C in
Rome and they talk. Then Madame Merle, who, we are told, was born in Brooklyn
and therefore ought to have known better, has a long conversation with Isabel
Archer. Then someone meets someone else in a museum or a train station or a
restaurant and they have a long conversation -- once again dissected by HJ. Then
they ride the rails to Florence and talk. Meanwhile Ralph Touchett is slowly
dying and will continue die (and talk) for another five hundred pages. These
various conversations are often oblique, with the most important points omitted
or merely implied (to be grasped only by persons of subtlety and sensibility).
It's all so slow that I sometimes felt myself yearning for a good solid knife
fight or at least a lengthy car chase. When Isabel finally tells enigmatic
villainess Madame Merle that she doesn't want to see her ever again, I longed
for her to spit it out with a a good round "fuck off" -- but no such luck.

And yet as mysteries are revealed in the last third of the novel, Portrait
becomes undeniably exciting. Much is familiar; it seems as though James
recapitulates the marriage of Dorothea Brooke and Eddie Casaubon in the
misalliance of Isabel Archer and the "sterile dilettante" Gilbert Osmond. And
also borrows the Pansy plot from the story of Honoria Dedlock. But I came to
these insights, if they are insights, only in retrospect; while reading the
novel, I was surprised and intrigued.

I strongly object to the ending of the novel, which seemed to violate the
trajectory of the plot. Surely Isabel has earned her freedom. To me, her
continued bondage to propriety seems cruel to both the character and also to
hopeful (but deceived) readers. Wicked, in fact, to the point of sadism. No
doubt the conclusion tests a reader's sophistication, and no doubt if I read the
voluminous commentary that the novel has engendered, the apparent cruelty of the
conclusion would be be explained and justified. But I won't read the commentary.
I'm obviously not a "person of sensibility" and I prefer to remain unimproved,
unenlightened, and pissed.

Title: A Brooklyn Memoir
Date: April 23, 2022

I read Imagining Robert, My Brother, Madness, and Survival by Jay Neugeboren for
neighborhood and neighborly reasons. Its author is a 1955 graduate of fabled
Erasmus Hall High School (I was class of 1956). Much of the story takes place
in the area of Brooklyn now called Lefferts Gardens. Walkable, or at least
bicyclable, from East 9 Street.

It's a sad tale. Younger brother Robert went seriously off the psychological
rails in his late teen years. Older brother Jay relentlessly chronicles his
brother's lifetime of struggles. It becomes clear that modern medicine does not
offer any remedy or hope to people with Robert's illnesses. The system relies
on  ineffective drugs and ineffective therapies and what amounts to involuntary
imprisonment. It's a painful, discouraging history.

And it's also a good and moving book. Very sincere and very emotional. I confess
to dropping an occasional tear.

And yet I don't know whether it's right to expose a loved one to such public
scrutiny. I myself wouldn't have made that choice. But I empathize with
Neugeboren's tale, inasmuch as I know from personal experience that therapies
for some forms of mental decay are no better now than they were during the
Darkest Ages.

Title: Starokonstantinov
Date: May 05, 2022

Ukraine has been invaded and whole cities have been obliterated by the Putin
dictatorship. It's tragic. Once again, I'm overwhelmingly grateful that my
grandparents chose to pack up and leave the blighted Ukraine. It's a decision
that has looked better and better with each passing year.

My father's family came from a Ukrainian "shtetl" called Starokonstantinov,
or Alt Konstantin ("old Constantine"). As a youth, I overheard but did not
understand conversations in Yiddish about a place that my grandparents called
(phonetically) Xusantine-gebernia, where the X stands for a non-English deep
guttural fricative. Seventy years ago I paid little attention to my eastern
European ancestry. Now I'm fascinated.

Where is Starokonstantinov?  What is a "shtetl?"

I've just read Yohanan Petrovsky-Shtern's new (2014) and highly pertinent
history, The Golden Age Shtetl (an oxymoronic title if there ever was one). Y
P-S defines a shtetl as "an East European market town in private possession of
a Polish magnate, inhabited mostly but not exclusively by Jews, and subject
to Russian bureaucracy." Starokonstantinov, he claims, was a "quintessential
shtetl." "My" ancestral shtetl lies in the western part of Ukraine, about 50
miles south of a line drawn between Lviv and Kyiv. Nowadays, it has a population
of about 30,000 souls.

I know that my grandfather's people lived in Starokonstantinov from the middle
of the nineteenth century, but I have no idea when they first arrived -- it
might have been years or centuries before. The town itself is not an ancient
foundation. It enters history only in the late 16th century when a Polish noble
named Konstanty Ostrogski built himself a castle (which still survives) and took
ownership of the surrounding area. Starokonstantinov was a "private town" --
meaning that it was owned by the Ostrogski family for several hundred years. In
its first years, Starokonstantinov was included in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.
In 1569 it became part of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. In 1793, and for
many years, even after my ancestors had struck out for the new world, it was
a possession of the Russian Empire. Now it's in the independent Ukraine, and
hoping to remain so.

The history of Starokonstantinov is marked by a series of tragedies prior to
the one now in progress. An early disaster was the Battle of Starokonstantinov
in 1648, which was a key event in the Chmielnicki Massacres of 1648-49. Eastern
rite Cossacks broke into the fortified town and killed all of its 130 Jewish
families and as many Polish Roman Catholics as they could find. During the early
part of the 18th century, the Haidamack massacre of Uman by Cossacks spilled
over into other Ukrainian shtetls, including "mine." And then beginning in 1881
came the series of pogroms -- anti-Jewish peasant riots provoked and tacitly
supported by the Russian officialdom. In Starokonstantinov, there were 6611 Jews
in 1847 and 9212 (61% of the total population) in 1897. (There would have been
two more if my grandparents hadn't seen the light in 1895). During the Nazi
occupation in 1942, virtually all the remaining Jewish population (6731 in 1939)
was murdered. It's a troubled, tragic history.

I'm not sure what it means to say that a town was wholly owned by Polish
nobility. Did the Ostrogskis own all the land, or the land and some of the
buildings? Did they administer the public works? The churches? Did they possess
the surrounding farms?  Did they own, until they were freed in 1861, the
serfs?  Most likely, each shtetl had its own particular form of ownership (the
late medieval world was anything but standardized). Y P-S does not explain;
perhaps he assumes it's common knowledge.

Starokonstantinov occasionally makes an appearance in The Golden Age Shtetl.

I had not realized how active my ancestors might have been in the vodka trade.
"In Starokonstantinov, the possession of Countess Rzewuska, about fifty [Jewish-
owned] inns and taverns yielded 67 percent of the town revenues." (Query:
how and when did the shtetl pass from the Ostrogskis to the Rzewuskis, who
were a very prominent and wealthy Polish family)? As far as I can tell, the
"town revenues" went directly into the hands of the Polish overlords. In 1827,
"Starokonstantinov Jews realized the that their efforts to prevent the draft of
men for twenty to twenty five year terms in the Russian army [had failed], and
the Jewish populace turned against their own kahal elders and attacked their
houses." "Local police had to summon an additional army unit to suppress the
outburst." (The "kahal" was a committee of prominent Jewish citizens who were
the nominal governors [under Polish supervision] of the Jewish population.)
In the first half of the nineteenth century, the divorce rate among Jewish
couples in Starokonstantinov, was 16 percent. In larger cities, it was even
higher (in Letichev it was 47 percent). Y P-S attributes the surprisingly
high rate of failed marriages to the relative freedom of Jewish women and
to the breakdown of traditional constraints as the Jewish population became
increasingly urbanized. A major fire in Starokonstantinov in 1835 hastened the
shtetl's decline. Russian travelers found Starokonstantinov and especially its
roads deplorable. "A Russian army officer observed that Starokonstantinov is
dirty beyond any measure: but 'if we bother ourselves to learn the reasons for
this situation, we would perhaps find out that even the Jews, whom are usually
blamed, have nothing to do with it.... To drive through the streets of the
town is a real challenge, as there is no pavement. Stones once paving the road
have long sunk into the soils. When it is raining, they do nothing but prevent
movement.'" Mud season in Starokonstantinov must have been an annual challenge.
Nevertheless, Starokonstantinovites were readers: a merchant estimated that in
the shtetl there were "about 20,000 books, mostly prayer books, bible and bible
commentaries, tractates on the Talmud and the Kabbalah." Y P-S thinks that this
number must be a great exaggeration. But it's on the record that a merchant
named Pinhas Yosef Bromberg from Starokonstantinov brought twenty Hebrew books
with him while traveling on business to St Petersburg.

My great-grandfather was a participant in the commerce of Starokonstantinov.
According to my father, he was a "factor."  A "faktor" (Yiddish from German)
was essentially a middleman. My ancestor had a horse and a wagon (perhaps, I

Title: Dodge City Nincompoops
Date: May 06, 2022

The rip-roaring conclusion to Dodge City (1939), is marvelously dumb. The bad
guys, led by really nasty villain Jeff Surrett (Bruce Cabot) have jumped out
of the burning railroad car and onto their horses. They are going to make a
getaway, we assume. But for some reason, the six schmegeggees don't ride away
from the railroad tracks. Instead, they continue exactly parallel to the tracks,
allowing Wade Hatton (Errol Flynn) to get out his rifle and pick them off, one
after another.

All that the black hats needed to do was to hang a right and ride off into the
brush, or just rein up, and let the train go by. The train is on a railroad
track.  But no. Not these guys. They keep on riding alongside the train until
they're all shot. End of movie, but not the end to my astonishment. I'm baffled
that the director, Michael Curtiz of all people, allowed such a brainless
ending.

Also: Errol Flynn, with his anachronistic 1930s mustache and condescending
smile, was so goody-goody and upstanding that I felt a strong urge to piss on
his leg.

Title: A "Ditmas Park" Novel
Date: May 09, 2022

From my birth in 1939 until I fled to Ithaca in 1956, I lived on East 9th
Street, in a section of Brooklyn that had no other name than "Flatbush." But
all is flux, as Heraclitus said in a very different context, and now the
undistinguished neighborhood of my youth has been upgraded to pretentious
"Kensington."  Moreover, the adjacent section of Flatbush through which I early
morning shambled to fabled Erasmus Hall H. S., consisting of a large stock of
handsome old Victorian homes, has also been re-christened. It's now "Ditmas
Park."

Ditmas Park is where Emma Straub's novel, Modern Lovers (2016) situates itself.
It is, she claims, "the only neighborhood in New York City that felt like the
suburbs."  A sentence of praise or an instance of wicked irony, one might ask?

Suburb or not, Modern Lovers does not take place in the Flatbush of my youth.
Yes, streets retain their familiar names (Rugby, Argyle, Stratford, Newkirk,
Ocean Avenue). In fact, one of the modern lovers, a fiftyish wife and mother,
works out of a real estate office at the corner of Cortelyou Road and East
16th Street, exactly where old Mr. Hart used to repair the fragile gears of
my three- speed. But all is yuppified. None of the children in this novel go
to PS 217 or PS 139 or Erasmus (in fact, these anchors of my old neighborhood
go unmentioned). Instead, the young 'uns attend expensive "Whitman," an elite
private academy. The young lady who is at the center of the story has both a
'mum" and a "mom" -- a circumstance that no doubt occurred 70 years ago, but no
one would have talked about it, at least openly. It's Flatbush, all right, but
where are the Italians and Irish and the Jews?  A decade ago I toured PS 217
and couldn't help being struck by the "diversity" of the student body -- Turks,
Syrians, Russians, central and south Americans, Asians both east and south, and
of course Afro-Americans. These folks don't appear in Modern Lovers. Nor do
the ubiquitous Hasids. No wonder Emma Straub likes the slice of Brooklyn that
she describes as suburban.  Here's a Brooklyn novel that's more Updyke-y than
Fuchs-y.

Modern Lovers tells a warm, approachable, sound, humorous-to-slightly-satirical
story. It's modern, in the sense that the lovers aren't young and aren't
searching for mates; instead, they're middle-aged and trying to repair troubled
marriages. I don't doubt that Modern Lovers hits some readers' bull's eyes -- 
even if it misses my tired old target. For me, it was a story of considerable
sociological interest -- an instance of how the decades have transmogrified my
Flatbush into hip Ditmas Park.

At the end of the novel, the entrepreurial ladies start a new restaurant, Hot
and Sweet, which bakes perfect apple turnovers and supersedes that old frayed 
Cortelyou Jewish deli.

Title: Wood Words
Date: June 02, 2022

I suspect that I know more about wood than most laymen, partly as a consequence
of Uncle Al owning and operating the sawmill for all those years. And then
there's my own independent enthusiasm for trees: planting and transplanting,
gathering and saving seeds. Nevertheless, The Age of Wood by Roland Ennos
presented amateur me with a truckload of brand new information. It's a book that
re-tells the history of civilization through the use of wood and wood products.
A very good book, well worth the perusal.

Moreover, Ennos introduced me to a number of savory new words -- words that no
doubt I should have known and which are probably known to true woodophiles but
that are novel to me.

For example: the newfangled word anisotropy, which is defined as the property of
a material that displays different traits along different axes, as for example
lumber, which is much easier to split along its grain than across it. Because
wood is anisotropic and so tough sideways, it has many uses that it wouldn't
have had if merely isotropic.

Anisotropy, as a collection of sounds, does not appeal to me as much as some
of Ennos's gritty, oldfangled words. I am happy to make the acquaintance of
the word bodger, which is a wood carver or turner, but specifically a person
who makes chairs out of beechwood. What a wonderful word, though, I confess,
difficult to work into the conversation. Also hard to insinuate into the daily
exchange is futtock, which is a curved piece of timber forming the lower part
of the frame of a wooden ship. Futtock should not be confused with its near-
neighbor puttock, which is a kind of kite, and a word which Shakespeare uses as
an insult. Both futtock and puttock sound vaguely naughty, perhaps because of
their proximity to buttock. I also like strake, which is a continuous band of
hull planking, and which sometimes sports a rove, which is "a groove along the
lower inside edge of each strake." I admit that I had never heard of nacelles,
which are the outer casing of an early wooden aircraft engine. I imagine that
nacelles are as obsolete as wooden airplanes, as is monocque, a type of
construction in which the outer skin carries a major part of the stresses. Who
knew?  I was familiar with the word sheave but I didn't know that it also is
the rotating wheel inside a pulley. A duogong is part of the network of wooden
supports in traditional Chinese wood-frame buildings.

A trullo is a traditional Apulian drystone hut with a conical roof.

Title: Are Baboons "Spirtual'?
Date: September 11, 2022

A friend is intimately acquainted with a primatologist. She (the primatologist)
has spent many a year, almost a lifetime, studying baboons. She has lived with
them and claims to have been accepted as one of the troop. She travels with them
when she can. I'm impressed by her dedication. I wouldn't want to travel for
more than a couple of days with a group of human tourists, let alone energetic
lower primates. My one encounter with baboons, in a  rest area in South Africa,
was unpleasant. The baboons were noisy and aggressive. Sub-Yahoos.

The primatologist told my friend the following  story. She was accompanying
a troop of baboons on a trek from one feeding place to another. They came to
a river that they wanted to cross. They all stopped, sat down on the ground,
waited silently for about thirty minutes. Then they all arose as one and
proceeded to wade across the river.

My friend said, and I quote verbatim, "it was a spiritual moment."

To which I immediately responded, "I don't know exactly what you mean, but I
can tell you that never in a thousand years would I interpret such an event as
'spiritual'."

All of us around the table were polite, so the conversation moved on to more
fruitful topics and did not become contentious.

But later, I thought, what did he (and the primatologist) mean by the word
"spiritual."  And the best that I can come up with, is that they both deduced
that the baboons engaged in some sort of prayer--that they paused to solicit
divine intervention before setting out on a hazardous adventure.

I'm not even slightly sympathetic to that reading. In actual fact, just between
us, I think it's kind of dumb.

I can think of many a reason why a congregation of baboons might assemble
themselves and take a moment. Perhaps they were assessing the flow of the river.
Maybe they were waiting for the current to become less strong. Or perhaps they
were looking at the other bank to see if there were predators hiding in the
underbrush. Or, most likely, they were simply tired and were gathering their
strength.

I think that my friend wanted to believe that baboons are spiritual, because
it follows that if baboons can pray to a higher power, then there's something
natural and universal about belief in a deity, even if it's the Great Baboon in
the Sky. Conversely, I am just as convinced that baboons are smart enough to
look around carefully before taking the plunge. No supererogatory hypothesis
required.

To me, the natural and material explanation is completely obvious -- although I
must admit that the primatologist who offered the spiritual explanation and the
friend who repeated it are both scientists of considerable repute.

Title: Herman Wehmeier; Pitching 1950-2022
Date: September 22, 2022

For three days last month we stayed in a BNB just across the Connecticut River
in New Hampshire. The place is owned (or perhaps only managed) by a family
bearing the surname Wehmeier. It's a rare name, but one not entirely unfamiliar
to me. Like any member of my baseball-obsessed generation, I was immediately
put in mind of the only other Wehmeier who's ever crossed my path. I refer of
course to Herman Wehmeier, of famous memory, the right-handed pitcher who played
fourteen seasons of major league ball, mostly for Cincinnati and the Phillies.
His career, from 1945 to 1958, coincided with the period of my greatest interest
and enthusiasm for baseball -- the years in which I studied Dodger box scores
with an assiduity that I never granted to algebra or Latin.

Herman Wehmeier was a solid pro, but not a Hall of Fame quality pitcher. His
lifetime W-L was 92-108 and his cumulative ERA was 4.80. He made it into the
record books because he led the league in Walks Allowed three times, in Wild
Pitches twice, and in Hit Batsmen and Earned Runs Allowed once apiece.

When looking over his stats, one particular number stands out. Herm started 240
games in his career and pitched an astonishing 79 complete games. He finished
one out of every three games that he started! A remarkable achievement from
the perspective of 2022, is it not?  A new world of "closers," "set-up men,"
"openers" and precipitous yankings.

Among active pitchers, Max Scherzer, who might be my nominee for pitcher of
the decade, has, in 14 seasons so far, pitched just 12 complete games. In his
best year, 2015, he had just 4. Jacob deGrom, who is as talented a pitcher
as baseball can boast, has started 207 games in his career so far, just 4 of
which he has completed. The present leaders in complete games are veterans Adam
Wainwright with 28 and Justin Verlander with 27.

Robin Roberts, one of the best pitchers of Wehmeier's era, once pitched 28
complete games in a row, one of them lasting 17 innings. Lifetime, Roberts
started 609 games and completed 310.

Turkeys, I was recently surprised to learn, come in two distinct species. The
familiar one is the "wild turkey", Meleagris gallopavo, the big bird that in
broods of twenty or so, wanders around my house and garden, eating seeds,
insects, acorns and apples and occasionally leaving behind a fancy feather or
two.

They're new to the neighborhood. Until about twenty years ago, I had not seen a
single turkey; now, they're everywhere. And bold. Or perhaps just indifferent to
me.

And then there's the second kind of North American turkey. It's rare -- found,
nowadays, only in the Yucatan peninsula. It's the "ocellated turkey,"  and it's
one heck of a fancy bird.

Title: Rah-Rah
Date: September 28, 2022

Promenading last Friday on the semi-famous Boulder Mall, we stumbled upon a
Certifiably Big Event.

Ours is a college town where the three major religions are marijuana, massage,
and football. On the evening that precedes a Saturday home game, the Mall is
turned over to a football rally--a gigantic and noisy one. Have any of my
regular readers or stray internet pilgrims ever been to such an event?  It's
quite an echt American experience: the uniformed marching band -- all epaulets
and brass and drums, the perky cheerleaders, a float featuring sports heroes
of yore, the hundred gladiators themselves (all much taller and thicker than
ordinary human beings) along with chants and rousing speeches. Tons of school
spirit and not a shred of irony.

The next day, despite the ginned-up enthusiasm, our team was blown out by UCLA,
45-17.

Rallies are not my kind of event. I'm constitutionally allergic to rah-rah and
for the last couple of decades I've been boycotting football.

Why no more football for me? In truth, football was never my passion. I hardly
ever played the game -- only a little "two-hand touch" in the schoolyard, so
I'm not surrendering much by proscribing a sport that is a danger to everyone's
physical well-being. There are too many dreadful injuries, especially head
injuries. Too many retired players afflicted with dementia. A few days ago,
surfing the channels, I accidentally glanced at a few minutes of a NFL contest.
Even in that brief stretch, a cornerback was badly battered and carried by
stretcher into an on-field ambulance. To me, it looked like it could be a broken
neck. I'm sorry that I paused to watch; it will be along time before I do so
again.

And I've always been resistant to Rah-Rah. Rubs me wrong; always has, right from
the start.

The local mall rally caused me to remember my first days at Cornell, 66 years
ago. I was a most naive freshman (now "freshperson" or "first-year") and had not
a glimmer of an idea about college life -- none of my family or friends ever
having enjoyed such an experience. Completely at sea. My peers in the freshman
dorm insisted, you have to go to the rally. I had no idea what a rally was but
if going to college meant going to rallies, then why not? I knew no better and
tagged along with my new acquaintances. So there it was, just like last night on
the mall. The band, the cheerleaders, the athletes, the rah-rah exhortations.
One after another the speakers (were they coaches?), told us how hard we were
going to cheer tomorrow for dear old Cornell and victory. We sang Cornell songs,
the lyrics to which were handed to us on a mimeographed sheets of paper. It was
far too enthusiastic for me -- too patriotic I guess one might say. I was not
true to my school. How could I love Cornell or think fondly of my alma mater.
I had just arrived, for goodness sake, and hadn't even finished unpacking. The
insisted-upon emotion seemed contrived and artificial and I resented the pseudo-
nostalgia. I don't like being subsumed into a crowd. I respond negatively when
I'm exhorted to cheer or wave or sing. It all seems dangerously close to the
unthinking obedience of nationalist politics.

And then, next day, came the game itself. Dutifully I trudged to Schoellkopf to
watch our guys encounter Princeton. I remember nothing about the contest, not
even who won or lost. But I can still feel the cold September drizzle -- and I
know that I caught a stiff cold. In my four years in Ithaca, it was my first and
only football game.

I soon learned that Cornell had much to offer beyond the rah-rah. It took a year
or so, but eventually I found my people.

Title: Anemoia
Date: October 10, 2022

The premise of Riley Black's The Last Days of the Dinosaurs (New York, 2022)
is a most splendid one. Imagine, she proposes, that it is 66 million years ago
and dinosaurs are the monarchs of the earth. What was it like, in that era, to
be alive in, say, the steamy forests where Wyoming now lies -- a world in which
club-tailed ankylosaurs were tracked by tyrannosaurs while primitive mammals
scuttled in the ferny underbrush. Rich and strange, certainly. And then, how
was it all transformed on "the worst day in the history of the planet" when the
Chicxulub asteroid plowed into the Yucatan? One fine day, the dinosaurs were
triumphant; and then in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, the six-mile-wide
asteroid crash lands and everything goes all kablooey -- the sure and firm-set
earth shakes, the atmosphere turns furnace hot, and acid rain and smoke and fire
and tsunamis snuff out 80 per cent of our planet's animal species.

It's a fabulous idea for a masterpiece of science writing, and consequently
I'm grieved to report that The Last Days of the Dinosaurs is a disappointing
book. It is loose and melodramatic and outrageously padded -- a thirty page
essay turned into a swollen three hundred page opus. It's much too pop; it's
insufficiently serious and therefore leaves poor frustrated me craving data
and detail rather than reiteration. Who could believe that the high drama of
Chicxulub could become quite so tedious? I put the blame on Ms. Black's literary
agent, who, I have no shadow of doubt, advised her to "turn your idea into a
book, and keep it easy -- not too technical -- you'll sell a lot more copies."

What a shame, because Black is well-informed and writes with intermittent flair.
She loves her reptiles, and in particular displays genuine warmth, almost
reverence, for every young person's favorite dinosaur, the tyrannosaurus rex. An
infatuation that lingers from her childhood, I suspect. I myself, not similarly
transfixed, might have supposed that T. Rex had been expelled from the Terrible
Lizard Hall of Fame sometime in the 1990s, when it came to be gospel that
the 60-foot tall monster was not a top-of-the-food-chain predator but merely
a snuffling scavenger. Was it not revealed to us that the creature's meager
brain was dwarfed by its olfactory bulbs, so that it could effortlessly detect
decaying flesh over the unbounded western landscapes? And was it not also agreed
that its puny forelegs were useless for pursuit or attack? Black will have
nothing of such paleontological revisionism. Her T. Rex is a hunter, lurking in
ambush to pounce and to crunch with one powerful bite the enormous protuberant
osteoderms that protected the stegosaurus spine. To me, the idea that a beast
as gigantic as a tyrannosaurus could conceal itself behind bush or boulder and
sneakily lunge at its prey seems totally ludicrous.

Black, bless her kindly heart, firmly embraces the unrevised T. Rex. Her loyalty
is transcendent. In a burst of psychological overkill, she describes her crush
on the dinosaur as an example of anemoia. And what, readers rightly ask, is
anemoia?  It's an unfamiliar word that describes a baffling concept. Upon
investigation,"anemoia" turns out to be a recent coinage, a "fire-new" word
(as WS, in LLL, calls such innovations). It's "a nostalgia for a time one has
never known," such as Black seems to feel about the years and days that preceded
Chicxulub. And here I must once again reveal my want of imagination. Anemoia,
however hard I labor to grasp the idea, is too subtle for my downright brain.
Isn't it the case that "nostalgia" is by definition a cherishing of something
in one's own personal history, as such a one as I might remember with warmth a
concert or a wedding or that long ago glorious day in which I, batting leadoff,
started the game with a triple to right field.

I can't quite fathom a nostalgia for something I've not known in my own person.
The emotion that Black describes I would call simple curiosity. I'm as intrigued
as the next guy about the past and I can certainly summon a yearning to have
been present at some great historical event, but I wouldn't call it anemoia.
For example, I might wish that I had been at Fenway on September 30, 1960, the
day that Ted Williams blasted a home run on his very last time at bat -- but I
wasn't there and it would be a falsehood to claim otherwise. [Full disclosure: I
was in attendance, just behind third base, the previous day, September 29, and
therefore missed the moment by a scant twenty-four hours.] Unlike Black, I'm
not anemoiac about the dinosaur-dominated world of the K-P boundary, but I have
other anemoiac -- as I've now redefined the word -- yearnings.

My most pressing and immediate wish would be to have joined the crowd at a
performance at the Globe Theatre in London, perhaps of Hamlet in 1599 or
Macbeth in 1606. Why? Because even though Shakespeare's works have been studied
microscopically for more than 400 years, no one really knows how those plays
originally looked or sounded. My suspicion is that they were far more foreign,
more strange, less realistic and more primitive than scholars recognize.
After all, the most brilliant play ever written, King Lear, was performed in
daylight and the actors had to project their voices to a crowd of 2000 people,
many of them shuffling about, gossiping, and cracking hazelnuts. No sets, no
curtains, no lighting, and no scenery to speak of. I'd guess that the cast
employed a style of dramaturgy closer to its medieval inheritance of allegorical
representation than we like to admit. Furthermore, I am convinced that if I were
present there at the actual Globe, I would discover an endless series of unknown
unknowns. Unimaginable unknowns, that would knock our anemoiac socks off. The
past is another country; they do things a heck of a lot differently there.

But wait! My dormant anemoia, now aroused, yearns to experience in my own person
other events in the past. Where else to indulge my wants? Certainly in Athens,
at a performance of a play by Sophocles -- which I can guarantee to be a hundred
times stranger than anything London could possibly offer.

But why only the arts?  Now that I think of it, I would love to take a gander
at forested Manhattan Island when Henry Hudson's Half Moon made its first
landfall. I could have talked to the Lenapes; tried to warn them about the
dangers that were coming down the pike. And there's much more. Just prior to
struggling through The Last Days of the Dinosaurs, I read Marie Favereau's
The Horde (2021), a most fascinating history of the Mongol civilization that
conquered and controlled the area from Hungary in the west to Korea in the east
during the 13th century and the first half of the 14th. Favereau's depiction of
the Mongols was novel and disorienting, essentially because I'm accustomed to
think about great empires as centered on a dominant imperial city -- Athens,
Rome, London. I believe that I understand a little of what life might have
been like in Rome; after all, I've read some of the ancient historians and I
know a bit about cities. I've even toured Pompeii, for goodness sake! But the
Mongols did not live in cities; they were not particularly literate, they were
unabashedly polygamous, animist, and almost entirely nomadic. It's a challenge
to imagine a "city" of a hundred thousand people in constant migratory motion.
When Mongol men went to war, which they seemed to do often and always, they
brought along the women and children, the cattle-drawn carts and wagons and
the felt tents along with their horses, goats and sheep. To spend time with a
wandering horde, an entirely unfamiliar form of civilization, and to try to
understand their mental world, would certainly challenge and enlarge my (and
your) conception of what it means to be a human being.

Favereau doesn't dwell on such speculations (she is more concerned with military
history than social or psychological matters) but nevertheless the ways in which
the migrants related to each other and to their environment had to be entirely
foreign to us mostly urban, post Age of Reason moderns. What was it like to be a
Mongol? Perhaps I feel this question personally because a recent examination of
my DNA tells me that I'm 1% Asian by genetic inheritance. I assume, naturally,
that like approximately 16,000,000 other people, I'm directly descended from
Mongol leader Chinggis (formerly Genghiz) Khan through one of his seven wives
or his innumerable concubines. Is it anemoia, a recognition of my kinship to
Grandpa Genghiz, that has produced in me, this morning, such a wildness in the
blood? Or is it the caffeine?

In actual fact, although I'm most curious about Mongol life, I don't think
that I would have made a good nomad. In the first place, I suffer from serious
directional disabilities and would no doubt promptly misplace myself on the vast
and featureless Eurasian steppe; and secondly, I lack enthusiasm for subsisting
on kumis, the fermented mare's milk which was the staple of the Mongol diet.

Let me now admit that while I indulge some pseudo-anemoia for my distant Mongol
forebears, I feel much closer to my more recent Ukrainian shtetl ancestors. If
I could be plopped down in the western Ukraine, I might be able to absorb the
texture of life in Staroconstantinov in 1895, just before brave Isaiah and Eta
set out for America.  As things stand, I know almost nothing of any importance
about the lives of my eastern European ancestors. How did these resilient folks
survive centuries, millennia,  of dearth, disease and pogroms? What did they
eat? Where did they sleep? What, indeed, did they do for "fun," if they had
any conception of fun? What did they read? How did the sexes relate to each
other? How did they find privacy? And most significantly: how seriously did they
embrace that narrow, all-encompassing and demanding religion?

A nineteenth-century shtetl seems impossibly foreign and faraway, but in the
longer time frame, it's actually very recent. The most distant past that we can
readily imagine is when the archeological record begins to appear -- perhaps
five thousand year ago. But my and your fully human ancestors migrated from the
Olduvai Gorge some 60,000 years ago, which leaves approximately 55,000 years
without any data at all -- or at least nothing beyond the merest occasional
trace. For these many millennia our forbears lived in world where there were no
cities, no writing, no pottery, no weaving, no domesticated plants or animals,
no metals, no wheels and therefore no vehicles -- only stone hand axes and
later spears and much later still bows and arrows. Two thousand five hundred
precarious generations of foraging! I would like to see for myself how our
common ancestors managed to survive when the gigantic short-faced bear competed
for the cave and the terrifying European lion lurked in the shadows. I suspect
also that the most dangerous predator our g g g... grandfathers faced was the
tribe next door -- otherwise why would we have inherited such hostility to
people who look or act just slightly differently than ourselves. Wouldn't it be
profoundly anemoiac to join a family of our mutual forebears for a week or two
and participate with them as they went about their lives?

What a treasure-trove of unknown unknowns would we confront!

Title: Nostalgia
Date: October 24, 2022

The word "nostalgia" has a curious history. It was coined in the late 17th
century by attaching Greek άλγος (algos - pain) to νόστος (nostos
-homecoming). Originally, nostalgia carried a strongly negative signification:
"intense homesickness" -- "the depressing symptoms...  that arise in persons
when they are seized with a longing to return to their home and friends." Then,
for reasons that are not on the record, sometime during the first part of the
last century, the meaning of nostalgia shifted and became much more positive.
It's now a good word: "a wistful yearning for the past." A useful word.

Nostalgia is a familiar phenomena that all can recognize: the savoring of a
pleasant memory from earlier in our lives. It seems that nostalgia contains
within it a bias toward or even a falsification of the past. It's implicit in
nostalgia that things were better "back then." For example: I am a member of
a Facebook group called My Flatbush House from Years Ago. Its contributors
routinely idealize their childhoods. Reading their posts, you'd think that
the Flatbush of our youth was if not the the classical Golden Age at least
the Garden of Eden. "I loved my Brooklyn childhood." "I wouldn’t trade my
childhood for anything." "I grew up in the 40s and 50s! We were so lucky to have
known those days." "Much simpler times, more real and human-sized." "There was
no fear, everybody felt safe; we played out in the streets, unsupervised, until
it was suppertime." "We walked to and from school in every weather." "Going out
meant playing games in the street." "I feel so blessed to have lived such a
wonderful free life." "The fragrance of roses was everywhere in July (why don't
roses have perfume anymore?)"

"Ou sont les neiges d'antan?"  "Those were the days, my friend,/ We thought
they'd never end." "Rocky Top you'll always be/ Home sweet home to me."

Of course I also remember the good times, but I can't embrace such unalloyed,
uncritical celebrations. Yes, I can savor some pleasant moments in my seventy-
years-ago life. But I also recall that the 1950s was the era of "juvenile
delinquents" and gang wars, back alley abortions, ethnic strife, "broken homes,"
heroin, segregation, overcrowded chaotic schools, imminent nuclear holocaust
and "take cover" drills, McCarthyism, polio, the Korean War, Stalin, and Walter
O'Malley.

It's fascinating that the English language does not have a word for an antonym
of nostalgia. One of my sources suggests "cynicism." But I'm not a cynic;  I'm
an intermittent and realistic anti-nostalgist.

And why, when I lie insomniac (as is my too-frequent custom), do I not savor the
odor of those ever-perfumed Coney Island Avenue hybrid tea roses but instead am
tormented by nightmares of fear, humiliation, awkwardness, embarrassment and
loneliness. My childhood was pretty good one, thanks to my attentive parents. So
why do I obsess about the bad times? Have I gone full curmudgeon? Or am I simply
more honest than my cohort of Flatbush contemporaries?

In The Second Part of Henry the Fourth, Shakespeare explores nostalgia and its
opposite. Two old guys, Shallow and Silence, reminisce.

SHALLOW: I was once of Clement's Inn, where I think they will talk of mad hallow
Syet.

SILENCE: You were called 'lusty Shallow" then, cousin...

SHALLOW: On that very same day did I fight with on Samson Stockfish, a
fruiterer, behind Gray's Inn. Jesu, jesu, the mad days that I have spent. And to
see how many of my old acquaintance are now dead.

SILENCE:  We shall all follow, cousin...

SHALLOW:  Death is certain. Is old Double of your town living yet?

SILENCE: Dead, sir.

SHALLOW: Jesu, jesu, dead. He drew a good bow; and dead. He shot a fine
shot...  And is Jane Nightwork alive?...  Nay, she must be old; she cannot
choose but be old; certain she's old, and had Robin Nightwork by old Nightwork
before I came to Clement's Inn.

SILENCE:  That's fifty-five years since.

And then comes the correction, the anti-nostalgist.

FALSTAFF:  Lord, lord, how subject we old men are to this vice of lying. This
same starved justice hath done nothing but prate to me of the wildness of his
youth, and the feats he hath done about Turnbull Street;  and every third word
a lie.... He was the very genius of famine, yet lecherous as a monkey,... And
now is this vice's dagger become a squire and talks as familiarly of John o'
Gaunt as if he had been sworn brother to him, and I'll be sworn he never saw him
but once in the tilt-yard, and then he burst his head for crowding among the
marshal's men.

And on and on, at great amusing length.

Shallow and Silence indulge their nostalgia;  Falstaff sees thing differently,
but whether he is a realist, a cynic or a curmudgeon is open to interpretation.

Title: Where My Grandchildren Play Soccer
Date: October 25, 2022

Stunning, is it not? Just at the west side of our fair city, set against
the first manifestations of the Front Range. Six well-tended fields, scores
of players and many, many parents and grandparents (among them me, on sunny
Saturday mornings). I can't imagine a more idyllic and peaceful scene.

Do Luke and Caleb and Asher appreciate the glory of their situation? Why should
they, after all? It's what they've always known; they take it for granted that
soccer should be played in such lovely and prosperous surroundings. Later on,
they'll come to know more about the circumstances of less fortunate people.

It's hard for me not to compare Foothills Community Park with the P S 217
schoolyard of my own childhood. Ours was a representative "playground," no
better or worse than would be found in any other middle-class or working class
neighborhood. No grass, just solid concrete from one chain-link fence to the
other. It was where we ran races, played "two-hand touch," flipped baseball
cards, played punchball, stickball, basketball, softball, boxball, box baseball,
handball, and any other game that could be improvised with a pink spaldeen.
There were, as I remember, four basketball backboards and rims, arranged as two
full courts. But one of the backboards was missing, the pole having disappeared
many years ago and never replaced. Another of the poles had been set in the
ground at an angle of perhaps 80 degrees and never corrected. It was useless.
And then the two other baskets, on the Newkirk Avenue side, were set in ground
that was not level, so that the basket was 9' 6" or so if you shot from the left
side and 10" 6" on the right. Maybe this was a benefit; it helped us master
trigonometry.

The P S 217 schoolyard was crowded. Various sports overlapped and shared the
fields. If you were playing basketball, you had to watch out for line drives off
the bat of one of the softball players. This taught us to be alert.

I did not feel at all deprived or "underprivileged" -- it was life as I knew it
-- but I'm mighty glad that my grandchildren enjoy the luxury of grass and space
and peace. In the words of the great Sophie Tucker, "I've been rich and I've
been poor, and, believe me, rich is better."

Title: Amnesia on Film:  The Majestic (2001)
Date: November 02, 2022

Alas and alack, I've now known far too many folks who have endured serious
memory problems. As a consequence, I seem to have developed an interest in
amnesia not only in real life but also in fiction and film. There are many
many books on the subject and Wiki offers an astonishing list of 234 Hollywood
amnesia films -- some of which, judging by their titles, do not appeal to my
mature taste and which I promise never to view -- including such not doubt
remarkable productions such as Raft of the Dead, Zebraman 2: Attack on Zebra
City, and A Shaun the Sheep Movie: Farmageddon.

I sometimes imagine that there are fewer actual cases of loss of memory than
there are films on the subject.

Literary amnesia is a recent obsession; while the ancients had their Lethe, the
river of forgetfulness, I can't recall amnesiacs wandering lost around Athens or
Rome. Shakespeare never wrote an amnesia play, though at one point Lear, who's
had a rough go of it, asks "Who is it that can tell me who I am?"

I suppose that we moderns put amnesia front and center because we are concerned
with the integrity and the continuity of the self. Loss of memory threatens us;
no memory, no identity. But let us not forget that amnesia is a cheap and easy
all-purpose convenient and superficial no sweat plot device. The formula: loss
of memory = mystery; restoration of memory =  anagnorisis. Very little thinking
required.

The Majestic is an eccentric unsatisfying fairy tale that provides the usual car
crashes but also lost love, the FBI, HUAC, and an art deco movie theater -- all
in the Capraesque context of small-town standards versus big-city corruption.
Pete Appleton, played by an uncharacteristically subdued and expressionless Jim
Carrey, falls into what is depicted as a total global amnesia. He lacks the
least glimmer of his past life. In "real life," any human forced to cope with
such an experience would suffer from anxiety, shock, disorientation, fear, and
worry -- but not so in this slice of hollywoodiana. Amnesiac Pete is calm and
patient, because he is rooted not in our communal vale of woe but in a movie
tradition where amnesia is ordinary and effortless. Don't worry, folks, he'll
recover his memory by the last reel. No big deal. And he does.

Once again, amnesia is a disease like none other.

Title: World's Ugliest Building
Date: November 04, 2022

The world's ugliest building, or at minimum a top competitor for the title, is
located just a block or so down the street from our present abode. Too damn
close, in fact, because it broadcasts its miasma of aesthetic gloom directly at
me. It's a large ungainly brick cube -- windowless, characterless, featureless,
probably designed by an untalented deadwood kind of guy who drew his inspiration
from a childhood of toying with Legos. "A doctor can bury his mistakes", said
Frank Lloyd Wright many years ago, "but an architect can only advise his clients
to plant vines." Vines is what this shameless structure needs -- thick ropes of
kudzu and lianas, whole Jurassic jungles of them -- but no such luck.

It's a CenturyLink building nowadays, but for what purpose it was originally
created is unknown to me. CenturyLink is an "internet provider." No doubt its
insides are more beautiful than its outside. How strange! Magnificent images and
lovely turns of phrase, unknown and invisible to its neighbors, portal in and
portal out!

I can't get a good picture of the entire building, but, please, take a good luck
at this street-side ornament:

Title: Obits
Date: November 13, 2022

Like many of my peers, I've lately taken to reading the obituaries. When I was
a youthful fellow, I took pleasure in announcements of births and weddings and
anniversaries. No longer, alas; nowadays it's nothing but deaths. Reading about
the departed is not a habit of which I'm particularly proud. It's an unsavory
fixation upon the newly dead -- and is slightly ghoulish to boot. Yet daily
checking of the obits is not without a positive side: often it's exhilarating
to read about those amazing folks who have survived wars, dictatorships,
displacement, injury, and disease to live accomplished and joyful lives.
Obituaries are confusing.

It's not that I search out the obits -- they intrude upon me willy-nilly, like
it or not.

For one, there's the New York Times which every day memorializes a couple
or a dozen famous persons -- some of them people of my exact age cohort --
who have made a mark, for good or ill, in this our shared life. How does one
properly respond to such departures?  With empathy, certainly. But also, not
infrequently, with a touch of reluctant (and embarrassing) survivor-superiority.

I must admit that I'm frequently dazzled by these eminent people's list of
accomplishments, even if I haven't the least clue about exactly what they have
achieved. My own life has been, it would seem, so dominated by hearth and home,
so narrow and provincial that I cannot always appreciate the eulogized. Often
they have distinguished themselves in areas of expertise that have completely
passed me by: computer technologists who have created portals and platforms that
will always lie beyond my ken, physicists who have shed light (incomprehensible
to me) on dark mysteries, superstar rappers, mvp's in sports that I didn't know
existed, billionaire entrepreneurs with their 35,000 sq. ft. homes and their
stupendous megayachts, generals and spies, etc., etc., etc. It's astonishing how
little these famous folk have touched me; how little overlap there is between
their worlds and mine. Clearly, I've inhabited an impermeable bubble.

If so, why do I care, why do I read their obits, why do I bother to applaud or
(secretly and guiltily) pooh-pooh their contributions?

But hey, I can't blame it all on the Times. Every second month, I receive
an e-mail notice from the college that I attended, back there in the 50s,
that lists the recent deaths of my classmates. Only a few years ago, it was
a trickle, now it's a flood. While nothing forces me to open the electronic
envelope, nevertheless, I do so, "attracted" as David Copperfield once said
about Uriah Heep, "in very repulsion." Nor must I read the obituaries of members
of the graduate school through which I slipped, barely noticed, sixty-years ago.
Do I remember these people? Rarely, even despite occasional parallels in our
careers. In addition, I follow the obituaries in the local Daily Camera. People
I know, or, given my fifty-year residence in this fair city, those to whom I am
connected by a couple or three degrees of separation. Sometimes I am shocked
by the death of a person whom I hadn't heard was ill, or who died suddenly in
a bicycle crash or a fall from a step stool. Such revelations deeply disturb
a Sunday morning. And yet, is it so horribly wrong for me to congratulate
myself that it was not I but that other guy who was mowed down by a speeding
truck on Canyon Boulevard? (I had just crossed at that same spot a day before,
uneventfully. Luck of the draw!)

Does it matter that the obits that I read are not truly representative of
my contemporaries? They are accounts of people who have made something of
themselves, lived useful and noteworthy lives. I can't help thinking about the
others: the ones who slunk off the planet quietly -- those who were drunkards or
druggies, or who were seduced by some weird religious cult and disappeared into
the desert, or those who gave up the struggle and took their own lives, or those
who retreated. along with their six scrawny cats, to a dirty SRO on the upper
West Side (except when they venture to the street to harangue passers-by with
their idiosyncratic religious theories).

Even the obits that do come to my notice don't tell the whole story. They're
curricula vitae that 99% of the time are entirely laudatory. The ancient tag
"de mortuis nihil nisi bonum" is rigorously honored. The notices don't state
what everyone knows -- that the dearly departed was a notorious skinflint
who squeezed the last nickel from his tenants and his employees, stiffed his
partners, and regularly harassed his former friends with nuisance suits. They
fail to mention that an apparently upstanding citizen was also a neglectful
father who eventually ran off with his peroxided mistress and a Harley, or that
he was known to the neighbors as the guy who poisoned the Labrador retriever of
that nice elderly couple down the street. Or who was fired because he showed up
plastered once too often. Sometimes it's what's left out that's most revelatory.
Obits should be read with care; I don't always remember to do so.

But to tell truth it's not the obituaries themselves that bother me --it's my
own ambivalence and confusion. Why the fascination with obits? Is it the same
impulse that causes commuters to stop and stare at the wreck on the highway?
Could it be that I enjoy, genuinely enjoy, reading about the deaths of my fellow
creatures? And if I do so, what sort of morally defective person am I?  Do I
suffer from an incurable case of schadenfreude -- a delight in the misfortunes
of others? Or is it even worse -- mere undiluted gloating? For truly, I am
forced to admit, there is something almost triumphant about reading an obit.
"He's dead, but I'm alive." How pathetic and reprehensible a feeling -- and
how transitory!  When I am in a generous mood, I know that when I read an
obituary, I daren't gloat, but should rather mourn the common fate of all of us
poor fragile mortals. "Death is certain, sayeth the Psalmist." "No man is an
island entire of himself." Although I might gloat today, tomorrow I too will
be as dead as a doornail. Another bucket, mine, will be kicked. And yet I do
not always experience the fellow-feeling that I would like to admire in myself.
If I'm not a bad person, I'm certainly not always a good one. No question but
there's a chasm between what I feel and what I am convinced that I should feel.

Some obituaries present special problems. For example, I am immediately put
off when the the obituary begins with the foolish new age euphemism, "he
transitioned.... "  Such a phrase hardens my heart, I'm sorry to admit. Let's
face it; he didn't "transition." He died. But I'm equally saddened by the
obituary that announces that "he went to live with the Lord." Such pathetic
self-deception.

But the hardest moral problem for me occurs when I come upon the obituary of a
person I genuinely disliked. There aren't many of them; I'm not a hater. But
still, it's very difficult for me to find genuine empathy for someone I truly
loathed. It's wrong for me to rub my hands in triumphant glee because that nasty
s. o. b. is gone forever? I would prefer not to be the kind of person who dances
on graves.

Title: My Suicides
Date: November 20, 2022

I seem to have plowed a path of destruction, suicide-wise, in my earlier years.

In 1958, I studied "intermediate algebra" with a cheerful, well-regarded
teacher named Ruth B. White. One Monday morning, she wrote her new name on the
blackboard; she was no longer Mrs. White; she was now Mrs. White-Green. Her
supportive students, I remember, applauded enthusiastically. But just as the
semester ended and we pupils moved on to trigonometry, newlywed Mrs. White-
Green, sadly and incomprehensibly, took her own life. What a shock and puzzle
for a gawky innocent Flatbush "yoot." Why, I asked myself, should re-marriage
lead so suddenly to suicide (if indeed the two events were at all related)? To
me, this tragic occurrence was an early indication that human psychology was a
heck of a lot more mysterious than cocooned me had imagined. And then, a few
years later, in the spring semester of my second year in college, I enrolled
for a course in medieval history with the very distinguished Professor Theodore
Maroon. Just a few months after the class concluded, Professor Maroon destroyed
himself. Moreover, the very next year, I surveyed early American literature in
a course taught by Professor Stephen Emerson Black, who, the following summer,
attached a hose to the car exhaust, shut the garage doors, and put an end to his
existence.

I need to reassure myself that it was only a few, not all, of my many teachers
who pulled the trigger after trying to educate me. Nevertheless, something of
a pattern emerged. The trajectory continued in 1960, when, two months after he
officiated at our wedding, cigar-chomping Rabbi Herschel Gray walked into Lake
Yahnundasis in order to drown himself. Why? I had nary a clue; still don't, in
fact.

Several other people with whom I've crossed paths have also chosen to leave life
behind. I remember dour Alfredo Naranja, a college acquaintance from Costa Rica
or perhaps Panama. He graduated from Cornell, returned home, and immediately
shot himself. I also remember handsome fair-haired Stanley Brown. He was a
classmate at EHHS; the two of us studied four years of Latin in the same half-
empty schoolrooms. He was not a close friend, though I clearly recall that we
occasionally trudged home from school together. Stanley went on to Columbia,
where, I was later informed, he graduated first in his class, which is no mean
achievement. I wasn't surprised -- he was smart and extremely serious about
schoolwork. Stanley then proceeded to Harvard Medical School. Cambridge was my
home at that time as well and although our paths had not crossed in four or
five years, Stanley telephoned me "out of the blue," as they say, and engaged
me in conversations that were longer than I wished. I realize now that I was
not as hospitable to him as I might have been. He was lonesome, I think. And
then came the news that he had killed himself. I now wish that I had been more
cordial -- but how was I to know that he was in such mortal pain? The story has
a coda: Stanley's grandparents owned a delicatessen on Ditmas Avenue between
East 7th and East 8th. Some years after the suicide, I stopped in at the store
for a salami sandwich (or something) and encountered the diminutive elderly
storekeepers -- a sad, crushed couple. I knew, or thought I knew, that they were
mourning the death of their promising grandchild. Was it my imagination, or was
my intuition correct?

And then in graduate school there was Arthur Blue. Arthur was a serious poet
and budding scholar. I was a close enough friend that I was invited to his
Episcopal wedding in, I think, Wellesley, Massachusetts, where, for the first
time in my life, ceremonious kneeling was required of me. Arthur and I kept up
an intermittent correspondence after I moved to New York and he to Seattle. I
remember congratulating him on the births of his two daughters. But then one
December, I received an end-of-the-year card from Barbara Scarlet-Blue, which
contained a most memorable sentence: "Of course you have heard of Arthur's
suicide." Well, no, I hadn't. I was later informed that Arthur had turned on
the gas at his summer house on Vachon Island, where he had been on a solitary
vacation. Barbara offered no theory to account for Arthur's act, but now,
fifty years later, I suspect, without evidence, that he had sexual identity
problems with which he could not cope. If so, he would be another casualty of
the commonplace bigotry of that era. Arthur's death is a suicide to which I am
not reconciled, and never will be.

And I must also remember Mary Crimson, wife of famous Shakespearean scholar
Reginald Crimson, who, depressed, slit her wrists in the bath. It was an
absolutely devastating act for Reg and his many friends and admirers.

And then there are the young people, the next generation, who made irreversible
decisions when they were far too young to do so. There's the horrible story of
Carol Pink, a daughter of friends, who jumped off a balcony in Lincoln Towers
in Manhattan and landed, twenty stories below, on the roof of a yellow taxi.
Apparently, she tried to grab her brother and pull him down with her, but
thankfully she did not succeed. And Alice Magenta, daughter of Hill neighbors,
who killed herself in her late teens, a disaster made more excruciating because
her elder half-brother had done the same deed few years before. Their parents
never recovered from the twin losses; but why should they?  Another young
person was twenty-two year old Francesca Crimson, the daughter of a pair of
famous artists and herself a promising photographer; another plunge from the
roof of a tall building. And also, the teen son of my longtime colleague Richard
Purple, who did himself in with drugs, though his religious family chose to
believe, against all the evidence, that it was an accidental overdose.

I respect suicides, even when I don't understand them, because I believe that
everyone has a right to do what they want with their own selves. But I am
saddened beyond ordinary sadness when very young people take their own lives.
If an adolescent or twenty-something boy or girl told me that they had suicidal
thoughts, I would say "almost everyone has a few bad years; almost everyone
is miserable during adolescence. But almost every one of these unhappy beings
turns out to live a productive, useful and essentially happy life. Give it a few
years; don't make a precipitous decision. Hold on; hang tough; trust me, it's
going to get better."

Title: Another Astonishing Feat of Memory
Date: November 27, 2022

I've arrived at the age in which even a momentary lapse of memory is worrisome.
Have I at last begun the ineluctable descent into senility?

But then there's the contrary. When I happen to dredge up some bit of buried
knowledge, I experience a rush of triumph. I feel it as evidence that I've put
off the inevitable for another couple of weeks -- perhaps even months. And I
preen and strut shamelessly. I become unbearable.

At the Phillips, yesterday, we came upon a painting by Giuseppe De Nittis called
"Spring" (there's a pretty poor reproduction of it above). I glanced at the
picture, and in a flash, without hesitation, announced, "that's a trullo in the
left distance."  And I was correct -- my assertion confirmed by the scholarly
description on the accompanying wall plaque.

What is a trullo?  It's a building, obviously, a kind of drystone architecture,
common in Apulia, usually whitewashed and with a conical roof, often constructed
as a temporary shelter for shepherds and other agricultural workers and
occasionally for long term occupancy.

But how does a Flatbush yoot recognize and immediately name a trullo at first
glance?  I could be coy and say something like, "Oh, who doesn't know about
trulli?" and leave my friends baffled and dazzled by my prodigious memory.

But of course that would not be the full story.

Some seven or eight years ago, as turisti, we visited an Italian village called
Alberobello in Apulia in southern Italy. Here's a picture:

Title: What We Read in the 1950s: The Philadelphian (1956)
Date: December 04, 2022

Richard Powell's novel The Philadelphian has not worn well. It was a best-seller
in 1956 and was made into a "blockbuster" film, starring Paul Newman, in 1959.
We watched the movie (called, for some reason, The Young Philadelphians) on TCM
and I was sufficiently intrigued that I ordered up the long-forgotten novel
through our blessedly-efficient Interlibrary Loan. Gosh, what a disappointment!
The Philadelphian is a pot-boiler, I'm afraid, very mid-century. It's got it all
-- three-generations of rags to riches, heroic army service, blighted romance
and cheesy sex, and a contrived climactic courtroom showdown. Powell's prose is
flat, unstylish, at its best "journalistic," but marred by flights of tough-guy
pseudo-Hammettian or Chandleresque prose: "He came slowly downstairs from the
bedroom, with the pulse of blood hammering inside his skull like a rivet gun";
"Her head felt like a boiling tea kettle, and her thoughts kept escaping from
it like steam"; "The applause had been a cheer for the underdog. Later it had
developed that a wolf was romping around in underdog's clothing". Frankly, I'm
surprised that the novel achieved such popularity in the years of my youth.
Sorry to say but it's a trashy piece of writing.

The film is a bit better; more honest and more disciplined, hugely reliant on
Paul Newman's youthful charisma.

Calipash is the "gelatinous greenish material found underneath the upper half
of a turtle's shell." Perhaps this word is well known to turtle-fanciers, but
it's brand new to me. Calipash is "esteemed as a delicacy" but should not be
confused with calipee, which is a fatty gelatinous light-yellow substance
found immediately above the turtle's lower shell. Equally delectable, so say
connoisseurs. Here's a dish of mixed calipash and calipee. I confess that it
does not look delectable to me. Looks repellent, in fact, but each to his own.

Calipash could be served with pilaus, a Kenya spicey rice dish. One might, or
might not, add beeswing to the menu. Beeswing is the "filmy translucent crust"
that grows on port that has been bottle-aged.

Zenana is a word of Persian origin which refers to the part of a large house
reserved exclusively for women; it is therefore equivalent to harem.  Here's a

I would not want to be reincarnated as a turtle. Not at all.

Should it happen that I were to be reincarnated, I would prefer to return as one
of those great sea birds -- the Wandering Albatross or the Great Frigatebird 
or the Northern Fulmar -- that cruise for hundreds of miles over the Pacific
-- soaring effortlessly, joyriding the thermals, blissfully savoring the salt
spray at dawn and dusk. It would be glorious -- although not entirely without
a downside, because if I were such a bird I would have to sustain myself on a
repulsive sushi diet of raw fish. Yeesh.

But to live the next or a subsequent life as a turtle -- what a grim unpleasant
prospect! Turtles do not soar; they're earthbound, and they move so slowly that
they're almost immobile. At very best, they slog or plod. It's not that they're
unsuccessful in their own way; after all, they've been around for 200 million
years. Generations, therefore, have plod, have plod, have plod. But is there a
creature on earth whose bodily configuration is more limiting, more dictatorial?
Turtles spend a lifetime schlepping carapace and plastron up and down hills or

ponderous shell experience any kind of freedom or joy?

Besides, turtles are ridiculously ugly.

Title: Neighborhood Movie Theaters
Date: December 19, 2022

When I was an unadventurous Flatbush "yoot" back there in the 1950s, there
were only two movie theaters that mattered: the Leader and the Kent, both
on Coney Island Avenue, and both within an easy walk. The Leader was closer
to my East 9 Street home and it was there that I spent many a rainy weekend
afternoon ostensibly watching a double feature while sprinting in the aisles,
hurling popcorn at the kids who were down in front, and dodging the "matron."
The Kent was more of an expedition but still less than a quarter of a mile
away. I once saw a show there with my father (Bad Day at Black Rock (1955)],
memorable because it was the only time I ever went to the movies with him -- he
was no frivolous moviegoer. In my childish innocence, I assumed that both the
Leader and the Kent had been in place since time immemorial and that moviegoing
began and ended with these two theaters. They were like mountains and rivers,
permanent features of the landscape (or, rather, cityscape). I was very wrong.
All is flux and movie theaters come and go. According to that most valuable
resource, Cinema Treasures, over 27,000 cinemas in the United States have been
closed or demolished, with many more endangered -- killed in the 1930s by the
Depression and then in my time by the TV and DVDs and discs and streaming and
covid. And also by self-inflicted wounds -- the studios and independents have
failed to produce a regular supply of films for grownups and instead fill the
shopping mall screens with CGI effects and infantile fantasies and "franchises."
Nevertheless, the Kent is still in business, as a small-screen "art" theater,
but the Leader long ago devolved into a bowling alley -- the Leader Lanes.
Later it became a pharmacy. I don't know what has become of it lately; probably
something dreadful.

There's much more to the story than the Leader and the Kent. In my youth, there
was also the Culver Theater, the outside appearance of which I knew very well
but never the interior. The Culver was located at the corner of 18th Avenue and
McDonald, just a block away from the McDonald Avenue branch of the Brooklyn
Public Library, where I shelved books for 75 cents an hour all through my
Erasmus Hall years.

The Culver was adjacent to and almost under the Culver Local, the "El" or
elevated subway, that ran along McDonald (formerly Gravesend) Avenue. ("Elevated
subway", by the way, is one of the most fabulous unappreciated oxymora of
our time). The Culver was a big spacious theatre that sat 1445 people. I
imagine that most of the paying customers had a tough time catching the dialog
when a train rumbled by. I wish I could identify what film was playing when
this picture was snapped, but alas the image is blurred. The styles of the
automobiles suggest a date in the late 1930s. The Culver has long disappeared
and nowadays the most prosperous commercial venture on its former block is the
Tashkent Supermarket.

Then there was the Beverly, located at the intersection of Church Avenue and
East 2 Street, just a few blocks from Erasmus Hall High School at Church and
Flatbush.

On the day of this photo, the Beverly was showing Away All Boats, a 1956 war
drama featuring Jeff Chandler, but as we all know, Jeff was in fact Erasmus
alumnus Ira Grossel. The movie in which he starred was playing just down the way
from his old high school -- a marvelous serendipitous coincidence. The Beverly's
second feature, Raw Edge, was a western with Rory Calhoun and Yvonne DeCarlo.
Did I plunk down my quarter to watch a war movie and a western? It was certainly
the kind of programming that would have attracted my seventeen-year-old self. I
have no recollection of either feature but I am able to bring to mind an image
of young lovely Yvonne DeCarlo. The Beverly operated from 1920 to 1981 and has
since, sadly, been transformed into a T-Mobile showroom.

There was also the Rialto

at the corner of Cortelyou Road and Flatbush Avenue. It was directly on my route
as I walked to Erasmus Hall High School with Steve Lewin five times a week
between 1952 to 1956. It was also a block or two from the Sears, Roebuck store,
where in the summer of 1956, I handed out parking tickets to drivers entering
the Sears lot. Their cars looked a lot like the ones in this picture. Last I
heard, the Rialto had transmogrified into the Cortelyou Road Church of God -- a
sorry fate.

In addition to the theaters that I attended or might have attended in the days
of my youth, there were another bunch that had already shut up shop. The most
prominent was the Newkirk Theater on East 16th Street -- and therefore only
five or six blocks from P S 217. It stood just across from Newkirk Plaza, the
shopping center that also housed an express stop on the BMT line. The Newkirk
started life as the TNF, named after the initials of its trio of builders. It
might have been, originally, a legitimate theater.

In 1928 it reopened as a cinema with a performance My Best Girl with Mary
Pickford (who lived for a while with Doug F. at 1320 Ditmas). It closed in
1940 and has since been demolished. It must have been quite an ornament to the
neighborhood, but I rode my bicycle on that street many times and never detected
the least sign that there had once been a handsome theater there. I wonder
also what became of the grand Robert Morton organ that accompanied the silent
films. Later the Newkirk acquired a proper movie marquee as can be seen in this
fragment of an image.

The Newkirk was gone for good in 1940.

Then there was the Dorchester, a the corner of Dorchester and Coney Island
Avenue. Here's how its building appeared a few years ago:

Title: East Side, West Side (1947)
Date: December 30, 2022

How should a person who is an enthusiast of classic cinema react when he finds
himself loving a film that has been panned, dismissed and ignored for seventy-
five years?

The movie in question is a Manhattan tale called East Side, West Side. It was
released in 1947 when I was a mere eight years and has sunk like a stone. It's
a domestic drama (or soap opera) for two-thirds of the way and then goes full
noir in its last thirty minutes. If East Side, West Side is remembered at all,
it's for squandering big-time talent: actors Barbara Stanwyck, James Mason,
Ava Gardner, Cyd Charisse and Van Heflin; writer Isobel Lennart and director
Mervyn LeRoy. I cannot remember a picture from that era that is studded with
more stars.

In The New York Times, Bosley Crowther, the grand khan of 1940s movie critics,
not only hated the film but was driven by it into a kind of moral uproar. "East
Side, West Side," he wrote, "just about hits the low-water mark of interest,
intelligence and urgency. And certainly nothing accomplished by the writers or
the actors of this film does anything to raise it into an even remotely vital
realm.... Frankly, we thought that films like this one had been put on the dud-
list years ago." Yikes. Even though Crowther almost popped an artery writing his
review, he was not explicit about what so offended him. Let me guess: "films
like this" focus on frank sexual desire and more specifically with adultery and
its consequences.

East Side West Side has rarely drawn much comment, but in 1991, when other
noir-y films of past eras were being re-evaluated and upgraded, this one was
still considered "static" and "lurid, unconvincing and artificially chic...." In
a word, "uninteresting melodrama trash."

And yet the two of us found it engaging and vital and not in any way lurid.

The plot is loaded with familiar post-War II elements. Brandon Bourne (James
Mason) is married to well-to-do Jessie Bourne (Barbara Stanwyck) and has
recently ended a too-public affair with ex-waitress Isabel Lorrison (Ava
Gardner). Isabel left town and Brandon returned to his forgiving wife, but now
the ex-"hash-slinger" is back in town and wants Brandon again. She gets him,
way too easily. Jessie puts up with her husband's shenanigans for a while but
eventually leaves him. Meanwhile, Mark Dwyer (played by the great underrated
actor Van Heflin), who is some sort of spy/journalist/all-around good guy,
returns from Europe and immediately falls in love with Jessie. At this point,
the movie suddenly veers from its domestic track. Isabel is murdered and Brandon
accused of the crime. Dwyer, turned detective, comes to his rescue.

It's an episodic but not unworthy plot. But there's more to the film than this
brief summary. Here on Walnut Street, we fans of TCM appreciated elements of
the film that Bosley Crowther, and many other viewers, had left curiously
unexamined.

ES, WS declares in its title that it's going to explore class tensions and
antagonisms. The well-known formula is that dwellers in the east side of
Manhattan are patrician, rich, and snotty, while the west side is inhabited by
down-to-earth working-class plebeians who are rough but joyful. The film both
elucidates and challenges the cliche. Brandon Bourne epitomizes what would
now be called "upper class privilege." He's rich (probably inherited money),
accustomed to servants and to getting his way. He carries himself as though he
was born in tux and tails. He loves his wife Jessie, he repeatedly claims, but
there's no warmth or snuggling or flirtation between the two of them, which is
the film's way of implying that she's cold and that he's not getting enough at
home. (That's the way things are on the Upper East Side, don't you know?) On the
other hand, there's ex-waitress Isobel Lorrison, who covets East Side wealth and
who is overtly sexual; she's an orgasm waiting to happen. She covets Brandon's
life of ease as much or more than he wants her passion. She has no compunction
about introducing her eager sexuality into the Bourne household, all the better
if it pollutes their establishment complacency and fancy dress.

Even though ES, WS gives us James Mason at his slimiest and Van Heflin at
his must buoyant and likable, it is a film that is dominated by its female
characters. It offers us five-count'em-five strong women, all of whom exhibit
gobs of what has lately come to be called "agency." Jessie (who finds her
strength only in the penultimate scene) and Isabel, of course, but also Rosa
Senta, played by Cyd Charisse, a young woman who makes a very good decision;
Jessie's mother (Gale Sondergaard), who has the best scene in the film, when she
tells Brandon to his face that he's a vain and a fraud; and also Felice Backett,
played by Beverly Michaels, a dame who is "built like the Empire State Building"
and who is not afraid to throw a punch. Some of the best dialog in the film (and
there's a lot of good stuff) is between women who are either the closest friends
or the most bitter antagonists. There is, for example, a striking confrontation
between mistress and wife:

Isabel Lorrison : Sorry I'm not more subtle. But, you must remember, I haven't
had your advantages. When your mother was busy being the Great Lady of the
theater, mine was in a burlesque show on 14th Street. And when your mother sent
you to Miss Cavanaugh's School for nice, young ladies, I was slingin' hash! Oh,
you learned how to pour tea properly and how to cross your legs at the ankles
only - and that plain pumps make you a lady, but, putting bows on them make you
something else. You learned how to make a good marriage. But, like all your
kind, you think by marrying a man, you've done enough. Well, there's one thing
that Miss Cavanaugh forgot to teach you. Something I learned: how to keep a man.
How to keep him wanting you!

Jessie Bourne : My husband doesn't want you. He's finished with you. He told
me so last night.

Isabel Lorrison : I'll call him and he'll come running.

That's classy writing.

The women are not the only vibrant and credible characters. There's also
Bourne himself, who is an exemplar of what would now, decades later, be called
"sexaholism." He wants to be faithful, or at least says he does, but he can't
help himself when Isabel Lorrison/Ava Gardner has a telephone in her hands.
Whether he's ill or just weak and pathetic is left to the audience to decide.

And by the way, the film was written by a woman (Isabel Lennart) who adapted
it from a novel by Marcia Davenport -- a writer well known in her day but long
forgotten. The novel has been out of print for decades, but Interlibrary Loan
has located a copy for me. It's now "in transit' and I'm waiting impatiently for
it to arrive.

Title: Title Your Own Film Noir
Date: January 03, 2023

Here's a game. I've compiled a list of essential "film noir" nouns and
adjectives. Your job is to assemble them into the titles of noir films.

Nouns: city, death, shadow, night, fear, heat, murder, crime, kiss, street, gun,
thief, window, sidewalk, body.  Adjectives:  naked, black, evil, strange,
wrong, lonely, raw, secret, violent, sudden.

Using an adjective and a noun is good: e.g. Dark Shadow, Strange Gun, Violent
Window, Raw Heat.

Three words is better: City of Naked Death, Shadow of Evil Night.

Four words is triumphant: Secret Shadow on Crime Street, Dark Kiss at a Strange
Window.

Beware, though. Some of the combinations you assemble might already have been
used (Body Heat) -- or previously parodied (Naked Gun).

Title: What We Read in the Fifties: East Side, West Side, by Marcia Davenport
Date: January 16, 2023

Two weeks ago, I wrote some admiring remarks  about a little-known post-WWII
film called East Side, West Side. I said then that I was sufficiently impressed
and intrigued by the film that I intended to read the novel upon which it is
based, but that since ES,WS has evaporated into the mists of time, I would have
to wait for Interlibrary Loan to dig up a copy for me. Well, the novel has
arrived, coming haste-post-haste from Laramie, Wyoming, the flyleaf inscribed,
"To Mrs Eccleston, from Anna." Gosh, I'd love to know who Mrs. E and Anna were,
and what they (and Laramie) made of this extremely Manhattan-y book.

East Side, West Side (published in 1947), I can now report, is a big hunking
doorstop of a novel. Not a very good one, I'm afraid. It is prosy, untidy,
and crammed with too many episodes and too many undifferentiated characters.
To transform its meanderings into an economical screenplay required great
intelligence and imagination. All praise to the screenwriter, Brooklyn's own
Isobel Lennart, who condensed characters, eliminated subplots, rationalized
excesses, and to some degree toned down the book's inherent snobbery.

ES,WS can be described as an old-fashioned "woman's novel," and not in a good
way. Its female characters are, almost uniformly passive victims. Plus there's
far too much chat about makeup, dinner parties, and "fittings." There's an old
--very old-- canard that an erotic novel for women consists of 400 pages of
courtship and foreplay  followed by a proposal of marriage. I'm afraid that
ES,WS fits this unfortunate formula. Jessie Bourne, wronged and soon-to-be-
divorced wife, is wooed by gentlemanly General Mark Dwyer but o so slowly. Sex
is teased and deferred for chapter after chapter. In Isobel Lennart's alert and
improved script, women are not afraid to take charge.

There's one episode in the novel that seriously rankled me. There's a murder.
The privileged East Side aristocrats do not turn the guilty party over to the
police; instead, they suppress evidence and suborn perjury in order to keep the
scandal out of the newspapers. They succeed, though their plot couldn't have
deceived the dullest precinct flatfoot. In the film, I'm glad to say, a killer
is brought to justice.

Toward the end of the novel, Marcia Davenport introduces a long embarrassing
digression in which the General, just returned from the European theater,
lectures on the post war situation in Eastern Europe. I'm sorry to say that he
praises Soviet aggression in Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, etc. I suspect that
these tortured apologetics were written before Davenport lived in Prague and was
engaged to marry the Czech foreign minister Jan Masaryk, who in 1948 was thrown
out of a window by agents of the KGB.  I hope that Davenport would have changed
her position after the defenestration.

Title: "Re-Partnering"
Date: January 22, 2023

It's shocking, is it not, that 50% of American marriages end in divorce. "Fifty
per cent" is not just a statistic; it's a reality that stands for tons of
personal distress and suffering and remorse. Alas, the rate of divorce for
second marriages is even higher -- 60%; for third marriages, according to
many sources, as much as 75%. The fact that the percentage rises with age and
experience at first seems counter-intuitive. Shouldn't second and subsequent
marriages be happier, more peaceful?  Don't people learn and improve with
experience?  Should they not know themselves better and therefore choose a
mate more wisely?  Now that they are veterans, shouldn't they have grasped the
art of marriage ? Learned how to solve problems? Learned to make a stronger
and more sensible commitment to each other? After all, they've voluntarily and
optimistically decided to take another crack at marriage. Why not bend every
effort to succeed?

But the numbers don't lie. Many of the people who have been divorced one time,
say sociologists who study marriage and the family, bring negative attitudes
to the next. Instead of assuming that marriage is a lifelong commitment, they
regard it as a flexible arrangement that can be abandoned if things get tough.
They've already survived one or two divorces and are therefore less fazed by the
prospect of another. And inasmuch as the taboo against divorce has already been
shattered, such social inhibitions that remain are the more readily overcome.

There are even simpler explanation for the failure of subsequent marriages:
some people are marriageable by nature and some are marriageable-skittish. The
population of the marriageable-skittish increases as the natively marriageable
leave the pool. Who remains to be married among the population setting out on
second or third marriages? Only those people who are not intrinsically inclined
to prosper in long term relationships. As the pool shrinks to the less and less
marriageable, the percentage of failures inevitably rises.

Divorce and the rates of divorce have been well studied. But what about second
marriages of people who are not divorced but widowed? It's curious that there
seems to be no interest in how widows and widowers (w-ws) fare when they
contract subsequent marriages. Are second marriages of the w-ws more or less
likely to succeed? Apparently, it's not a pressing problem for sociologists. Or
perhaps it's too hard to procure the data. Just who are the remarried (or "re-
partnered") w-ws's? Many "remarried" widows and widowers don't bother to inform
either church or state of their new situation. They may have financial or tax
reasons to avoid scrutiny. They may be separately domiciled. They're not talking
but they're there. Hard to find and hard to study.

My suspicion, drawn from anecdotal evidence and just looking around at people
of my own age cohort, is that the divorce rate among remarried w-ws is very
very low. Why? Well, for one thing, because w-ws are people who are among the
marriageable by nature. They've stayed together, stayed married until death did
them part. Because they succeeded at maintaining a long marriage, they very
likely entered a later marriage expecting to do so again. In addition, w-ws
are likely to be older and weathered. Because they're not scarred by a painful
divorce, they are more likely to be sound of heart rather than wary and wounded.

Re-partnered w-ws have outlived many of the tensions of more youthful marriages.
They're probably not obsessed or consumed by their careers or by worldly
success. For better or worse, their successes and failures have been long
established, long completed. If they're old enough to be retired, they may have
the leisure to talk intimately with one another.

One of the principal causes of divorce, we're told, is tension around child-
rearing, an activity in which philosophical differences between the parents can
cause all kinds of difficulties and tensions and squabbles.  But most w-ws
aren't going to have more children, and the ones that they have are likely to be
grown and gone.

Nor will there going to problems with in-laws, because the in-laws are all dead.

And older w-ws, if they're fortunate, don't have the financial problems of
earlier decades: no sudden unemployment, no need to move to a larger, more
expensive house, no college tuitions. If they're not formally remarried, they
most likely keep their resources separate and therefore don't need to negotiate
about how money is to be spent.

Older folk don't have to deal with contraceptives. While sex is probably less
urgent and imperious than in earlier decades, it might be more consoling,
especially because older partners should have a better grasp of their own
needs and how they might be fulfilled. And they are probably more accepting of
themselves and of their bodies.

It goes almost without saying that w-ws have experienced the deaths of their
previous spouse and therefore share a most important mutual experience. A bond,
a link. An important mutual consolation, one among the many experiences that
older w-ws bring to the table.  They know from living many years on the planet
that various things that seemed important years ago turned out not to matter at
all.

And most important of all: older w-ws have learned over the course of many
decades not only how to love but how to cherish and to respect a wife or
husband.

Title: Automobiles in My Life
Date: January 24, 2023

This will be a very short essay, because automobiles have never been a big part
of my life. Unlike many of my friends, I've never been one to have a romantic
relationship with a vehicle.

My parents did not own an automobile and neither of them ever learned to drive.
I was a most provincial city boy, happy with my bicycle and my subway token and
wanting no more. I did not learn to drive a car until after I was married and
left Brooklyn behind.  Nevertheless, over the course of a lifetime I've owned a
number of cars. The first one was identical to the Nash Rambler depicted in this
stock photo:

The Nash was the car I drove to California and back in the summer of 1963 (the
first time I was west of New York). I've since owned an Oldsmobile '88, a
Renault Dauphine (a dog), an underpowered Dodge station wagon, an uncomfortable
but sturdy Corolla, a Saab, a Camry, and a Volvo that lasted for twenty-one
years and which I only surrendered  because it was hard on my aching back.
I've driven perhaps a hundred other automobiles and an occasional truck, mostly
rented, but I've never felt anything like affection for a single one of them--
they take you from one place to another and I'm grateful for the mobility. I'm a
cautious driver, but I've made some bad mistakes behind the wheel and I am lucky
to have gone through life without being mangled or killed, so far.

I confess that at various times in my life I've experienced the glamor of the
open road. I'm a happy fellow when I'm driving a two-lane at dawn or twilight
in southern Missouri or rural South Dakota. I have a soft spot for Iowa's Jesse
James Cafe and for the Crete Diner in Oneonta, New York. A stop at Grandma's
Cafe in some faded downtown is to me a peak experience, however weak the coffee
or gluey the cherry pie. I treasure those glorious small-town attractions: among
many others, the corn cob palace, Carhenge, the Donna Reed Museum in Denison,
Iowa, the Jell-o Museum, the Purple Martin Tower in Griggsville, Illinois, the
world's largest ball of twine in Cawker, City, Kansas.

I don't drive long distances any more. In fact, in the last twenty years I've
probably spent more time on the John Deere "Lawn Tractor" than in any other
vehicle. Maximum of five miles per hour, my kind of speed. It may not be
glamorous but it gets the job done. I've "buried" the machine a couple of times,
but it's still in one piece and still working.

Title: My Life with Telephones
Date: February 08, 2023

In the course of my lifetime, the telephone has gone from relatively rare
to ubiquitous, from wall to pocket, and from rotary dial to cell. From no
intelligence whatsoever to smart and then to very smart. Revolutionary changes.

When I was growing up in Flatbush, our family was prosperous enough to have a
telephone (not everyone did), but the device was only employed for local calls,
never for "long distance." Non-local calls were prohibitively expensive and were
only for deaths. To be called to the phone by long-distance was ominous.

Before the innovation of seven-digit dialing, we were Windsor 6-2077. Sometime
after WWII, our exchange was altered from WI 6 to GEdney 6. To me, this was an
early indication that the world was unstable and would be filled with ups and
downs. One day we were a Windsor, a royal house, and the next day we were a
Gedney, a brand of dill pickle.

Every telephone in existence looked exactly like this one.  The idea that they
would ever look otherwise was inconceivable.

For a month of so in the late 1950s, I had a job operating an old-fashioned
switchboard at the Sears warehouse on Utica Avenue -- definitely my most
satisfying telephone-related experience, lifetime. Ah that lovely click when the
plug fully entered its receptacle! A delight!  The one I sat at looked almost
exactly like this:

In my short time at the console, I became quite a proficient operator, only
cutting off important calls a handful of times. It's hard to believe that such
an antiquated-looking machine was still in use when I was a lad.

We must also recall the almost extinct telephone booth -- often out of order,
because someone wielded a crowbar to make off with nickels and dimes. And
smelly. Plus, one never had the right change when needing it most.  I do not
mourn the passing of the phone booth.

When we moved to Vermont in 1968, the Topsham Telephone Company had not yet
switched to seven digit dialing. Our home number was high-prestige 21, but we
were jealous of the family whose number was 9. Ours was a four-party line --
also a thing of the past. I wonder whether my grandchildren have ever heard the
phrase "party-line."  Or "rotary dial," for that matter.

When AT&T was deregulated and the market was thrown open to innovation, there
came a great explosion of telephone styles. Phones blossomed into many odd
colors and configurations. For a while, we owned one of these:

The Simpson phone was not my initiative but that of one of the younger members
of the family.

But more change was in the works. The prediction that there would be pocket
phones in the future seemed fantastical science fiction-y.  All phones had to
be connected with wires -- otherwise how could the sound get out of the wall and
into the handset. I scoffed.

Nowadays, everyone carries a cell phone. But it's not just a phone -- it's a
computer. It does everything -- perhaps too much. There is substance to the
frequently heard complaint that some individuals, especially young 'uns, relate
more readily to their cell than to the person sitting next to them. It's a
paradox: with more potential communication comes more loneliness. I myself must
admit that there's a fascination to the cell phone that is disarming.  I'm
trying not be allow myself to be addicted. But there is something wonderful
about a machine that lets you not only speak with but to actually see your
daughter, who is a thousand miles away. Not a trick that a rotary phone could
perform.

Not to be an alarmist or a Luddite, there's a serious downside to the cell.
It seems as though the machine  might be reorganizing youthful brains-- with
unknown consequences,

Scenes like this one have become scarily familiar:

Look up, children, look up! Please look up!

Title: Strangest Dream Yet
Date: February 15, 2023

In this one, I was lying in restless sleep in my own bed, when a figure, a man,
came at me. He tried to get under my covers, and I cried out, "You can't get
into bed with me. I'm a married woman!"  Very theatrical -- and strange enough,
but the details are even more peculiar.  Of course I'm not a woman -- I'm an
octogenarian man -- but not in the dream. Secondly the man who was trying to
attack me, though identifiably male, had the face of a stereotypical witch --
long crooked nose, verrucose almost echinulate skin, etc.  In addition, my
bedmate, who in real life is a woman, was, in the dream, male. That's a heck of
a lot of gender confusion for one dream fragment.

What is most memorable, however, is my plaintive cry -- "you can't get into my
bed.  I'm a married woman."  How to interpret this sentence?  I can invent
any number of bizarre "'Freudian" theories, but in fact I have no idea, except
for the opinion that I've expressed before on this blog, that I'm a mighty dull,
conventional fellow from 7am to 11pm, but from 11pm until morning, I'm crazy
imaginative, unconventional, and possibly even interesting.

Title: Words of my Life:  Hack
Date: February 18, 2023

I cannot think of a word that has undergone greater change during the course of
my lifetime than the plain monosyllable "hack."

"Hack" entered my language, like much of my early vocabulary, through the medium
of baseball. "He took a good hack at that fastball;" "he's up there hacking
away." A hack was a hard swing, not necessarily a successful one. [There was
also Stan Hack, the great Chicago Cub third baseman whose career was just coming
to an end as I was becoming conscious.]  In the days of my youth, "hack" was
also slang for taxicab and a cab driver was a "hackie." I don't believe I've
heard that particular use of the word in decades (except in 1940s movies).
In seventh-grade "shop" class at PS 217, Mr. Kaminsky introduced me to the
"hacksaw." The hack in hacksaw derives from a medieval word meaning "cut into
pieces," but the taxi hack has an entirely dissimilar origin. It comes from
hackney, a breed of horse and later the carriage itself that the horse drew --
the name of which then migrated to our big yellow taxi.

When did I first hear the expression, a "hacking cough"?  And why hacking?
Perhaps because the noise of a cough is similar to the sound of the short sharp
blows when one hacks through a forest or the jungle with a machete. Maybe that's
how it originated-- but I'm not entirely convinced.

Hack has another older meaning -- mediocre or failing, or not good at one's
trade, as in a "hack writer," or a "political hack." This usage is probably a
shortened version of "hackneyed," meaning trite or overused. When you waste
time, you're just "hacking around." In such cases,"hack" denoted incompetence.

Nowadays "hack" has come up in the world. To hack into a computer implies not
laziness but skill. In this usage, "hack" is also malicious. Hackers may be
smart but they're also dangerous; they can cause crashes when they illegally
intrude to alter a program.

The most common contemporary use of "hack," if I'm reading the data correctly,
occurs in the recent coinage "lifehack," which is defined as "a strategy or
technique adopted in order to manage one's time and daily activities in a
more efficient way." I can't be the only person whose junk mail folder is
regularly inundated with recommended lifehacks, most of which seem mighty silly
or simplistic.

And then there's an even more specialized use. Here's one that's new to me:
"scientists announced that they had genetically hacked tobacco plants to
photosynthesize more efficiently." This usage seems to retain something of the
older meaning of cut or slash although it is a stretch to envision a genome
being attacked by a sword or a snickersnee.

Goodness gracious, it's a long road from waving at an inshoot with the old
hickory to inserting bits of DNA in the tobacco genome. But here we are.

Title: Is Safety an Illusion?
Date: March 01, 2023

Am I just plain nuts to think that I live in a safe and secure world? All the
evidence says "perpetual vigilance" and "it can happen here" and "keep a close
watch?

Let's look at the situation.

Our state has a violent history. In the far past: at Sand Creek in 1864, several
hundred Cheyenne and Arapahos were brutally murdered. In 1914, a century or so
ago, the Pinkertons, employed by the Rockefellers, killed no-one-knows-how-many
miners when they shot randomly into the Ludlow tent colony.

More recently, killing has become the work not of army or paid professionals but
of heavily armed civilians. In 1999 there was the horrible Columbine High School
massacre in which twelve were killed and twenty-one wounded. Just thirteen years
later came the mass killing inside a Century 16 theater in Aurora, just a few
miles south of where I live, in which twelve people were killed and another
seventy injured. Then in 2015 there was a shooting at a Planned Parenthood
clinic in which three were assassinated and nine others wounded. In March of
2021, just two years ago, in the Table Mesa King Soopers, a "gunman" killed ten
-- customers, employees, a police officer. And last year, we had the nightclub
shooting in Colorado Springs where five were murdered and twenty-five others
wounded.

I didn't happen to be in any of these places, but I might have been. Although
I wasn't at the Columbine school, I was at that very moment in a different
classroom in Denver; I didn't go to the movies to see the Dark Knight, but
I do go to theaters. It wasn't "my" King Soopers that was terrorized, but
nevertheless I've bought stuff at that very store many times when I've happened
to be in south Boulder; I wasn't at the Colorado Springs bar but I've certainly
patronized bars. In any one of these cases, It could just as easily have been me
that was shot dead or maimed. I've been one lucky fellow, but people much like
me have not been so fortunate.

Two days ago, a vicious prank phone call set off a scramble and shelter-in-place
warnings at two-block away Boulder High School. BHS is where AGP and our three
children spent many a year. This scare turned out to be a case of "swatting" --
a disgusting new practice in which a nasty sociopath calls an institution to see
if he can get a reaction from a SWAT team. Deliberate malice. Such false alarms
are not mass killings, but they're still hair-raising, anxiety-provoking, and
potentially dangerous events.

It's coming close to home, isn't it. Luck of the draw, so to speak, that I'm
still whole.

When I was a teacher, I was never in real danger but, like everyone else on the
faculty, I had a few deranged students. I remember once that a particularly
odd young lady asked to make an appointment for a conference. Wary of her, I
proposed that instead of her coming to my office that we meet in the public
cafeteria. l can't remember what she wanted to talk about, but I recall vividly
that at one point she asked, "do you think I have a gun in my purse?"  I
replied "I don't know whether you do or not, but I know that this meeting is now
over." I stood up and walked away, half convinced that I was about to be shot in
the back. But I wasn't.

It's a violent world; no one has ever been truly safe. But all we can do is go
blithely about our business, hoping to be spared.

I shouldn't complain; we're not in a war zone; it's not like Ukraine, where at
any moment Russian drones and shells and missiles can drop on you from the sky.

Title: Words of my Life:  Troll
Date: March 05, 2023

"Troll" is a word that has strangely metamorphosized in the course of my
lifetime. While It once had warm associations; now, not so much.

"Troll" came into my life in the late 1940s at Makamah Beach on the Long Island
Sound. My grandmother Sonia taught me how to "troll" for bluefish or sunfish.
Here's how you do it. You paddle slowly and let your "shiner" dangle on fishing
line a few yards behind the rowboat. "Troll" is very like "trawl." Perhaps
the two words are variants; or perhaps "troll" is a distant descendent of
Latin trahere, to drag." Troll is related to "trolley," a device used to drag
things from place to place, as a trolley does its passengers. "Troll" seems to
incorporate the meaning "wander" or "wander into."

From my early interest in northern mythology (a "mythology," by the way, is
someone else's religion), I learned that a "troll" is a clumsy ugly monster who
hides out under bridges or in cemeteries. Trolls were troublesome, provocative,
perhaps even cannibalistic.

But nowadays, the older meanings of "troll" have been superseded. A 'troll'
is now a person who participates in a conversation, usually an internet
conversation, with the intention of sowing discord or causing trouble. I am not
sure about the origin of this usage, but I would like to guess or hypothesize
that it combines the sense of "wandering into" with the malevolence of the
Scandinavian figure. A troll is therefore an electronic ogre.

Title: Words of My Life: Boot
Date: March 08, 2023

Is there another common English word that exhibits such varied meanings as
"boot?" Or one that has shown such continual transformation during my brief
years on the planet?

Like much of my early vocabulary, "boot" entered my life through the medium of
radio baseball . In my mind's ear, I can hear the voice of Red Barber announcing
that "umpire Babe Pinelli has just given the boot to Leo Durocher." "Given the
boot" does not make the claim that Durocher was presented with footwear; it
means that he was kicked out of the game as if with a metaphorically-booted
foot.

Nor was it only obstreperous managers who were "booted." "There's a two-hopper
to third, but Cox boots it" -- meaning that he bobbled it, even though the ball
never touched his foot. In baseball, curiously, you can boot a ball with your
hand, which is, logically speaking, as nonsensical as mis-gloving it with your
foot.

As everyone knows, a boot primarily protects the area from the shin down to the
toes. But there's a second common meaning to "boot": "something extra," as in
the phrase "to boot." "He's a great pitcher -- and a good hitter to boot." The
shoe-ish meaning comes through old French from a Germanic source; the profit or
use or something-extra meaning derives from an unrelated OE (Old English) word;
moreover, in latter stages of its development "boot" has also been influenced by
its phonological neighbors booty, and, I suspect, butt.

In order to gain some historical perspective, let us consider the ways in which
Shakespeare makes use of the word boot. "To boot" meaning "in addition" is
employed frequently, as, for example, when Henry IV swears "by my scepter and
my soul to boot," or when Macduff says to Malcolm that "I would not be the
villain that thou think'st/ For the whole space that's in the tyrant's grasp/
And the rich east to boot." A less familiar use occurs in The Winter's Tale,
when Hermione, accused of adultery, concedes that  "it shall scarce boot me/
To say 'not guilty.'" Her "boot" means that it will not be to her advantage or
profit to assert her innocence. This signification can shade over into gain or
even into a coin itself, as for example when Camillo passes money to Autolycus,
saying,"hold thee, there's some boot." Contemplating his gain, Autolycus muses,
"What an exchange had this been without boot! What a boot is here with this
exchange." Just as boot is gain, so bootless means without gain or helpless, as
when Henry V explains that he will be powerless to restrain a rampage: "We may
as bootless spend our vain command/ Upon the enraged soldiers in their spoil."

Shakespeare gets some punning mileage out of the multiple meanings of "boot."
Glendower boasts that "[T]hree times hath Henry Bolingbroke made head/ Against
my power; thrice from the banks of Wye/ And sandy-bottom'd Severn have I sent
him/ Bootless home and weather-beaten back. "Bootless" means helpless; but
sardonic Hotspur, never noted for a sophisticated sense of humor, cannot resist
the obvious pun: "Home without boots. And in foul weather too."

So a boot can be a shoe, an advantage, an addition, a reward, a help. But look
what's happened to the poor helpless word in more recent times. "Boot Hill"
is a cowboy frontier cemetery.  Across the waters, a "boot" is the trunk of
an automobile. The infamous "Denver boot" is a wheel clamp that immobilizes a
vehicle. In the army, a boot is a recruit or rookie who is sent to "boot camp."

But then, along came the computer, where one "boots" or restarts one's machine.
This use, I'm told, originated with the phrase, to "pull oneself up by one's own
bootstraps" -- i.e. perform a difficult task at one's own initiative, just as a
computer starts itself. There's also the warmboot, which sounds little too much
like the old torture device, the Spanish boot and which can also be called a
softboot (but not by me).

In Shakespeare's day, boot was not always distinguished from "booty" as in the
case of the Archbishop of Canterbury's famous bees, which "like soldiers, armed
in their stings,/ Make boot upon the summer's velvet buds,/ Which pillage
they with merry march bring home." Booty as pillage survives to this day, but
is, I think, obsolescent. Nowadays, booty is more likely to be used in the
phrase "booty call" which means (and here I'm relying on the invaluable Urban
Dictionary) a "telephone call made to request a sexual encounter." Who would
ever have devised or imagined such an innovation?  Does this booty derive
from "shake your booty," meaning to move your butt or bottom in a sexually
suggestive way?  Not a meaning known to Shakespeare, or at least, not one that
the Shakespeare concordance acknowledges.

Title: Old Age Home/ Retirement Community/ Senior Living Center
Date: March 10, 2023

We were invited for dinner at the place to which a number of my "senior" friends
have retreated. The experience was cordial and civilized, but somehow troubling.
I know one thing: I don't want to wind up there. I'm staying put as long as I
possibly can.

Too many old folks. I want to live where there are people of all ages and
varieties. Babies and toddlers and tweens and teen-agers and young adults. More
activity, fewer canes and crutches and walkers.

The place, though handsome and well-appointed, seemed to me to be inhospitable.
Supervisors at every entrance. We had to check in at a fancy kiosk where some
sort of electronic device took our official data and printed out a visitor
badge, which I pocketed. It felt much too "policed."

The dining room was hushed and mannerly. The food was institutional-plus, but
nevertheless institutional. I much prefer my own cooking; I've made a fetish of
self-sufficiency all these years and I'd like to continue so. I like to stir my
own pot.

The apartments are splendid, but the long narrow corridors between apartments
are oppressive. Too reminiscent of hospitals. Or jails.

My principal objection: friends who have moved there become subsumed into the
society of the place. They participate in the home's "activities." It's good and
healthy for them, I suppose, but my friends become lost to me. Swallowed in a
kindly maw. It's scary, to those of us who don't want to be swallowed.

I'll stay here on Walnut Street as long as I can. As in the traditional resolve,
Iplan to leave "feet-first." But we shall see what the future brings.

Title: Can We Hope for a Locative Renaissance?
Date: March 18, 2023

Here on Walnut Street, we're trying to make more and better use of locatives
-- words that have long been underemployed and undervalued. We think that the
language (and therefore the world) would be richer and more commodious if others
would join with us in this endeavor. But we're not evangelizing, heck no! We
honor and respect each and every person's private and personal linguistic
choices, locatively-speaking.

Nor do we refer to the common adverbial locatives, such as homeward, downtown,
underground, or nearby.  The locatives that we wish to revive and reinvigorate
are the neglected -- even forsaken -- classics of locativity.

Everyone uses the locative where -- the point upon which you metaphorically
stand --  but how many of us remember to employ the excellent and useful "to"
form, whither, or the "from" form, whence.  It's true that whither and whence
sound a trifle obsolescent, but with frequent use the flexible ear will soon
accommodate. One might be tempted to say "wither goest thou" or "whence com'st
thou", but with a little effort, "whither do you go" and "whence do you come"
will sound perfectly natural, I'm sure.

Similarly, we regularly use the word here, but by golly, we have slighted hither
(to here) and hence (from here).

Equally neglectful is the abandonment of thither and thence ("to there" and
"from there"). Extraordinary useful words, relegated thoughtlessly to the rear
of the locative line.

And then of course, there's yon, yond and yonder, all related varieties of
"there" but further off than "there." At a distance. Shakespeare, as one would
expect, is a most skillful deployer of yons. From Hamlet: "But look, the morn in
russet mantle clad/ Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastern hill."  From Julius
Caesar. "Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look;/ He thinks too much; such men
are dangerous."  From Romeo and Juliet. "What lady's that/ Which doth enrich
the hand of yonder knight?"

A yonnish locative that is not endangered and continues to thrive is the
word beyond. Shakespeare's most remarkable and I daresay most beautiful use
of "beyond" occurs in Cymbeline, when Innogen learns that her exiled lover
Posthumus Leonatus has returned to England. She is impatient to meet him at
Milford Haven; Innogen's speech that begins with the plaintive cry, "O, for a
horse with wings" includes the most transcendent barrier-busting locative in the
entire history of the English language. Her longing to see her lover is, she
claims, "beyond beyond." A superlative locative, beyond anyone's imagination but
Will's.

Wow, carded at this great advanced age! Not, of course, carded so as to be

besides, I don't drink.

It was yesterday, at the Denver Art Museum, when I asked for senior tickets (a
big $2.00 discount). "May I see your driver's license. I have to check that
you're over 65?" "Are you kidding, I'm 84!"  "No, I need to see it." Needed
to see LERM's also, although she's 79. Frankly, we were both a bit flattered,
even if it was all because of bureaucratic procedure rather than guess-your-age
eyeballing.

I remember that a score of years ago, a clerk at a some venue or other scanned
my face and without the least hesitation charged me senior fare. I was then only
65 and was slightly insulted to be taken for my full actual age. Now, a similar
but upside-down situation, and I'm mighty amused.

Title: Shadowlands (1993)
Date: March 31, 2023

Recently some much-admired old friends recommended a movie called Shadowlands
(1993). They pledged that we'd love it. But we didn't. In fact, we regarded
it as a film that lacked value and integrity. Of course, we won't mention to
our friends that we responded so negatively and that we now question their
esthetics. I'm sorry but it makes me uncomfortable to doubt people whom I
otherwise respect.

But gosh was this Shadowlands a pretentious stinker! It transformed into pure
soap opera the peculiar relationship between novelist and religious apologist C.
S. Lewis and his fan/correspondent Joy Davidman. We were not entranced by the
"white marriage" of a reserved, asexual Oxford don and a smart down-to-earth
Jewish-turned-Christian New Yorker. But the odd couple hardly had time for
an idyllic picnic on the banks of a picturesque stream before Joy developed
a terminal cancer, at which point the movie transitioned from merely dismal
to full bore lugubrious, perhaps because the director relied on the "Pause
Meaningful" (also called the "Soulful Two-Shot") for much of his effects.

Joy Davidman was played by Debra Winger, who had died of cancer ten years before
in Terms of Endearment (1983), so she was on familiar ground when pale and wan
in a hospital bed.

With such a story, a director should make every effort to avoid turning his film
into a tear-jerker. Not this director, not this movie. Shadowlands ended with a
shameless climax in which Lewis (Anthony Hopkins) indulged in prolonged tears,
sobs, and theatrical snuffling. The old manipulative formula: if you want to
make your audience cry, make your leading man weep.

Over the course of Shadowlands' static 131 minutes, I found myself longing for
old-fashioned movie action. If not a car chase, at least a mad dash --with
a couple of fender-benders -- to the hospital. Perhaps Hopkins, excluded by
a Nurse Ratchet from Winger's hospital room, might have gained entrance by
breaking a window in an adjoining room and tip-toeing across a narrow ledge,
twelve stories high.  And instead of yet another tepid scene in the college's
common room, how about letting Hopkins punch a fellow don right in the kisser.
Anything but another long shot of an o-so-green meadow and purling brook.

Title: Roux/ Rue/ Rue/ Rubaboo
Date: April 07, 2023

"Roux" is word that everyone seems to know but me. To the best of my
recollection, "roux" had never crossed my personal threshold until last week
-- perhaps because I have never taken any special interest in fine cuisine.
I've now enlightened myself, but at the cost of blundering into a bewildering
etymological thicket.

"Roux," to reprise the obvious, is "a mixture of flour and fat cooked together
and used to thicken sauces.... Butter or lard are commonly used fats." But
why "roux," with its excrescent French x? Un nom étrange. Roux, if I have it
right, means brown, or more precisely, reddish brown (as opposed to "brun" or
"marron." In the case of the sauce, roux is an abbreviated version of "beurre
roux," or brown butter and, curiously, comes unbuttered into English as simply
"roux." Roux derives from Latin russus or ruber, reddish, both of which ancient
words originate in the same Indo-European root. I've now learned of a kind of
surgery called a Roux-en-Y, probably pronounced "ruin why," which is a kind of
"anastomosis"--  or gastric bypass -- in which blood or intestinal vessels
are configured into a Y shape. But although one may suspect so, this "roux"
has nothing to do with sauces, thank goodness, but is named for the Swiss 
physician who originated the surgery, César Roux. I suspect that Roux's roux
does not descend from ruber but from rufus, red-headed, as in William II, aka
William Rufus.

Title: Idaho Bill Would Restrict Female Travel
Date: April 09, 2023

Representative Clay Hawkins of Eagle Hollow has filed a bill in the Idaho
legislature that would regulate the travel of women of child-bearing age.

Hawkins' bill would prohibit fertile women (14 to 54) from leaving Idaho unless
they could present evidence that they were not pregnant. "How else," said
Hawkins, "can we prevent them from traveling to a child-murdering state like
Colorado and killing an unborn child?" The bill would require women to present a
certification from a doctor or the results of a recent pregnancy test.

The bill is expected to sail through the Republican dominated legislature.
Governor Brad Little has pledged to sign the bill "as soon as it hits my desk."
He called it "common-sense legislation."

Asked how the state plans to enforce the legislation, Representative Hawkins
replied, "roadblocks."

[April 15:  I wrote this parody of Republican foolishness a week ago, fully
confident that my readers would recognize it as a joke -- an April fool
exercise. But to my surprise, almost everyone who commented or contacted me took
it for real. Readers readily accepted the idea that an Idaho legislature and an
Idaho governor would take seriously a proposal to examine the menstrual cycles
of childbearing-age women.  It goes to show not that my readers are unusually
naive, but that the present-day Republican party is so fanatic, dictatorial, and
intrusive that it might just offer such legislation. Which tells us something
about the sorry state of our beloved country.

In truth, I do not believe it was my imitation of journalist style that deceived
my readers. I think it was the accompanying photograph. The doofus-schmendrick
in the photo is in fact a member of the Idaho House of Representatives (though
he's not Clay Hawkins, whom I invented). But the so-called Clay Hawkins has the
face of a person who would conceive of such a fascistic bill -- the foolish,
fatuous eyes, the pseudo-patriarchal beard no doubt camouflaging a receding
or slack chin, the general air of know-nothing simple-minded idiocy. It's the
picture, not the prose, that sold the satire.]

Title: Written for Descendants of Sonia and Joseph Green
Date: April 18, 2023

This is a picture of my maternal grandparents, my mother's parents, Sonia and
Joseph Green. I imagine that it was the work of a professional photographer.
I guess that the image dates from when he was about thirty years old and she
twenty-five -- so 1910 or thereabouts. I have no idea why the photograph has
faded to blue-purple; it used to be ordinary black-and-white. I believe that the
costumes that the formal young couple wear were hired for the occasion, as was
the habit in those days; I doubt that their wallets would have permitted such
fashionable dress.

They're a handsome young couple, are they not?  She very feminine, even
delicate, prominently displaying her wedding ring; he sporting a slightly rakish
mustache and a full head of youthful hair. When I knew him, forty years later,
his hair was white and very sparse.

Sonia Chafetz and Joseph Usilewski arrived at Ellis Island in August of 1904,
traveling steerage from Rotterdam. I've written about my grandmother Sonia here.

I know very little about my grandfather, Joseph Usilewski, later Green. I
was thirteen when he died, in 1952, from the last of his five heart attacks.
Although my grandparents lived just around the corner on Coney Island Avenue,
and I found myself in their presence very often, we had little to say to each
other -- mostly because I spoke only English and his English was halting at
best. We sometimes played 500 rummy and fan-tan, and I can remember him saying,
"Now I'm in a predicament" before discarding, but that's about the most intimate
we became. He was aloof and unsmiling --not in any sense "fun." But why should
he be? His life had not been easy. He was from Minsk in present-day Belarus and
was trained to be a pharmacist, but he had been drafted into the Russian army
for the usual twenty-year term. His pay, he told me, was "a ruble every other
month, when we got it." So he did the sensible thing -- deserted and ran off to
America with Sonia. The family story, which I heard from my mother, was that
both Joseph and Sonia were engaged to other people when they met and eloped.
My mother also said that when they arrived New York they had just one pair of
shoes between them and that Sonia would wait at home until Joseph came home
from work before she could leave the house. My mother also told me that when
she herself was born (June 14, 1905), her father was not allowed to visit Sonia
in the hospital because he could not prove that he was her husband (no ring, no
papers). Whether my grandparents were ever legally married, I do not know; nor
does it matter.

My grandfather was a strict father; my mother said that he raised his children
"with the belt." There was a two-year period when he wouldn't speak to my then
young-adult mother because he disapproved of her male friendships.

I don't think his was a happy marriage; he was frequently absent and it has been
supposed that there were "other women" in his life. Nor was he a great success
in the new continent; he never found a home in the world of business although
as far as I know he was always employed and never in debt. In his last years he
worked as a messenger carrying papers and money from one downtown business to
another. When I knew him, he and Sonia lived in a very modest two-room apartment
(in a third-floor "walkup").

I suppose I should mention that although born Jewish, neither Joseph nor Sonia
practiced their religion. Neither of them ever attended a synagogue or even
honored Rosh Hashanah or Pesach at home. Joseph was a socialist and an active
member of the Workmen's Circle, in his day a mutual aid society for recent
immigrants. I know nothing of his political commitments except that he had a
deep loathing for the communist government of Russia. "Worse than the czars."

Joseph had a brother, Nahum, and a sister whose name I have forgotten. Neither
of his siblings had children.

If I had been more enterprising, I might have learned from Joseph and his family
what life was like in White Russia in the nineteenth century. But I was too
young, too self-centered. Too bad.

Title: Kitsch? or the Epitome of Tacky?
Date: April 26, 2023

We visited the grandiose Americana at Brand Mall in Glendale, California. It's
gigantic, splendid, and luxurious.

I was, I gotta say, utterly transfixed by the artificial lake and its wondrous
statue. Words cannot do it justice; here's a picture:

The statue is titled, "The Spirit of American Youth Rising from the Waves."
It is 18 feet tall, weighs 2500 pounds and is covered with 23 carat gold,
which, I'm going to guess, made it expensive to construct and to install.  It
rises from the artificial lake and soars loincloth-clad above the neighboring
Cheesecake Factory.  It's shamelessly, courageously vulgar.

It is, in my opinion, the epitome of kitsch: crass, tasteless, crude, gaudy,
flashy, pretentious, showy. Banal. I think the contemporary expression is "over
the top."  No Stendhal syndrome for me.

I must say that it doesn't engage the intellect or require much in the way of
interpretation. It might even be called fake art expressing a fake emotion.
Nevertheless, it's lovable in a kind of melodramatic way. I'm glad to have
encountered it, even though it doesn't speak well for American or Californian
sensibilities. Perhaps it embodies tasteless nouveau-riche ambition. Bottom
line: it's astounding.

Date: May 08, 2023

Texas Representative Trey Moody (R-Flower Mound) introduced a bill in the lower
house that would require all public school teachers, administrators, and other
personnel to bear weapons during the entire school day. Weapons must be "carried
publicly, in a visible manner" such as in a hip holster.

Moody stated that "not only would firearms discourage shooters, they would also
improve discipline and learning. An armed teacher is a respected teacher," he
declared. According to the bill, teachers who refuse to carry sidearms would be
immediately fired "for cause."

The Idaho legislature passed a bill that would reinstate the firing squad
as a method of execution. The firing squad would consist of six to eight
citizen volunteers. Anticipating great demand for the position, the law states
that members of the squad be chosen by lottery from Idaho citizens who can
demonstrate that they are proficient with 'long guns, or AK-47s" and are
certified members of the National Rifle Association.

Tennessee senator Shelby Shatzline (R-Sequatchie) has sponsored a bill that
would automatically expel professed atheists from the state legislature.

Atheists, he contended, "lack the moral bearings to serve the public. They
simply cannot tell right from wrong, inasmuch as they are not guided by a loving
and  omniscient deity." The bill is expected to pass resoundingly in the
Republican-supermajority Tennessee legislature, though its impact may be moot,
inasmuch as there are no known atheists in either house. Senator Shatzline is
also drafting a bill that would expel atheists from Tennessee.

South Carolina representative Britt Brownfields, has introduced a bill that
would penalize unmarried people who live together. It would impose a penalty of
"100% of state tax liability" upon such couples. Brownfields stated that living
"in sin" weakens the moral fibre of the nation and flouts Biblical law.

According to the draft of the bill in addition to the tax penalty, violators
would immediately be tarred and feathered and ridden out of town on a rail.
Perdue Chicken will volunteer the feathers and Koch Industries the tar.  A
donor or vendor of rails has not yet been selected.

Title: Still Another Republican Legislative Initiative
Date: May 14, 2023

Alabama representative Ernie Yarbrough has introduced a bill called the Abolish
Abortion in Alabama Act which reclassifies abortion as murder in the first
degree. Pregnant women who abort a child, either surgically or through the use
of drugs, would be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. According to the
Alabama Political Reporter, Yarbrough contends that "abortion is murder, and
justice demands that our laws treat it as such."

Representative Yarbrough has been one the nation's foremost advocates of what he
calls "medical freedom."  He has long opposed face masks and covid vaccinations
-- or in fact vaccinations of any sort. He "believe[s] that no person, entity or
government has the right to force its citizens to violate bodily autonomy. The
right, blessing and freedom as individuals to make personal medical, health and
wellness decisions ultimately rests in the hands of Alabama citizens." Abortion
is therefore an intrusion into the God-given right of every embryo (or unborn
child) to be born. "All of us, including fetuses, deserve to make these personal
decisions without threat of coercion, persecution or job loss."

Representative Randolph *Randy" Holman (R-Phenix City) has submitted a bill
that would take Yarbrough's policy position a bit further. Holman's bill
would require the "re-fertilization" of women who were guilty of abortion.
In most cases this would involve identifying the father of the unborn child
and requiring the couple to re-fertilize.  Otherwise, says, Holman, even if
a child- murdering woman is fined or jailed, she hasn't made restitution to
society. Only "re-fertilization" will do the job, Holman says. He calls it
"compensatory pregnancy."

If the father of the unborn child cannot be found, surrogates may be employed.
Surrogate fathers would include members of the legislature who voted in support
of the legislation.

Title: My Summer So Far
Date: August 25, 2023

It's the end of August 2023, and what an unusual summer so far. It's all about
the rain -- constant, unremitting, monsoony.  Record-setting.  Last week
we had three dry days in a row -- first time this entire summer. I've not
once seen the stars. One of the great pleasures here is the shiny distinct
Milky Way on a clear night -- but there has not been a single cloudless
night in months. The pond, therefore, has been gloriously filled and the
waterfall, characteristically only a trickle at this season, is still a
veritable picturesque and noisy Niagara. We had a great blueberry crop this
year, but not a single edible plum, perhaps because of the late frost. The
vegetables have done well, especially the tomatoes and cucumbers. I don't know
why I haven't seen a single cabbage butterfly this summer -- but I'm glad
they've shunned us. Ditto the tomato hornworm. Is it the rain? We've had more
tomatoes than we can eat even after giving away bagsful. LERM and I have had a
great time, weather permitting, with the various flower gardens. Delphiniums
and phlox have had especially good years -- and we've planted some new shrubs
--hydrangeas and weigelas -- and extended the day lily borders. Mowing has been
a challenge, because the grass grows so rapidly and there are so few days when
it's dry enough to cut. As a result, when I do find an opportunity, the grass
comes out of the machine in wet clumps and plugs. Unsightly, to say the least.
NGP has not been impeded by the weather or by the surgery. He's out there every
day tending to the forest and expanding his course. Not many guests (my friends
are becoming too old to travel). BHP and his family were here for almost three
weeks -a great pleasure -- but the daughter never appeared,.

And to think that last summer was so droughty that the well went dry.

I've done some reading but no writing -- not even on this blague.

Title: "At Home"
Date: September 17, 2023

"And you're still at home," observed Mr. Henry, who had arrived to repair
our on-the-fritz propane-powered clothes dryer. (Mr. Henry has been curating
our appliances for a generation; he can diagnose a problem by a glance from
several yards away, or perhaps he does it by magic. He's a kind of stove and
refrigerator genius).

"At home?" Mr. Henry had inquired about my age and I had confessed my longevity.
"Confessed" is not exactly the right word. "Bragged," perhaps. I've reached the
age when I don't mind if people ask about my years. I'm proud, I think, to have
reached 84 and 5/12s still able to do a day's work -- when many of my friends
and former colleagues have plummeted off the cliff or have moved to a "senior
living" (formerly called "old age") residence.

But Mr. Henry's comment took me aback -- took me a few seconds to grasp. "Still
at home?" Where else would I be? Ah, in an institution.

I wonder about the difference between the 84-year-old person that Mr. Henry
perceived and the 84 that I experience, internally, every day. To myself, I'm
certainly not the geezer that I catch sight of in the mirror. Gray, paunchy, a
trifle stooped. A bit unsteady on his feet. Even on my best days, I'm not as
vigorous, even middle-age vigorous, as I once was. I tire easily and rest often.
Work a bit, nap a bit. I no longer perform feats of strength, not only because
my muscles have shrunk, but because I'm afraid of injuring my always-vulnerable
back.

I don't feel seventeen, but I feel myself to be myself. I'm competent. My brain,
thanks be to all the gods and goddesses in the various pantheons, is still
functioning well, though I'm troubled by "noun loss."  I know which plant
is a delphinium and which a hyssop, but there are days when those nouns just
disappear and can't be recalled. Same with the names of people. The recall
system is as fragile as the dryer, but the storage system is working just fine
(if I'm patient).

I find that sometimes people who look only at my outside underestimate my
abilities and give me credit and even praise for actions that I think of as
routine. I find this phenomenon to be mildly insulting. It's no fun to exceed
expectations when the expectations are so low.  At the same time, I know that
the task that I can easily dispatch today, might be one that I won't be able
to perform tomorrow. And yet I don't want to allow myself to be patronized or
applauded for putting my pants on correctly,

I no longer feel immortal. In fact, I feel mortality pressing in on me. I don't
fear death, but I'm not ready for it. I'm enjoying life far too much. How I
would feel if my various twinges and aches turned into chronic pains I cannot
say. But for today the watchword is, press on!

Title: The "bottlebrush buckeye"
Date: September 19, 2023

As a youth, I spent many a happy hour in the Brooklyn Botanic Garden. One of
the plantings that I remember vividly was what I conceived of as a "wall" of
bottlebrush buckeyes. It's been many a year, but what stands in my memory is
roughly 40 or 50 linear feet of 20-foot-tall decorative shrubs in full flower.

So naturally, when I came to West Bradford, I tried to reproduce the effect. I
just happened to have a perfect spot for a wall of buckeyes -- a fertile slope
of the proper size and shape. In 1980 (plus or minus a year or so) I purchased
two such plants from White Flower Farm in Connecticut and set them 30 feet
apart, optimistically hoping that over the course of the years they would expand
to fill in the allotted space.

It did not happen. One of the plants lingered for a year or so before giving up
the ghost; the other stood still -- grew a bit, then died back over the winter.
Our Zone 3 Vermont weather proved to be too harsh for a plant that had thrived
in Zone 6 Brooklyn. I resigned my self to the fact that my experiment with the
bottlebrush buckeye was a failure.

But then perhaps 10 years ago, after decades of stagnancy, the plant began to
increase in size. Global warming?  Wetter summers? Maturity? I can't say. And
then this past summer, after forty-plus years of doing virtually nothing, the
bottlebrush buckeye produced some flowers. And there they are -- long awaited
and very welcome!

(The purplish plant in the background is Joe Pye weed, eutrochium purpureum,
which thrives and multiplies without the least bit of assistance from me. And
also a 20-year-old weeping willow and young Eastern cottonwood, which I set in
place about 5 years ago.)

This past summer, dazzled that the buckeye produced its extravagant flowers at
last, I gave it a few hours of care. Weeded it, pruned away the dead growth, 
and gave it a small optimisitc dose of 10-10-10 fertilizer. I'm very curious to
see what happens next summer. Could it be that my 40-year old experiment will
succeed at last?

Title: Cemetery struck by fallen tree
Date: September 21, 2023

I'm more or less reconciled to my anonymity. Just not a famous dude. Not an
"influencer." Haven't been covered by newspapers or reporters in a generation or
two. But now notoriety has struck.

Careful and diligent readers of this blague know that the old West Bradford
graveyard -- a couple of acres of bumpy terrain -- abuts our Vermont property.
And now they will discover that "our" cemetery has been featured in the Bradford
Journal-Opinion (formerly the United Opinion). Here's the story:

The picture is of such poor quality that it's impossible to decipher. The story
isn't that easy to read either so here's a transcription:

Cemetery struck by fallen tree

by Alex Nuti-deBiasi

BRADFORD--The Bradford Selectboard voted last week to spend $3500 to carefully
clean up the West Bradford cemetery after a tree fell last week shattering limbs
and possibly damaging headstones and gravesites.

"It looks like a bomb went off," Donnalyn Burgess Lyon told selectboard members
at the meeting on August 24. I'm beside myself."

Lyon has several generations of family members buried at the bucolic cemetery
located on Hackett Hill Road near South Road. She visited the cemetery to trim
the grass and care for the gravesites.

A reporter who visited the cemetery ahead of last week's meeting did not see any
damaged headstones, but at least one heavy limb rested on a stone.

Lyon told a reporter she visited the cemetery on a weekly basis to care for
plots and trim the grass around stones until she broke her leg. Now she makes it
every couple of weeks.

Board members said it appears that the tree was located on an abutter's property
but that the town should spend the money to clean up the municipal property
before pursuing reimbursement from the abutter. They solicited a quote from
Thomson Logging for the clean up.

"We want it taken care of and not cause more damage," board chair Meroa Benjamin
said.

Hey, we're newsworthy -- and a diligent reporter is right there on the case.
We're a little taken aback that Donnalyn's sensationalist remark that "it looks
like a bomb went off" was reported without comment.  A bomb didn't go off; a
tree fell.

Moreover, we object to the story's headline: the cemetery wasn't struck by a
fallen tree; it was struck by a "falling" tree. Once it's fallen it doesn't do
any striking.

For the record, the tree was a big tooth aspen, which folks around here call
"popple." It was huge, and it was thoroughly rotten at the base of the trunk.
The wonder is, "it hath endured so long."

And also: the "abutter" has reimbursed the town for the cost of the cleanup.

Title: Awkward Question
Date: September 27, 2023

I was at the old-age home (sorry, "retirement community") last week -- a place
that gives me the creeps even though many of my friends and former colleagues
seem to live there happily. (I'm on the waiting list but I hope that I'll never
be constrained to move in.)  I was there to share lunch with a 90-year-old
friend. At the next table over (in the rather luxurious dining room) was a woman
whom I knew slightly fifty years ago -- as a neighbor and as the mother of a
Flatirons Elementary School tudent. She's 89, a widow, and still healthy, still
attractive.

She (let's call her Ms. GK) initiated the conversation with this question. "Is
your wife still alive?"

It wasn't the inquiry itself that took me aback. It was the casual way in which
it was asked, with no more emotional resonance than, say, "do you want raisins
in your cereal?" or, "is it raining outside?"

Which made me realize that Ms. GK --  and all her fellow denizens of the
facility -- live in a world of "sole-survivors" where the deaths of spouses
"were as plentie as Blackberries." Therefore, there is nothing noteworthy
or remarkable for her to inquire about the status of a long time companion,
especially when more than half of husbands and wives have already kicked the old
bucket.

Nevertheless, the lack of emotion, the cold bloodedness, the absence of
euphemism, of Ms. GK's question produced in me a "take stock" moment. Whether we
are in or out of the institution, we are in the same ninth-decade world.

But I do hope that I myself do not become quite so matter-of-fact about the
death of friends and family.

Title: Our Classmate Janet Reno
Date: September 29, 2023

My first visit in four months to the new acquisitions shelf of the Boulder
Public Library turned out to be fruitful, for I discovered J. H. Stiehm's
2023 biography of Janet Reno: Janet Reno, A Life (Gainesville, Fl). Janet was
a classmate ('60) at Cornell and also proceeded with me to Harvard, where
she was one of 16 women in her law school class, and I was a undistinguished
graduate student in GSAS. I knew her slightly at Cornell; she "sat desk" at Sage
Hall, where I was a frequent caller. Our relationship never advanced beyond
superficial chat and I was surprised as all get out when she re-emerged in 1993,
having been appointed Attorney-General by President Clinton. She served in that
position for eight years and made quite a mark.

I've been on a project of reading the memoirs of members of my age-cohort,
especially of those with whom I've crossed paths, even if ever so slightly.  I
think that so far, Janet Reno is the only one of my acquaintances who's earned
not just an autobiography, but a biography of her own.

I was particularly interested in the paragraphs about Janet's Cornell and
Harvard years, but I'm sorry to report that those sections are notably thin
and superficial. Stiehm's account make Cornell seem archaic and primitive --
out of a 1930s movie. It is news to me that "freshman wore beanies, sophomores
had Cornell sweaters, juniors had blazers, and seniors had straw hats." Mere
mythology. It's true, though, that there was considerable drinking at fraternity
and apartment parties, but for what college was that not true?

Careless errors: Janet did not live at Dickinson Hall, she lived at Clara
Dickson Hall. She did not study political theory with non-existent Professor
Mario Anatti, but no doubt she did take classes with the distinguished scholar-
politician Mario Einaudi.

Stiehm passes over in silence the most egregious moment in Janet's career --
when she was suckered into allowing villainous Ken Starr to expand his probe
into Bill Clinton's sexual adventures. Either an apology or an explanation
should surely have been in order.

Title: In Which I Do a Good Deed
Date: September 30, 2023

We were sitting on a metal bench in front of the Boulder Public Library, resting
up for the half mile walk home. It was unusually peaceful; families in and
out, borrowing or returning their bags of books. Once in a while, there's a
discordant note: a homeless, drugged, or deranged person, muttering or sometimes
shouting incoherently, dragging a dirty blanket or wheeling a stolen supermarket
cart or bicycle. But yesterday there was an event. A large young man, 40ish, had
lost his child. He asked us, "have you seen a boy with a red hat." No we hadn't,
but we said we'd pay attention. The poor distressed guy ran from place to place
in the park and in the adjacent parking lot, shouting "Zack."  As he became
increasingly agitated, so did I. Is there a worse feeling of powerlessness than
when you've lost contact with your child. As he became more and more frantic,
I remembered Florence Dombey and Mrs. Brown, and Etan Patz, and Leiby Kletzky.
After a few moments, I said to LERM, "if the boy with the red hat had come out
of the library alone, we would have seen and noticed him. He's got to be inside
the library and I'm going to find him." I walked into the building and almost
immediately heard some high-pitched crying from somewhere in the stacks. In a
few seconds I located the boy (four-years-old, I would guess). I said to him, "I
know exactly where your father is and I'm going to take you to him." I took the
boy's hand and walked out of the library -- almost immediately to encounter the
crazed parent coming our way. I released the child and in a second he was in his
father's arms. Father and son consoled each other. I sat back down on our bench,
knowing that I had done a good deed. It was a very satisfying, human feeling.
After a brief while, we walked home uneventfully.

Title: Jane Austen's Emma; Harriet Smith's Ancestry
Date: October 10, 2023

Both partisans and skeptics of Jane Austen's Emma will remember Harriet
Smith, the young woman who becomes the object of Emma Woodhouse's officious
matchmaking. Harriet's ancestry is explained by JA; she is "the natural daughter
of someone" -- that is, she is an illegitimate child of obscure origin.
Harriet's patronizing friend Emma imagines, without a shred of evidence, that
the poor dear must be the daughter of nobility. She therefore interferes with
Harriet's romantic prospects, first by discouraging an "attachment" to an
upright and capable farmer -- and then by promoting relationships which we
readers are taught to believe should be beyond Harriet's aspiration. JA, for all
her satirical spirit, is not one to challenge the rigid class distinctions of
rural Highbury.

But then, at the very end of the novel, other options having led to disaster,
Harriet and farmer Robert Martin are allowed to marry.  Almost as a coda -- an
afterthought -- Austen reveals to us that

Harriet''s parentage became known. She proved to be the daughter of a tradesman,
rich enough to afford her the comfortable maintenance which had ever been her's
and decent enough to have always wished for concealment, -- such was the blood
of gentility which Emma had formerly been so ready to vouch -- It was likely to
be as untainted, perhaps, as the blood of many a gentleman, but what a connexion
had she been preparing for Mr. Knightley -- the Churchills -- or even for Mr.
Elton! The stain of illegitimacy, unbleached by nobility or wealth, would have
been a stain indeed.

It's a curious and I think distressing revelation.

There's an unpleasant sneer in the dismissive phrase, "daughter of a tradesman"
where "merchant" or even "prosperous merchant" might have been more generous.
Moreover, the pregnant phrase "illegitimacy unbleached by nobility or wealth"
neatly encapsulates the hypocrisy of a society that can condone a rich bastard
but condemn a poor one.

But what is most bothersome about the paragraph is what it omits. Although JA
pull back the curtain on Harriet Smith's father, she does not bother herself
to reveal anything about Harriet Smith's mother. Surely even an illegitimate
child had one, and surely that mother, in addition to her pregnancy and
childbirth, had a story of her own -- both before and after she surrendered her
child. If Harriet's father can be revealed (even though he is not named), why
then, why not her mother?  What is implied by this omission? That the mother
doesn't matter -- she was merely "someone's" mistress or concubine. Or perhaps
a prostitute. That Harriet's status in society has nothing to do with her
inconsequential mother.

Or perhaps that JA, raveling the loose ends of her story, preferred to avoid a
distracting complication.

My own theory is that JA just simply forgot. Because fathers matter a great deal
and mothers matter much less, it's not of any moment who was Harriet's mother.
In psychological terms, JA is guilty of a perfect parapraxis -- and unconscious
forgetting, canceling, or, in modern jargon, an erasing. Harriet's mother is not
even erased -- she's utterly non-existent.

Sometimes what is not represented can be as revealing as what is included.

Source: 2023/10/falling

Title: Falling
Date: October 18, 2023

I suppose I fell an uncountable number of times in the days of my youth, but to
these floppings I paid no mind. I started to take note during my first year in
Ithaca, when, a creature of sidewalks and "gutters," I fell splat on my face in
the slopes and snows far above Cayuga's waters at least a score of times. Lithe
and springy, I did not a whit of damage to myself.

Falling became a real issue in my life only when my father, at age 74 in
1978, took a header down a flight of basement stairs at 539 East 9. From that
moment, his life changed rapidly for the worse. Whether his  arthritis was
a consequence of the fall, as his doctors claimed (they called it "traumatic
arthritis") I cannot say, but from that time until his death eight years later
he was crippled with pain. His once athletic body wasted and shrunk, and
his lively step devolved into a sad shuffle. For me, it was a warning and a
precedent. Don't fall.

Nowadays, even though I'm older by several years than my father was when the
arthritis finally took his life, and am most definitely marooned in what he
liked to call "extra innings," I'm most aware that it is a fall that could do
me in. I take precautions: not paranoid, I hope, but sensible. Some years ago
I moved to a building with an elevator -- no more second floor bedrooms or
basement washing machines for me. For our West Bradford summers, I've put up
rope banisters where the ground is steep or irregular. I carry a stick when I
walk on the paths or in the woods. "Three legs good, two legs bad." Even so,
this past summer I fell twice. The first time, because a cemetery groundhog had
dug a burrow next to a gravestone and grass had grown to conceal his hole. I'm
glad the fall was a gentle one, because I would have hated to have gone down
in local lore as the guy who died when he cracked his head on an old, lichen-
covered tombstone. Too much irony, too much black humor.

My second fall was when a rope snapped -- so not my fault at all. The ropes
that we used for a banister on a steep path leading from the dike to the
waterfall garden had simply rotted out. I tumbled slowly and gracefully. We've
now replaced that old rope with a new one so massive that it could secure an
aircraft carrier.

Moreover, I've stopped going up on ladders -- not even kitchen step ladders.
If a ceiling light bulb needs to be changed, I'll hire someone or beg a favor
from a young person. I'm aware of the tragic story of a friend of a friend who
lived in a house with a two-story entrance foyer. Though seventyish, he climbed
a ladder to straighten a wall hanging and lost his balance. He lingered for a
few days, but never regained consciousness.

Some friends of a decade or so younger than I came visiting yesterday. In the
course of a lively conversation, I revealed that I shun step stools and ladders.
One of the guys said, "I'm not ready to give up climbing on ladders." I said,
"Why not, it's dangerous -- you can hurt yourself."  He said, "I'm too young.
It's a matter of self-respect." To which I responded, "Fuck self-respect."

I asked my cardiologist what was going to kill me. She said, at your age,
and with your state of health, the most likely cause is either an infection
or a fall. Which I take to be good news of a kind. I can be vigilant about
infections and I can be very cautious about where I set my feet. Especially
so if I remember my "mature" vulnerability and if I keep in mind my father's
history.

Nevertheless, I'm beginning to feel that I may not be immortal.

Title: Words of My Life: Provider
Date: October 20, 2023

I first encountered the word "provider" in its positive sense as a virtual
synonym for "mensch": "he was a good provider; he took care of his wife and his
kids and his aged parents and even his employees" (if he had any).

But nowadays the word has been stripped of its warm associations and has emerged
as a cool or neutral term. I encounter the word most often when I need medical
attention. A doctor is no longer a doctor; he's been renamed a "provider." I
believe this usage to be the invention of the nefarious insurance companies that
govern and distort our medical system. "Doctor" and "nurse" are praise-words,
rich in significance. "Provider" has no resonance. It reduces your doctor to an
index or reference number and is therefore of great utility to the bureaucracy.
I can't imagine that a doctor, asked what he does, would be happy to respond, 
"I'm a provider."

The word "teacher" has, for many, a positive resonance. I was a teacher; I was
not an "education provider" -- nor would I have embarked on a career with the
aim of being considered such.

I believe that nowadays the most common use of the word "provider" occurs in the
internet phrase, "content provider."  And so the word continues on its long
downward path.

Title: The Anti-Bucket List
Date: October 24, 2023

Here follows a list of some of the many activities that I definitely,
excruciatingly, do not wish to perform before I kick the ol' kettle. My life
is perfectly complete as it stands, and I feel no psychological pressure to
engage in any of these anxiety-ridden ventures. Nope, all the pressure is on the
side of safety, indolence and sloth. I'm mighty "fulfilled" just as I am. As
fulfilled as I want to be.

I do not yearn to explore the depths of the Marianas trench in a submersible --
nor even go down a few hundred feet to view a shipwreck. I prefer the surface
of the wine-dark sea, or better still, a quiet pond where, even if I'm a daring
distance from the edge, my feet can still touch bottom.

I do not want to take up diving into shallow rivers from rocky precipices.
I'm not interested in being death-defying or picturesque. I can defy death
just perfectly while lying on my couch. Also, no bungee-jumping, or, even more
lunatic, jumping out of airplanes with a fickle parachute on my back. No thank
you.

I have no desire to smuggle weapons or drugs across the border or into Singapore
or Iran. In fact, I don't think I'll do any smuggling at all. I consider my
career as a smuggler, never flourishing, to be absolutely finito.

I do not need to take up a late-life career as a wild-animal trainer. No lions,
tigers, bears. Though I do wish that I could do something about the broccoli-
eatiing groundhogs.

I don't wish to train for a second career as a food-taster to the mighty. I
wouldn't be good at the job; I'm chronically, almost terminally hypochondriacal.
I would probably find poison in every forkful or sip --  and then display all
sorts of bizarre symptoms. I especially don't want to be a food taster for
people on Mr. Putin's shit list. No sirree.

I do not want to go dancing with the stars. Never, never, never, never, never
(as William Shakespeare wrote in a slightly different context).  No televised

Title: In a Lonely Place (1950)
Date: October 27, 2023

On this last time through, I was struck by an element of the film of which I
had not taken sufficient notice. It's a distinctly post-WWII movie. Dix Steele
(Bogart) had been a successful writer before the war; he was, we're told, a good
commanding officer; but now he's erratic, crazy jealous, his sanity at knife's
edge. The film does not offer an explanation for his decline. When he's shown
pictures of the brutally murdered Mildred Atkinson, he exhibits no emotional
response;  it's as though he's so thoroughly inured to violent death that he
lacks fellow-feeling. The audience must infer he's seen too many such deaths.
In the past, I hadn't sought a cause for his symptoms, but this time, it was
transparent to me that although the writers don't dwell on the war as a cause,
they assume that the 1950 audience will get the point. It's shell-shock or
battle fatigue or what is now called PTSD. When I came to appreciate the film's
1940s ambience, In a Lonely Place became not merely an intimate psychological
drama with noir overtones, but a trenchant commentary on WWII devastation and
disruption. And therefore a more profound and richer work of art.

I was curious enough about what is left unsaid in the film to look for a copy
of the novel from which the film is drawn. It's Dorothy B. Hughes, In a Lonely
Place, first published in 1947 and now reissued in 2017 by New York Review Books
(thanks NYRB!. Not a difficult search, because it was right there on a shelf in
the Boulder Public Library.

In a Lonely Place is a novel in the Chandler-Hammett-Gardner orbit. For those
who love the genre, it might be a great read. For me, not an aficionado of
mysteries or detective novels, it was, I'm afraid, a plod -- much marred by an
arid, graceless prose style, with many a sentence so awkward that it pained
both eye and ear. But just as I suspected, in the novel the WWII material is
front and center -- and it's PTSD all right. The shocker, however, is that
Dix Steele is not the Bogart-Steele of the film. Not even close. He's not a
disturbed  ex- officer trying to adjust to the post-war world. Instead, he's
a serial killer on the prowl for another victim. He's murdered his landlord
and a former girlfriend, and a trio or quartet of young pretty women. He's a
textbook misogynistic nutcase and therefore not nearly as interesting the film's
complicated troubled Dix Steele.

I'm in awe of the brilliant transformation from book to script. The credit goes
to two writers:  Edmund Hall North, who first "adapted" the novel, and Andrew
P. Solt (a refugee born in Hungary as Endre Strausz) who wrote the screenplay.
And of course to the director, the great Nicholas Ray.

(In the picture above, Dix's arm is around Laurel's neck. It should be an
affectionate embrace, but he's too possessive. She's justifiably wary.)

Title: Another Brooklyn Memoirist: Robert A. M. Stern
Date: November 07, 2023

I must confess that I had never heard of architect-entrepreneur Robert Stern
until I read Martin Filler's NYRB review of Stern's recent autobiography --
which is called Between Memory and Invention: My Journey in Architecture. How
could I have been so behindhand, so ill-informed?

Filler's evaluation of the memoir is sharp-elbowed. He plainly doesn't like
Stern himself although he grudgingly grants that he was a successful dean of
architecture at Yale. His critiques of Stern's buildings are unfriendly and
a bit wicked: of Yale's two newly-constructed colleges, Filler claims that
"first- year students might imagine that they've wandered into a themed Disney
resort called Academialand." The Comcast Center in Philadelphia, he says, is
of "surpassing banality"; the George W. Bush Presidential Center in Dallas
"resembles a branch bank in a suburban shopping mall." Moreover, Filler is is
both scornful (and possibly envious) that Stern married into lavish wealth
(his wife was a Gimbel heiress). Is it wit or is it bigotry to deride Stern's
progression from a working-class Brooklyn Jewish family to a big time Manhattan
success as a typical "rugelach to riches story?"

It was when I learned that Stern was a Brooklyn boy that my interest was
provoked and I trotted over to the Boulder Public Library to procure a copy of
Memory and Invention. I doubt I would have read the book from cover to cover
except for its neighborhood relevance. Robert Stern, it turns out, was not only
a local lad but he was born in exactly my year, 1939. He attended public schools
and had hoped to attend Erasmus Hall High School, which would have made him my 
classmate, but, he claims, he lived outside of the district and so was shunted
to Manual Trades High School (famously featured in the grimy novel and film, The
Blackboard Jungle). It was a surprise to me that he grants a sentence to one of
his junior high school classmates, the "diplomat" Matthew Nimetz, whose name I
remember from my four years at Erasmus but whose person, as far as I can recall,
I never encountered. I have to doubt that Stern was districted out of Erasmus.
Manual Trades was a school that students chose, like Stuyvesant or Brooklyn
Tech. Stern misremembers. He probably decided to cast his lot with Manual Trades
because it was reputed to be a "hands-on" school. It's doesn't much matter: he
would have been just as unhappy at Erasmus. He craved Harvard and Manhattan and
notoriety and money, and none of the local schools would have filled the bill,
certainly not EHHS.

Although the lengthy accounts of Stern's buildings might enlighten and inspire
a specialized readership, I myself found the book dispiriting. There is lots of
information about commissions procured by sucking up to the mighty and a heck of
a lot more about infighting among the high-flying architects than I needed to
know. In addition, the book overflows with self-congratulation and is replete
with assiduous and triumphal name-dropping.

It's not for me to judge Stern's achievement, but I cannot disagree with his
contention that architects should be fully steeped in but not restricted by the
architecture of the past. I gather that Stern is a "neo-traditionalist' and
Filler, his reviewer-critic, a "modernist."  I cannot say how many buckets of
talent (Filler would say "none!") that Stern brought to his game, but however
many they are, they are only drops in an ocean of ambition.

Despite it all, I was intrigued by Stern's Brooklyn childhood, especially where
his history bisects (or veers away) from my own. His grandparents, like mine,
are folks of eastern European shtetl origin who struggled without much success
to adapt to the new world. They landed in Brooklyn, which Stern seems to have
resented. He yearned for "the city," Manhattan. I myself did not sufficiently
appreciate Brooklyn, and like Stern, I wanted out. Nowadays, it's embarrassing
for me to recall that the one big idea of this Brooklyn "yoot" was to leave the
old country, Flatbush, behind. Stern, on the other hand, is unembarrassed: "I
disliked Brooklyn--it was a place to be from and get out of (his italics). The
difference between us is that he knew that he wanted Manhattan; I didn't know
what I wanted, I just wanted to go somewhere else, which I have managed to do,
having spent most of my life in the mountain west and in green New England.

Stern also knows what all of us old Brooklynites know -- that our once
provincial and disrespected borough has become a bit hoity-toity. The realtors
have taken over. Stern says that his childhood neighborhood "is now alternately
called Windsor Terrace and Kensington, but at the time everyone just called it
Flatbush."  Which is exactly my recollection. If you had asked me in 1950 what
part of Brooklyn I hailed from, I would have said "Flatbush." But now the PS 217
catchment area is called Kensington or Ditmas Park, expressions that I had never
heard until the last decade or so.

One curiosity about Between Memory and Invention: unlike every other Brooklyn
reminiscence I have ever read, Stern never mentions the Dodgers. Quite a telling
omission, I think, if you think about it for a moment. Nothing about either food
or sex, either. An uncharacteristic Brooklyn childhood.

Title: A Few Words New to Me
Date: November 09, 2023

An "ongon," frequently depicted, it turns out, in Ice Age Mongolian art, is
a type of shamanistic spirit. When a shaman dies, he becomes an ongon. My
dictionary says that the plural of ongon is ongod, but the prehistoric art book
in which I found this word prefers ongones. I doubt I'll have regular occasion
to use the plural form, but if I did I would prefer the more familiar English-
sounding version, ongones. The adjective entopic is the opposite of ectopic.
Ectopic refers to something in its usual place and entopic means that it is
its regular place, as, for example, your tongue is in your mouth. If it were
elsewhere, it would be ectopic. In an entopic pregnancy, the embryo is in the
womb, where, by golly, is just where it ought to be. A "psychopomp" (from Greek
ψυχοπομπός, meaning a 'guide of souls') is an entity who carries the
soul of a dead person to the underworld or to heaven, or wherever. I suppose
that the familiar cartoon figure of a hooded, faceless man with a scythe is
a kind of psychopomp, though I don't remember anyone ever calling it so. A
"geoglyph" is a design in the earth created by removing soil and exposing the
underlying rock. Here's a most famous geoglyph:

Title: Another Brooklyn Memoirist:  Pete Hamill
Date: November 15, 2023

Half of Pete Hamill's memoir sometimes seems to have dropped down from another
universe or more precisely from an alternative civilization, while the other
half depicts events and ideas that are as familiar to me (as they say) as
the back of my hand. Although Pete and I are both Brooklynites and near-
contemporaries (he was born in 1935, and I in 1939), our lives were o so similar
and yet completely different. But that's the way things were in complex,
composite 1940s Brooklyn.

The title of Hamill's memoir establishes the differences. It's well-named --
A Drinking Life (1994) -- and it is saturated with liquor and Irish bars and
elbow-lifting and most especially with Pete's father's uncontrollable and
disabling alcoholism. Yet just a few blocks over, in my part of Brooklyn,
alcohol played no part whatsoever in my own family or my life in the
neighborhood. I would not call an autobiography of my own An Abstinent Life,
because we weren't teetotalers and there was always a glass of Scotch to offer
to guests, but we hardly ever touched the stuff ourselves. It wasn't until much
later in life that I came to realize that my father and I were genetically
incapable of digesting alcohol. I've written about this peculiar phenomenon
here.

Equally in contrast was Hamill's early education. The poor fellow was enrolled
at Holy Name of Jesus, a Catholic parochial school where one of his teachers
was the "snarling vicious Brother Jan, a thick-necked Pole with a jutting
jaw and bent nose" -- your classic sadist -- who derived his joy in life by
whipping with a thick ruler the bare hands and butts of defenseless boys. I
myself learned to read and cipher at P.S. 217, a public elementary. At 217,
we had teachers both gifted and incompetent but no deranged monsters and no
corporal punishment. I can remember being bored at school, but not terrified.
Not terrified of the teachers, that is -- among the students we had our fair
share of bullies and sociopaths.

Hamill's Park Slope family took Roman Catholicism seriously but he himself
was not an enthusiast. Although he loved the costumes and the incense and the
majestic hymns, and although he confesses that the loved the "cartoony name"
of the Holy Ghost, he was, right from the start, an instinctive atheist. My
Flatbush family proffered us nary a single drop of religious information or
indoctrination or training. I myself had never attended a single religious
service in either synagogue, church, temple, mosque or tabernacle until 2021,
and then only because it was New Orleans and we heard that Ellis Marsalis had
volunteered to improvise a few measures on the piano. Hamill was a atheist by
dissent; I was one by inheritance.

Nevertheless, Hamill and I shared a great deal -- mostly, I think, in the form
of popular culture. Ring-o-levio, spaldeens, stoop ball. Where else but in
Brooklyn was a "do-over" a "hindoo?" And baseball. Hamill remembers that an
uncle confided to him that "the Dodgers are the greatest thing in the world."
He delights in reciting a litany of familiar Dodger names: "Augie Galan, Dixie
Walker, Ralph Branca, Joe Hatten, Henk Behrman, Hugh Casey." Except to a select
few of us, these names are meaningless random syllables, but to those who were
children at a particular time and place, they are poetry in its purest and
most sublime form, each name a luscious mouthful of pure pleasure. Syllables
that will forever bond Hamill and me to the end of the chapter. Syllables that
transcend this transitory sublunary existence.

Like me, Hamill was a great lover and collector of comic books. Both of us
savored heroes such as Captain Marvel and Captain Marvel jr. and the Human Torch
and the Green Lantern and Plastic Man and the Sub-Mariner and Wonder Woman and
Invisible Scarlet O'Neill. Hard to believe but there are those who think that
Freddie Freeman is only an all-star first baseman, but Hamill and I know better.

And also like me, Hamill found his way the public library where he measured
himself against Jim Hawkins and Edmond Dantes and Sydney Carton and D'Artagnan.
Tough competition.

Sometimes, Pete Hamill leaves pop culture behind and delves into his own
personal psychology. Here's a paragraph of unusual sincerity and one that
touches at least tangentially on my own experience. It appears in a discussion
of the writings of Robert Louis Stevenson. (I should mention that I read
everything of Stevenson's that the McDonald Avenue Library possessed.)

"I sensed (says Hamill) that I was my own version of Jekyll and Hyde. In my
head, the Good Boy was constantly warring with the Bad Guy. I wanted to be the
Bad Guy, tough, physical, a prince of the streets, at the same time I was driven
to be the Good Boy: hardworking, loyal, honorable, an earner of money for the
family. The Bad Guy cursed, growled, repeated dirty jokes and resisted Brother
Jan, the Good Boy served Mass in the mornings and read novels in bed at night."

In retrospect, I realize that I shared  a bit of Hamill's doppelgangerism.
In real life, I was a conforming Jekyll; but in my heart, in my soul, I was
a fierce dissenter. Lots of anger, lots of unfocussed passion. I didn't much
act upon my Hydeness, except for the occasional adolescent pilfering and the
meaningless fights. But how else to account for the violent dreams -- especially
the regularly-repeated nightmares where I bashed in the heads of unidentifiable
adults with a heavy shovel?  And buried their bodies in my father's backyard
garden underneath the hybrid teas?

Title: Another Brooklyn Memoirist:  Barry Manilow
Date: November 17, 2023

The singer and composer Barry Manilow writes that he took three arduous years
to produce his rather thin memoir (Sweet Life, Adventures on the Way to
Paradise, 1987). I'm skeptical of his claim because his book has all the outward
indications of the celebrity genre that might justly be called the "as-told-
to's. It's written as a flow of "I did this, then I did that; I was great." 
The dullest prose; I don't think there's so much as a metaphor in the entire
book.  Gosh, I searched high and low for genuine feeling, for insight or
learning, or for complexity of vision. No dice. How could such an unreflective,
shallow being have achieved so much?  Been so popular, so highly regarded, so
famous.

I can't say that I'm very familiar with Manilow's music, but I'm pleased to
learn that he produced Bette Midler's debut album, The Divine Miss M. "Delta
Dawn" and "Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy" were midlife favorites that I've been
pleased to revisit today (with the assistance of officious Alexa).

Brooklyn influence? Manilow seems to be a bit ashamed of his origins. At age
20, he moved from Brooklyn to Manhattan. "As we drove away, I said to myself,
'Good- bye, Brooklyn. Thanks for everything. I'm never coming back.' And I never
did."  The only clear evidence of his Brooklynity is that he named his beloved
dog "Bagel."

Just about every NBA team now has a non-native 7-foot center on its roster.
What's wrong with America -- can't we produce sequoia-size centers any more? 
Except for Minneapolis-born Chet Holmgren, Oklahoma's incredible rookie, by
jiminy they're all furriners. The last three MVPs, mirabile dictu, all big
guys, originated elsewhere: Milwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo from Nigeria
by way of Greece, Philadelphia's Joel Embiid from Yaounde, Cameroon, and
Denver's Никола Јокић, more familiar to us 'Mericans as Nikola Jokic,
from Sombor, Serbia. In addition, there's also awkward but effective Jonas
Valanciunas on the New Orleans Pelicans, from Lithuania; GSW's Dario Saric from
Croatia; Rudy Gobert, now blocking shots for Minneapolis (sharing center duties
with New Jersey's big Kat) from France; Kristaps Porzingis, playing for the
Boston Celtics (an exceedling lanky guy who seems to think he's a 7'3" guard)
from Latvia; Chicago's Nikola Vučević, from Montenegro; Jusuf Nurkić, of the
Phoenix Suns, formerly one of the "itch brothers", from Bosnia; Atlanta's Clint
Capela, Swiss via Angola; Sacramento's Domantas Sabonis, who is a fine fine
player but not as dominant as his father, Arvydas, from Lithuania  -- alongside
his backup, Alex Len from Ukraine; the Clippers Ivaca Zubac, from Croatia;
Houston's multi- talented Alperen Şengün, who leads the league in unusual
diacritical marks, from Turkey; Portland's Deandre Ayton from the Bahamas;
Pascal Siakam, playing for Toronto from Cameroon; Goga Bitadze from the other
Georgia, playing for Orlando: and of course the latest teen sensation, France's
Victor Wembanyama, from France. And I've probably forgotten one or two others.

Seven foot tall American centers, where have you gone? Why and wherefore? Die t?
Environmental deterioration? Genetics? Disinteres                             t?

It's not just a passing moment. Veteran NBA fans will remember Rik Smidt, Yao

Title: "Hereditary Meritocracy"
Date: December 03, 2023

"Hereditary meritocracy" is a phrase, and a concept, that hits home.
Reluctantly, I must concede that these words characterize my small corner of the
American experience (at least in part).

"Hereditary meritocracy" is a pointed irony. It's obviously an oxymoron -- a
contradiction -- in which an adjective that goes one way is sutured to a noun
that goes another -- juxtaposing, as it does, unearned heredity to earned merit.

Heredity, as it defines an individual, comprehends the talents or defects that
happen to lie in one's genes. In the wider social sense, it refers to what is
often called "ascribed status" or "ascribed value." You can be a marquis or a
mogul because your father or grandfather was "well born" or because he made
a ton of money -- not because you yourself ever lifted a finger. But to be
a member of the meritocracy, you must have achieved something intellectual,
financial, political, artistic, or whatever. Your own abilities, your own work.

But heredity and merit are not as distinct in practice as they are in theory,
as the phrase "hereditary meritocracy" indicates. The hereditarily rich and
well- born have advantages that allow their offspring to "achieve" and prosper.
Children of the advantaged develop, it's been shown, larger cerebellums. They
attend better schools, enjoy a richer home life, have better medical care
and are coached in music and art and athletics. Of course they then perform
better on standardized tests, which is then interpreted as as a sign of merit.
It's a better forecast of "success" to be rich with mediocre genes than poor
with excellent genes and good work habits -- though it's hard for some of the
privileged to admit this obvious fact.

And now to the point. I myself and my family have during this last century made
our way into the "hereditary meritocracy." Although we're not particularly rich
in cash, we're rich in family resources and intergenerational support. I believe
that every one of my own parents' descendants, and there are now 24 of them,
has or will graduate from college. We are almost uniformly "professionals": 
accountants, lawyers, teachers, librarians, journalists. Not a one of us rolls
cigars for a living, as did my grandfather. We're prosperous.

Should we be embarrassed or ashamed that we can provide a privileged life for
our descendants. I don't think so, because we didn't step on anyone's heads to
get here. We need not apologize for our successes in this new world.

But we do have obligations. The first is to be aware of our good fortune and
to realize that our successes owe as much to opportunity as to effort. (After
all, with the same genes, we were stagnant and miserable for a thousand years in
the "old country"). And then we must also make sure that we do not put barriers
in the way of others -- or more positively, we must try to help others find
themselves in the same comfortable niche that we have reached. It's an imperfect
system, this "hereditary meritocracy," but it is far from the worst the world
has known.

Title: Amnesia on Film:  Black Angel
Date: December 06, 2023

[Warning, metablogians: do not read the following paragraphs if you're planning
to see Black Angel, a curious, interesting 1946 noir. Your viewing pleasure will
be ruined by the following "all spoiler" entry.]

Once again, it's amnesia, Hollywood style -- an alcoholic blackout that
is granted a patina of respectability when a doctor calls it Korsakoff's
syndrome. The plot in brief: a whiskey-soaked amnesiac (Martin Blair, played by
Cornell's own Dan Duryea) has just plain forgotten that he murdered his bad-girl
blackmailing wife.

I must say it's a difficult premise for me to swallow -- but is nevertheless
the kind of oddity that's par for the course in the Hammett-Chandler-Woolrich
universe.

To add to the complexity, forgetful Martin sets out to find the killer, and is
hot on the trail when his memory suddenly returns -- and in a flash he realizes
that he himself is the guilty party for whom he's searching. It's a mighty
contrived and out-of-left field kind of revelation -- but I must confess that I
fell for it. I was deceived by a series of red herrings and was surprised by the
film's outcome. I rather doubt that most viewers will be as much a sucker as I
was.

Like many noirs, Black Angel gets off to a very fast start. Scarcely thirty
seconds in, Mavis Marlowe (Constance Dowling) opens a bureau drawer and
retrieves her nice ladylike pistol. I respect a movie that's thoroughly
and instantaneously loyal to its genre. I wonder, though, whether future
generations, studying those many black-and-white crime films of the 1940s and
50s, won't think that every chest of drawers, armoire, lowboy, highboy, tallboy,
dresser, and chiffonier in Los Angeles or New York City harbored an easily
accessible derringer, rod, gat, or piece.

Title: Basketball in My LIfe
Date: December 13, 2023

My father, who was born in 1904, was a basketball enthusiast when the game was
in its infancy. He played guard on Eastern District High School's team and later
played as a freshman at CCNY under legendary coach Nat Holman. But Dad came
from an impoverished family and left college after one year because, he told
me once, "I couldn't see how I could stay in school when my family needed so
much." So while his formal education went by the wayside, he was able to make up
the difference by a lifetime of reading. And although he was not a complaining
sort, it was clear to me and I think to my brothers that he felt a bit grieved
that his formal athletic career had been cut so short. He kept at it, though,
on his own. Well into his forties, he was absent from family dinner one night
a week. "Wednesdays," my mother explained, long before I could understand what
the words meant, "your father goes to the gym." And Saturday mornings, in warm
weather, were reserved for tennis. Dad very much wanted his three sons to carry
on his athletic tradition, but I think, in retrospect, that in the long run we
all disappointed him. Both my brothers were fine athletes although not big or
fast enough for professional careers; I was, alack and alas, a disappointment.
Dad, who had also been a semi-pro catcher in baseball, taught Gene and Jon
how to throw an "inshoot" and an "outshoot," but he could not bring himself
to coach me because it was obvious that with my 55 mile an hour fastball and
scattershot arm, I wasn't going anywhere, pitching-wise, and although he showed
me a couple of basketball moves he was, I recognize, a bit embarrassed by my
want of athletic skill. (In my defense I must report that although I was more
academic than athletic, I was voted "class athlete" by my P. S. 217 (8-5) eighth
grade class -- a group which must have been, now that I think of it, quite a
collection of klutzes). My older brother was a good enough basketball player to
play for his college team for a year, and my younger brother was an outstanding
sandlot all-star in baseball who once struck out Joe Torre, who, it will be
remembered, finished his major league career with a .300 lifetime average. (The
second time he pitched to Torre, my brother says, the future MVP hit a ball that
"is still circling the earth.") I myself had the briefest career on the diamond.
The pinnacle of my experience was that, once, playing second base, I turned a
double play -- took the toss from the shortstop, stepped on the bag, gracefully
wheeled, and pegged the ball perfectly to the first baseman. It happened once
and once only, but it was glorious -- definitely a Hall of Fame moment. The peak
of my basketball career occurred in the slippery court (which doubled as a dance
floor) in the basement of the Flatbush Jewish Center on Coney Island Avenue and
Avenue J. I was, I estimate, thirteen years old. Wearing number 3, in black and
gold, I was steaming down the left side of the court on a fast break and was
forced away from the basket, so instead of a layup I managed a sweeping running
left-handed hook which caught nothing but net. There was modest applause. None
of my teammates guessed that I had intended to bank the ball off the backboard
and that it had slipped out of my hand and swished, entirely by accident. I only
reveal this deep secret now, very now.  Another high point in my career: I once
won a local foul shooting contest. I hit 23 of 25. One small caveat, though.
The contest was conducted in the P.S. 217 schoolyard, where the baskets were,
how shall I say this correctly, unsteady and soft. As a result, they were like
sewers -- everything flushed. I doubt that I would have made 23 on a standard
rigid rim. Nevertheless, I did win the medal and the other competitors all used
the same ball and basket as I -- so, therefore, a modest triumph. And then
playing basketball faded into the background, because I didn't get my growth
until very late and for a while I was playing at 4' 11" or 5' 1" against hairy
guys who had already reached their full mature height. But I continued to pursue
my undistinguished career -- including the most competitive activity of my life
-- three on three half court in the EHHS gym, one basket wins, and "winners
out." And then a little intramural in Ithaca; an occasional pickup game in
Cambridge. Oh, and twenty years later on, I played a bit with my own offspring,
all three of whom were more athletic than I. My last pathetic hurrah (almost a
decade ago, now) was being obliterated at h-o-r-s-e by my granddaughter Ella.

Nevertheless, I retained my interest in the sport. No longer a participant, I
became a serious spectator. I know enough about roundball to appreciate both
player and play. For thirty years or so, I had a good seat at the home games of
the CU Buffaloes -- it was high quality college basketball (although the Buffs
rarely enjoyed a winning season). One source of interest and fun for me was to
evaluate the talent and try to predict which of our guys (or the visitors') had
the skill and size to move up to the next level. Over the years, I followed
the early days of many a later NBA regular -- and even a couple of stars. I
remember in particular Jay Humphries, who played four excellent seasons for
CU and then averaged in double figures during an extended NBA career. Also
local lad Chauncey Billups, "Mr Big Shot" himself. Andre Roberson, a terrific
defender and rebounder who never lived up to his potential because he just
couldn't master the corner three; Matt Bullard, a fine outside shooter; Scott
Wedman; Alec Burks; Derrick White (still playing for Boston and getting better
each year); and Spencer Dinwiddie, whom I didn't judge to be an NBA player but
who has become a steady professional. The high point of my CU spectatorial
career occurred in 2006 when the Texas Longhorns brought to our stadium a
gangly teen- ager named Kevin Durant. One didn't have to be a sophisticated
evaluator of talent to recognize that KD had a spectacular career ahead of him;
it was grandly obvious. It took him only two years to lead the NBA in scoring.
I stopped attending CU games when the athletic department, an independent
entity with only a loose connection to the University, demanded that I make a
donation of $400 for the privilege of purchasing season tickets. I resented the
presumption, and I felt that there were many causes more worthy of my limited
philanthropy than CU basketball. Although I stay away from our local Events
Center, I'm still an occasional arena visitor. In fact, just last season, LERM
and I bought incredibly expensive tickets to watch the Cavaliers take on the
Pelicans at the Smoothie King Arena in New Orleans. The venue was up-to-date
but way too brightly lit, and crowded, and noisy. Moreover, I dislike the
theory that attendees must be continually entertained and placated with garish
novelties. I don't go to basketball games for the half-time acrobats or the
animal acts or the costumed dancers or the "kiss-cam" or the ear-popping "music"
nor to be commanded when to cheer or when to chant "DE-FENSE." I go to watch and
admire the players. Despite the distractions it was a good game, even though
Zion Williamson was out with an ankle injury. These pros, even the unheralded
ones, are fabulous athletes and they are especially impressive in person.

So for most of my life it's been the electronic medium that has kept me abreast
of the game. It all started with radio; I suspect that very few readers of this
entry will be able to recall the fast-paced narration of Marty Glickman on WHN,
but he was, let me tell you, a hoops artist who could bring the Knicks alive
with voice alone. Then came television, sometime around the early 1950s. The
thirteen inch black-and-white Dumont that my father acquired displayed an image
that seemed miraculous at the time but paleolithically primitive compared to
the 60" HDTV that entrances me nowadays. It's all present -- right there before
my astonished eyes. Incredible no-look passes and sensational blocks and three-
pointers from downtown -- and also horrid tattoos -- in brilliant color. In my
TV-basketball saturated brain is stored the entire history of the NBA from then
until now. In the 50s, Max Zaslofsky, Harry Gallatin, Sweetwater Clifton, Carl
Braun, the McGuire brothers Dick and Al, and Ernie Vandeweghe, who played only
home games because he was a full-time medical student. A team that was good but
always managed to lose to the Celtics -- who had Cousy and Sharman and later
Bill Russell, the Jones boys (Sam and KC), Havlicek and Heinsohn. I was in those
years a most loyal and enthusiastic fan of our own New York Knickerbockers --
the championship teams composed of Willis Reed, Dave DeBusschere, Bill Bradley,
Earl Monroe, and Walt Frazier, names and faces as present in my memory as
the more celebrated Dodger boys of summer. Then came the Magic-Bird era, LA
"showtime," Michael Jordan, Duncan-Ginobili-Parker-Popovich, and now LeBron
James, who, although, he is certainly the most effective player in history, is
less exciting to watch than his innovative contemporary, Steph Curry. During
this last while, I've become a devoted GSW fan; when they were at their best, a
few years ago, they played an extraordinarily beautiful game. There were nights
when they'd score 30 baskets on 25 lovely assists. It's been a great ride that's
now coming to an end, but there's another generation of players on the horizon
and perhaps I'll be around long enough to enjoy them. After all, I've been there
for the entire history of the NBA. What developments I have seen! What was once
a local, coterie sport has gone international, with many of the best players
coming from overseas or south of the border. Where once all the players, save
a few, were White and middle-class, now 75% to 80% are Black and inner-city,
bringing with them a heck of a lot of skill and flash and dazzle. Lumbering
awkward centers, with their slow roundhouse hook shots, have been superseded by
astonishingly mobile 7-footers who can protect the rim but also drift outside
to nail a three. Salaries, in the old days, were little more than nominal and
now there are marginal players making millions off the bench. The athletes have
become celebrities -- and their shoes have become almost as famous as they
are, and more lucrative. Franchises, which once went for a song, are now worth
billions.

When I'm watching a game on a Sunday afternoon, I think about my father. I wish
he could sit with me and discuss the progress of the sport. I'd like to show
him what has happened since he left us in 1985. He'd like it that the players
are bigger, faster, stronger, in better shape, and that the shooting is more
accurate and the defenses more subtle and sophisticated. He'd love the pick-and-
roll and the pick-and-pop. He'd appreciate the alley-oops and the accurate full
court passes. I also know what he wouldn't like -- the overhasty three, the
lenient interpretation of walking and palming, and the occasional showboating,
Most of all, he'd hate it that the NBA is now in cahoots with the gambling
establishment. He would see it, as I do, as a major miscalculation -- as a
scandal waiting to happen.

Every once in a while, even at this advanced age, I dream that I'm in the midst
of a game, and I rise up and with an effortless flick of the right wrist launch
a perfect 40-foot three that hardly even grazes the net. A childish fantasy,
perhaps, but still very  satisfying.

Title: Another Brooklyn Memoirist -- Barry Menikoff
Date: December 14, 2023

I met Barry Menikoff a couple of times. The first time was at the Huntington
Library in San Marino, California and the second time when he was a visiting
professor here in Boulder. A Robert Louis Stevenson specialist, he was; I've had
a fondness for RLS from my childhood, and I've read a substantial percentage
of his voluminous works, so we had something to talk about. Menikoff was then
teaching in Hawaii and mighty anxious to find his way back to the mainland.

I knew nothing of his childhood except that like me he was a Brooklyn boy. Then,
a while ago, I heard through a mutual acquaintance that he had written a memoir
of his childhood and youth. And so he has. It's called Stone Mother, and it's
privately printed but available on Amazon, and it's a damn good book that might
with a few judicious edits have been a successful commercial publication.

I used to tell my friends that I was the most naive boy in the history of the
known universe ever to arrive on a college campus. But now I have a competitor.
Menikoff knew a lot of things -- principally how to survive the death of
his mother and the disappearance and neglect of his father, so he was not
without resources. Socially, he was behindhand, and in terms of books and
intellectual life, he was nowhere. It was quite an achievement for him to get
from Brownsville to Brooklyn College and then on to a successful career as a
teacher and scholar.

I think that what I liked best about this memoir is its honesty.  It tells the
truth and by doing so creates a strong, credible picture of Brooklyn life back
then,

Title: Another Brooklyn Memoirist -- Marty Glickman
Date: December 19, 2023

In the late 40s and 50s, Marty Glickman was the radio voice of the New York
Knicks. As a basketball announcer, he was simply the best. Most of us from that
era, especially Brooklyn guys, can still recall in our mind's ear his melodious,
accurate and rapid-fire recreation of the game. "Gallatin to Braun on the left
wing. Swish."

Until a couple of days ago, I did not know that Marty Glickman had written (in
an "as-told-to" kind of way) an autobiography called The Fastest Kid on the
Block (1996), and that, believe it or not, one copy of this book is among the
holdings of the Michener Library of the University of Northern Colorado, in
Greeley, Colorado -- and is now in my very own hands. A warm thank you to UNC
and to Interlibrary Loan.

Glickman was not only an announcer; he was also a student at fabled P S 217, my
own not-so-"alma" mater, which he attended from first through sixth grade. He
was born in 1917 so that would be in the 1920s. He was, get this, the fastest
kid on the block in my very own neighborhood.

He was not just a voice but an athlete, best known as a two-way football player
at Syracuse University. He was also a top of the class sprinter who once ran a
hundred yards in 9.5 seconds (the great Jesse Owens held the world record at
9.3). In 1936, Glickman was scheduled to run the second leg of the 4 x 100 at
the Berlin Olympics.  He was scratched at the last minute for reasons that are
still murky, but Glickman's opinion, and mine, is that Adolf Hitler didn't want
a Jew to win a medal, so he had Goebbels whisper to Avery Brundage, who was the
head of U. S. Olympic committee, that Glickman not be allowed to run. (Brundage
was a notorious racist, misogynist, and Jew-hater, known as "slavery Avery."
(There's an unverified report that Brundage spoke at the February, 1939, Nazi
rally at Madison Square Garden; it would nor have been out of character for him
to have done so.)

Glickman is philosophical about not being allowed to run in the Olympics. It
would have been good to show his grandchildren his gold medal, he says. I myself
am indignant for him.

Once, when I was still a Brooklyn yoot, a rumor swept the P S 217 schoolyard
that "Marty Glickman is going to be here this afternoon."  He appeared, but all
that I can remember is that he spoke to a knot of kids. I remember nothing more.

Title: Another Brooklyn Memoirist -- Norman Podhoretz
Date: January 03, 2024

To most readers of this blague, Norman Podhoretz is a nonentity, but for a
while there, he was a big deal in certain intellectual circles. His youthful
autobiography, Making It (1967), elicited howls of indignation. Nowadays, it's
impossible not to read Making It retrospectively, because it's undeniable
that the author, who began life as liberal or progressive, has metamorphosed,
over the years, into a monster. He is now a full bore Trumpian fascist. In
the Podhoretz universe, abortion is infanticide and homosexuality constitutes
a danger to the polity. Although the child of shtetl Jews, Podhoretz is now
stridently anti-immigrant. In 2010, he ridiculously proclaimed that "I would
rather have Sarah Palin sitting in the Oval Office than Barack Obama." He has
called the Trump presidency "a kind of miracle" and announced  that Trump is "a
vessel chosen by God to save us from the evil on the Left." Such a sentiment is
not just echo-chamber conservative twaddle: it's nutso insanity pure and simple.

How much of Podhoretz's wandering in the wilderness can be traced to his
Brownsville Brooklyn childhood and youth is hard to say?  Making It is a
most peculiar autobiography. It's beautifully written -- in the sense that
the arguments are finely deployed and the sentences are lucid, sometimes even
lyrical. But it's also clear that Podhoretz, from the start, was the kind of
obnoxious guy who delighted in provocation. It's not uncommon for Brooklynites
of his generation to wish to leave Brooklyn behind. Podhoretz is shameless about
his ambition: he had "a vulgar desire to rise above the class into which he was
born."

Most megalomaniacal autobiographers want to be liked. Not Podhoretz. He strives
to be disliked, even hated, and in this he succeeds. He had a fear of becoming
an "inauthentic WASP" but that's exactly what he became. The further to the
right he went, the further away from his mother's embarrassing Yiddish accent. A
sad life.

The character in literature who Podhoretz most resembles is Johnny Rocco in Key
Largo, who wants "more."

Podhoretz's "more" is similarly empty and was similarly dangerous.

Title: New Year's Resolutions -- 2024
Date: January 05, 2024

It's that time of year once again -- time to get 2024 out of the starting gates
with force and vigor. I'm all into self-improvement, as everyone knows. So here
are my resolutions.

1). Sleep longer, and stay in bed later in the morning. No need to bounce out of
bed. It's warm and cozy in there. Breakfast will wait a few minutes longer. 
Related resolution: take more and better naps. Nothing more pleasurable than a
lie-down after a satisfying lunch.

2). Eat more ice cream. We are fortunate to live in an age of ice-cream
abundance and variety. I intend to take advantage of the circumstances.  And
by ice cream, I mean Ice cream: no ersatz concoctions of soy, whale-oil, kefir,
oatmilk, yoghurt, tofu, or coconut oil. Cream, as from a cow.

3)  Walk more slowly. What's the rush?  Why is everyone in such a gol-durn
hurry?

4)  Avoid responsibility. Let others do their share. At this point in life,
there's no shame in shirking.

I hope this program is not too ambitious. I wouldn't want to fail at it and
embarrass my friends and supporters. I'll do my best.

Title: Alou
Date: January 10, 2024

I read Felipe Alou's autobiography, My Baseball Journey (2018). It's not a
literary masterpiece, but nevertheless a solid book that "does the job."
It's particularly valuable for its story of the brutalities faced by a black
Dominican pioneer coming to segregated America in the early '50s. A good
reminder of a part of our ugly racial history that is so easy to forget or
ignore. In an afterword, Bruce Bochy calls Alou the "Jackie Robinson of South
America." My Baseball Journey is also a good reminder of the daily hardships
faced by the professional athlete. True enough that they're well paid, but also
true that they're subject to injuries and decay and insecurity and have to fight
for their job every day. There's no such thing as tenure in sports. Alou was
smart and resilient and proud and enjoyed a career that can be justly celebrated
-- but not all do.

Here's my favorite paragraph: "I missed playing when I retired. Every retired
ballplayer goes through the same things, the same thoughts and emotions. I still
miss playing. To this day, I have dreams that I'm still playing. Sometimes I
have nightmares where I"m late for a game or I've missed a team bus to the
ballpark." I understand this sentiment very well; like many of my peers, I still
dream that I'm either late for class or am standing in front of a large audience
and have absolutely no knowledge of the subject about which I'm required to
discourse for an hour.

One weakness of My Baseball Journey: though Alou managed through the steroid
years, and knew Barry Bonds and others, he gives the drug problem mighty short
shrift. His book turns a blind eye toward that painful period.

Title: Words of My Life -- "Joint"
Date: January 17, 2024

"Joint" is a word that in the course of my lifetime has engaged in some serious
shape-shifting. When I first encountered the word, joint (derived from the
Latin jungere, to join) was simply a place where two pieces of wood were glued
together or where one's bones were articulated to produce a wrist, elbow, or
knee. Mighty simple and uncomplicated, it would appear -- but even then "joint"
had begun to accumulate variants. Rick Blaine's sentence in Casablanca was an
early warning: "of all the gin joints in all the towns in the world, she has
to come into mine." A "joint" was apparently a nightclub or bar. "Gin joint"
suggests that  "Rick's Cafe Americain" was louche or sleazy, and perhaps
it was, what with all the crooked gambling going on and with the mysterious
"letters of transit" stuffed into Sam's piano. But why "joint"?  It seems
fanciful to suppose that a joint was a place where various people "joined"
together, but I can't think of a more persuasive etymology.

Another use of joint came to my attention in the late 1960's when I became
seriously interested in Jacobean oak furniture. Here's a handsome "joint stool":

A joint stool was the most ordinary kind of chair during the period when
Shakespeare was wielding his quill. Why "joint"?  Apparently because it was a
joined stool, and therefore of higher quality than one that was merely glued.
A joiner was a skilled craftsman before mass-produced nails and screws became
inexpensive and commonplace.

Shakespeare knew joint stools very well: "Cry you mercy, I took you for a joint-
stool," says the Fool to a joint stool. Fool humors mad hallucinating Lear by
pretending that the joint stool is the king's daughter Goneril. Shakespeare, by
the by, played many a variation on "joint," employing or inventing  such terms
as "joint-servant," "joint-laborer," "joint-ring," "jointress," "unjointed,"
"injointed," "short-jointed," "conjointly," and "disjoint."

But even Shakespeare would not have imagined the transfigurations of the word in
these our latter days. Nowadays, a joint is a prison, though I don't know why
one would call it so when such colorful appellations as "hoosegow," "clink,"
"stir," "slammer," and "pokey" are all on the tips of our collective tongues.
Nor would he have imagined "joint" as a marijuana blunt or spliff. He wouldn't
have known but might have appreciated "joint" as a term for the male sexual
organ.

All of which makes it possible, theoretically, to say, "I was in a joint,
smoking a joint, figuring out how to exercise my joint."

As for me, I use the word "joint" everyday -- in the most useful phrase "joint
card."

Other words of my life:  slouch, cishet, yips, ramps, jot and tittle, worship,
mucilage. spatchcock, umpire, stopper.

Title: Othello (1604), Nora Prentiss (1947), Date Night (2011)
Date: January 29, 2024

Many years ago, in what sometimes seems like an earlier life, I taught
Shakespeare courses to both young and "mature" students. When we reached
Othello, halfway through the semester, I would, of course, point out that the
play did not take the traditional form of tragedy-- of a great man or king gone
awry as in the case of Macbeth or Richard III. Othello instead introduced a
formula that was innovative for its time but which has become commonplace in
ours. Othello is a domestic drama in which a marriage falls all to pieces. I
liked to tell my captive audience, only slightly facetiously, that the whole
of life is divided into two parts: the comic, which begins with birth and ends
with marriage, and the tragic, which begins with marriage and proceeds to
death. A statement which is a kind of shorthand, simplified version of a cliche
of criticism. Like many such abbreviations, this formula contains a dollop of
truth. Othello in fact begins with a marriage -- or more accurately a defiant
elopement -- and comes to conclusion with Desdemona strangled in her bed and her
husband the Moor a suicide. It's the sole play of Shakespeare's that follows
the strict marriage-to-death path, although Romeo and Juliet is comic until
the secret wedding but becomes tragic afterwards, while the wondrous Winter's
Tale begins with Leontes and Hermione already married and pushes through some
desperate circumstances only to come to a miraculous comic climax with the
restoration of a woman presumed dead and a glorious second-generation wedding.
Both RJ and WT sometimes seem like two different and opposite kinds of plays
condensed into one -- and yet are all the more triumphant for being so.

These musings were precipitated by the film that we watched a couple of nights
ago -- Nora Prentiss (1947), which Wikipedia characterizes as a film noir, but
which is better thought of as two films in one -- a film that starts as an
instance of domestic drama or "bourgeois realism" or even soap opera and doesn't
become a murder mystery until two-thirds along the way. In a limited sense,
it's not unlike Shakespeare's hybrids, but alas does not successfully yoke or
blend its disparate plots. As a result, the last section of Nora Prentiss,
I'm sorry to say, becomes not intriguing but unbelievable and ludicrous. It's
an odd and interesting film, although not a good one, but it's worth watching
for aficionados of TCM not only for its manipulation of genre expectations but
also because it is one of a large group of films that are so very common and
ordinary in twentieth-century America where such enormous value is attached to
a happy and fulfilling marriage -- and to the disappointment that arises when
the marriage comes a-cropper. In Nora Prentiss, a midlife couple with a pair
of kids, who live in an orderly picket-fence house, ought to be living a happy
life, but, by golly, both husband and wife are discontented and bored. They
are afflicted with the whole package of suburban anxieties. It's Cheever-land
or Updyke-land: demanding children and divorcing friends, the stultifying
daily routine, the unsatisfying jobs, the dull obligatory social events, and
especially the lack of sexual excitement which is signified in these Code-
burdened movies by the gulf between the twin beds and the sterile head-to-toe
sleepwear and also by that pathetic chaste kiss before husband and wife turn
away from each other as they extinguish the cute matching bedside table lamps.
Gosh, it's a scenario that is familiar from dozens and perhaps scores of postwar
(and later) films.

Melodramatic Nora Prentiss follows the fortunes of steady-Eddie Dr. Richard
Talbot, enacted by Kent Smith, who meets nightclub chantoosie Nora, played by
Anne Sheridan. Flirtation turns into an affair, and the affair evolves into true
love or at least into genuine sexual passion. But all goes from bad to worse
when Talbot, instead of seeking a divorce from his stern unlovely wife, concocts
a dumb whopper of a plot that makes Friar Lawrence's harebrained sleeping-dram
waking-up-in-the-tomb plan seem brilliant in comparison. Talbot fakes his own
death and disappears -- causing the film to turn police-procedural. And then,
through a series of hard-to-credit mischances and gimmicks, Talbot finds himself
in his newly assumed fake guise indicted for murdering -- oh no yes indeed! --
his very own self. Nora Prentiss by this time has metamorphosed into a film that
by rights should be renamed City of Naked Death or Shadow of Evil Night. Even
so, the film might have been salvaged had not so much depended on the acting
skill of Kent Smith, who is perfectly fine in the first part of the film, but
incapable of managing the switch from reliable doc to nervous fugitive. It's
not entirely his fault: the role puts too much pressure on the actor. I doubt
whether such a transition could have been handled by Roscius or Burbage or
Garrick or Sir Laurence Olivier himself.

Here is a picture of Ann Sheridan and Kent Smith. Sheridan wisely holds on to
her hat; Smith's chapeau dominates the scene; very 1940s.

Title: Another Brooklyn Memoirist: Martin H. Levinson
Date: February 02, 2024

Autobiographers from Brooklyn divide, on the whole, into two camps. There
are the discontented, who yearned from day one to get the hell out of the
neighborhood as quickly as possible; and then there are the nostalgics,
perpetually romanticizing those great days of spaldeens, stickball, and
chocolate egg creams. Martin Levinson's privately-published memoir Brooklyn
Boomer, Growing up in the Fifties (2011) is most decidedly of the latter group.
But what a thin and disappointing piece of work it is!!  Gosh, were we all
quite so shallow! Levinson's book displays no sense of life's complexities and
contradiction and ambiguities. Perhaps it's because he didn't or wouldn't read
-- no exciting trips to the Brooklyn Public Library in this sterile memoir. Nor
even to the movie palaces.

The best word for Brooklyn Boomer is, I'm sorry to say, superficial. Also
padded.

Also unoriginal.

Plus the account of public school "assemblies" is shamelessly cribbed from a
2006 entry on this very blog.

A dvandva compound is a formation in which two individual nouns are joined
to form a new word. Wik offers the example "singer-songwriter." I think that
"barber-surgeon" is therefore a dvandva, although I am confident that I am the
first person ever to denominate it as such. Anaptyxis is a term in linguistics
for the demotic insertion of a vowel between two consonants, as in filim for
film or realitor for realtor. A calque a word-for-word translation from one
language to another. Clausula is a term in ancient rhetoric for a consciously-
contrived rhythmic ending to a long sentence. If I've ever employed a clausula,
I am sure that it's been entirely fortuitous.

A suffete was a Carthaginian official or magistrate. A groma is a Roman
surveying instrument that had plumb lines hanging from four arms at right
angles. I do nor know how it was employed but it must have worked very well
because the Romans did some remarkable surveying. A gromatic text is therefore
a record of a survey. An ostracan is a fragment of ancient pottery onto which
writing has been scratched or incised. Since ostraca are durable they are a
primary source of archeological information. A cippus was a cylindrical stone
used as a gravestone by the Etruscans and as a boundary marker by Romans. Here's
a handsome old cippus.

Title: New Words of Etruscan Interest
Date: February 13, 2024

I have just finished reading Sybille Haynes comprehensive study, Etruscan
Civilization, A Cultural History (2000). It's not only a window into a
remarkable extinct world, but also a trove of exciting words new to me. And as
readers of this blague are well aware, vocabulary excites Dr. Metablog.

For example: a skyphos is a two-handled cup for drinking wine. Here's an
especially handsome one from the 5th century BCE.

It's decorated with a portrait of a hoplite, a Greek soldier.

Then there's the versatile word symplegma, which sounds suspiciously like a
noxious bodily discharge -- but isn't. If one searches for the word symplegma,
the first meaning that one encounters is a "genus of ascidian tunicates in the
family styelidae." What the heck are any kind of tunicates doing in a volume
on  Etruscan civilization? But on further investigation it emerges that
symplegma has a second and more pertinent definition. It's a word that is used
by art historians and archeologists for a depiction of sexual intercourse.
Honest to Pete, who would have guessed?  How the two symplegmata -- the
tunicate and the fornicate -- are related, is, I must say, quite a mystery.

Another word with two distinct significations is tibia. We all know that the
tibia is the bone that connects ankle and knee. I did not know that for students
of ancient world it also refers to a brooch or clasp.

Bucchero is the name of typical and common Etruscan ceramic distinguished by its
burnished black glaze. Here's a bucchero oinochoe (or jug for wine).

Speaking of jugs, there's also the aryballos, which is a "globular flask" used
to contain perfume or oil. Another kind of jug is the "canopic jar", which was
used by the ancient Egyptians to store a guy's (or gal's) inner organs during
the process of mummification. I have no idea how mummies were processed, nor
have I any desire to be enlightened.

A coroplast was, in antiquity, an artisan or sculptor who created terracotta
figurines. Here's a lovely example of such a one's work.

Nowadays, Coroplast, Inc. is the name of a large company that produces
corrugated plastic sheets used in packaging and signboards.

A felloe or felly is the outer rim of a wheel to which spokes are attached.
I imagine that this word is well known to bicyclists and wheelwrights, but
I had never encountered it. My chagrin, my apologies. An acroterion is an
architectural ornament mounted at the apex of corner of a building, a kind of
rooftop gargoyle. An anthemion or palmette is a design consisting of radiating
petals. Sometimes anthemia are carved into acroteria. If two anthemia are set
back to back they are said to be addorsed.

Title: What We Read in the 1950s: The Magnificent Ambersons
Date: February 25, 2024

Although The Magnificent Ambersons was first published in 1918, it was still
admired and almost canonical in the 1950s when I was coming to awareness. It
was the sort of unchallenging social realism novel in the Sinclair Lewis or
John Marquand tradition that was then school-and-societyy approved. Did I read
it then? I can't say for certain. I can swear that I read Tarkington's Penrod
series which was specifically targeted to young people. I would have thought
that this week's reading of The Magnificent Ambersons was a return to familiar
territory, but it doesn't much matter because I didn't recognize a single word
of it. All was newer than new -- and disappointing to boot.

Tarkington's reputation, once sky-high (two Pulitzer prizes), has plummeted
since the 50s and I doubt that my grandchildren or their co-eval friends have
ever heard his name. Strange to say, the edition that was on the shelf at the
Boulder Public Library had all the marks of a high school text, with commentary,
footnotes, and sample questions designed to challenge those dedicated young
folks who were diligent enough to make it to the end. I suspect that students
and their teachers will find themselves repelled not only by the superbly
snobby, unattractive, and bratty central figure but also, and especially, by
the frequent and offensive use of the slur "darkies." Mighty off-putting, I'm
afraid.

The Tarkington mini-revival was precipitated by a viewing of Orson Welles' 1942
The Magnificent Ambersons - a film that deserves to be called "rivetting" -- but
rather for the cinematography than for the disturbing, perverse family drama
that it depicts. Welles thought it was his best work. Audiences will neither
be able to concur or disagree with his assessment because some forty minutes
of his completed film were cut and destroyed by a studio editor in order to
make the work more commercial and more palatable. Moreover, a happy ending was
sutured onto the film -- the original had been much "darker." Though how much
darker is hard to imagine, because even as it stands it's a gloomy story of
perverse values and gratuitous tragedy. In the edited and "improved" version,
George Minafer survives his automobile accident and reconciles with attractive
Lucy Morgan. In the novel and apparently in Welles' version, George dies of his
injuries. In both novel and film, George is a self-centered prig and frankly,
when the film came to conclusion, I myself would have been quite willing to
let him die. In no way had he earned the favors of such a self-respecting and
intelligent young lady as Lucy. Hadn't paid his dues, even though to make some
money he had taken up a dangerous work involving "nitro-glycerine." I do wonder
what might have been depicted in those purged Welles minutes because the film
follows the novel closely, almost slavishly.  What did Welles include that the
novel passes over, or more suggestively, what did Welles invent and add?

I think that one of the reasons that Booth Tarkington has sunk without much
trace is because of his exceedingly short-sighted and reactionary stance. The
Magnificent Ambersons is anti-modern, but not out of any deep ecological,
philosophical or psychological conviction. Tarkington idealizes the Indiana of
his childhood and doesn't much like change. People are moving into his town
(Indianopolis though he never uses the name) from Eastern Europe and they're
outworking and displacing the good old solid Americans -- those established
families with their shared values and small-town friendliness. These new
arrivals make money and build large ugly house and instead of horse-drawn
carriages they drive automobiles. The new auto industry is a particular bete
noir for Tarkington. The Ambersons lose their money investing in it and George
gets himself run over by a vehicle that was plunging down the street at 20 mile
an hour.  Autos bring speed and soot and social disruption.

At this moment, I do not feel a need to read any more novels by Booth
Tarkington.

Title: The Piacenza Liver
Date: February 29, 2024

It's humiliating for me to confess that until a few weeks ago I had never heard
of the Piacenza Liver, which is a life-size bronze Etruscan replica of the liver
of a sheep, and unquestionably European civilization's most heralded metal
liver. How could I not have known?

The PL was unearthed in 1877 and dates from the first century BCE. Here's a
picture of this most important artifact:

It's shocking to me that the tourist-oriented website of the city of Piacenza
advertises its Duomo, a 12th century Romanesque church, its Passerini-Landi
Library, and the Palazzo Farnese, a 16th century great house, but offers not the
slightest mention of its foremost liver (which is housed in the palazzo). An
inexplicable omission.

Title: State of the Person
Date: March 22, 2024

If there can be a "state of the union" address, and in Colorado a "state of the
state," why should we not have a "state of the person" -- specifically, the
state of this person, i.e. me. An annual report. Today seems like a good day for
it -- inasmuch as I have just now passed a weighty milestone, my 85th birthday.

On the whole, let me say, without bragging, that this particular person is in a
surprisingly good state.

My Brain: it's still working. I believe that I am as competent as ever at
analyzing problems and drawing conclusions and planning appropriate actions. Nor
have I lost a significant amount of language. There is even an occasional moment
in which I wow myself with a well chosen word or a smidgeon of wit. That's the
good news. The downside is that my recall system has definitely lost ground.
Noun loss, it's called. My memory for names has woefully declined, so much so
that it's become a considerable annoyance. I can recognize an acquaintance on
the street, or, say, actors in a film, or an athlete, but I cannot bring up a
name. I test myself when I watch NBA basketball on the TV.  A familiar player
appears on my screen: I know where he went to college and who he played for last
season and the strengths and weaknesses of his game, but by golly I can't recall
his name. I find this to be highly frustrating -- and perhaps a scary harbinger
of future debility. Sometimes the moniker bobs to the surface a day later,
making me aware that my storage system is still working. No question but that my
celebrated, prize-winning instant recall is a thing of the past. Also starting
to fail: short-term memory. Nowadays, when I read a long novel, by the time I
come to the conclusion I've forgotten details from the first chapters. A couple
of times now, when I've read a good new novel or a classic old one, I've turned
right around and gone through a second time. Trust me, this was not a habit of
my younger brain. I also find it difficult to acquire and retain new knowledge.
I spent four years studying Italian and made no more than a year's progress. I
had to complete the same lessons over and over again just to make it stick --
only to have the expression or the conjugation or whatever evaporate in a month.
I can't memorize poetry -- which I once did so effortlessly. So I've mostly
given up new areas of information -- although this last month I'm taking a crack
at learning Etruscan -- a challenge even though it's an extinct language with
only about 250 known words. No struggles with pronunciation, thank goodness!

My mood: generally positive and cheerful, except between 2 am and 4 am, when I
lie awake filled with real and imaginary dread. I experience sadness, of course,
but not depression. No need for anti-depressants or anti-psychotics, thank
goodness.v I'm optimistic, on the whole, still taking pleasure in small things,

My Body: still functioning although some routine tasks have become difficult.
Putting on socks and shoes, for example. I'm just not limber -- not even as
limber as I was at 75. When things fall to the floor in the morning I tend to
let them lie until later in the day when I'm slightly more supple. When I work
in the garden, I keep a long stick next to me so I have something to help me
arise. Sometimes I feel myself starting to shuffle, the way my father did in his
last years -- and then I make a determined effort to lift my feet. I have almost
all of my own teeth (a couple of fakes) and with the help of specs and hearing
aids my eyes and ears are valiantly continuing to do the job.

Your older body has accumulated some deficits: a touch of cancer, four kinds
of heart peculiarities, the threat of another TIA or UTI. But I do as I'm told
and take the pills that my various doctors recommend. I asked the fine serious
woman who serves as my cardiologist, "what is going to kill me?" She replied
that at my age, and given my state of health, the most likely causes were a) a
fall, and b) an infection. Consequently I've become mighty careful about where
I set my feet. I don't know what to do about infections except to be vigilant.
But it would be foolish not to recognize that at this age life is precarious and
that anything can happen at any time. I could keel over before I finish the next
sentence. One undeniable symptom of deterioration is that my stamina is much
diminished. Much more resting between tasks, many more naps.

The hardest part of the day continues to be the nighttime. I've aways been a bad
sleeper and I'm no better now. Lying awake can lead to alarmism: is that pain
in my knee a bruise or is it a blood clot that will go to my heart, or is it a
symptom of a metastatic cancer?  But alarmism is not as troubling now as it
was in days of yore -- no matter what happens now, they can't take the first 85
years from me. Frankly, I'm more worried about living too long than I am about
dying.

I'm always been troubled with nightmares and continue to be so. I envy those
who turn out the light at 11 and wake up at 7. It would be blissful to be one
of those elect. On most nights, instead of sleeping I roll and twirl like a
rotisserie chicken. It's wonderful that the Widder Malkinson is able to ignore
my tossing and turning.

Family: I'm most pleased about my family and family relations. Although I was
not a perfect father, I was a hard-working and serious one, and I think that my
children would acknowledge such. I love all three of my children more than they
can know -- or at least, more than they could know until they had children of
their own. I like all my kids and grandkids and on the whole they like me. I
believe that I grew closer to my kids during the years of A's long decline. I
have good conversations, or at least polite ones, with the older grandchildren
but the three younger ones treat me with no more interest or respect than if I
were an orange cone -- which is probably appropriate for their age; I certainly
did not engage with my grandparents or people of their generation when I was 9
or 11. I hope to live until the the young guys are in their twenties when they
might find it consequential to talk with their aged GP.

I've made an effort to keep in touch with cousins -- especially cousins on my
father's side. After all, I am by far the oldest member of my extended family --
the "patriarch," I like to say.

Love: here's a great success story. My relationship with the Widder has been
near-miraculous -- a ten-year honeymoon, although it may seem soppy to says so.
Of course in some ways it's easier to form a relationship at this age of little
responsibility -- no conflict over children, no careers, no declining parents,
no money worries, very few obligations. Both Lynn and I appreciate this much
simpler life. Her and my offspring have been generous with us -- a boon that we
do not take for granted. Moreover, it's common knowledge that people in a loving
situation live longer than singletons -- so we're both, in theory, keeping each
other alive.

Friends: very important to me at this stage of life. I work at keeping in touch.
But every month, it seems, some 50-year friendship comes to an end. The death
and diseases of my friends and family and former colleagues are the most painful
feature of this octogenarian life.

Intellectual life: I read a lot and write a bit, but I no longer read books
about books. I like writing this blog. At this point in my life, I read at least
9 non-fiction books for every novel. In addition, I've become fascinated by
the films of the 40s and 50s and watch as many as two or three a week. There's
something reassuring about the black-and-white cinematography, the ubiquitous
fedoras, the coast-to-coast trains, and even the ever-present curl of cigarette
smoke.

The world: quite a mess. A period of great reaction. There's a real danger of
losing our democracy. And losing our planet. But I'm cheered that there are so
many people of good will in the world and in my life.

When I was a young fellow peering at the calendar, I thought "the year 2000 is a
long way off. If I should live to the new millennium, I'll be 61 years old and
I'll have lived a long life."  Now I'm a quarter century beyond that marker,
still going strong. Who ever would have guessed?  My principal emotion at this
point: gratitude. Gosh I've been fortunate.

Title: Two Astonishing Dreams in One Single Night
Date: March 30, 2024

The first:  I dreamt that I received a phone call from my deceased older
brother's deceased first wife (who has, by the way, been dead for thirty or more
years). She says, very clearly, "______ is dead" (I leave out the name of the
person she mentioned because some people are squeamish or superstitious -- but a
person very much alive. I'm shocked. I say, "what happened."  There's no answer
at the other end although I hear the sounds of paper rustling. I ask again and
once more there is  no response. Then I say, "did he do himself in." There
is quiet at the other end of the line. End of dream. I take the non-answer as
agreement -- yes, it was suicide  After a while, I wake up, less troubled than
puzzled. How peculiar -- how different from my usual "lost-in-the big-city" or
"can't-find-the-classroom" fantasy.

Later in the night, I dream that it's time for me to write a novel (remarkable
in itself because I am a most unimaginative, uncreative person and not a
writer of fiction). In the dream, I compose the first paragraph of a novel. I
can't remember my exact words, but basically I set the scene in an old, tired,
tumble- down country tavern where a couple of nondescript folks are sitting and
drinking. It's all very fuscous, grey, washed out. (In retrospect, it seems as
though I've plagiarized Thomas Hardy.)  But I complete the paragraph with this
remarkable sentence: "A brindle cat supplied the color." A wonderful detail,
even if I do say so myself. But here's an oddity. Even though my well-informed
dreamatorium found and deployed the word "brindle," my conscious self is not
familiar with the word. What a revelation!!

I wake out of the dream and, immensely curious, immediately google the word
"brindle" which turns out to mean something like tortoiseshell -- a standard
very familiar domestic cat color. My daytime self is therefore dazzled by the
pertinent vocabulary of my nighttime self.

I am also impressed by the use of the word "supply" -- a brindle cat supplied
the color" --where my more pedestrian daytime self might have said, "there was a
brindle cat."

Once again, I find that although I'm a moderately dull kind of guy during the
day, my unconscious or dream life is imaginative and daring. How can this
happen?

Moreover, I wonder what would my life have been like if I had been granted
easy access to the creative side of my brain? Is it possible that I would have
written many a sentence as accomplished as "a brindle cat supplied the color."

[Addendum April 24

Just a few minutes ago I woke out of the usual troubled sleep.  I must
have been dreaming, but I can't recall a single detail except that the name
"Karlheinz Stockhausen" came vividly to me. I even said the name out loud
(there's a witness). But why in the living blazes would Karlheinz Stockhausen
be in my mind, or unconscious mind, or dream life?  I am aware that KS was a
composer of electronic music; that is to say, I've heard his name. But I'm not
interested in electronic music and as far as I know I've never heard a single
note of any of his compositions. He's not a figure to whom I've given a moment
of conscious thought. And yet there he was in my mind and in my mouth. Without
the slightest inkling of context.

Minds (especially my very own) are mighty mysterious.]

Title: My Life in Gambling
Date: April 09, 2024

This will be a very short entry, because gambling is not a part of my life. I'm
not averse, just uninterested. My brain lacks a gambling gene.

I don't bet on sports; I don't participate in office pools; I've never once
been to the track. I don't bet on cards because I don't play cards, not even
solitaire. I've never put so much as a nickel into a slot machine. I've never
bought a single lottery ticket.

My idea of gambling is to put a dollar into a Coke machine -- sometimes you get
the Coke, sometimes the machine fails. That's chance enough for me.

Title: A New Orleans Conversation
Date: April 14, 2024

For our annual winter stay in New Orleans, we rented a place in the old Bywater
district. It's a feature of the neighborhood that one house is a perfect example
of classic vernacular architecture while the next one over is a ramshackle mess,
smelling of mold and nearly swallowed by yellow cat's paw creeper. And then one
over after that is a vacant lot, the home having been demolished years ago.

Almost all Bywater houses touch or impinge on the sidewalk, European-style,
and many of their owners decorate the public way with pots of common annuals,
especially those lovely rocket pink snapdragons. Others set out repurposed
bathtubs and various other containers filled with flowering perennial plants
that I can't identify. It's a mighty colorful area -- when it isn't derelict.

Somewhere on Royal Street (or was it Decatur?) between Desire and Independence,
we admired the sidewalk garden of a renewed double-shotgun (a common kind of
home) and fell into neighborly chat with the bright-eyed old lady sitting on its
porch (or stoop, or veranda, or patio). We offered, "good day for taking some
sun," and she, perhaps lonely, launched into a monologue: "my friend takes care
of me. He's young. I broke my hip last year, so no more stairs." Etc. And then
she asked, quite out of the blue, "how old do you think I am?" Clearly, she was
proud to boast of her many years.

Now, I've been around enough blocks to know that it's never a good idea to
estimate someone's age. It's a difficult art -- you must guess about ten percent
below what you think is accurate, because if you guess older you've insulted
the inquirer and if too much younger you're guilty of insincere flattery. So I
hesitated, kept quiet. At last, to break the silence, I replied "well, ma'am,
how old are you?" I thought I had given a safe response because I could see that
she wanted me to be curious. "I'm 84, can you believe it?"

I was more surprised than she had imagined, because if I had ventured a guess,
I would have said 92. Or at the lowest, way up in the 80s, because, well, the
woman looked ancient and frail. She reminded me my two grandmothers, who died at
87 and 89 and who, in their last years, rarely if ever left their homes but if
they did venture out, did nothing more adventurous than to sit on a bench for a
few warm minutes.

But I'm 85, a year older than my new Bywater acquaintance. She's inactive,
winding down her life, resting in a soft chair, and I'm not only upright and
walking, but happily exploring a distant city. For a moment I felt a bit of
superiority, of triumph. I certainly did not say to my elderly friend, "yeah,
you're 84 but I'm 85, look at me." I'm not that crude. But I confess that those
or similar words passed through my brain. Not a sentiment that I admire in
myself and one I quickly banished. It was unhandsome, ungenerous even if it came
and went in a millisecond.

I know that I'm fortunate to be moderately vigorous, still strolling the avenues
and enjoying good health. Yet I am very aware that my well being is not an
achievement about which I can be vain or proud. It's simply the luck of the
draw, luck of the genes. In addition, it's a fact that I have been fortunate
enough to have had access to a lifetime of superior medical care. Without that
surgery in 2010, and the later one a decade ago, I would not have been touring
the Bywater. I'd have been dead or at best, wheelchair-bound and in pain,
gorging on advils and aspirins and narcotics. A moment's reflection served as a
good antidote to any feeling of superiority that I might harbor.

Still musing, I began to wonder about my Royal Street friend. Who is she,
aside from an ancient person savoring the sun?  What memories does she hold?
Who knows, perhaps she lived a wild and varied life. Was she a traveller, an
adventurer?  Enjoying complicated and deep relationships with a series of
devotees?  Perhaps she was a talented musician -- a soloist in the church
choir -- or an artist?  I allowed myself to fantasize what she was like in her
glamorous thirties -- crossing the equator on a cruise with her first husband,
the one with the estate in Jamaica. And the children: one a famous surgeon, the
other, the unlucky one who was a hero in Iraq but who took years to regain his
footing. Or was she, perhaps, a writer?

Everybody has a story; what is hers?

Title: My Life in Cooking
Date: April 23, 2024

And now for another installment in my long-running "autobiography by topics."

Today's topic is my life as a cook. I say cook, rather than chef, because
my kitchen work has always been functional rather that artistic -- the very
opposite of sophisticated or elegant. I am most definitely not a chef -- just
a guy who can put a meal on the table. Confession: I prefer to my own food to
what is presented to me at all but the most elite restaurants. I'm basically a
hamburger-and-ketchup plebeian; fancy foods with exotic ingredients do nothing
for my pedestrian palate. Why leeks, chives, ramps or shallots when your
everyday yellow onion will do the job. Especially if it's one of those amazingly
sweet Vidalia onions.

My lack of gourmet-ism originated with my family of origin, back there in 1940s
Flatbush where cooking was not imaginative. Its basics were Velveeta cheese and
those slimy canned Harvard beets. No frills but a sufficiency where "enough
[was] as good as a feast." My mother, who presided over the kitchen, did it
all, every bit of it (my father might just have starved if he had to extend
himself to boil water). Mom was a functional cook and her limited repertoire
of meals repeated weekly. I never knew her to try something new nor did I once
see her consult a cookbook. Spices were limited to salt and pepper. Chicken
was boiled, lamb chops were broiled, flounder was poached. There was too much
malodorous liver and too much tongue and too many salmon croquettes. Almost
all meals were accompanied with mashed potatoes. My favorite food, in those
days, was noodles with a meat-and-tomato sauce (which would nowadays have been
upgraded to "Bolognese"). (The word "noodles" was later promoted to "spaghetti"
and has now been ennobled to "pasta.") On an occasional flush Sunday there was
roast beef. The family celebrated Thanksgiving with a grand turkey and countered
Yom Kippur with a defiant roast pork.

What a tedious chore it was for my mom to set out twenty-one meals a week for
the five of us, but she did so without complaint.

The only memorable meals of my childhood were supplied by my grandmother Sonia.
Unsurpassed blintzes, potato latkes, jams and jellies. My favorite meal in those
days: black radish, onion and pumpernickel complemented with gribbinis. I have
written about my love affair with the black radish here.

The first steps into cookery of my own arose out of my native frugality. When
I was in college, most of my friends ate in the dorm cafeteria or in nearby
restaurants but I soon discovered that with a little initiative I I could eat
better and cheaper. It was a bit of a learning process, because, growing up, I
regarded cooking as a kind of alchemy to which only married women were privy.
In 1957, I abandoned the dormitory for a remarkably grotty off-campus apartment
and discovered that I too could turn on a gas burner and transmogrify raw
ingredients into food. For the next three years I lived on a hunk of meat and a
boiled potato and warmed frozen peas -- at a quarter the cost of an equivalent
restaurant meal! Not elegant food -- but what a revelation!  It was not only an
improvement in standard of living, but a demonstration to myself that I need not
imitate my father's example of dependent helplessness.

My galley skills, such as they were, were also good for my social life. Dates
with my girlfriend (later my wife of more than half a century) often began with
me preparing a Saturday night dinner for her. Fortunately for the two of us, she
was not put off by my want of culinary imagination.

Let me record a sad reminiscence about the way in which we were all hog-tied by
Eisenhower-era conservatism: I did all the cooking until June of 1960, when AGP
and I married. At that point, it seemed mandatory and inevitable  that kitchen
responsibilities should be transferred from me to her. It was, we believed, an
inviolable rule of the universe that wives cooked and husbands ate. That was
the way things were in that reactionary pre-feminist period -- even though my
bride had until that point never prepared a single meal in her entire life. How
conventional, how thoughtless we both were. However, true to the stereotype, AGP
rapidly became a much better cook than I could have imagined. But what socially-
constrained idiocy! How blinkered were the two of us! It's embarrassing to
confess it all even sixty-plus years after the fact.

Once the three children joined us, cooking became less fun and more of an
obligation -- but now a chore at last shared by the two of us. Inasmuch as
we were both employed, food preparation became a weekend activity. Together
we'd cook up a cauldron of beef stew or a spaghetti sauce or something else
that could get us through the week. Lunches were improvised, but I was always
the breakfast cook. I wish I could properly estimate the number of eggs that
I scrambled or pancakes that I flipped. They would stuff a moderately-sized
warehouse, I'm sure. For AGP, meals became a burden. If I remember correctly,
it was not so much the labor of preparation as it was the organization that
distressed her. Just gathering the ingredients and keeping the refrigerator
stocked became dull boring work. Her point, and I know she was correct in this,
was that even if I did I half the cooking, she had 100% of the responsibility.
Things became even more complicated when the kids went through their vegetarian
phases and when their complicated after school activities made orderly
scheduling next to impossible.

I remember that one summer, sometime in the 70s. I announced that I would do
all the gathering and cooking for two months. AGP's only task was to lie in the
hammock all day and to eat whatever I produced. AGP enjoyed the vacation, but
she pointed out that it our society, men could get the credit for labor that was
taken for granted for women. She was once again correct in her assessment, but
nevertheless I felt that I had done a good deed. I think she enjoyed the kitchen
respite.

Eventually the kids left home and life became simpler. We were now "recovering
parents."  Food preparation became simpler and fun again. Joint fun.

Unfortunately, it was only a few years later that AGP began her long decline. Of
course I took over more and more of the kitchen responsibilities. I think for
the last ten years that AGP was with me, I was the head and only cook. How else
would we have survived?  As a result, I became more interested in the work.
As I have said, I never became a chef, but I do take some pride in my general
competence around the kitchen -- especially in my barbecued spare ribs, my beef
stew, my stuffed cabbage (grandma Sonia's recipe) and my transcendent lasagnas.

Nowadays, in my miraculous second relationship, cooking, like everything else,
is shared equally.

Gosh it's been a long haul.

Title: My Life with Shakespeare - I
Date: May 14, 2024

As a rule, I keep my distance from live performances of a Shakespeare play
because I seldom enjoy the experience and regularly find it misleading. This has
not always been the case. A few versions, notably the lucid Scofield Coriolanus
at Stratford in 1962, are still vivid in my brain. What has happened? 
Somewhere along the way, I've lost patience and lost interest in playgoing. Am I
alone?  I remember sitting in some theater or other in the way back when, when,
glancing left and right in my row, I could not help noting that a significant
cadre of my fellow spectators were not engrossed in the performance but were
nodding off, and that others in my vicinity were clearly bored, drifting
passively toward sweet sleep.

This is a phenomenon that I had never encountered at a baseball game where
everyone is alert and engaged. Anything but silent and sometimes raucous?

So why were all these numb Shakespeare spectators sitting as still as stones?

And why was I among them, inasmuch as I too, let me confess, was bored by the
performance. I was not, as I yearned to be, lost in the words or engaged by the
action. While I resisted sleep, except possibly for a second or two here and
there, I was treading mental water, so to speak. Not exactly hypnotized, but
certainly not transfixed. And I was in this state of inattention even though
I knew the words that the actors were saying as well or better than they knew
them themselves. Eventually, in the course of time, I came to admit to myself
that to attend a Shakespeare play was not for pleasure but rather to honor an
eminence, to pay dues to a cultural icon, to participate in a ritual of cultural
hegemony -- and that I had paid good money in order to worship at the shrine of
Shakespeare and to lend my support to what has long been labelled "Shakespeare
idolatry."  This revelation, or apercu, or insight made me unhappy as I am not
by nature given to reverence. To try to bend my will to admire on-stage oratory
felt inauthentic, contrary to myself as I knew myself.

Yet I am an unabashed, unapologetic lover of Shakespeare. Not of the theater,
but of the book. When I sit myself down to read one of Shakespeare's most
excellent plays, the experience can be and often is utterly transcendent.

It is reading that unlocks the play; puts me in touch with true genius.There's
something about the one-on-one concentration that you can give to a book in your
very own hands in your very own chair that you can't give to a performance,
where you're crammed into your space and have lost to your neighbor the battle
for the arm rest. You're distracted by the inevitable snuffles and sneezes of
your fellows and by the too-clever sets and costumes and lighting and artifice
-- all of which interfere with your grasp of what is most important about poetic
drama -- the words. But at home, I'm dazzled by the poetry and I am transported
with aesthetic bliss (however defined). I'm moved to tears and laughter and also
admiration.

He's endlessly fascinating, this Shakespeare guy, and intelligent, and a poet
like none other.

It's all I need; a comfortable posture for my ancient limbs, a bit of silence, a
book --  and I'm in awe.

Performances, in my opinion, erect a barrier to understanding and obscure rather
than illuminate the plays. It's necessarily so, because directors and actors
interpret the play.  It's their job;  it's what they do. Interpret. And every
interpretation, no matter how skillful, is an obstacle.

A reader is less constrained and can keep his mind open. No one, no thing, to
mediate between the eyes and the page.

Performances are especially hazardous when directors deliberately attempt to
make a play relevant or in accord, somehow, with the zeitgeist of the decade.
Clever catchpenny novelties do nothing for me. Why must plays be set anywhere
but where Shakespeare intended them?  Any effort to update a play, or make it
"contemporary" or "feminist" or "anti-fascist" or "anti-colonial" or whatever,
produces only distraction and distortion. Which is why the long history of
Shakespeare on stage is a woeful history of addled misinterpretation. Nahum
Tate's notorious King Lear of 1681, in which Edgar and Cordelia embrace at the
end and Lear is pensioned off is ludicrous, but not more absurd than last year's
Queen Lear.

Query: if I'm so disdainful of live performances, how is it that I'm so fond of
Shakespeare on film.

But that's a subject for another day.

Title: My Career as a Dowser
Date: June 06, 2024

When we built the summer house/cabin/hovel in 1977, we needed to dig a well,
and someone, probably the plumber, hired a dowser. I didn’t approve –-I
would have hired a credentialed hydraulic engineer. For me, dowsers belong
in the same ol' crazy crate as astrologers, phrenologists, flat-earthers,
Shakespeare-author conspiracists, along with the lunatics who report on visits
to the earth by ancient astronauts. Nevertheless, a dowser arrived, an elderly
gentleman. Curiously, he dowsed with an old pair of rusted pliers rather than
the traditional forked willow stick. He was an enthusiast for his trade and,
ignoring my skepticism, showed my how to cut a willow and exactly how to hold
it. After he left, I tried it out. A most odd experience, one of the oddest in
my life, then took place. As I walked about, brandishing the rod, from time to
time the tip of the willow would turn suddenly down. Not in a subtle way, but
forcefully and dramatically – strongly enough to redden and even slightly cut
the palms of my hands.

Even more strange -- if I handed the willow to another person and he or she
walked about, nothing happened. Nothing, that is, until I held that person's
wrist. Then the dowsing rod went all crazy and twisted downward out of the
holder's hands.

It was a wondrous incredible experience and is vivid in my memory now these
fifty years. But it was a one time only event.

Every once in a while, over the decades, just for fun, I would cut a piece of
willow and walk about, but I’ve never been able to reproduce the phenomenon.
The dowsing rod doesn’t dowse, doesn’t do anything at all;  just behaves
like an ordinary piece of wood.

I don't believe in dowsing. I don't believe that you can find underground water,
or even underground electric wires as some think, by walking about with a piece
of willow in your hands.  On the other hand, I know that something peculiar
and very real happened to me that one time. Was there water underground. I
don't know, but I know that I wouldn't dig a hole on the basis of that fleeting
evidence. I am a man of reason, or at least I like to think so.

Incidentally, the place that the 1977 dowser picked out for us to dig was a
great success. We've enjoyed a bounteous  supply of water for all these many
years.

But now that I know more about wells than I did half a century ago, I can read
the landscape well enough to recognize that the dowser picked an obvious place
to dig a well -- with or without the help of his magical pliers.

Title: My Onion Heart
Date: September 15, 2024

Last night I woke from a dream with this peculiar phrase repeating itself in my
half-conscious brain: "it fills my onion heart with fear and trembling."

I have a couple of questions to ask of my capricious dreamatorium, which
although obviously capable of creating passable iambic pentameter is rarely
self-explanatory.

a) What is "it?"  What is the nameless dread that precipitated this piece of
blank verse, and b) what in the living heck is an "onion heart."  And why am
I accused of having one?  Is an "onion heart" pungent and tasty, when eaten
either raw or sauteed?  Or is it constructed of layers of scales and therefore
mysterious and perhaps unknowable.

Frankly, I don't have a good theory, except to say that I don't feel that to be
described as having an "onion heart" is complimentary. If my dreamatorium wanted
to say something nice about my heart, it had such relevant and easily available
alternatives as "lionheart" or "braveheart." Or even "sweetheart," for goodness
sake.

Title: Words of My Life:  Bottom
Date: September 19, 2024

"Bottom" is another of the many words that came into my life through the medium
of baseball. As soon as I was able to walk and talk, I learned that an inning
has both a "top" and a "bottom." "Bottom of the ninth" was an optimistic phrase
because there was always the Ebbets Field hope that the Dodgers might come
through with a game-winning rally. Later, when I discovered that there was more
to human existence than baseball, the various and colorful meanings of "bottom"
began to reveal themselves. For example, the posterior part of the human body,
which I knew as the ass or the behind or the tuchas, was, I learned, called the
"bottom" by people of sophistication. A euphemism?  A Britishism?

Even later on, I discovered that bottom, signifying buttocks or butt was not the
root meaning of the word but a metaphorical extension of its original sense.
Old English botm, cognate with Latin fundus, meant land or farm or soil. This
meaning of "bottom" is well-preserved in the phrase "bottom land" -- the level
and fertile acres along the banks of a watercourse. Many English family names
are consequently topographical surnames of ancient inhabitants of various river
fronts -- such as Bottoms, Robottom, Higginbottom, Ramsbottom, Longbottom,
Winterbottom, and Bottomley. Names that have nothing to do with either innings
or asses.

The oddity that "bottom" can refer both to farmland and to the human butt can
sometimes yield unconscious comedy. For example, in 1977, I was a guest at a
wedding in the infelicitously named Kent village of Pett Bottom. I must hope
that Pett is a variant of Pitt, a "hollow," rather than commonplace "pet" with a
supernumerary "t".

These days, "bottom" is more likely to mean something like "the essence" -- as
in such phrases "to get to the bottom of the matter"; or "the bottom of one's
heart."

And then there's egregious Bottom in A Midsummer Night's Dream, who does not
disdain the mandatory pun: "This is to make an ass of me."

Title: My Aunt Mollie
Date: September 23, 2024

This post is written for my children, grandchildren, and any potential future
descendants. Aunt Mollie was an important person to my in earlier years. She
should be remembered.

Mollie was my father's older sister. She was born in 1900, the third of the
four children of Isaiah and Eta. She was an extremely private person and never
revealed the least personal information about herself. I know nothing of her
childhood and I am not even certain that she attended high school. I know that
she was for many years employed in the surgical instrument field, where she
advanced to a responsible management position and earned a reasonable salary
(for those days). She retired early, perhaps in her fifties. She never married
nor introduced me or anyone else in our family to a boyfriend, lover, or suitor,
though in later life I learned that it had been her constant habit to visit a
"Mr Isgin" every Wednesday. Who was Henry Isgin? I believe that he was a fellow
worker at her place of employment and I know that when he died he willed Mollie
his Long Island City house. That's all I know; I hope that her relationship with
him was satisfying.

Mollie's curly black hair never grayed. Her eyes were so dark that there was no
visible distinction between iris and pupil. My daughter, who knew her only in
her last years, remembers her as small, squarish, and big-bosomed.

Mollie never "moved out"; during my childhood, she lived with her parents and
later with Eta only in a small ground-floor apartment at 334 Eastern Parkway
in Crown Heights. When Eta died in 1963, she moved across the river to a her
own place at last, a modest apartment in Greenwich Village, where she lived
until her death in 1985. She enjoyed the concerts and the theater and her
independence. She was a solid New Yorker; like my father, she never learned
to drive an automobile. Unlike my father, who was uncomfortable outside his
familiar sphere and was averse to travel, Aunt Mollie was an adventurous sort.
She traveled the world, usually solo. She was constantly on the move. I heard
tell, for example, that she was a passenger on one of the first commercial
flights to China (in the 1930s).

In 1952, she offered to take me on a trip to Washington DC. I jumped at the
chance. It was my first time out of Brooklyn and quite the revelation: gosh,
there were other cities, other neighborhoods in the universe! We stayed at the
Mayflower Hotel (gosh, there were hotels!), ate in "restaurants" -- another
novelty -- visited the Lincoln and Jefferson Memorials, and even took a boat
ride up the river to Mt. Vernon. We heard Harry Truman deliver a Fourth of
July address from the base of the Washington Monument. It was exhilarating
and inspiring -- a first toe-in-the-water alternative to my very marked
provinciality and to the exaggerated caution of my parents. I am sure that I
would never "gone away" to college, or relocated to the Rocky Mountain west, or
traveled to other continents if it hadn't been that Aunt Mollie introduced me to
the world outside the P S 217 schoolyard in my thirteenth year.

Mollie also helped me financially. She wasn't rich but as a single woman with a
good income she accumulated enough cash to intervene, generously, at critical
moments. In a sense, she was the family banker. She gave me a couple of thousand
dollars for part of the down payment on the Hackett Hill property and later
held, on favorable terms, the mortgage on my house on 10th Street. When she
died, she bequeathed me the remainder of the principal.  Although these were
not great sums, they were nevertheless very crucial to me and to my family's
financial well-being.

Even more important: Mollie admired and, I believe, loved my wife -- which was a
very good thing because my own mother was not so positive.

I can't say that I ever had a real conversation with Mollie. She asked little
and told less. She was not curious, or thoughtful, nor well-educated -- not
even a reader. She was always a little crude and could be critical and blunt
(though not to me). To my brother, when he was going through a tough period in
his financial life, she said, "Why don't you just get a real job." To a niece,
she offered, "Why don't you just lose weight."  A true Victorian at heart, she
regarded all illnesses as mental and moral weakness.

Mollie was proud of her extraordinary vigor and health. She once told me that
she went 40 years without seeing a doctor. She was robust and middle-aged at
84, dead at 85 -- every one of her organs having failed. Loss of mental acuity
was the first sign of decay. In 1984, she called my father on the telephone and
said, out of the blue, "Pop is here."  Dad said, "What do you mean Pop is here.
Pop died in 1946." Mollie answered, "Yes, I know that. So why is he here." 
After that shocking moment, the end came quickly.

I' have never visited my parents' graves, but I'm told that Mollie is buried on
my father's right and that my mother is buried on my father's left. So Dad lies
forever between the two women to whom he was closest in life.

Title: More on Starokonstantinov
Date: September 26, 2024

The (website) "My Shtetl -- Jewish Towns of Ukraine" gathers information about
Starokonstantinov -- "Old Constantine" -- the town from which, in 1895, my
courageous grandparents emigrated to America. The site is in Russian but it can
be mechanical translated into awkward but intelligible English.

Some of my friends of European extraction have been able to return to the
old country villages where their families originated, but that option is not
available to me. Trust me, there's no pilgrimage to Starokonstantinov in my
future -- even if the town happens to survive the Russian invasion and the
rockets. My grandparents did not bring to Ellis Island happy memories and
nostalgia or pique my curiosity with warm fuzzy memories of their earlier years.
Nevertheless, Starokonstantinov provokes my curiosity. For how many decades
did my ancestors live in this so-obscure-to-me town?  How did they manage to
survive?

One of the compilers of the My Shtetl website, Yevgenii Schneider, has unearthed
a report on Starokonstantinov written in 1884 by a certain N. I. Zuts, a
lieutenant in the 45th Azov Infantry Regiment. Why or for whom these paragraphs
were written I have no idea, but some of it largely duplicates information that
I have previously posted. According to Lieutenant Zuts, Starokonstantinov was
founded in 1505 as the village of Kolyshchentsy in a grant from the king of
Poland to one Ivan Labunsky. On January 5, 1561, Labunsky's descendants sold
Kolyshchentsy to Prince Konstantin Ostrozhsky. Three months later, Ostrozhsky
was permitted by the king to found a city first called Konstatinov, then
Novokonstantinov, and finally in 1632 renamed Starokostiantyniv. A castle was
constructed in 1571. In 1620, the city passed into the possession of the princes
Zaslavsky, and in 1682, to the princes Lubomirsky. Starokonstinov became part of
Russia in 1793.

(It seems to be the case that Ukraine was a largely unpopulated or
underpopulated frontier until a few hundred years ago. When and why did my
people decide to try their luck on this vast semi-empty plain?)

The website does not make it clear who, if anyone, is living in these houses
today.In addition, Evgeniy Schneider appends a brief history of the Jewish
community of Starokonstantinov. I've transcribed it.

Title: My Baseball-First Vocabulary
Date: October 04, 2024

Folks who weren't there can hardly appreciate how thoroughly the nation and
neighborhood into which I was born was baseball-saturated. In the 1940s and
1950s, the heyday of the fabled Dodgers, baseball was Brooklyn and Brooklyn was
the world -- of this there was, nor could be, any doubt.

Baseball was the all-encompassing medium though which we learned about success
and failure, defeat and resiliency, exhilaration and sadness, and ultimately of
the knowledge of good and evil.

Not only morality, but language itself. It's an unimpeachable fact that my early
vocabulary was solidly baseball-based. It took years and sometimes decades
before I discovered that many baseball words also carried an off-the-diamond
significance.

Readers may scoff at this claim to the linguistic priority of baseball --
because they can't imagine or can't believe how central pitching and catching
was to our experience. So "let's go to the tape."

Take, for instance, the word "pennant." During my salad years, "pennant" was a
common everyday word that meant only "league championship." If you finished 
first in your league, you "won the pennant." I had not the least glimmer of
an idea that a "pennant" was also physical object -- a flag, it turned out,
usually triangular and usually nautical. To me, a pennant was immaterial and
metaphorical. When Russ Hodges famously (to those of us of a certain age)
screamed, in 1951, "the Giants win the pennant, the Giants win the pennant,"
there was no reason for twelve-year-old me to suspect that the word had an
extra-baseball existence. (Nor did I know that "league" meant anything but
National or American, major or minor.)

Another such word is "battery," which to me and to my cohort of scruffy
schoolyard friends meant nothing more than the duo of pitcher and catcher.
"Today's battery is Newcombe and Campanella"; "they're facing the 'brother
battery' of Mort and Walker Cooper." But later it came to pass that the word
battery was known to the world beyond Ebbets as a source of electric power--
in those days lead-acid and now lithium. And that, in addition, "battery"
had violent associations -- as in "assault and battery" -- or its military
signification as an assemblage of cannons. (The word "batter" had already leapt
its baseball perimeter. Thanks to my mother, I was early familiar with the
tasty mixture that could be baked into cookies or bread). And "bat" was the old
hickory or ash, not a flying mammal.

There are many other baseball words that migrated away from their first home.
A "rubber" was a 4" wide strip of something -- was it really made of rubber?--
that lay on the mound just 60 feet and 6 inches from home plate. Later, a
rubber became an eraser and then the material from which automobile tires are
made and then, much much later, a condom. A "mound," of course, was first and
foremost a pitcher's mound, not a geographical feature. A "dugout" was where
players gathered when they weren't on the field; later it became a kind of
canoe. "Stuff" -- some days a pitcher had his good stuff, but some days his
sinker just didn't drop. A "stance" was a batter's pose in the box; some batters
had an open stance and some a closed. "Clutch" did not denote holding tight to
something or other; it meant only a "clutch hit". A "blast" was not a bomb going
off; it was long four-bagger. The "count" was not degree a of knighthood; it was
the state of balls and strikes on the batter.  The next batter would wait on
a metaphorical "deck" long before a deck became a pack of cards or an exposed
porch. A "blooper" was a "Texas leaguer"; only later did it become a flawed
outtake. Strike! Three strikes and you're out. Later, a labor movement. And many
more.

"Fair" and "foul" indicated where a batted ball fell to the earth in relation
to the first or third base lines. Macbeth's "So foul and fair a day I have not
seen" was many years into the future.

Title: My Life in Objects XIX: Bronze Door Plate
Date: October 09, 2024

It's my newest acquisition, purchased on ebay just a couple of days ago, but
already a favorite. It's a bronze door plate, very beautiful and heavy in the
hand. It's inscribed PULL. It bears no manufacturers or identifying marks but
the style is mighty pure Victorian. I imagine it came from a demolished once-
elegant downtown department store. What the heck do I plan to do with it?  Why,
it will be attached, next summer, to the old iron gate that we mounted at the
entrance to the "waterfall garden." It's whimsical, of course, because while
the gate helps to define the space, it guards absolutely nothing and is easily
circumvented.

If PUSH had been available I would have purchased it too. But PULL is
sufficient. A plate saying NO SOLICITORS has also been proposed -- but that
addition might be just a little bit of overkill (and silliness).

Source: 2024/10/words-of-my-life-outing-1

Title: Words of My Life -- Outing
Date: October 09, 2024

During my lifetime, the word "outing" has mutated beyond recognition. It first
entered my youthful vocabulary (as did so many other words) through the medium
of baseball. An "outing" -- in the old days --meant to me only a stint on the
mound. "Podres has had a good "outing" today." The more general meaning of
"outing" as a short trip taken for pleasure, such as a picnic, or a jaunt in
the country, only came into my  life many years later. "They enjoyed a family
outing to Montauk." The fact of the matter is that my family of origin didn't go
on "outings," but at some point I must have heard I heard about such journeyings
from friends or read about them in novels.

These days, I rarely encounter the baseball or picknicky meanings of "outing."
"Outing" has transformed into the obnoxious word that describes the odious and
hostile practice of exposing the sexual identity of a person against his/her
will.  From picnic to nasty, alas.

Frankly, I prefer the traditional significations and activities.

Title: Sleeping: a History
Date: October 13, 2024

I'm a terrible, terrible sleeper. It's a lifelong plight and a serious
disability. Truth to tell, I'd have more success as a contestant in a tango
contest, or as a heldentenor yodeling in front of thousands, or as a trapeze
artist or as a sumo wrestler than I have as a sleeper.

Bad sleeping runs in my family. I suppose that I inherited the trait from my
father. Growing up, we never knew where we'd find the old guy in the morning,
because during the night he'd wander from room to room and from bed to chair and
even onto that scratchy old green tufted sofa. For me, the hardest part of any
day has always been the night -- and, believe it or not, the problem has become
more severe as I grapple with old age.

My usual routine is to fall asleep prematurely (and unwisely) at 10:00 pm. Then
I wake at 12:30 am, usually in a fright from a ghastly nightmare, my brain
alert, but my body yearning for oblivion. Then I'm up for a while, involuntarily
reprising some atrocious embarrassment or shameful failure in some earlier part
of my life. Unable to find the right situation for my ancient limbs, I twirl
beneath the blankets like a rotisserie chicken. I don't want to disturb my
peacefully-slumbering bedmate, so I wander the residence, finally to settle in
an auxiliary bed. Then my wayward brain starts to ruminate on the state of the
nation, especially on the prospect of a second term for the moronic demagogue.
At this point, I reluctantly surrender to necessity and take a sleeping pill
(the powerful hypnotic ambien). I read or watch a basketball game on the TV,
but after about 45 minutes the drug takes hold and the muscles in my eyes
slacken so much that I can no longer bring the separate images of right and left
eye together. Eventually I fall into "airplane sleep" -- the kind of shallow
surface sleep that we all experience when we fly "economy" or "coach" (better
called "steerage"). At about 6 in the morning, I wake out a second horrid
dream, relieve myself, and try to snatch a couple of peaceful hours --  a hope
which I regularly fail to accomplish. Eventually, "the darkness has passed/ And
it's daylight at last."  I'm foggy-headed for a while but at last I regain my
equilibrium until it's time for another nighttime bout with Morpheus. And that's
how I pass one third of my life.

On the cheerful side, although I'm a bad nighttime sleeper, I'm a fairly
proficient daytime napper. The most wonderful and memorable sleeps of my life
have been afternoon naps. When I was in my teens, back there in the Eisenhower
era, it was my weekend custom to trot to the schoolyard in the morning and play
three-on-three half-court basketball for a couple of hours (in those days I
enjoyed an endless "second wind"). Then I'd come home for a mid-day dinner --
perhaps if the parents were feeling flush it would be a roast beef or roast pork
along with a bounty of potatoes (the most soporific of vegetables). Then I'd
retreat to my room, tune the old wood-cased Philco to a Dodgers game, perhaps
even to a double-header, and allow myself to be soothed by the rhythmic cadences
of Red Barber and Connie Desmond. A deep, profound and most satisfying nap would
then ensue -- the kind of sleep where you're so far gone that you don't know if
it's day or night, summer or winter when, hours later, you crack an exploratory
eyelid.

Where are the sleeps of yesteryear?

In my maturity, sleep has been, as I've said, a combat zone. In these last years
I've achieved weekend afternoon depth just two times. Alas and alack, it was
the drugs, the sedatives for my two surgeries that did the trick. When you're
anesthetized, at least as I experienced it, there's nothing -- no sound, no
dream, certainly no twirling -- between the moment the anesthetic kicks in and
moment it leaves. You're just not there. You're nowhere.

The ancient formula was somnus imago mortis. That is to say, sleep is the
simulacrum of death. Sleep is designed to prepare us for death. There was a time
that I would scoff at such a pious formula -- but not any more. I think that
if death is what I experienced during anesthetized sleep, why, then, there's
nothing to fear. It will be peaceful and long and very boring, but not at all
stressful.

I would like my tombstone to read, "No More Insomnia, Forever."

Title: My Life with Museums -- an Introduction
Date: October 30, 2024

In the course of my long life, I've visited hundreds of museums -- more than
I can possibly count or remember. Nor just the famous and glorious ones: how
many times, driving in unfamiliar locality, or wandering in a new city, have
I been irresistibly lured into the local landmark?  Even in the most modest
establishment, there's something new to learn and discover. Nevertheless, my
focus, lifetime, has been on art museums, where even the most iconic, most
reproduced painting or sculpture acquires new life when viewed in the flesh.
Let's face it: copies can be useful and informative, but the real thing is the
real thing -- always revelatory, and sometimes transcendent or sublime. In fact,
let me confess, in the Rembrandt Gallery at the Metropolitan Museum in New York
City, I experienced a transient version of the so-called Stendhal Syndrome. Once
and once only, but never to be forgotten.

I'm dazzled, in memory, by the vast holdings of the Borghese, the Louvre, the
Rijksmuseum, the British Museum, and an early love, the under-appreciated
Brooklyn Museum right there on Grand Army Plaza.

I'm grateful to the exhibitions and the hard-working curators that introduced
me to major painters I wouldn't otherwise have appreciated: Aelbert Cuyp and
Jan Steen at the National Gallery, Camille Pissarro at the Jewish Museum in
New York; many more. And also the specialized museums, chief among them the
Vasa Museum in Stockholm, which taught me more about life in the seventeenth
century than could a fleet of books. And a special favorite, the Corning Museum
of Glass in Corning, New York -- a most wonderful and comprehensive display of
an ancient and modern craft. But also the many local museums that I visited
during my thirty-eight cross-country migrations. Who could ever forget the Donna
Reed Museum in Denison, Ohio, or the Jell-O Museum somewhere near Buffalo, New
York?  Gosh, I'm still hoping that someday I will make it to the National
Museum of the American Coverlet in Bedford, Pennsylvania.

And then there are the troubling museums. I wonder if I will ever have the
courage to enter the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, DC. It was
disorienting enough to visit an open-air museum, somewhere in Lithuania, where
a variety of preserved structures from that country's miserable past have been
brought together to simulate a peasant village. It was a strange dispiriting
visit. After all, my ancestors as far back as we can know lived and worked in
such a sad little village. My visit was, I suppose, educational -- but also
melancholy and depressing. The village seemed not so much preserved as embalmed.

Title: Another Creative Dream
Date: November 11, 2024

I'm aware that Oscar Wilde is reputed to have said that the most terrifying
words in the English language are -- "I would like to tell about you my
dream."  But I'm going to report on last night's dream anyway, because it's so
bizarre and interesting (at least to me).

I'm sitting at a table in a restaurant with my ladylove. Actually, it's not
exactly a restaurant; it's more like a nightclub of the kind that's familiar
to me only from 30s films, not from real life. Small tables in a very large
room, patrons wearing fancy slick clothes -- men in dark evening wear, women in
shimmering white. Low chatter. Everything normal except that wandering among
the tables is a giant African lion, male, with an intimidating mane and a long
swishing tail.

I say to my lady, "I don't like the looks of this. That lion could easily carry
off a small child."  End of dream, or at least, end of what I remember.

Once again, it's clear that my nighttime self is far more imaginative than my
pedestrian daytime self, who would never in a million years have thought to
introduce a whopping big lion from the Serengeti into an ordinary restaurant.
I'm not nearly so visionary. Does the dream have any meaning? An obvious
interpretation is that even places safe for recreation can be dangerous.  Or,
conversely, that dangers can be domesticated and made safe. Take your pick.

Title: Deaths, 2024
Date: December 26, 2024

The year got off to an early start when Brad Gombas died on December 16. Brad
was the brother of my late brother-in-law Allen Gombas. I knew him in the
1970s, when he was a young man; he lived most of his life in New Mexico where
he established a career as a builder and craftsman. I wasn't in touch except
through the extended family communication chain. On December 26, my friend
since  1965 Ray Pike died at age 90. Ray was an accomplished journalist. Nancy
Pike and AGP were the young mothers in a playgroup that included the infants
NGP and Nina Pike -- in an earlier life it now seems. We saw Ray and Nancy at
least once a year for many decades. Then on the last day of the year Sue Palmer
died (peacefully, I'm told), after many many years of illness and pain. She was
a superbly talented artist and a friend, though not a close one, since 1969. In
February, we lost Nancy Levitt. Not a close friend (wife of a colleague) but a
long time acquaintance  -- a regular at the Takacs, seated just in front of
us these past 30 years. Sheldon "Spike" Cohen, later Alan Mills, a friend from
the PS 217 schoolyard, died in March. Esophogeal cancer that had metastasized.
A long drawn out death, with many months of hospice care. In May. Bill Wood
died. He was a world-famous scientist and a friend. It must be 20 years now
since his wife, Renate Wood, a poet, left us. Bill had been in a relationship
with another old acquaintance, Marilyn Krysl, for these many years. Marilyn
died a couple of months after Bill; she had been in "memory care" for several
months. During the summer, we lost two former English colleagues. The first to
go was congenial Chuck Squier, at the age of 91, who had moved to Boise, Idaho
to be near his children; he was a friend and also a long time neighbor on the
Hill; the second: nice guy Doug Burger. In August I discovered that Anatol Anton
had died earlier in the year. I knew Anatol when he was a member of the CU
Department of Philosophy in the 70s or 80s, but hadn't been in touch since he
left Boulder to return to San Francisco. Anatol was a cheerful bear of a man,
far to  the political left, who grew up in Greenwich Village with a semi-famous
painter for a father. Fred Litto, classmate from P S 217 and Erasmus, died in
Brazil, where he had lived for 50 years; we always planned to get together, but
it never happened. Another PS 217 friend, Tony Sogluizzo, died in the spring
but I didn't find out about it until much later. He was a genuinely decent and
gentle man who had a good career as a librarian. Late in December, we attended
the dignified funeral of Bill Belew, husband of Lynn's friend Sharon Belew. 
And so the year came to an end.

Title: Cornell English Then and Now -- 1
Date: January 09, 2025

Here's a truth that blows my freakin' mind: since I earned my B. A. in English
from Cornell University in 1960, sixty-five years have come and gone. Glaciers
have melted and rivers have changed their course since, way back when, in a
prior millennium, I was first introduced to serious literature -- to Chaucer and
Milton and George Eliot.

My professors in those far-away-and-long-ago days were exclusively male and for
the most part veterans of WW2 or the Korean war. They wrote definitive scholarly
articles for the Philological Quarterly or for Modern Philology; they published
learned monographs on canonical poets and novelists; and they taught courses
with such forthright titles as The Seventeenth Century and Wordsworth and
Coleridge. Although I was an indifferent student before I arrived at Cornell,
I found an intellectual home in the Department of English. Inasmuch as I did
not have a brain for rigorous science or for the tough analytic philosophy that
was then in fashion, I was fortunate that the work of English suited my limited
abilities -- curiosity, patience, a good memory, and something of a feel for
language.

Just yesterday (and what, pray tell, prompted me?), I took a peek at the
current website of Cornell's English Department. (In the index-card 1950s, when
the manual typewriter was the acme of technology, the word "website" would
have signified a dark corner colonized by spiders.) Even at first glance, the
2025 Cornell website said to me "very very different, very 'now'." While an
occasional word or phrase was recognizable, it was the novelty -- the modernity,
I guess -- that flared from the electronic page and dazzled mine eyne. Time
marches on, no doubt, but whether it marches boldly forward or plunges over a
cliff remains to be established.

First of all, it's no longer the Department of English. It's now, hurrah!,
the "Department of Literatures in English." What a welcome redefinition --
an assertion that English is a world language and that it houses a world
literature. Nowadays, if I sit down with a work of fiction, I'm just as likely
to read a novel by a writer from Africa or India or Australia as one from the
British isles or North America. There's not a reason in the world why Chinua
Achebe or Abdulrazak Gurnah should not be studied in an English Department. I
respect this shift in focus and I regret that my 1950s Beowulf-to-T. S. Eliot
English department was so parochial, so provincial. I can only admire the fact
that the Department of Literatures in English has annexed to itself whole
continents of writing -- a case of academic imperialism that this time seems
wholly right and just.

The website also reveals that, in a nation in which the study of the humanities
in higher education is at risk, Cornell's English is a huge thriving enterprise.
There are fifty-one people on permanent staff, almost all of professorial
rank. Of this number, twenty-seven -- or slightly more than half -- are women.
And among those pictured on the site, a significant number are "of color."
Undoubtedly, the present department is a far more representative collection of
individuals than my 1950s faculty. Moreover, the chair, the associate chair,
the director of undergraduate studies, the director of graduate students, and
the director of writing are all women. It may once have been the case that the
occasional female interloper was a token for display only, but not so now.

And what do these handsome and distinguished men and women study? Fortunately
for me, members of the faculty list their areas of concentration. Most claim
two or three specialties, some as many as five; a few recalcitrant individuals
list none, leaving me to wonder whether they are polymaths or just ornery
uncooperative academics. Among the fifty-one, the single expertise most commonly
claimed is "cultural studies." This preponderance set me back a bit, because
"cultural studies" is not a term I recognize nor one that existed, as far as I
know, in the 1950s, when the word "culture" was synonymous with "civilization"
-- sometimes just Western Civilization -- and when "cultured" meant something
equivalent to "educated" and possibly even "socially established." But now,
apparently, "cultural studies" is, and I quote a respected source, "an academic
field  that... investigates how cultural practices relate to wider systems of
power. These include ideology, class structures, national formations, ethnicity,
sexual orientation and gender." Am I correct, and is it possible, for me to
infer from this litany of nouns that "cultural practices" comprehends just about
everything that we as a society say or do? Clearly the Department of Literatures
in English lays claim to a heck of a lot of intellectual territory -- and that
it is a far more aggressive entity than is revealed by its mere absorption of
Anglophone novels. I was initially suspicious of these extensive claims, but
after reflecting a while I recognized that, if I set to one side the self-
aggrandizing listing of ideology, ethnicity, class... etc,), cultural studies
may in practice simply bring to the forefront such elements as imperialism and
nationhood in Robinson Crusoe or race and gender in Othello. Wouldn't it be
comforting if "cultural studies" is at least in part merely traditional wine in
spiffy new bottles? I, for one, certainly hope so.

After cultural studies, it is "literary theory" that claims the largest group
of adherents -- thirteen, or about a quarter of the faculty. This revelation
surprised me because I would have guessed that "theory" had long since gone the
way of the aurochs and the mouflon. "Theory" had its herd of enthusiasts in its
obscurantist heyday in the last century, yet it seems to be alive and kicking at
Cornell -- but only, I suspect, as a vestigial remnant of an earlier time and
only among the more senior members of the Department.

Following "theory" in popularity among the professoriate are the seven members
who stake their claim to "gender studies." Six other say "African-American." The
nine who announce a specialty in creative writing may not know that they are the
successors and the beneficiaries of the late revered Professor James McConkey.
Not a single member of the faculty offers "Shakespeare" or "Milton" as an area
of expertise. I do not doubt that the study of gender and African-American and
Asian-American literatures is a good thing, but I would have wished that the
authors of the finest works of art in all of Anglophonia be accorded equivalent
attention and status.

Would a reincarnated Youthful Me elect take a degree from such a faculty? 
I'm skeptical, but I can't say for sure because I don't know whether or not,
in the classroom, the scrupulous examination of literature and ideas has been
undermined by transitory and faddish ideologies. I must confess that the biases
of the website make me feel old and wary and out of touch. And tired.

Well then, what does take place in the classroom?

Let's sample some evidence.

In days of yore, I enrolled in "Elizabethan and Jacobean Drama," a course taught
by the distinguished scholar and teacher David Novarr. The course was organized
as a chronological march from Kyd and Marlowe in the 1580s right through to Ford
and Massinger -- the last playwrights of significance before the theaters went
dark in 1642. I remember savoring some delightful comedies by Ben Jonson and
Francis Beaumont and also a couple of ferociously brilliant tragedies by Thomas
Middleton -- writings, I suspect, that 2020s English majors are not destined
to encounter -- even though an acquaintance with these plays is essential
background for understanding the timeless works of Shakespeare.

There's no equivalent course in the present curriculum, but there is an
analogue, and it appears in the catalogue of offerings thusly:

ENGL 3240. Blood Politics:  Comparative Renaissance Drama

Blood is everywhere. From vampire shows to video games, our culture seems to be
obsessed with it. The course examines the power of "blood" in the early modern
period as a figure that continues to capture our imagination, not only as a
marker of racial, religious, and sexual difference and desire, but also as a
dramatic player in its own right. How does a politics of blood appear on stage
when populations are being expelled and colonized for reasons (mis)understood in
terms of blood?.... Topics include honor, revenge, purity, the body, sexuality,
conversion, and death.

The course description itself is a mess -- both incomprehensible and
meretricious. I'm shocked by the catchpenny pandering. Do 2020s teachers need to
lure students into their classrooms with "vampires" and "videos?" The assertion
that "blood is a dramatic player in its own right" is nonsense. The description
reads like advertising copy for a cheesy low-budget horror flick playing at some
louche all-night grind house.

Moreover, "blood" isn't "everywhere." Goodness gracious!

I'm afraid that these entrancing plays are doomed to be put through the
"cultural studies" homogenizer. Or "theorized" out of all compass.

Ah, well.

Back in 1960, I had a summer job in Ithaca and therefore happened to be loafing
around the campus when the University hosted its returning alumni. Among the
returnees were the old folks  -- some few of them members of the class of
1895 -- who had walkered and wheel-chaired to their Sixty-Fifth. Geezers, I
thought. It's sobering to realize that those codgers were the same age -- 86 --
as I am now. Should I  return to Ithaca this coming spring, for my very own
Sixty-Fifth, I will be perceived by the young 'uns exactly as I observed those
Class of 1895 guys: as ancient and irrelevant.

It follows, therefore, that my reservations about the 2025 English curriculum
have their exact parallel in the 1895ers perspective on my 1960 curriculum. It's
not hard to imagine that they -- I mean the members of the class of 1895 --
who had been educated in elocution and Old Norse, would have been shocked and
perhaps outraged by the 1950s "modern" curriculum that I found so enticing and
illuminating.

And now, because I don't want to go full curmudgeon and become the kind of
superannuated guy who shakes his ebony stick at the modern world and deplores
the decline of civilization, I'm going to make an effort to find out what's
really going on in 2025. I have therefore set myself the task of reading a
representative sample of the books written by members of the present-day English
faculty.

I'll report on my studies right here.

Stay tuned.

[January 18] Bernhard Starr writes:  "Vivian, you are right about the course
description. It's a disgrace. It's badly written and ridiculous. Why didn't you
include the name of the prof. who wrote it?  He/she needs to be exposed. What
"populations are being expelled and colonized" by Volpone or The Changeling? 
And did you look other course descriptions -- are they equally silly?  What's
worst about the course description is that it doesn't respect the plays that the
class is going to examine. They're not important interesting dramas to the
teacher -- they're just fodder for an ideology.

[January 19] Vivian de St. Vrain replies: "Mr. Starr, I didn't identify the
author of the course description because the website doesn't identify him/her.
Just as well. Also, I didn't read other course descriptions though I might do so
in the future. I think you're correct that the course description does not
respect the dramas or their authors. Which is, as you suggest, mighty
disappointing."

[January 19] Bernhard Starr replies:  "I think I'd rather study Old Norse."

[February 4] Thurston Dale replies:  "I guess I'm a geezer, too (Cornell, '65).
I'm glad I majored in English before criticism turned crazy. Great teachers --
Mizener, Abrams, Parrish, Novarr."

[March 17] Anatole Miles Webber writes: "Vivian, you were naive back in the
1950s and you're still naive now. You assume that the Cornell English Department
of your youth, 65 years ago, was normative and normal. You were then and still
are oblivious to the fact that the Department's 1950 curriculum was the product
of stress and change and compromise. Try to remember that there were at least
three forces at work and that various faculty members had various degrees of
commitment to them. The first group was the oldest -- the traditionalist who
studied, as they had always done, literature as history and biography and
philology. Get the text and the context right was their primary concern. Then
there were the 'new critics" -- heirs to Leavis and Scrutiny in England and the
southern agrarians (Ransom, Tate, Warren) in the US. But the main intellectual
current riling English Departments were the fierce critics out of New York
(mostly Jewish) circles (Kazin, Trilling, Fiedler, Paul Goodman, Irving Howe,
etc). In retrospect, even though Cornell brought both Lionel Trilling and
Cleanth Brooks to Ithaca during your and my years there, the new winds made
little impression on our education. Cornell was peaceful, isolated and non-
ideological. It appears from your writing that you preferred it that way and
still do. It was stable until the theory people brought in novelty and confusion
and excitement.

[April 15] Parnell Pratt replies: "And also monumental pretension. And eventual
collapse and failure."

[May 3] Lance Birdseye (Lt., USAF) writes: "What a funny website this is. Hey,
folks, join the real world."

Title: Cornell English Then and Now -- 2
Date: January 12, 2025

To begin my project of getting a fix on Cornell's Department of Literatures in
English, I attempted to read Professor Jeremy Braddock's Collecting as Modernist
Practice (Johns Hopkins, 2012).

My plan is to read these Cornell contributions to knowledge with as much empathy
and as little prejudice as I can muster.

Despite my good will, I got off to a bad start. The title of Braddock's book,
Collecting as Modernist Practice, struck me as dispiriting and uninviting. It's
an uncompromising coterie title that seems to say to me (and to every general
reader), "I don't care whether you read this book or not." And indeed the copy
that I borrowed from the university library had sat on the shelf unthumbed and
pristine for the twelve years since its publication. Perhaps it's the minuscule
typeface.

Collecting as Modernist Practice is not a page-turner. I found it rough
going, and I now confess that I read closely only the introduction and one
chapter -- and skimmed the rest.  Braddock studies the work of collecting and
anthologizing art and poetry in the modernist (mostly 1920s) period. The chapter
that I studied, The New Negro in the Field of Collections, was enlightening
and I was glad to have read it. Braddock is an indefatigable researcher.
Sentence after sentence is supported by extensive archival work and a plenty of
footnotes. I do wish that the author was as interested in the art and mystery
of literature as he is in literature's reception. Collecting as Modernist
Practice might be more at home in a department of sociology.

Braddock's prose style is awkward and forbidding. He loves long static sentences
with complex subjects and predicates that are sutured with weak verbs. In the
pages that I studied, I rarely encountered a metaphor or any other figure of
speech. Braddock is also partial to newly-coined polysyllabic abstractions that
he may think add heft to his thesis, but which in fact frustrate his readership:
minoritarian, identitarianism, anthologization, narrativizing. On the whole,
entirely too much suffixizationality.

I will always be grateful to Braddock for introducing me to Witter Bynner's 1917
Spectra hoax, of which I was ignorant, and especially for acquainting me with
the fabulous name of one of poets that Bynner invented: Anne Knish.

[January 13] Oksana Sartry writes:  "Vivian, I don't think that you're entirely
fair to Braddock. It's true that his prose style is imperfect, but remember that
the book is most likely his dissertation.  And for a diss. it's quite good. I
also think that when he writes about poetry, he's quite thoughtful and
insightful."

[January 13] Marianne Morrison, Ph. D. writes:  "Vivian, your too harsh about
Braddock's vocabulary. Those words that you poke fun at are the regular
vocabulary for people of his generation; your out of touch.

[January 14] Oksana Sartry replies: "I wonder why Johns Hopkins published this
diss. in its modernism series. Good diss., but immature book."

[January 17] Sean R. Fine writes:  "I'm interested in modernism, but frankly,
this book is absolutely unreadable. Whatever value it has is buried beneath tons
of jargon. Gives academia a bad name."

Title: Words of My Life -- Poop
Date: January 20, 2025

Nowadays, the ordinary meaning of the noun "poop" is feces. Perhaps because
"poop" is a nursery word, it is apparently less offensive than "crap" or "shit."
And yet less infantile than kaka or doodoo.

But "poop" did not refer to the work of the lavatory until about 1720. Nor do I
remember it being in general use during my childhood.

I myself first encountered the word "poop" in the escapist seagoing novels
to which I was addicted as an adolescent: the Bounty trilogy, the Hornblower
series, Treasure Island, Mr Midshipman Easy, and the buccaneering books of
Rafael Sabatini, Jeffery Farnol, and many many others whose names have been
long forgotten. In these romantic novels, it was often the case that a handsome
young midshipman and a pretty maiden, her golden hair cascading over her shapely
shoulders, would flirt while leaning against the taffrail of the "poop." Had
I known or suspected that "poop" carried stercoraceous overtones, my budding
fantasy life would have turned to dreck. Thank goodness I knew nothing.

The poop deck, I soon deduced, was the roof of the cabin built into the aft of
a sailing vessel. Why "poop?" From the French word for stern, poupe, itself
derived from the Latin puppis (also signifying stern). Wherefore puppis? No one
knows -- the word has no analogues in other ancient languages.

Shakespeare used the naval "poop" in the celebrated passage in Anthony and
Cleopatra in which Anthony was greeted by Cleopatra. It's the epitome of
classical conspicuous consumption as well as Shakespearean eloquence.

Title: Cornell English Then and Now -- 3A
Date: January 25, 2025

I am absolutely buffaloed by Laura Brown's book, The Counterhuman
Imaginary (Cornell UP, 2023).

The title is a puzzle. Why does the adjective come after the noun? And what does
the word "counterhuman" mean?  (One hundred and forty-six pages to go and I'm
already off balance. I'm worried that if I can't understand the title I'm going
to have a heck of a difficult time with the content.)

I took a guess that the coinage "counterhuman" would signify something
monstrous or terrifying, like a vampire, troll or ogre. But I was not even
in the ballpark. "Counterhuman," I have now discovered, is a term of art in
contemporary literary criticism that refers to everything that is not human:
not only animals, natural phenomena such as storms and earthquakes, but also
"things" or objects -- anything that is constructed or manufactured. Not
"inhuman' -- just not human. (But why "counter" rather than "non" human?)

Moreover, the word "imaginary," which I have for a lifetime understood to
be an adjective signifying what is not material but rather a product of the
human mind, as for example, art and literature and dreams, has also undergone
metamorphosis. According to wiki, the adjective-turned-noun "imaginary" "is the
set of values, institutions, laws, and symbols common to a particular social
group and the corresponding society through which people imagine their social
whole.” That's a deal of territory, but I think I understand: "imaginary" is
essentially a synonym for what I might, naively, have called "culture." (Might
an alternative to The Counterhuman Imaginary be The Culture of Things? It's a
more inviting title and much less pretentious.)

But now I'm stopped in my tracks. The "imaginary, it appears, is "the work of a
particular social group." How in the world, then, do the "counterhuman," who are
incapable of thought, possibly generate "a structure of ideas?" Pots and pans
and volcanoes and marmosets don't have brains that think or speak, except when
we humans attribute such traits to them.

In a whimsical moment, Duke Senior, in As You Like It, proposed that there are
"tongues in trees, books in the running brooks, sermons in stones." Am I to
understand that this author takes seriously what Shakespeare regarded as an
ironic jokey extravagance? Gosh, I hope not.

I think I now get the point: Laura Brown, the prestigious Class of 1916
Professor of English at Cornell University, intends to defend a paradox. She
will explain to me how non-humans, things without an intelligence, can create
a culture. I'd better pay close attention. Or perhaps the author means to
advance the trivial but more sensible and less sensational idea that humans can
attribute culture to animals and things.

Nevertheless, I must say what's on my mind -- what a deliberately off-putting
title. It's clearly designed to repel the general reader, someone like myself,
and to speak only to coterie fellow-travelers who might understand either
or both of the words "counterhuman" and "imaginary." Not a large potential
audience.

Do I have a chip on my shoulder as I turn from the title to the Introduction   .
Yes, I believe I do                                                            .

[January 25] Marianne Morrison, Ph.D. writes:  "Vivian, you should not go on
with this. Your so prejudiced against this writer that you cant give her a fair
hearing."

[January 25] Vivian de St. Vrain responds: "Marianne, I'm trying my best to be
fair and honest."

[January 26] Petal Rivera writes: "Vivian, I think you're naive to suggest a
less pretentious title. I hate to say it, but the point is not to avoid
pretense, but to be pretentious. No modesty in this book."

[January 27] J C Occhiogrosso writes:  "Vivian, you're being deliberately
obtuse. C'mon, it's not so difficult."

[February 4] Vivian de St. Vrain responds:  "Ok, J C, if it's so easy, why don't
you suggest a better title."

[February 12] Winifred A. Walker writes: "Like it or not, this is typical
academic jargon. If you want to read this book, you must master the idiom."]

================================================================================

Source: 2025/01/cornell-english-then-and-now-3b

Title: Cornell English Then and Now: 3B
Date: January 30, 2025

I'm still trying to come to terms with Laura Brown's book, The Counterhuman
Imaginary. I've wrestled the title to a draw, and now I'm going to take a crack
at the Introduction. Is this task a good use of my limited time?

Let me quote a sentence that I take to be the very heart of the book and the
heart of the problem. It's a doozy.

"Human story telling is found to provide a subtle scenario for affirming the
other-than-human, based on an imputed commonality that replaces human priority
with cross-species inclusivity that transcends the human."

Laura Brown's prose reads as if it were first drafted in German and then
rendered into English by Google Translate.

It takes effort, but once you penetrate its peculiar idiom, it makes a kind of
sense. For those of my readers who are still with me, let me try to parse this
sentence. I suspect It may mean something like, "human beings project thoughts
and feelings onto animals and objects."

"Human story telling" [that is, literature]

"is found to provide" [the passive "is found," should be deleted even though it
functions as a compliment to the person (i.e. the author herself) to whom this
insight has been revealed.]

"a subtle scenario" [I don't know exactly what the phrase "subtle scenario"
means; nor do I think that anyone else does.]

"based on an imputed commonality " [I understand "commonality" because I know
that humans and animals share many features. I don't see the necessity for the
word 'imputed"; imputed by whom? who other than humans can "impute."]

"that replaces human priority" [i.e. there should be no preference for humans
over animals and rocks, despite the paradox that humans and not animals can
think about the equivalence.]

"with cross-species inclusivity" ["inclusivity" is implicit in the previous
rejection of "human priority." Wow, these abstract nouns do pile up
(commonality, priority, inclusivity). Suggested simplification: "that includes
other species"]

"that transcends the human.]. Transcends, in this final clause, smuggles into
the argument a new idea, because "to transcend" means "to surpass." The claim
now, as this snake of a sentence winds its weary way to conclusion, is that
the meaning that humans attach to things is greater than the humans who do the
attaching. At least I think that is what it may mean.]

So after completing this investigation, I think that the claim is that
literature projects ideas onto animals and also things. And sometimes these
projections illuminate and enhance both things and animals.

I'm exhausted. I had planned to discuss the Introduction at greater length, but
I've had enough. Instead of proceeding with the introduction, I'm going to try
to understand the chapter on Robinson Crusoe (a novel that I first read as a boy

Title: Cornell English Then and Now -- 3C
Date: January 31, 2025

I'm a lifelong fan of Defoe's Robinson Crusoe. I love all the shipboard stuff,
the adventure, the exoticism, Crusoe's self-reliance, his  psychological
complexity, his religious ponderings, and especially the recapitulation of
nascent capitalism on the island. I'm as entranced as ever by the attempt to
domesticate goats, by his attempt to build a boat, by the single footprint on
the beach, by Friday's escape and the battle with the cannibals. With a little
effort, I have been able to set to one side the novel's faults: the author's
careless repetitions, his appalling colonialist racism, those last anticlimactic
adventures and the return to England, the unnatural absence of sexuality or
passion, the paranoia and the unnecessary violence. Massive defects, yes indeed,
but Robinson Crusoe is still a great eternally wonderful mishmash of a novel.

So it came as a surprise to read Laura Brown's one-sentence summary of the
novel in The Counterhuman Imaginary: "Robinson Crusoe enacts a self-creative
other- than-human vitality by setting matter in motion through the persistent
repetition of irresistible succession."

Maybe Robinson Crusoe does "enact" and "set matter in motion" -- I don't know,
can't say. But I do not plan to undergo the pain and woe of making sense out of
her ungainly and mystifying sentence. For Laura Brown, Robinson Crusoe is not
the pleasure and challenge that it has been for three hundred years -- it's just
raw material for her dry-as-dust ideological machine.

And a waste of my precious time.

[February 1] Bernhard Starr writes:  "Brown transforms the gold of literature
into the dross of criticism."

[February 1] Professor Merlon Crenelle, Southwestern Louisiana U., writes:
"Vivian, you're totally unfair. You take one sentence out of the chapter and
make fun of it. You don't even bother to see how the sentence is related to the
larger argument. You owe Professor Laura Brown an apology. You're
irresponsible."

[February 1] Marianne Morrison, Ph. D. writes: "Vivian, I agree with Mr. (Ms.?)
Crenelle. Youve not tried to understand Brown. Your lazy."

[February 2] Vivian de St. Vrain responds:  "Whether I'm lazy or not, Brown
writes in an obscure code. Why should I have to try to crack the code?  Why
can't she write in English? She's a Professor of English, for goodness sake.
It's not my job to figure out what she's trying to say; it's her job to make it
plain."

[February 2] Sean R. Fine writes: "It makes me wonder about the "imaginary" in
which Laura Brown seems to thrive. Closed, cloistered, self-congratulatory."

[February 3] Thurman Valentino (SVDGA) writes: "I think that Vivian de St. Vrain
is absolutely correct not to try to figure out what that sentence means. It's
not a reader's responsibility. My opinion is that Laura Brown is smart enough to
produce a complicated argument, but not smart enough to make complicated
argument clear."

[February 3] Michael F. Bristol writes: "Or maybe, dear Viv, you're not smart
enough to figure it all out."

[February 4] Vivian de St. Vrain replies: "OK, Bristol, if you're so smart why
don't you just tell us exactly what "persistent repetition of irresistible
succession" means."

[February 4] J C Occhiogrosso suggests: "One thing regularly follows another?"

[February 7] Beulah Withee writes:  "The problem is not with just that one
sentence. It's that whole paragraphs and pages are filled with such difficult
sentences. After each of these, a reader has to pause and interpret before going
on to the next one. It puts far too much burden on the reader."

[February 9] Gabriel Cussen III writes: "I tried to read the book but I didn't
get very far. Do visitors to this blog remember the criticism of academic
articles and books: "What is new is not true and what is true is not new." This
book is even worse, because what's true is utterly trivial."

[February 9] Bernhard Starr responds: "Gabriel Cussen, I agree with you. 
There's no there there."

[February 13]. Herbert Lecovin (Cornell '61) writes: "The important question is
what is going on in her classroom. Does she lecture in this dialect and does she
expect her students to write as she does?

Title: On the Mall
Date: February 02, 2025

After a severe cold snap, it's a welcome warm Friday afternoon. We're on the
semi-famous mall enjoying a long-postponed promenade. A woman, in her seventies,
stops us. "Can you help me?" I'm embarrassed to confess that my first reaction
to her plea was that she must be one of our many panhandlers. But not so. She
continued: "It's my husband, he has Parkinson's, can you help me get him to
the car?" He, Bill, was standing frozen, unable to speak, unable to move, his
balance precarious. "Two years ago," she said,"he was robust. He's having a bad
day." And indeed he was. I took Bill's left arm under the shoulder, his wife
the other arm. Lynn grasped my left hand and carried Bill's useless stick, and
together we shuffled him infinitely slowly and gently to the curb. "I thought we
could go out for coffee," she said, "but I was wrong." While we stood quietly,
Bill's wife went to fetch their car which was parked only fifty feet away. She
backed it to where we stood (Lynn now supporting Bill on his right side). We
helped Bill into passenger seat. His wife buckled him in.

I asked her, "do you have help?'  "Yes, she said, "friends." "Do you have
children?" "Yes, but they don't live nearby." She thanked us generously and
drove off.

I was sad for both him and her. He, because his dreadful disease is going to
kill him very soon. And she, because her life now consists of morning-to-night
care taking -- in bed, out of bed; dressing and undressing; into a comfortable
chair for a while and then and out of it; brief awkward walks; three times a
day lifting the spoon to his lips. And what's known in the care taking trade as
"toileting."

I'm convinced that she doesn't know how bad he is. Caretakers are always behind,
always catching up. If she knew, she'd have had a wheelchair at the ready. He
needs constant care-- not just family or friends, but professional assistance.
Can they afford a place in a memory care facility or nursing home? Not everyone
can.

Afterward the incident, we went to a coffee shop -- a normalizing activity for
us. But, sitting there, I was shaken. Certainly profound sadness for the ill
husband and the encumbered wife, and in addition a touch of personal PTSD.

And then the inevitable pondering. "To this favor must we come." It's not just
Bill. We're all doomed -- even that cute infant in the next booth, rapturously
examining her fingertips. A host of diseases, some as bad as Parkinson's,
waiting at the door, waiting.

I've never visited my parents' graves. I don't even know where they are buried.
I've been told that my father is buried between my mother and his sister Mollie,
but I don't know where they lie. I have a paper that tells me where my sister
Susan, who died as an infant, is buried, but I've never been there. I don't know
where my brother Eugene lies.

I know exactly where Althea and Phyllis are buried -- just up the hill, under
the big maple. I visit once a year and bring a stone to place on their markers.
Phyllis's is a bronze plaque affixed to a stone; Althea's is just the capital
letter A and her dates (1939-2016). It's what she wanted.

Dan Goss is buried in Staten Island somewhere. I visited once, with Althea. A's
mother, Grandma Anne, wanted her ashes divided in half and spread, part with
Phyllis and part with Dan.  She has no gravestone, nor wanted one.

I have told my family that I want my tombstone to read, "No more insomnia,
forever." But that's a joke.

Nowadays it's the custom to scatter the ashes on a favorite place, which is
nice, but there's no place to visit. Especially no place for those buried at
sea.

Title: Mary Antin, The Promised Land (1911)
Date: February 12, 2025

I have just read Mary Antin's autobiography, The Promised Land, first published
in 1911. It is a book that I should have known much earlier in my life but only
discovered a week or so ago. The larger part The Promised Land is the familiar
story of immigrant life in a new country -- the author's struggles to adapt to
an unfamiliar culture, her achievements and triumphs, and her unabashed flag-
waving patriotism. More strange and more informative, is the picture of life
"old country," as viewed through the eyes of a young woman.  Antin grew up
in provincial, impoverished Polotzk, a small city now in Belarus, but which
at various times has been administered and exploited by the ungentle hands of
Varangians, Poles, Lithuanians, and Germans. During Antin's youth (she was
born in 1881), Polotsk was a part of Russia. It was not a good time to be a
Jew in Polotsk or indeed anywhere within the Pale of Settlement. (Her story is
especially pertinent because I myself have a hunk of Belarusian-Jewish genes --
as do, therefore, my children and grandchildren.)

Antin's life in that bleak part of the world was, I think, triply suppressed.
In political freedom and standard of living, by the Russians; in domestic and
personal relations, by oppressive Hasidism and the rabbis who enforced its
demanding rules; and thirdly, because Antin had the misfortune to be born
female. She had every reason to leave Polotsk behind.

Antin recognized early that she was a "prisoner" because "the Czar" commanded
Jews to stay within the Pale. She "accepted ill usage from the Gentiles as one
accepts the weather. The world was made in a certain way and I had to live
in it." Polotsk was a place of constant ethnic strife fueled by dangerous
superstitions. "The Gentiles said that we had killed their god and that we used
the blood of murdered Christian children in the Passover." The Jewish community
of Polotsk was always under threat of violence -- "the peasants would fill
themselves with vodka, and set out to kill Jews. They attacked with knives and
clubs and scythes and axes, killed them or tortured them, and burned their
houses. This was called a pogrom." There was also the threat of the draft,
where recruits served until the age of 41. (My maternal grandfather, Joseph
(Usilewski) Green told me that he had been drafted into the Russian army for a
twenty-year term; I now understand that he must have entered the army at age
21. In 1904 Grandpa, age 26, deserted and came to America. Good move.) Some men
escaped the draft by paying crippling bribes to conscription officers. Taxation
was onerous. "Peace cost so much a year in Polotsk."

Antin also explains that as stifling as was the Czar, the rules of religion were
harsher. "Within the wall raised by the vigilance of the police, another wall,
higher, thicker, more impenetrable was the religion of  the Jews." The rabbis
favored piety (as they conceived it) to independence or freedom or prosperity
and they enforced the most minute regulations and prohibitions of all actions
day and night. Antin tells of a wife who found a blemish on the chicken she was
preparing to cook. She consulted the rabbi who pronounced the chicken traif.
That night, the family went hungry.

Polotsk seems to have had no dissenters or freethinkers, or at least none that
Antin notes. I imagine that those who challenged orthodoxy either left of their
own accord or were shunned.

Girls were offered little outside the family kitchen or nursery.  They were
expected to marry young and produce many children, especially sons who could
distinguish the family with their Torah studies. Schooling was discouraged for
girls, who were taught to pronounce but not understand Hebrew.

At its prime, Polotsk had 60,000 inhabitants, perhaps 60 per cent of whom were
Jewish. There were twenty-three synagogues. Today there are no synagogues and no
Jews.

When dealing with a child, always make your appeal to the better side of his/her
nature.

No one owns anything; the most you can say is that you have a lifetime lease on
it.

As far as I can tell, I am just a long link in a chain going from nowhere to
nowhere.

If you lose your man, go directly to the basket.

Never omit an opportunity to do a favor for a friend, and never be embarrassed
to accept a favor from a friend.  People like to help one another.

Anyone can make money if he makes it the sole business of his life to do so.

When the stock market is going up, everyone is  a genius.

The czars and the rabbis kept our family in darkness for a thousand years. It
took hundreds of years for us to fight our way out of the ghetto, and they (the
orthodox and the Hasids) want to put themselves back in it.

Don't forget to wash behind your ears.

Title: Cornell English Then and Now - 4
Date: February 15, 2025

Vivian de St. Vrain writes: "Cathy Caruth is the Frank H. T. Rhodes Professor
of English at Cornell University. She has written quite a number of books but
the one that I selected for this Cornell English Department project, partly
because of its engaging title, is Literature in the Ashes of History. Alas, the
title is misleading, because Caruth doesn't concern herself with literature in
any recognizable way. Rather, the book investigates psychoanalytic theories,
especially of loss and trauma. Although in an earlier part of my life I read
and studied all of Freud's major works, I found this book to be far too subtle
and abstruse for my downright brain. I have therefore asked assistance from
my long time friend A. Barnett Langdale, Jr. Barney is a very smart medical
school graduate, a therapist, and psychologist (though not a psychoanalyst) and
a person for whose opinions I have great regard."

A. Barnett Langdale, Jr., writes: "Thanks, Viv, for entrusting me with the of
task of reading and evaluating this book. I fear that I shall disappoint you,
because I had a hard time understanding Literature in the Ashes of History. In
order to profit from reading this book, one must accept certain assumptions
about Sigmund Freud and about the art of psychoanalysis. Caruth sets out to
modify and reinterpret the famous fort-da episode in Freud's Beyond the Pleasure
Principle. This became an immediate problem for me, because I have never
agreed with Freud's analysis of his grandson's play -- perhaps because his
interpretation clashes with what I have  learned from long years of closely
observing children in my professional practice. Events such as fort-da can
generate a spectrum of meanings and a variety of interpretations equally as
valid or invalid as Freud's. As I result, I read this book with a great deal of
resistance to its assumptions and their ramifications.

Many of the arguments that Caruth creates ("suggests" is her usual verb) are
too arcane for me. She carries her readers away from common sense. She inhabits
an intellectual world in which every event or fact carries its own negation.
And that negation bears a consequent negation, and so on ad infinitum, like the
images in a pair of opposed mirrors, leading inevitably to a situation in which,
as Macbeth says, "function/ Is smothered in surmise and nothing is/ But what is
not."

Vivian de St. Vrain responds: 'Many thanks, Barney. In the course of reading
Literature in the Ashes of History, I came to think that its procedure is, in
a sense, a lot like theology. If you make certain assumptions about god and
angels and creation, you can generate a fantastically complicated superstructure
of ideas that has absolutely no relations to the world in which we dwell. This
book is not theology, it's psychoanalytic theory, but it shares a similar
procedure, because, despite its highly-elaborated complexity, its assumptions
are unprovable if not absolutely false. Intelligence and sophistication can
take you only so far. I'm afraid that in the end, there's no more heft in this
kind of study than there is in theology -- the "subject without an object."
Ultimately, it's Cloud-Cuckoo-Land."

[February 15] Walter Balletto writes: "Before you dismiss this intelligent book
out of hand, you might want to read the ecstatic review by Michael Levine in The
Undecidable Unconscious: A Journal of Deconstruction and Psychoanalysis. It's
online. Levine makes the effort to read carefully, which neither you nor your
friend Langdale do."

[February 15] Vivian de St. Vrain responds: "At first I thought that Mr.
Balletto was being ironic, inventing an improbable self-parodic name for an
academic journal. Who would believe there is actually such a publication? But I
looked it up and, by golly, it's real. Moreover, it's published, mirabile dictu,
by the University of Nebraska Press!!!"

[February 16] Janet Rich asks: "You haven't said anything about Caruth's
presence in a Department of English. Shouldn't she relocate to Psychology?"

[February 16] Herbert Lecovin (Cornell '61) asks: "I wonder how many of Caruth's
colleagues can read and understand her work?"

[February 16] Anita Robillard writes: "Caruth is on an island, and instead of
welcoming friends to join her, she erects walls and barricades to keep them
out."

[February 17] Joel Salzberg writes: "What do you mean by "island." She teaches
at Cornell; Cornell's not an island."

[February 17] Anita Robillard writes: "It's a metaphor, Joel."

[February 17] Herman S. Levi writes: "I don't understand why you compare
psychoanalysis to theology. They're nothing alike."

[February 18] Vivian de St. Vrain responds: "Professor Levi, let me refer you to
a familiar passage in the Leviathan, where Hobbes writes of "names that signifie
nothing, but are taken up and learned by rote from the Schooles, as
hypostatical, transubstantiate, consubstantiate, eternal-Now and the like
canting of Schoolemen." Similarly, the words of psychoanalysis, such as pleasure
principle, Ego, etc. signify nothing at all. Theologians and psychoanalysts can
be very smart people, but the net practical result of their involuted
speculation is transitory, wrong, useless, specious, and false."

[April 1]  Skye Barasch writes:  So, Vivian, is there anyone on the Cornell
English faculty whose work meets your antiquated approval?  It's all bad,
according to you.

[April 1]  Vivian de St, Vrain responds: Actually, Ms/Mr Barasch, I'm just about
to add a paragraph on a member of the faculty whose book was very informative
and comprehensible. No abstruse jargon, I'm glad to say.  Stay tuned;  my
comments will appear here in a day or two. I do wonder, now that I think of it,
if I'm unconsciously picking the least approachable books to report on. I'll try
to mend my ways.

Title: Cornell English Then and Now -- 5
Date: February 21, 2025

Elisha Cohn is an associate professor in Cornell's Department of Literatures in
English. Her Still Life, Suspended Development in the Victorian Novel (2016)
strikes me as two books in one. The first is quite lovely and filled with a
variety of splendid apercus. Cohn explores "lyric moments" in the novels
(confession: I read closely only the chapter on Thomas Hardy, the novelist
with whom I'm most familiar). She observes that Hardy (a poet as well as a
novelist) occasionally stops the progress of the story and allows his characters
to experience a moment of stasis or reflection or reverie that is more a
characteristic of lyric poetry than prose. I was much impressed by her analyses
of these moments -- and wondered why I had failed to notice such events --
or non-events -- myself. So criticism did what it's supposed to do -- widens
our understanding and appreciation of works of literature. I returned to the
Victorian novel armed with a new way of seeing. In fact, I'm now reading Little
Dorrit again for the express purpose of ascertaining whether a non-poet like
Dickens employs the same Still Life method. So far, not the case -- Dickens has
his own particular (and very successful) methods of expanding the consciousness
of his characters.

Ah, but then there's the other side of Cohn's book which attempts to develop
her useful insights within the slough of "theory." I half suspect that Cohn
felt obliged to make herself relevant or contemporary or tenure-worthy with
her tumble into this quicksand -- but perhaps I'm wrong. Perhaps she devoutly
believes in an apparatus that I find so incomprehensible and transient. In
this second part of the book, many famous names are invoked and admired; some
of these are very French and very revered; others  are merely professors at
American universities. Pages of text and footnotes defend against the horrid
possibility that Still Life might be "insufficiently theorized." And in these
speculative paragraphs Cohn discusses the deprivilegization of hierarchical
thought in favor of forms of lateralization in which individuations are
impersonal and singularities are pre-individual and which reterritorialize
along the lines of preexisting structures of power which re-consolidate into
static concepts, etc., etc. Which is when I either descend into a reverie (or
nightmare) of my own or hurl he book across the room.

[February 23  Audrey ap Howell writes:  "Vivian de St. Vrain, you've go it
wrong. The notion that there are poetic moments in the novels is well
established. The originality of this book lies in its theorizing of these
moments. You would know this if you had read carefully and not skimmed."

[February 24] J C Occhiogrosso writes: "This is a well-written book. Complicated
but not obscure."

[February 25]  Reuben Musgrave writes:  "I bet that Cohn is a delightful teacher
-- if she keeps to the events in the novels and stays away from bewildering
'theory.'"

[February 25] Savannah Courtermanche writes:  "All novelists pause the plot for
moments of reflection. Nothing new here."

[March 5]  Joy Jourgenson writes:  "This difficult monograph would have been
more useful as a series of short, insightful essays.  Too bad it had to be
expanded into a repetitive static book. Not the author's fault -- just the tune
of the times."

[March 6]  Eli Munn writes:  "Vivian, you're too old and out of it to have an
opinion worth anything. Shut it down and go back to your knitting."

[March 15] Rogers Roggen writes:  "I wonder, Vivian, how you can work yourself
up into such a snit about Cornell when the USA is going to hell in a handbasket.
Shouldn't you put your effort into more pressing matters."

[March 18] Homer vanNess writes:  "Reuben Musgrave, are you possibly the "Cousin
Rube" that I heard my parents mention? I know there's a Musgrave branch to my
family. (I found your name doing a random googlesearch). If you are Cousin Rube,
could you pm me at [email protected]. I'd love to hear from you. I think you
went to Cornell; so did I but much later."

Title: Words of My Life -- Text
Date: February 28, 2025

I first encountered the word "text" -- as did everyone else of my cohort -- as
the first component of "textbook." At P S 217, textbooks were issued on the
first day of school. Then, later in the day, we ritually scissored brown paper
grocery bags and improvised protective book covers. It was not unusual for the
covers to be in better shape than the retirement-eligible books. At college,
I was surprised to find that I was required to purchase my own textbooks -- a
discovery that busted a hole in my precarious budget.

And then the word "text" sat still for a number of years until it emerged as
a term of art in critical theory. "Text" became a generic word for anything
written: novels, poems, plays, signs, advertising slogans, tattoos -- anything
that could be analyzed and discussed. I think, in retrospect, that the idea
was not to "privilege" one form of writing over another. "Text" is to poem as
"provider" is to doctor.

Nowadays, "text" has emerged from the gloom of academic criticism and has become
the most frequently used of words. Who could have predicted it? I myself,
formerly a writer of letters and postcards and until recently of emails, and for
many years at one point a user of the telephone, now send and receive multiple
"texts" in a day.

The noun has also acquired a variety of verb forms: "I'll text you"; "I texted
you";   "Text me when you arrive"; "Talk to you later.  I'm texting."

All derived, ultimately, from L. texere textus, to weave; or textor, a weaver.

The use of "text" in religious ceremony, as in a cleric's, "today's text is..."
has never been a part of my life.

Title: It's Big! We're Little!
Date: March 05, 2025

Can it possibly be true that the universe as we know it is becoming larger and
larger? The more we learn, the more it seems to expand. The scientists who
know about such things now brag that the Milky Way numbers between 200 and 300
billion stars, nearly all of which are probably circled by planets. Moreover,
these same experts now claim that there are something like one or two trillion
such configurations -- some of them small but most larger than our own personal
galaxy. And to top all that, there's a rumor circulating that our universe might
be just one of an untold, possibly infinite number of other universes. Some of
them Big Banging, some expanding, some collapsing.

These numbers are staggering and incomprehensible, at least to me. I can't even
get a hold of a million of anything, even grains of sand, let alone a billion (a
thousand million!) enormous stars.

Now they tell me that our universe began 13.8 billion years ago, more or less,
and will go on for a hundred billion more. That's another very large number for
me (or you) to assimilate.

It's all mighty perplexing. And then let me add the toughest question of all:
why is there something rather than nothing? Yes, why is that? How come?

There are some who find this sort of information dismaying because it confirms
the triviality, the meaninglessness of our individual lives. How can I possibly
worry about last night's insomnia or my latest nosebleed -- or indeed my very
own life -- in a world of a gazillion planets, stars, ultramassive black holes,
neutron stars, galaxies, and a universe which may have no discernible boundary
or beginning or ending.

Yet I myself find all this information not dismaying but comforting - maybe even
inspiring.

What are the odds that a planet might support life? Very small. And that the
planet's precarious lifeforms would evolve for a couple of billions of years
and then generate intelligent life?  And that a million years of mating and
surviving by various evolving primitive and then recognizable humans might lead
to my ancestors -- and that after thousands of lucky matings eventually resolve
into my parents Manny and Lil who happened upon the precise instant to beget Me.
And that I, in the second half of my 80s, way past my shelf life, would still be
here to enjoy these extra innings.

All this work of creation and evolution and luck to culminate in Me.

It's a miracle of cosmic proportions and should be hosannahed. Here I am,
enjoying my still functioning brain. My stomach is mellow after a full meal
and my skin is glowing from a stroll in the warm sun. At the end of the day, I
will crawl under the covers with my bedmate and ladylove. Truly the stars have
aligned to my benefit.

Nor let us not underestimate  the consummate joy of mattress and blanket.

My assemblage of molecules has had a great run -- much more than could be
reasonably anticipated.  Soon my molecules will disassemble and then reassemble
into someone else. I'm very glad to contribute to this phenomenon.

But if so -- if we are so fortunate, as I believe us to be, why don't we as
a people celebrate our good fortune? Take pleasure in our lives. What's the
need for this continuing strife and wars and enslavements and genocides? What's
the point of it? We're all sitting here, billions of us, for a second or so in
an infinitely boundless and timeless universe. Why must half of us make life
miserable for the other half? Why can't all we just get along?

Truly we are a horrid species.

I wonder whether other planets that support intelligent life have done any
better. I hope so.

Title: Driftin'
Date: April 01, 2025

Every once in a while, I experience something that I call a "cultural
convergence" -- perhaps an event reported in a daily newspaper that closely
resembles something on the very page of the novel that I happen to be reading. A
cross-genre overlap, let us say.

Here's in example of such a coincidence that amused me much.

Yesterday evening I watched the classic western The Magnificent Seven (1960)
and this morning I read, once again, Shakespeare's Twelfth Night. It's hard to
believe but yes, there is a very brief moment where two such very distinct works
brush against one another.

Unlike TN, The Magnificent Seven is a violent spectacle that steers clear of
humor, or subtle characterization or extensive dialogue. After the climactic
concluding battle to preserve the Mexican village has been both lost and won,
the two surviving gunmen share a moment before trotting off on their separate
ways. Chris Adams (Yul Brynner) inquires of Vin Tanner (Steve McQueen) if he
has a plan for what comes next. Laconic Vin, cowpoke and gunslinger, responds,
"driftin'.

In Twelfth Night, there's a similar question and a similar answer, but in a far
different idiom. Antonio asks Sebastian, who has survived a shipwreck, about
his plans. Sebastian's view of his future is essentially the same as Vin's, but
there is none of that "ah shucks" minimalism in his reply. Instead, Sebastian
responds, "My determinate voyage is mere extravagancy."

[While Vin's one-word answer is clear as clear can be, Sebastian's "mere
extravagancy" requires a bit of a gloss. Nowadays, "extravagancy" (usually
"extravagance") signifies a "lack of restrain in purchasing luxury goods." Not
so in 1600, when "extravagant" remained much closer to its root etymological
inheritance. The word descends from L. vagare, "to wander." Extra-vagance
therefore means something like "wander beyond." Here's a more familiar example
of the word at work: when Roderigo characterizes Othello as an "extravagant and
wheeling stranger," he does not criticize Othello for spending too many ducats
on his fancy get-up. He means that he's a rootless and wandering non-native.
(Wheeling? my dictionary glosses wheeling as "roving, wandering, drifting"). And
also: "mere" did not then connote triviality; its meaning is closer to "pure."
"Determinate" meant and still means "decided.")

Therefore Sebastian's sentence --"My determinate voyage is mere extravagancy" --
is directly equivalent to  Vin's "driftin''". Cultural convergence at its best.

It's just two ways of talkin'.

I sometimes wonder about Shakespeare's intent here. Why did he bother
to put such a difficult sentence in Sebastian's mouth? For purposes of
characterization, certainly. But at the expense of clarity. Wouldn't it have
been more economical, more transparent, for Sebastian to say something plain,
such as "I don't have a plan, I'll just wander." It's certain that some
percentage of Shakespeare's audience, perhaps most, will not grasp the meaning 
of the sentence as written and will be left puzzled. Yet as he so often does,
Shakespeare preferred eloquence to transparency.

In my opinion, Shakespeare delighted in his own fluency.  And sometimes I think
that Shakespeare wasn't just writing to be heard by his Globe or Blackfriars
audience. He was writing to be read and studied --  although I doubt he could
have imagined a future in which his sentences would be glossed with crowded
inches of small-type footnotes.

It it possible that Shakespeare also had an inkling that, as Beethoven once put
it, he was writing for "a latter age?"

Title: Cornell English Then and Now -- 6
Date: April 03, 2025

After struggling through a run of mysterious and puzzling works, I'm cheered to
discover a book written by Cornell English faculty member that I could read with
pleasure from beginning to end. And understand. And which alerted me to books
and poems with which I was not familiar. No theory, no pretentious jargon; just
honest scholarship and intelligent stylish analysis,

It's Facing the Abyss, American Literature and Culture in the 1940s, by George
Hutchinson, who is Cornell's Farr Professor of American Culture.

Unlike Professor Hutchinson, who is a considerably younger man, I myself was
alive (although barely sentient) during the 1940s. I was too young for serious
reading, so 1940s culture didn't come to my aluminum desk until the 1950s when
I belatedly came to awareness. As a result, I read many of the books that
Hutchinson discusses a decade past their relevance. Hutchinson also mentions
many influential books that I didn't read at all and therefore came as a
surprise -- and which underlined my ignorance. For example, during the 1950s,
my high school and college years, I read many books of 1940s Jewish American
writers to whom Hutchinson devotes a long chapter: Mailer, Bellow, Malamud,
Rukeyser, Arthur Miller, etc. But my acquaintance was incomplete. I confess that
I had never heard the names of Jo Sinclair or Isaac Rosenthal, both of whom
Hutchinson scrutinizes at full. One name missing from Hutchinson's survey is J D
Salinger, who started to publish in the 40s but only became famous with Cather
in the Rye in 1951. Just as well -- I never caught Salinger fever although many
of my friends were quite infected.

Hutchinson has presented me with a reading list of books that I should have
known but didn't and that will keep me engaged for months. I'm grateful.

Hutchinson's chapter on WWII is most revelatory. Without being unduly partisan,
it exposes and corrects the "greatest generation" mythology that I had half come
to accept.

After reading Facing the Abyss, I continued my investigation of Cornell English
faculty publications by taking a couple of wild swings at Elizabeth S. Anker's
mystifying On Paradox, the Claims of Theory (Duke UP, 2022). (Anker holds a
joint appointment in Cornell's law school and its Department of Literature in
English.) I can say just two things for certain about this difficult book: a) I
didn't understand two consecutive sentences, and b) it's not about literature,
not even tangentially. In fact, I'm not sure what it's about -- as far as I can
tell, it's not about the law. I have rarely attempted anything in English prose
that I found quite so impenetrable. I never even grasped what Anker means by
paradox.

I'm sure it's mea maxima culpa, but so be it.

[April 4] PGB writes: "Every time you post something, it becomes ever clearer
that you're not the right person for this investigation. Give it up and stick to
something within your abilities, like basketball. You write well on basketball.
Do yourself a favor: stay away from the deeper issues that Anker discusses."

[April 4]  Vivian de St. Vrain responds: "Perhaps you're right, PGB (whoever you
are). The shoemaker should stick to his last. This Anker book is not intended
for me, but I I wonder for whom it is intended. It's got to be an extremely
small specialized audience. Six or eight people, worldwide. I doubt anyone on
Cornell's English faculty then or now could make heads or tails of it."

[April 6]  Artie Greengroin writes: "Thanks for hanging in there.  I hope you
find other Cornell English Professors who know how to write English. I'm not
optimistic, though. BTW, I think PGB is harshing on you, but I agree that your
basketball essays are pretty good."

[April 8] Vivian de St. Vrain responds: "Thanks for the recommendation, Artie
and PGB. If anyone is interested, my basketball essays are here.

[April 9]  Charles Evans (Mercer College) writes: "I agree. Vivian, your notes
on basketball are quite good. But you're just not smart enough to understand
philosophy."

[April 10] Joe J. Keen (Northwest Nazarene University, Nampa, Idaho) writes: "I
agree with Charles Evans. The basketball entries are amusing. But, Vivian,
you're no philosopher."

[April 16] Vivian de St. Vrain writes: The "Artie Greengroin" who posted on
April 6 does not exist. Artie Greengroin is not a real person; he's a character
invented by the WWII novelist Harry Brown. Come on, Artie you can use your real
name. Don't be afraid. Don't hide behind a pseudonym. We're all friends here."

[April 30]. Chester Bacon writes: "Thanks for bringing the Hutchinson book to my
attention.  I've read and been enlightened by it. But following your
recommendation I'll stay away from the Anker book. And I do like your basketball
essays."

Title: Trump, Chaucer, etc.
Date: April 16, 2025

Chaucer's Pardoner, some will remember, has long blonde hair and speaks in
a high treble voice. Chaucer calls him "a gelding or a mare." A gelding is
obviously a eunuch; what Chaucer means by mare is less clear -- perhaps "female
eunuch" -- whatever that entails -- or a gay male or possibly even a woman
cross-dressed as a man. In any case, a person of ambiguous sexuality -- "gender
fluid" in modern idiom.

Update: the Naval Academy Nimitz library at Annapolis has purged from its
shelves a book by Robert S. Sturges called  "Chaucer's Pardoner: Gender
Theory." Isn't it reassuring that our national security will no longer be
endangered by a discussion of the Pardoner's identity.

Title: Cornell English Then and Now -- 1
Date: April 22, 2025

Here's a truth that blows my freakin' mind: since I earned my B. A. in English
from Cornell University in 1960, sixty-five years have come and gone. Glaciers
have melted and rivers have changed their course since, way back when, in a
prior millennium, I was first introduced to serious literature -- to Chaucer and
Milton and George Eliot.

My professors in those far-away-and-long-ago days were exclusively male and for
the most part veterans of WW2 or the Korean war. They wrote definitive scholarly
articles for the Philological Quarterly or for Modern Philology; they published
learned monographs on canonical poets and novelists; and they taught courses
with such forthright titles as The Seventeenth Century and Wordsworth and
Coleridge. Although I was an indifferent student before I arrived at Cornell,
I found an intellectual home in the Department of English. Inasmuch as I did
not have a brain for rigorous science or for the tough analytic philosophy that
was then in fashion, I was fortunate that the work of English suited my limited
abilities -- curiosity, patience, a good memory, and something of a feel for
language.

Just yesterday (and what, pray tell, prompted me?), I took a peek at the
current website of Cornell's English Department. (In the index-card 1950s, when
the manual typewriter was the acme of technology, the word "website" would
have signified a dark corner colonized by spiders.) Even at first glance, the
2025 Cornell website said to me "very very different, very 'now'." While an
occasional word or phrase was recognizable, it was the novelty -- the modernity,
I guess -- that flared from the electronic page and dazzled mine eyne. Time
marches on, no doubt, but whether it marches boldly forward or plunges over a
cliff remains to be established.

First of all, it's no longer the Department of English. It's now, hurrah!,
the "Department of Literatures in English." What a welcome redefinition --
an assertion that English is a world language and that it houses a world
literature. Nowadays, if I sit down with a work of fiction, I'm just as likely
to read a novel by a writer from Africa or India or Australia as one from the
British isles or North America. There's not a reason in the world why Chinua
Achebe or Abdulrazak Gurnah should not be studied in an English Department. I
respect this shift in focus and I regret that my 1950s Beowulf-to-T. S. Eliot
English department was so parochial, so provincial. I can only admire the fact
that the Department of Literatures in English has annexed to itself whole
continents of writing -- a case of academic imperialism that this time seems
wholly right and just.

The website also reveals that, in a nation in which the study of the humanities
in higher education is at risk, Cornell's English is a huge thriving enterprise.
There are fifty-one people on permanent staff, almost all of professorial
rank. Of this number, twenty-seven -- or slightly more than half -- are women.
And among those pictured on the site, a significant number are "of color."
Undoubtedly, the present department is a far more representative collection of
individuals than my 1950s faculty. Moreover, the chair, the associate chair,
the director of undergraduate studies, the director of graduate students, and
the director of writing are all women. It may once have been the case that the
occasional female interloper was a token for display only, but not so now.

And what do these handsome and distinguished men and women study? Fortunately
for me, members of the faculty list their areas of concentration. Most claim
two or three specialties, some as many as five; a few recalcitrant individuals
list none, leaving me to wonder whether they are polymaths or just ornery
uncooperative academics. Among the fifty-one, the single expertise most commonly
claimed is "cultural studies." This preponderance set me back a bit, because
"cultural studies" is not a term I recognize nor one that existed, as far as I
know, in the 1950s, when the word "culture" was synonymous with "civilization"
-- sometimes just Western Civilization -- and when "cultured" meant something
equivalent to "educated" and possibly even "socially established." But now,
apparently, "cultural studies" is, and I quote a respected source, "an academic
field  that... investigates how cultural practices relate to wider systems of
power. These include ideology, class structures, national formations, ethnicity,
sexual orientation and gender." Am I correct, and is it possible, for me to
infer from this litany of nouns that "cultural practices" comprehends just about
everything that we as a society say or do? Clearly the Department of Literatures
in English lays claim to a heck of a lot of intellectual territory -- and that
it is a far more aggressive entity than is revealed by its mere absorption of
Anglophone novels. I was initially suspicious of these extensive claims, but
after reflecting a while I recognized that, if I set to one side the self-
aggrandizing listing of ideology, ethnicity, class... etc,), cultural studies
may in practice simply bring to the forefront such elements as imperialism and
nationhood in Robinson Crusoe or race and gender in Othello. Wouldn't it be
comforting if "cultural studies" is at least in part merely traditional wine in
spiffy new bottles? I, for one, certainly hope so.

After cultural studies, it is "literary theory" that claims the largest group
of adherents -- thirteen, or about a quarter of the faculty. This revelation
surprised me because I would have guessed that "theory" had long since gone the
way of the aurochs and the mouflon. "Theory" had its herd of enthusiasts in its
obscurantist heyday in the last century, yet it seems to be alive and kicking at
Cornell -- but only, I suspect, as a vestigial remnant of an earlier time and
only among the more senior members of the Department.

Following "theory" in popularity among the professoriate are the seven members
who stake their claim to "gender studies." Six other say "African-American." The
nine who announce a specialty in creative writing may not know that they are the
successors and the beneficiaries of the late revered Professor James McConkey.
Not a single member of the faculty offers "Shakespeare" or "Milton" as an area
of expertise. I do not doubt that the study of gender and African-American and
Asian-American literatures is a good thing, but I would have wished that the
authors of the finest works of art in all of Anglophonia be accorded equivalent
attention and status.

Would a reincarnated Youthful Me elect take a degree from such a faculty? 
I'm skeptical, but I can't say for sure because I don't know whether or not,
in the classroom, the scrupulous examination of literature and ideas has been
undermined by transitory and faddish ideologies. I must confess that the biases
of the website make me feel old and wary and out of touch. And tired.

Well then, what does take place in the classroom?

Let's sample some evidence.

In days of yore, I enrolled in "Elizabethan and Jacobean Drama," a course taught
by the distinguished scholar and teacher David Novarr. The course was organized
as a chronological march from Kyd and Marlowe in the 1580s right through to Ford
and Massinger -- the last playwrights of significance before the theaters went
dark in 1642. I remember savoring some delightful comedies by Ben Jonson and
Francis Beaumont and also a couple of ferociously brilliant tragedies by Thomas
Middleton -- writings, I suspect, that 2020s English majors are not destined
to encounter -- even though an acquaintance with these plays is essential
background for understanding the timeless works of Shakespeare.

There's no equivalent course in the present curriculum, but there is an
analogue, and it appears in the catalogue of offerings thusly:

ENGL 3240. Blood Politics:  Comparative Renaissance Drama

Blood is everywhere. From vampire shows to video games, our culture seems to be
obsessed with it. The course examines the power of "blood" in the early modern
period as a figure that continues to capture our imagination, not only as a
marker of racial, religious, and sexual difference and desire, but also as a
dramatic player in its own right. How does a politics of blood appear on stage
when populations are being expelled and colonized for reasons (mis)understood in
terms of blood?.... Topics include honor, revenge, purity, the body, sexuality,
conversion, and death.

The course description itself is a mess -- both incomprehensible and
meretricious. I'm shocked by the catchpenny pandering. Do 2020s teachers need to
lure students into their classrooms with "vampires" and "videos?" The assertion
that "blood is a dramatic player in its own right" is nonsense. The description
reads like advertising copy for a cheesy low-budget horror flick playing at some
louche all-night grind house.

Moreover, "blood" isn't "everywhere." Goodness gracious!

I'm afraid that these entrancing plays are doomed to be put through the
"cultural studies" homogenizer. Or "theorized" out of all compass.

Ah, well.

Back in 1960, I had a summer job in Ithaca and therefore happened to be loafing
around the campus when the University hosted its returning alumni. Among the
returnees were the old folks  -- some few of them members of the class of
1895 -- who had walkered and wheel-chaired to their Sixty-Fifth. Geezers, I
thought. It's sobering to realize that those codgers were the same age -- 86 --
as I am now. Should I  return to Ithaca this coming spring, for my very own
Sixty-Fifth, I will be perceived by the young 'uns exactly as I observed those
Class of 1895 guys: as ancient and irrelevant.

It follows, therefore, that my reservations about the 2025 English curriculum
have their exact parallel in the 1895ers perspective on my 1960 curriculum. It's
not hard to imagine that they -- I mean the members of the class of 1895 --
who had been educated in elocution and Old Norse, would have been shocked and
perhaps outraged by the 1950s "modern" curriculum that I found so enticing and
illuminating.

And now, because I don't want to go full curmudgeon and become the kind of
superannuated guy who shakes his ebony stick at the modern world and deplores
the decline of civilization, I'm going to make an effort to find out what's
really going on in 2025. I have therefore set myself the task of reading a
representative sample of the books written by members of the present-day English
faculty.

I'll report on my studies right here.

Stay tuned.

[January 18] Bernhard Starr writes:  "Vivian, you are right about the course
description. It's a disgrace. It's badly written and ridiculous. Why didn't you
include the name of the prof. who wrote it?  He/she needs to be exposed. What
"populations are being expelled and colonized" by Volpone or The Changeling? 
And did you look other course descriptions -- are they equally silly?  What's
worst about the course description is that it doesn't respect the plays that the
class is going to examine. They're not important interesting dramas to the
teacher -- they're just fodder for an ideology.

[January 19] Vivian de St. Vrain replies: "Mr. Starr, I didn't identify the
author of the course description because the website doesn't identify him/her.
Just as well. Also, I didn't read other course descriptions though I might do so
in the future. I think you're correct that the course description does not
respect the dramas or their authors. Which is, as you suggest, mighty
disappointing."

[January 19] Bernhard Starr replies:  "I think I'd rather study Old Norse."

[February 4] Thurston Dale replies:  "I guess I'm a geezer, too (Cornell, '65).
I'm glad I majored in English before criticism turned crazy. Great teachers --
Mizener, Abrams, Parrish, Novarr."

[March 17] Anatole Miles Webber writes: "Vivian, you were naive back in the
1950s and you're still naive now. You assume that the Cornell English Department
of your youth, 65 years ago, was normative and normal. You were then and still
are oblivious to the fact that the Department's 1950 curriculum was the product
of stress and change and compromise. Try to remember that there were at least
three forces at work and that various faculty members had various degrees of
commitment to them. The first group was the oldest -- the traditionalist who
studied, as they had always done, literature as history and biography and
philology. Get the text and the context right was their primary concern. Then
there were the 'new critics" -- heirs to Leavis and Scrutiny in England and the
southern agrarians (Ransom, Tate, Warren) in the US. But the main intellectual
current riling English Departments were the fierce critics out of New York
(mostly Jewish) circles (Kazin, Trilling, Fiedler, Paul Goodman, Irving Howe,
etc). In retrospect, even though Cornell brought both Lionel Trilling and
Cleanth Brooks to Ithaca during your and my years there, the new winds made
little impression on our education. Cornell was peaceful, isolated and non-
ideological. It appears from your writing that you preferred it that way and
still do. It was stable until the theory people brought in novelty and confusion
and excitement.

[April 15] Parnell Pratt replies: "And also monumental pretension. And eventual
collapse and failure."

[May 3] Lance Birdseye (Lt., USAF) writes: "What a funny website this is. Hey,
folks, join the real world."

Title: New Old Books from the 1940s
Date: April 22, 2025

I read George Hutchinson's Facing the Abyss, a report on the culture of the
1940. Hutchinson assesses books that were influential during that troubled
decade.

When I came of age in the 1950s, I encountered a good share of these books. I
was a curious, library-addicted lad and 1940s culture lingered in the 1950s air.
Yet Hutchinson brings to attention whole shelves of important writing of which I
was shamefully ignorant. Through the resources of Interlibrary Loan and second-
hand internet bookstores, I've now become acquainted with a bunch of new old
books. Here's some of them (with more to follow).

Hutchinson claims that Jo Sinclair's Wasteland (1946) is an important
contribution to the Jewish-American novel. Perhaps it is, by priority, but I
found it disappointing and superficial. The main man, Jacob Braunowitz changes
his name to John Brown and hides his Jewishness, but it doesn't work -- he lives
in a "wasteland" neither integrated into America nor bolstered by his inherited
religion. Along comes a Freudian psychoanalyst and in a few magical sessions
Brown is liberated to embrace his Judaism. For me, the novel was simplistic and
implausible. Harry Brown's A Walk in the Sun (1944) is the most persuasive and
realistic war novel I've ever read -- it accomplishes more in 150 pages that
Norman Mailer achieved in 600. Aldo Leopold's Sand County Almanac (1949 is a
pioneering classic of environmentalism -- though nowadays less widely known than
Rachel Carson's Silent Spring but much more learned and innovative. It's a very
good book but frankly I found the "lyrical" prose a bit too gooey for my taste.
Isaac Rosenfeld's Passage from Home is a distinguished novel of adolescent
alienation. It's kinky (about a boy's semi-sexual relationship to his deceased
mother's sister). It's a far better novel, I think, than Salinger's similar
and imitative Catcher in the Rye. What a pity that Rosenfeld died of a heart
attack at age 38!  A great loss to literature. I also read Anatole Broyard's
Kafka Was the Rage, a memoir of Greenwich Village in the 1940s although not
published until 1985. It's a noteworthy collection of short essay, able to be
much more candid about sex and sexuality than if it had appeared during the time
it chronicles. Broyard claims that 1946 was the best year ever: the war was over
and he had freedom and the G I Bill.

A pretty good for me too -- in 1946 just seven years old, sitting on the sunny
stoop eating raisins.

Francis Beaumont and also a couple of ferociously brilliant tragedies by Thomas
Middleton -- writings, I suspect, that 2020s English majors are not destined
to encounter -- even though an acquaintance with these plays is essential
background for understanding the timeless works of Shakespeare.

There's no equivalent course in the present curriculum, but there is an
analogue, and it appears in the catalogue of offerings thusly:

ENGL 3240. Blood Politics:  Comparative Renaissance Drama

Blood is everywhere. From vampire shows to video games, our culture seems to be
obsessed with it. The course examines the power of "blood" in the early modern
period as a figure that continues to capture our imagination, not only as a
marker of racial, religious, and sexual difference and desire, but also as a
dramatic player in its own right. How does a politics of blood appear on stage
when populations are being expelled and colonized for reasons (mis)understood in
terms of blood?.... Topics include honor, revenge, purity, the body, sexuality,
conversion, and death.

The course description itself is a mess -- both incomprehensible and
meretricious. I'm shocked by the catchpenny pandering. Do 2020s teachers need to
lure students into their classrooms with "vampires" and "videos?" The assertion
that "blood is a dramatic player in its own right" is nonsense. The description
reads like advertising copy for a cheesy low-budget horror flick playing at some
louche all-night grind house.

Moreover, "blood" isn't "everywhere." Goodness gracious!

I'm afraid that these entrancing plays are doomed to be put through the
"cultural studies" homogenizer. Or "theorized" out of all compass.

Ah, well.

Back in 1960, I had a summer job in Ithaca and therefore happened to be loafing
around the campus when the University hosted its returning alumni. Among the
returnees were the old folks  -- some few of them members of the class of
1895 -- who had walkered and wheel-chaired to their Sixty-Fifth. Geezers, I
thought. It's sobering to realize that those codgers were the same age -- 86 --
as I am now. Should I  return to Ithaca this coming spring, for my very own
Sixty-Fifth, I will be perceived by the young 'uns exactly as I observed those
Class of 1895 guys: as ancient and irrelevant.

It follows, therefore, that my reservations about the 2025 English curriculum
have their exact parallel in the 1895ers perspective on my 1960 curriculum. It's
not hard to imagine that they -- I mean the members of the class of 1895 --
who had been educated in elocution and Old Norse, would have been shocked and
perhaps outraged by the 1950s "modern" curriculum that I found so enticing and
illuminating.

And now, because I don't want to go full curmudgeon and become the kind of
superannuated guy who shakes his ebony stick at the modern world and deplores
the decline of civilization, I'm going to make an effort to find out what's
really going on in 2025. I have therefore set myself the task of reading a
representative sample of the books written by members of the present-day English
faculty.

I'll report on my studies right here.

Stay tuned.

[January 18] Bernhard Starr writes:  "Vivian, you are right about the course
description. It's a disgrace. It's badly written and ridiculous. Why didn't you
include the name of the prof. who wrote it?  He/she needs to be exposed. What
"populations are being expelled and colonized" by Volpone or The Changeling? 
And did you look other course descriptions -- are they equally silly?  What's
worst about the course description is that it doesn't respect the plays that the
class is going to examine. They're not important interesting dramas to the
teacher -- they're just fodder for an ideology.

[January 19] Vivian de St. Vrain replies: "Mr. Starr, I didn't identify the
author of the course description because the website doesn't identify him/her.
Just as well. Also, I didn't read other course descriptions though I might do so
in the future. I think you're correct that the course description does not
respect the dramas or their authors. Which is, as you suggest, mighty
disappointing."

[January 19] Bernhard Starr replies:  "I think I'd rather study Old Norse."

[February 4] Thurston Dale replies:  "I guess I'm a geezer, too (Cornell, '65).
I'm glad I majored in English before criticism turned crazy. Great teachers --
Mizener, Abrams, Parrish, Novarr."

[March 17] Anatole Miles Webber writes: "Vivian, you were naive back in the
1950s and you're still naive now. You assume that the Cornell English Department
of your youth, 65 years ago, was normative and normal. You were then and still
are oblivious to the fact that the Department's 1950 curriculum was the product
of stress and change and compromise. Try to remember that there were at least
three forces at work and that various faculty members had various degrees of
commitment to them. The first group was the oldest -- the traditionalist who
studied, as they had always done, literature as history and biography and
philology. Get the text and the context right was their primary concern. Then
there were the 'new critics" -- heirs to Leavis and Scrutiny in England and the
southern agrarians (Ransom, Tate, Warren) in the US. But the main intellectual
current riling English Departments were the fierce critics out of New York
(mostly Jewish) circles (Kazin, Trilling, Fiedler, Paul Goodman, Irving Howe,
etc). In retrospect, even though Cornell brought both Lionel Trilling and
Cleanth Brooks to Ithaca during your and my years there, the new winds made
little impression on our education. Cornell was peaceful, isolated and non-
ideological. It appears from your writing that you preferred it that way and
still do. It was stable until the theory people brought in novelty and confusion
and excitement.

Title: Cornell English Then and Now -- 1
Date: April 22, 2025

Here's a truth that blows my freakin' mind: since I earned my B. A. in English
from Cornell University in 1960, sixty-five years have come and gone. Glaciers
have melted and rivers have changed their course since, way back when, in a
prior millennium, I was first introduced to serious literature -- to Chaucer and
Milton and George Eliot.

My professors in those far-away-and-long-ago days were exclusively male and for
the most part veterans of WW2 or the Korean war. They wrote definitive scholarly
articles for the Philological Quarterly or for Modern Philology; they published
learned monographs on canonical poets and novelists; and they taught courses
with such forthright titles as The Seventeenth Century and Wordsworth and
Coleridge. Although I was an indifferent student before I arrived at Cornell,
I found an intellectual home in the Department of English. Inasmuch as I did
not have a brain for rigorous science or for the tough analytic philosophy that
was then in fashion, I was fortunate that the work of English suited my limited
abilities -- curiosity, patience, a good memory, and something of a feel for
language.

Just yesterday (and what, pray tell, prompted me?), I took a peek at the
current website of Cornell's English Department. (In the index-card 1950s, when
the manual typewriter was the acme of technology, the word "website" would
have signified a dark corner colonized by spiders.) Even at first glance, the
2025 Cornell website said to me "very very different, very 'now'." While an
occasional word or phrase was recognizable, it was the novelty -- the modernity,
I guess -- that flared from the electronic page and dazzled mine eyne. Time
marches on, no doubt, but whether it marches boldly forward or plunges over a
cliff remains to be established.

First of all, it's no longer the Department of English. It's now, hurrah!,
the "Department of Literatures in English." What a welcome redefinition --
an assertion that English is a world language and that it houses a world
literature. Nowadays, if I sit down with a work of fiction, I'm just as likely
to read a novel by a writer from Africa or India or Australia as one from the
British isles or North America. There's not a reason in the world why Chinua
Achebe or Abdulrazak Gurnah should not be studied in an English Department. I
respect this shift in focus and I regret that my 1950s Beowulf-to-T. S. Eliot
English department was so parochial, so provincial. I can only admire the fact
that the Department of Literatures in English has annexed to itself whole
continents of writing -- a case of academic imperialism that this time seems
wholly right and just.

The website also reveals that, in a nation in which the study of the humanities
in higher education is at risk, Cornell's English is a huge thriving enterprise.
There are fifty-one people on permanent staff, almost all of professorial
rank. Of this number, twenty-seven -- or slightly more than half -- are women.
And among those pictured on the site, a significant number are "of color."
Undoubtedly, the present department is a far more representative collection of
individuals than my 1950s faculty. Moreover, the chair, the associate chair,
the director of undergraduate studies, the director of graduate students, and
the director of writing are all women. It may once have been the case that the
occasional female interloper was a token for display only, but not so now.

And what do these handsome and distinguished men and women study? Fortunately
for me, members of the faculty list their areas of concentration. Most claim
two or three specialties, some as many as five; a few recalcitrant individuals
list none, leaving me to wonder whether they are polymaths or just ornery
uncooperative academics. Among the fifty-one, the single expertise most commonly
claimed is "cultural studies." This preponderance set me back a bit, because
"cultural studies" is not a term I recognize nor one that existed, as far as I
know, in the 1950s, when the word "culture" was synonymous with "civilization"
-- sometimes just Western Civilization -- and when "cultured" meant something
equivalent to "educated" and possibly even "socially established." But now,
apparently, "cultural studies" is, and I quote a respected source, "an academic
field  that... investigates how cultural practices relate to wider systems of
power. These include ideology, class structures, national formations, ethnicity,
sexual orientation and gender." Am I correct, and is it possible, for me to
infer from this litany of nouns that "cultural practices" comprehends just about
everything that we as a society say or do? Clearly the Department of Literatures
in English lays claim to a heck of a lot of intellectual territory -- and that
it is a far more aggressive entity than is revealed by its mere absorption of
Anglophone novels. I was initially suspicious of these extensive claims, but
after reflecting a while I recognized that, if I set to one side the self-
aggrandizing listing of ideology, ethnicity, class... etc,), cultural studies
may in practice simply bring to the forefront such elements as imperialism and
nationhood in Robinson Crusoe or race and gender in Othello. Wouldn't it be
comforting if "cultural studies" is at least in part merely traditional wine in
spiffy new bottles? I, for one, certainly hope so.

After cultural studies, it is "literary theory" that claims the largest group
of adherents -- thirteen, or about a quarter of the faculty. This revelation
surprised me because I would have guessed that "theory" had long since gone the
way of the aurochs and the mouflon. "Theory" had its herd of enthusiasts in its
obscurantist heyday in the last century, yet it seems to be alive and kicking at
Cornell -- but only, I suspect, as a vestigial remnant of an earlier time and
only among the more senior members of the Department.

Following "theory" in popularity among the professoriate are the seven members
who stake their claim to "gender studies." Six other say "African-American." The
nine who announce a specialty in creative writing may not know that they are the
successors and the beneficiaries of the late revered Professor James McConkey.
Not a single member of the faculty offers "Shakespeare" or "Milton" as an area
of expertise. I do not doubt that the study of gender and African-American and
Asian-American literatures is a good thing, but I would have wished that the
authors of the finest works of art in all of Anglophonia be accorded equivalent
attention and status.

Would a reincarnated Youthful Me elect take a degree from such a faculty? 
I'm skeptical, but I can't say for sure because I don't know whether or not,
in the classroom, the scrupulous examination of literature and ideas has been
undermined by transitory and faddish ideologies. I must confess that the biases
of the website make me feel old and wary and out of touch. And tired.

Well then, what does take place in the classroom?

Let's sample some evidence.

In days of yore, I enrolled in "Elizabethan and Jacobean Drama," a course taught
by the distinguished scholar and teacher David Novarr. The course was organized
as a chronological march from Kyd and Marlowe in the 1580s right through to Ford
and Massinger -- the last playwrights of significance before the theaters went
dark in 1642. I remember savoring some delightful comedies by Ben Jonson and
Francis Beaumont and also a couple of ferociously brilliant tragedies by Thomas
Middleton -- writings, I suspect, that 2020s English majors are not destined
to encounter -- even though an acquaintance with these plays is essential
background for understanding the timeless works of Shakespeare.

There's no equivalent course in the present curriculum, but there is an
analogue, and it appears in the catalogue of offerings thusly:

dramatic player in its own right. How does a politics of blood appear on stage
when populations are being expelled and colonized for reasons (mis)understood in
terms of blood?.... Topics include honor, revenge, purity, the body, sexuality,
conversion, and death.

The course description itself is a mess -- both incomprehensible and
meretricious. I'm shocked by the catchpenny pandering. Do 2020s teachers need to
lure students into their classrooms with "vampires" and "videos?" The assertion
that "blood is a dramatic player in its own right" is nonsense. The description
reads like advertising copy for a cheesy low-budget horror flick playing at some
louche all-night grind house.

Moreover, "blood" isn't "everywhere." Goodness gracious!

I'm afraid that these entrancing plays are doomed to be put through the
"cultural studies" homogenizer. Or "theorized" out of all compass.

Ah, well.

(mostly Jewish) circles (Kazin, Trilling, Fiedler, Paul Goodman, Irving Howe,
etc). In retrospect, even though Cornell brought both Lionel Trilling and
Cleanth Brooks to Ithaca during your and my years there, the new winds made
little impression on our education. Cornell was peaceful, isolated and non-
ideological. It appears from your writing that you preferred it that way and
still do. It was stable until the theory people brought in novelty and confusion
and excitement.

Title: Cornell English Then and Now -- 1
Date: April 22, 2025

Here's a truth that blows my freakin' mind: since I earned my B. A. in English
from Cornell University in 1960, sixty-five years have come and gone. Glaciers
have melted and rivers have changed their course since, way back when, in a
prior millennium, I was first introduced to serious literature -- to Chaucer and
Milton and George Eliot.

My professors in those far-away-and-long-ago days were exclusively male and for
the most part veterans of WW2 or the Korean war. They wrote definitive scholarly
articles for the Philological Quarterly or for Modern Philology; they published
learned monographs on canonical poets and novelists; and they taught courses
with such forthright titles as The Seventeenth Century and Wordsworth and
Coleridge. Although I was an indifferent student before I arrived at Cornell,
I found an intellectual home in the Department of English. Inasmuch as I did
not have a brain for rigorous science or for the tough analytic philosophy that
was then in fashion, I was fortunate that the work of English suited my limited
abilities -- curiosity, patience, a good memory, and something of a feel for
language.

Just yesterday (and what, pray tell, prompted me?), I took a peek at the
current website of Cornell's English Department. (In the index-card 1950s, when
the manual typewriter was the acme of technology, the word "website" would
have signified a dark corner colonized by spiders.) Even at first glance, the
2025 Cornell website said to me "very very different, very 'now'." While an
occasional word or phrase was recognizable, it was the novelty -- the modernity,
I guess -- that flared from the electronic page and dazzled mine eyne. Time
marches on, no doubt, but whether it marches boldly forward or plunges over a
cliff remains to be established.

First of all, it's no longer the Department of English. It's now, hurrah!,
the "Department of Literatures in English." What a welcome redefinition --
an assertion that English is a world language and that it houses a world
literature. Nowadays, if I sit down with a work of fiction, I'm just as likely
to read a novel by a writer from Africa or India or Australia as one from the
British isles or North America. There's not a reason in the world why Chinua
Achebe or Abdulrazak Gurnah should not be studied in an English Department. I
respect this shift in focus and I regret that my 1950s Beowulf-to-T. S. Eliot
English department was so parochial, so provincial. I can only admire the fact
that the Department of Literatures in English has annexed to itself whole
continents of writing -- a case of academic imperialism that this time seems
wholly right and just.

The website also reveals that, in a nation in which the study of the humanities
in higher education is at risk, Cornell's English is a huge thriving enterprise.
There are fifty-one people on permanent staff, almost all of professorial
rank. Of this number, twenty-seven -- or slightly more than half -- are women.
And among those pictured on the site, a significant number are "of color."
Undoubtedly, the present department is a far more representative collection of
individuals than my 1950s faculty. Moreover, the chair, the associate chair,
the director of undergraduate studies, the director of graduate students, and
the director of writing are all women. It may once have been the case that the
occasional female interloper was a token for display only, but not so now.

And what do these handsome and distinguished men and women study? Fortunately
for me, members of the faculty list their areas of concentration. Most claim
two or three specialties, some as many as five; a few recalcitrant individuals
list none, leaving me to wonder whether they are polymaths or just ornery
uncooperative academics. Among the fifty-one, the single expertise most commonly
claimed is "cultural studies." This preponderance set me back a bit, because
"cultural studies" is not a term I recognize nor one that existed, as far as I
know, in the 1950s, when the word "culture" was synonymous with "civilization"
-- sometimes just Western Civilization -- and when "cultured" meant something
equivalent to "educated" and possibly even "socially established." But now,
apparently, "cultural studies" is, and I quote a respected source, "an academic
field  that... investigates how cultural practices relate to wider systems of
power. These include ideology, class structures, national formations, ethnicity,
sexual orientation and gender." Am I correct, and is it possible, for me to
infer from this litany of nouns that "cultural practices" comprehends just about
everything that we as a society say or do? Clearly the Department of Literatures
in English lays claim to a heck of a lot of intellectual territory -- and that
it is a far more aggressive entity than is revealed by its mere absorption of
Anglophone novels. I was initially suspicious of these extensive claims, but
after reflecting a while I recognized that, if I set to one side the self-
aggrandizing listing of ideology, ethnicity, class... etc,), cultural studies
may in practice simply bring to the forefront such elements as imperialism and
nationhood in Robinson Crusoe or race and gender in Othello. Wouldn't it be
comforting if "cultural studies" is at least in part merely traditional wine in
spiffy new bottles? I, for one, certainly hope so.

After cultural studies, it is "literary theory" that claims the largest group
of adherents -- thirteen, or about a quarter of the faculty. This revelation
surprised me because I would have guessed that "theory" had long since gone the
way of the aurochs and the mouflon. "Theory" had its herd of enthusiasts in its
obscurantist heyday in the last century, yet it seems to be alive and kicking at
Cornell -- but only, I suspect, as a vestigial remnant of an earlier time and
only among the more senior members of the Department.

Following "theory" in popularity among the professoriate are the seven members
who stake their claim to "gender studies." Six other say "African-American." The
nine who announce a specialty in creative writing may not know that they are the
successors and the beneficiaries of the late revered Professor James McConkey.
Not a single member of the faculty offers "Shakespeare" or "Milton" as an area
of expertise. I do not doubt that the study of gender and African-American and
Asian-American literatures is a good thing, but I would have wished that the
authors of the finest works of art in all of Anglophonia be accorded equivalent
attention and status.

Would a reincarnated Youthful Me elect take a degree from such a faculty? 
I'm skeptical, but I can't say for sure because I don't know whether or not,
in the classroom, the scrupulous examination of literature and ideas has been
undermined by transitory and faddish ideologies. I must confess that the biases
of the website make me feel old and wary and out of touch. And tired.

Well then, what does take place in the classroom?

Let's sample some evidence.

In days of yore, I enrolled in "Elizabethan and Jacobean Drama," a course taught
by the distinguished scholar and teacher David Novarr. The course was organized
as a chronological march from Kyd and Marlowe in the 1580s right through to Ford
and Massinger -- the last playwrights of significance before the theaters went
dark in 1642. I remember savoring some delightful comedies by Ben Jonson and
Francis Beaumont and also a couple of ferociously brilliant tragedies by Thomas
Middleton -- writings, I suspect, that 2020s English majors are not destined
to encounter -- even though an acquaintance with these plays is essential
background for understanding the timeless works of Shakespeare.

There's no equivalent course in the present curriculum, but there is an
analogue, and it appears in the catalogue of offerings thusly:

ENGL 3240. Blood Politics:  Comparative Renaissance Drama

Blood is everywhere. From vampire shows to video games, our culture seems to be
obsessed with it. The course examines the power of "blood" in the early modern
period as a figure that continues to capture our imagination, not only as a
marker of racial, religious, and sexual difference and desire, but also as a
dramatic player in its own right. How does a politics of blood appear on stage
when populations are being expelled and colonized for reasons (mis)understood in
terms of blood?.... Topics include honor, revenge, purity, the body, sexuality,
conversion, and death.

The course description itself is a mess -- both incomprehensible and
meretricious. I'm shocked by the catchpenny pandering. Do 2020s teachers need to
lure students into their classrooms with "vampires" and "videos?" The assertion
that "blood is a dramatic player in its own right" is nonsense. The description
reads like advertising copy for a cheesy low-budget horror flick playing at some
louche all-night grind house.

Moreover, "blood" isn't "everywhere." Goodness gracious!

I'm afraid that these entrancing plays are doomed to be put through the
"cultural studies" homogenizer. Or "theorized" out of all compass.

Ah, well.

Back in 1960, I had a summer job in Ithaca and therefore happened to be loafing
around the campus when the University hosted its returning alumni. Among the
returnees were the old folks  -- some few of them members of the class of
1895 -- who had walkered and wheel-chaired to their Sixty-Fifth. Geezers, I
thought. It's sobering to realize that those codgers were the same age -- 86 --
as I am now. Should I  return to Ithaca this coming spring, for my very own
Sixty-Fifth, I will be perceived by the young 'uns exactly as I observed those
Class of 1895 guys: as ancient and irrelevant.

It follows, therefore, that my reservations about the 2025 English curriculum
have their exact parallel in the 1895ers perspective on my 1960 curriculum. It's
not hard to imagine that they -- I mean the members of the class of 1895 --
who had been educated in elocution and Old Norse, would have been shocked and
perhaps outraged by the 1950s "modern" curriculum that I found so enticing and
illuminating.

And now, because I don't want to go full curmudgeon and become the kind of
superannuated guy who shakes his ebony stick at the modern world and deplores
the decline of civilization, I'm going to make an effort to find out what's
really going on in 2025. I have therefore set myself the task of reading a
representative sample of the books written by members of the present-day English
faculty.

I'll report on my studies right here.

Stay tuned.

[January 18] Bernhard Starr writes:  "Vivian, you are right about the course
description. It's a disgrace. It's badly written and ridiculous. Why didn't you
include the name of the prof. who wrote it?  He/she needs to be exposed. What
"populations are being expelled and colonized" by Volpone or The Changeling? 
And did you look other course descriptions -- are they equally silly?  What's
worst about the course description is that it doesn't respect the plays that the
class is going to examine. They're not important interesting dramas to the
teacher -- they're just fodder for an ideology.

[January 19] Vivian de St. Vrain replies: "Mr. Starr, I didn't identify the
author of the course description because the website doesn't identify him/her.
Just as well. Also, I didn't read other course descriptions though I might do so
in the future. I think you're correct that the course description does not
respect the dramas or their authors. Which is, as you suggest, mighty
disappointing."

[January 19] Bernhard Starr replies:  "I think I'd rather study Old Norse."

[February 4] Thurston Dale replies:  "I guess I'm a geezer, too (Cornell, '65).
I'm glad I majored in English before criticism turned crazy. Great teachers --
Mizener, Abrams, Parrish, Novarr."

[March 17] Anatole Miles Webber writes: "Vivian, you were naive back in the
1950s and you're still naive now. You assume that the Cornell English Department
of your youth, 65 years ago, was normative and normal. You were then and still
are oblivious to the fact that the Department's 1950 curriculum was the product
of stress and change and compromise. Try to remember that there were at least
three forces at work and that various faculty members had various degrees of
commitment to them. The first group was the oldest -- the traditionalist who
studied, as they had always done, literature as history and biography and
philology. Get the text and the context right was their primary concern. Then
there were the 'new critics" -- heirs to Leavis and Scrutiny in England and the
southern agrarians (Ransom, Tate, Warren) in the US. But the main intellectual
current riling English Departments were the fierce critics out of New York
(mostly Jewish) circles (Kazin, Trilling, Fiedler, Paul Goodman, Irving Howe,
etc). In retrospect, even though Cornell brought both Lionel Trilling and
Cleanth Brooks to Ithaca during your and my years there, the new winds made
little impression on our education. Cornell was peaceful, isolated and non-

still do. It was stable until the theory people brought in novelty and confusion
and excitement.
