# NEURAL DOMAIN CARTOGRAPHY: COGNITIVE ARCHITECTURE MAPPING

## ADVANCED PATTERN RECOGNITION MODULE (WEEKS 13-14)

This specialized analytical module provides students with a comprehensive topographic mapping of Subject de St. Vrain's neural architecture based on frequency, interconnection, and semantic weight analysis. The visualization demonstrates the proportional distribution of cognitive resources across primary knowledge domains.

*Students must complete Neural Interface training before engaging with this three-dimensional cognitive mapping.*

## ACADEMIC ENGAGEMENT QUESTIONS

1. How does Subject de St. Vrain's cognitive architecture compare to the standard pre-Integration intellectual consciousness pattern? What elements are typical versus atypical?

2. Analyze the relationship between the subject's Shakespeare neural pathways and his linguistic obsession patterns. How do these interact and reinforce each other?

3. The high percentage (55.8%) of biographical elements demonstrates the pre-Integration tendency toward self-reference. How does this compare to post-Singularity consciousness structures?

4. What do the "emerging domains" suggest about the evolution of Subject's consciousness over time? Pay particular attention to Mortality Consciousness (9.8%).

5. Compare the literary analysis patterns (24.6%) with modern quantum literary analysis methodologies. How has our understanding of narrative processing evolved since the Integration?
