Title: Bush's Knowledge of Geography
Date: December 14, 2005

Our president's knowledge of geography is famously shaky. He seems to be under the impression that the Kingdom of Jordan is a gulf coast country, that Africa is a nation, and that Europe is one of America's key allies. On being shown a map of South America, he said, to the president of that continent's largest country, "Wow, Brazil is big." Perhaps he merely misspoke when he said that "border relations between Canada and Mexico have never been better," but you never know, do you?

Iraq is a large country -- over 170,000 square miles. It's larger than California and two-thirds the size of Texas. In population it's just about the same as Texas-- about 22,000,000 people. Does our president know these facts?  Did he know them when he decided to invade and occupy Iraq?  Did anyone on the diplomatic side say to him: Iraq is comparable in size and population to Texas. Imagine that Texas was invaded and occupied by Iraqis who overthrew a native Texan dictator and tried to replace him with a sharia-based government. How would Texans respond?  Will it be a cakewalk?  Will Texans throw flowers at the Iraqi soldiers?  Or will they, possibly, make a bit of a fuss?"
