Title: Peony Survival
Date: March 27, 2007

Last October, I decided that one of my herbaceous peonies -- a Prairie Moon, to be precise -- needed to be separated and re-planted. I did the deed, but a few days ago, while cleaning the garden, I found a small, overlooked fragment of a tuber -- six inches in length and no more than half the diameter of a finger -- lying on the ground entirely exposed to the elements. I missed it last autumn, I guess.  But the good news: while there was no sign of rooting, there was a bud -- and the bud was swelling with new life.  (It had been a wicked winter, with temperatures down to 10F.)

Peony-growers know that it's important not to plant the roots too deep in the soil. The experts say two inches at the most. My experience is that in our Colorado clay, two inches can be too much, and that peonies so planted may come up spindly and flowerless. But now I know that it's safe to err on the shallow side.  Herbaceous peonies are tougher than I imagined -- pretty much impervious to cold.  Or at least such is the case with this particular variety.

Friends, I can't tell you how much I admire that tenacious little cylinder of life.  It's toughness is inspiring.  I've prepared a burrow for it -- the best in the way of soil and situation that I can offer. Let's see what it makes of its new opportunity. It's spring;  I'm optimistic.
