Title: An Overheard Anecdote
Date: May 20, 2007

We were flying Frontier from DC back to Colorado. Two old guys (old, but younger than I) were swapping stories. Here's one. "Rosie and I were at a hotel in Vegas, in bed.  About one in the morning, we hear a hooker knock on the door across the hall.  'Anyone want a little action.' No answer. Then, sure enough, she knocks on our door. 'Want some action?'  Rosie says, 'Move on, honey, I'm working this room.'"

Good dialogue.

I assume that Rosie is the wife.  But the story, at least to my tired old ears, has a slightly different valance if she's a date, a business associate, or a mistress.
