Title: Good News for the Directionally Impaired
Date: July 09, 2007

I've been indoctrinated by our uncomprehending society to regard my geographical dyslexia, or my directional disability, or whatever it's to be called, as a shameful condition. So it's good to know that DD can be otherwise valued.

I've been informed by one of my readers that the Pilipino word ligaw has two meanings: a) courtship, and b) totally lost. As a result, the adjective ligawan can refer either to a person who has no sense of direction, or to someone who is especially attractive to suitors. It stands to reason that a person who has absolutely no awareness of direction (right or left, east or west) whatsoever and is constantly buffaloed and flabbergasted by the well-meaning instructions of friends and would-be guides must be extremely radiant, perhaps even charismatically magnetic.

I find this new information to be both highly probable and extremely consoling.

Moreover, my admiration for Pilipino language and culture and good sense has skyrocketed.

I therefore propose that the term "geographical dyslexia" be replaced by "ligawan."

From this moment on, there's a new order to the universe: to be hopelessly dysgeographical, hopelessly lost is now, officially, sexy.
