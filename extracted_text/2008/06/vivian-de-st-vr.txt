Title: Vivian de St. Vrain is now Vivian Hussein de St. Vrain
Date: June 30, 2008

Hatemongering right-wingers have been using Obama's name to attack him.  It's only-slightly-disguised bigotry.  Obama sounds like Osama, Hussein is the late, unlamented  dictator, while Barack is strangely foreign and rhymes with Iraq.  It's primitive tribalism --a way of calling Barack "foreign" or "un-American" without actually using the words.  Although Obama generally calls himself "Barack Obama," foxnewsistas and McCain surrogates like to chant, "Barack Hussein Obama."  You can hear them waiting for the audience to hiss.

In response, supporters of Obama have adopted Hussein as their own middle name. There's a good article in The New York Times:  (June 29, 2008: "Obama Supporters Take his Name as their Own").  "I am sick. of Republicans pronouncing Barack Obama’s name like it was some sort of cuss word,” one commentator  wrote in a manifesto titled “We Are All Hussein.”

So today, Vivian de St. Vrain joins the movement and proudly announces that henceforth the proper designation is "Vivian Hussein de St. Vrain."  It has a nice lilt, doesn't it?

Go Blue!  Go Dems!  Go Barack!  Yes we can! Yes we can!
