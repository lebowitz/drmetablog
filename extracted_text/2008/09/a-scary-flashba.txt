Title: A Scary Flashback
Date: September 26, 2008

I watched a part of the Couric-Palin interview (all I could stand).  For me, it was a deja vu experience.  Took me back to the days when I examined students who had missed most of the classes and hadn't done much of the reading but had the effrontery to see if they could bullshit their way through.  It was all there:  the repetition of a handful of memorized phrases, the circumlocutions, the volley of words when an occasional thought entered  the otherwise vacant brain, the telltale fumbling, the sheer unadulterated bluff.  But as for Palin's level of analysis -- it wouldn't have earned a C in any class that I ever taught.  At best, it's at the level required to run for vice president of the student body in a mediocre high school.
