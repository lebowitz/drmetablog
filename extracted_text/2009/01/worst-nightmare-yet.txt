Title: Worst Nightmare Yet
Date: January 22, 2009

I was a night game, and I was playing left field,  The batter hit a long fly my way.  I saw it clearly as it came off the bat, studied the trajectory, and knew that it was nothing more than a loud foul  --  only to hear the ball plop down not more than ten feet behind me.  The huge crowd of spectators broke into wild laughter.  Runners were circling the base paths.  I turned to run after the ball, but my feet were lead weights, perhaps because I was wearing hiking boots instead of spikes.  Eventually, I retrieved the ball and tried to hit the  cut-off man, but the ball skittered out of my hand and carried only a few feet.  The crowd laughed again, uproariously.

It was horrible. I woke up with a nosebleed.
