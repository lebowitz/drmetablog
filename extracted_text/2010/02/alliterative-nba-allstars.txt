Title: Alliterative NBA All-Stars
Date: February 10, 2010

Everyone out there in Bloglandia has been eagerly awaiting my NBA All-Star team chosen to accord with the template, A**** A****, B**** B****, so here it is at last:

Centers:  Moses Malone, Alvan Adams, Darrell Dawkins.

Forwards:  Paul Pierce, Bill Bradley, Happy Hairston, Joe Johnson, Walt Williams, Dale Davis.

Guards:  Rajon Rondo, George Gervin, Gale Goodrich, Lafayette (Fat) Lever, Steve Smith, Wally Walker.

Coach:  Scott Skiles.

If anyone can suggest important additions to this list, I'd be mighty grateful.

February 11.  Spike Cohen writes:  "inasmuch as the spoken language has priority over the written, George Gervin is ineligible. In place of Gervin, at guard, how about Phil Ford."
