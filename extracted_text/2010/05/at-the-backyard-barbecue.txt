Title: At the Backyard Barbecue
Date: May 30, 2010

"I grew up in Durban and in Cape Town. It was a privileged enclave. I had no idea what was going on except that when I competed in sports, there were kids who had no shoes. That was my first awareness. I went to government schools, but everyone was white. The teachers were not allowed to talk politics but we knew how they felt. When I was eighteen and finished high school, I could either go into the "police" or to jail.Â  f you were in the police or in the army, you were going to fight the guerrillas in Angola or you were going to put down the natives. My mother was British, so I had a British passport. I left the country. I was a triathlete. Sometimes we were sent to train in South Africa. I knew then that I could never come back. I lived in France for fourteen years. We lived in southern France, in Marseilles and in Avignon. There were many Arabs and they would jeer at my wife when she went running. We came to Boulder because of the running community. It's a great place for children. It may be a bubble, but it's a good bubble. I don't run anymore but I coach triathletes. It's what I know how to do.

Mandela was amazing. He was very forgiving. I don't know if it will always be forgiving. I completely understand the resentment."
