Title: Conversation with our State Representative
Date: February 28, 2011

Dr. M:  "Do you think that these tea party Republicans can be educated?"

State Rep:  "I'm not hopeful. They don't know much about governing. They don't want to know anything.  They're very disciplined -- they vote exactly the way they're told to vote. And they're not very intelligent."
