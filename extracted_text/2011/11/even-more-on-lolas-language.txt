Title: Even More on Lola's Language
Date: November 13, 2011

Let us understand what Lola (the exemplary two-year-old granddaughter) meant when she cryptically observed, "Nay, no ba."

Nay --perhaps better spelledÂ  neigh -- means horse or horses. "Ba" are of course sheep. Lola watched them last summer when the two grazing animals shared the same Vermont pasture. But when her father took her to a Virginia farm, she noticed that there were no sheep among the horses. Hence her succinct formula: "nay, no ba."

As Duke Vincentio says, "all difficulties are but easy when they are known."
