Title: What Lola Remembered from Last Summer
Date: April 07, 2012

It was a long, luxurious summer, with gardens and apple cider and swimming and berry-picking and walks in the woods and cousins and all sorts of games.

All much enjoyed by Lola, who is now approaching two and a half years old.

"So, Lola, what do your remember about last summer in Vermont?"

Lola, after a pensive moment: "Sheep and horses poop on the grass."
