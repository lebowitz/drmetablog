Title: More About Lola's Use of Language
Date: June 30, 2012

At two-and-a-half, Lola has become very precise. Grandpa: "That's a nice white sweater you're wearing." Lola: "It's a jacket." Grandpa: "You're tired. Why don't you put your head down on the bed." Lola: "It's not a bed; it's a pad." Grandpa: "It's a nice blue pad." Lola: "It's green."

All this precision is coupled toÂ idiosyncratic pronunciations. Ketchup, for example, is "kep-tuck."
