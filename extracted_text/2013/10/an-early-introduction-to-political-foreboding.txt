Title: An Early Introduction to Political Foreboding
Date: October 07, 2013

I was thirteen years old when Eisenhower-Nixon defeated Adlai Stevenson. I was of course horrified. In what sort of nation, I thought, could a doddering simpleton with a dark mccarthyite machiavel at his ear defeat an intelligent, educated, humorous progressive. Ghastly, ghastly.

Mullling this over this morning, I remembered that while Truman was still in office, postage stamps would be cancelled (hand-cancelled in those days) with the inscription, "Twenty-five years of Social Security." But right after the Eisenhower inauguration, the slogan was altered to "Pray for Peace."

A message about a concrete program that actually helped people suddenly turned into a meaningless, faux-religious instruction. "Pray for Peace" did not seem then, nor now, like a viable political position. "Pray for Peace" did not speak to me.

Sixty years later and the Republicans are still beating the same meaningless drum, still going backwards.

Not only have the damn Republicans not caught up with the age of reason, but they're still embracing the dark ages.Â The hole into which they've inserted their collective heads is not only deeper but considerably more vacuous.
