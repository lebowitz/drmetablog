Title: NBA Aristocrats
Date: March 27, 2014

There's Sir Charles Barkley, of course, leading the way, and all those Kings (Bernard, the king of Kings, but also Albert, Stacy and a score more). Dozens of Earls, including the diminutive Boykins, and my favorite, nomenclature-wise, Acie Earl. Also Brevin and many other Knights. Nor can we forget Marques Johnson or Marquis Teague. And Mel Counts, the 7' foot guard. Baron Davis, Walter Dukes, Tayshaun Prince. Royal Ivey. Let's not forget Mike "The Czar" Fratello.

While the big dipper was only a chamberlain, there's a notable double-dipper:  Earl Barron.

There must be many more. Help me, metablogians. Surely I've just scratched the royal surface.

March 29:  I can't believe that I forgot King James, who may be better than KD, but certainly less fun to watch.
