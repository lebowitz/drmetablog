Title: Deepfried Oreos
Date: April 20, 2017

On the main street of Estes Park (Gateway to Rocky Mountain National Park), a sign outside the restaurant advertised "deepfried oreos." I was both flabbergasted and thunderstruck, not believing my eyes. But here's the evidence:

Just above ice cream and below "funnel cakes" (but that's another story). Is it a hoax, or can there be such a thing? Absolutely, there's many a google-entry on "deepfried oreos." Several different recipes, one more hideous than the next. A piece of cuisine americaine that had somehow escaped me all these many years.

One of my waggish friends writes: "I should confess that the last time my wife and I were in Paris, we sampled the deep fried Oreos at a little café on the rue de Rivoli. The sommelier suggested a hearty Cabernet to take the edge off the sweetness of the dish and the wine worked beautifully with the cookie filling, an amalgam of flavors that made our senses tingle." I of course was skeptical of his story. No knowledgeable sommelier would recommend a red wine because it was well known that deepfried oreos were best served with champagne or gatorade.

Is it possible that deepfried oreos could become part of the cuisine of old Europe? Will it be the case that in every Italian village, just between the macelleria and the quaint pasticceria there will be an oreofritteria? A mom-and-pop oreofritteria using recipes that have been in the family for centuries -- but in danger of being taken over by the big American chain, a subsidiary of -- who knows what -- called Signor Oreofritto. A terrifying prospect all around.
