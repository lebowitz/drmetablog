Title: Canyon Passage (1946)
Date: November 24, 2018

In our tour of classic western movies, we watched Canyon Passage (1946), directed by Jacques Tourneur, who is famous for the noir masterpiece Out of the Past (1947). Canyon Passage is a good substantial film and it's got everything a frontier drama should have: a cabin raising, a saloon in which a poker game is perpetually in progress, gold mines, muddy streets, Indians (unsympathetically depicted as mere murderous savages), gun fights, bar brawls, lovely landscapes, and Andy Devine.

At its emotional heart is a mighty curious three-way relationship between Dana Andrews as Logan Stuart, an upstanding entrepreneur; Brian Donlevy as George Camrose, a banker/gambler, and Susan Hayward as Susan Hayward. Hayward is engaged to George but attracted to Logan. She doesn't seem to know what is made obvious to us, that George is a compulsive gambler, a wastrel, an embezzler, a serious flirt, and eventually a murderer. Why Hayward, or Lucy as she's sometimes called, doesn't see him for what he is puzzles us. It's an even greater mystery that Logan Stuart, who knows George's faults, remains loyal -- even, at one point, risking his life and imperiling his reputation to break his friend out of prison.

The oddest scene is one in which George gives his fiancee Lucy a tepid kiss. He turns to Logan and says, "Can you do better?" Logan takes the challenge and kisses his friend's fiancee; he wins -- she clearly responds less to her intended than to his friend. What are we to make of this?  It seems borderline pervy. Is there a suggestion that the men are closer, more "friendly"  than the conventions of the western film ordinarily allow?  Or are Logan and George more than just good ol'  loyal buddies?

After George is killed, Logan and Lucy wind up together, but more for convenience than passion, or so it seems to suspicious ol' me.
