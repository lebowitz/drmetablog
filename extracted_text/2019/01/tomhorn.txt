Title: Our Local Gunslinger:  Tom Horn
Date: January 01, 2019

Although he has been mythologized, he was real. Here he is in the photographic flesh, perhaps weaving the rope by which he was famously hanged.



And here's the movie version: Steve McQueen, slightly more glamorous.



My earlier self, the Brooklyn 'yoot', would have been happy to know that I now live only a few feet away from the mythical gunslinger.
