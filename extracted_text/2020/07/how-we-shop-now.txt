Title: The Way We Shop Now
Date: July 18, 2020

The last time, a decade ago, that I needed a rug pad, I went hunting at various malls and shops that might stock such an item. After a few exhausting hours, I located an appropriate-size rug pad at one of those large import stores -- it may have been Pier 1 or WorldMarket. The quality wasn't quite right, and the pad was too large and too costly, but it was there --Â  and I do possess a utility knife with a very sharp blade. So I bought it, struggled with it, but -- it worked, and it's still there, doing its job, padding the Heriz.

This time, covid-time, I'm not allowed to search around town, and I don't want to, so instead I did some internet sleuthing for "rug pad."

It's a revelation -- there are many, many vendors very anxious to satisfy my rug pad needs: RugPad USA, Mr.RugPad, RugPads 'R Us, Rugpad-orama, eSaleRugPads, RugPadStock, RugPadHome, RugPadSolutions, Dr. Pad, RugPad World, Royal-T RugPads, Underfoot-Inc, and My Rug Pad, among others. Costco sells a "Mohawk" rug pad made of "100% post industrial recycled synthetic fibers with all natural rubber with SBR latex backing," whatever that is, not cut to exact size, and you have to buy a shrink-wrapped package of four.

I choose RugPadUSA not only for patriotic reasons but because its site featured a lengthy explanatory essay on the potential disasters, hazards and glories of various species of rug pads. Are you not shocked to learn that that some inferior rug pad manufacturers pad out their fiber with clay?

RugPad USA is a company that takes its rug pads very seriously. I am now up to snuff on Grip, Cushion, Longevity, Sustainability, Safety, and Made-in-America-ness. And also on materials: rubber, jute, felt, Pure Wool, hemp, and memory foam, in their various forms and combinations (and prices).

I went with an "eco friendly Nature's Grip 100% natural rubber and plant jute." It arrived in four days, cut to exact measure. Perfect. This rug pad is so beautiful, let me tell you, that I'm thinking of laying it on top and putting the old tribal Turkish Varamin tent rug underneath. Well, maybe I'm getting too enthusiastic about my glorious new rug pad.

Advantages to internet shopping: it lets your fingers do the walking, there are an infinity of choices, and after a while the item appears miraculously outside your door. Disadvantages: you can't see or feel the product before making a decision; it's a pain to return mistakes; your cash goes to an absentee merchant (RugPad USA is located in Connecticut); local shops suffer, and also, slightly delayed gratification. But the electronic mall is definitely the way we shop now.
