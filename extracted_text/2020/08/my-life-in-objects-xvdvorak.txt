Title: My Life in Objects -- XV (Dvorak)
Date: August 24, 2020

Although my mother loved classical music and listened daily to WQXR, our family did not own a phonograph. Eventually, sometime around 1953 or 1954, a record player appeared courtesy of my older brother Eugene, who set it up in his bedroom and also bought a few albums. His collection consisted of a few Broadway musicals and some pop standards (Sinatra and the Mills Brothers for sure). He allowed me to use his machine when he wasn't at home. What an opportunity! I memorized Oklahoma and Guys and Dolls,Â among others.

When I was eleven or twelve years old, I was home from school of a week. Was it whooping cough? The radio became my constant companion (no TV in those years). Every day for a week, I listened to a "dramatization" of a novel by Dumas. I believe it was Twenty Years After, but I can't be positive. The story was not memorable, nor were the performances, but the "background music" was to my ears astonishingly beautiful. On Friday, when the story came to conclusion, it was announced that the music that had entranced me was the New World Symphony.

After I gained access to Eugene's record player, I saved my nickels and for $1.98, the standard price of LPs at that time, I bought a copy of the Symphony. It was an expenditure of significance, even for someone who was pulling down $.75 an hour shelving books at the local public library.

Having discovered that one could buy and own recorded music, I little-by-little added to my collection. By the time I graduated from college, I owned ten or a dozen recordings. I remember Dennis Brain's performance of Mozart's Horn Concertos, Paul Kletzki's version of Mahler's Symphony #1, an Angel recording of Bach's Magnificat, and a Prokoviev Lieutenant Kije Suite. There were a few others that I can no longer remember. But none of them were as important as the Szell Dvorak, which was my gateway to the classics.

I'm listening to it now. Via Alexa.
