Date: November 26, 2020

[March, 2012]  Well, maybe not readers. Page-viewers. But did they view closely?  Did they savor the wit and learning?  Did they browse?  Or did they merely Ctrl-C and plagiarize a few sentences for that high school essay which is due tomorrow morning?

Still, 100,000 is a good round number. Some bloggers, alas, have as many visitors in a single day.

[November 25, 2020: 315,000 visitors, or viewers, or readers, or whatever they're called. And counting.]
