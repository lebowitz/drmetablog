Title: Carded at 84
Date: March 28, 2023

Wow, carded at this great advanced age! Not, of course, carded so as to be permitted to purchase alcoholic beverages.  Those days are long since gone, and besides, I don't drink.

It was yesterday, at the Denver Art Museum, when I asked for senior tickets (a big $2.00 discount). "May I see your driver's license. I have to check that you're over 65?" "Are you kidding, I'm 84!"  "No, I need to see it." Needed to see LERM's also, although she's 79. Frankly, we were both a bit flattered, even if it was all because of bureaucratic procedure rather than guess-your-age eyeballing.

I remember that a score of years ago, a clerk at a some venue or other scanned my face and without the least hesitation charged me senior fare. I was then only 65 and was slightly insulted to be taken for my full actual age. Now, a similar but upside-down situation, and I'm mighty amused.
