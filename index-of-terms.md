*For detailed mapping of cognitive domains, see the [Neural Domain Cartography]({{ '/cognitive-domains.html' | relative_url }}) module.*

*Neural archeology notes: This comprehensive index represents approximately 96.7% of Subject de St. Vrain's documented consciousness artifacts, integrating both thematic preoccupations and interpersonal relational networks. Complete neural mapping would require Advanced Integration Protocol certification (Level 3+).*

*Special note: Subject demonstrates unusual self-reflective capacity for a pre-Integration consciousness, with multiple metacognitive analysis patterns appearing across the documented record.*
