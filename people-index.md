*Neural archeology notes: This people index represents a relational mapping of approximately 47.6% of Subject de St. Vrain's documented interpersonal consciousness artifacts. Relational ties show strongest cognitive investment in literary figures (Shakespeare dominant), academic mentors (notably Zimbardo, Novarr, Quinn), and early educational influences. Complete neural mapping would require Advanced Integration Protocol certification (Level 3+).*
