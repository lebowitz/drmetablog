1. **counterhuman** (54 occurrences): A philosophical term used in academic contexts, suggesting opposition to conventional human perspectives or anthropocentrism.

2. **blague** (49 occurrences): A French word meaning "joke," "jest," or "prank." Its frequent use suggests the author's familiarity with French terminology.

3. **demotic** (12 occurrences): Referring to the ordinary, everyday language or culture of common people, as opposed to literary or elevated language.

4. **doppelganger** (11 occurrences): A German term meaning a ghostly double or counterpart of a living person, often used in literary or philosophical contexts.

5. **pandiculation** (8 occurrences): The act of stretching and yawning, especially upon waking. An extremely rare word in common usage.

6. **simulacrum** (8 occurrences): A representation or imitation of a person or thing, often with connotations from Baudrillard's postmodern theory.

7. **nascent** (7 occurrences): Just coming into existence; beginning to develop or emerge.

8. **anagnorisis** (2 occurrences): The critical moment of recognition or discovery in a literary work, especially in Greek tragedy.

## Analysis and Observations

1. **Academic and Philosophical Vocabulary**: The presence of terms like "counterhuman," "simulacrum," "exegetical," and "lacunae" reveals the author's academic background, likely in literary theory and philosophy.

2. **Multilingual Knowledge**: Words like "blague" (French) and "doppelganger" (German) demonstrate familiarity with multiple languages and their specialized terminology.

3. **Literary Expertise**: Terms like "anagnorisis," "zeugma," and "prosaic" are specialized literary terms that would typically only be known to those with advanced literary education.

4. **Linguistic Playfulness**: The use of extremely rare words like "pandiculation," "virago," and "sesquipedalian" suggests a delight in linguistic obscurity and verbal play.

5. **Distinctive Voice**: The frequent use of "counterhuman" (54 occurrences) and "blague" (49 occurrences) represents signature vocabulary that helps define the author's distinctive voice and interests.

This analysis confirms that Dr. Metablog employs an unusually sophisticated vocabulary drawing from specialized academic fields, literary theory, and multiple languages. This linguistic profile suggests an author with extensive academic training, likely in literary studies, and an exceptionally broad vocabulary that far exceeds typical English usage.
