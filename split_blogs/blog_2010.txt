Title: Another Visit to the Coffee Shop
Date: January 01, 2010

Reading at one of our local Starbucks, I was, as is often the case, lost in my
book. But I looked up when a late 20s-early 30s blonde and bearded man sat down
at a table across the way. I noticed that he was holding his cup of coffee in an
odd way. And then I realized that where his right hand should have been there
were a pair of stainless steel hooks. Sad, I thought. And yet he seemed cheerful
and optimistic. I wondered if I would be in such good spirits if I had lost a
hand in an accident. I went back to reading, but looked up again when he fumbled
with the sleeves of his jacket. And then I saw that he had no left hand either.
Instead, a  pair of hooks, left and right, where hands and fingers should be.
What terrible accident could have caused a young man to lose both hands, I
wondered. Perhaps I was more sensitive than usual, but I was moved almost to
tears as I watched him manipulate his coffee and his napkin and his muffin with
his mechanical prosthetics. Soon his young and attractive girlfriend joined him.
She came on aluminum crutches. "Must have broken her foot," I thought. Then I
saw that there was no foot and that she had only one leg.

I'm slow, but I figured it out at last.

Soldiers. Home from Iraq. Bombs -- IEDs --  took off his hands and her leg.
They met at a rehabilitation hospital. Fell in love. They're trying to start
life over again.

I'm not ashamed that I turned away and started to cry.

And then grief converted to anger.

That damned useless war! That idiot ignoramus Bush! That villain Cheney!. Those
two megalomaniacs, and their co-conspirators,  who started this war -- they're
sitting pretty right now, aren't they? But these young folks right next to me --
they're not sitting so comfortably. They've paid the price.

Belatedly, I wish them all the joy that life can offer. As for crazy George and
strutting Dick, there's no penalty that they can pay, there's no retribution
sufficient -- but if their pernicious bodies would rot half a centimeter a day,
why, that would be a start.

Title: Well-aged Outrage
Date: January 04, 2010

Another day, another solicitation  from Cornell, the university that I attended
back there in the Bronze Age 1950s. I've got to admire their tenacity -- they've
been holding out the tin cup for fifty years and I've never dropped in a nickel.
Not even a copper.

Why so negligent? Well, there are a number of reasons. The first, and probably
most important, is that I took my education so seriously that I became a
teacher, and as a result,  I never accumulated the kind of dough that would
make the least impression on a multi-billion dollar endowment. A second reason:
I sent my daughter to Cornell during the 1980s (at what now seems like the
bargain rate of only $20,000 - $25,000 a year), and the total four-year cost of
her stay was a sufficient contribution to the ole alma mater. And finally, other
causes felt more pressing (last year, for example, Obama, and this year, helping
to keep our state legislature blue). But these reasons are mere rationalization
and excuse, for, truth to tell, I bear a grudge against Cornell. Let me unclasp
a secret book and tell you about it.

In my first year at Cornell, I shared a room in an all-freshman dormitory. It
was not gracious living, but I hadn't expected it to be. Cinder-block walls,
composition floors, cheap extruded-aluminum furniture. Worst of all, the doors
were fragile, hollow-core, and were always busting. I busted one -- I slid a
piece of furniture and sliced a hole into the 1/8" plywood sheathing of Room
2117. (Whose brilliant idea was it to put fragile doors in the way of a thousand
adolescent males?) Anyway, some guys came to fix the hole, which they did by
gluing a 2" by 6" piece of plywood ONTO THE SURFACE OF THE DOOR. Talk about
craftsmanship!

But here's the rub. I was billed $10 for the so-called repair. $10.00?  Not so
much, you say?  Well, I was then employed at $1.25 an hour, so the perfunctory
repair, which couldn't have taken five minutes to complete, represented the
before-tax wages of a full day's labor. (Further context: the rent for my half
of the room was $315 for the 32-week school year, or less than $10 a week.) 
Plus the bill was sent directly to my father, who was scrimping to send me
whatever bucks he could afford and didn't need to know that I had wasted $10
laying waste to the elegant decor.

I was outraged. I'm still outraged.

Hey, Cornell. Make it up to me. Do the right thing. When you've contrived an
apology and a recompense, well, then, maybe we can start to talk about possible
donations.

Title: A Melancholy Errand
Date: January 08, 2010

Before Grandma died, she specified cremation and asked that her ashes be divided
between the graves of her husband Dan and her daughter Phyllis. Now the time has
come to fulfill the first half of the assignment. We'll fly to NYC later this
month. We'll make a pilgrimage to the Baron Hirsch cemetery on Staten Island,
scatter a portion of the ashes, leave behind a ceremonial stone or two, and
think thoughts as positive as the occasion will allow.

However, in the light of the Detroit plane incident, I'm concerned about
carrying a box of white powder on board. Am I paranoid? is it completely nuts to
imagine that some vigilant but misguided TSA employee will take a gander at the
ashes and think "anthrax" or "explosives." Take me into that little room where
they peruse your "body cavities." And then on to Gitmo.

Apparently, I'm not the only person with this worry.

"Passengers are allowed to carry a crematory container as part of their
carry-on luggage, but the container must pass through the X-ray machine. If the
container is made of a material that generates an opaque image and prevents
the security screener from clearly being able to see what is inside, then the
container cannot be allowed through the security checkpoint." Is our container
sufficiently transparent? How would one know?

Instead of carrying the ashes aboard, why don't we just check them through?

"Some airlines do not allow cremated remains as checked baggage so please check
with your air carrier before attempting to transport a crematory container
in checked baggage." Why would United Airlines care whether I put ashes in
my bags?  It's obvious -- they lose the luggage and then we sue them for
zillions.  How about if I promise not to sue?

I'm going to guess that it's not a good idea to sew the "cremains" -- hideous
neologism -- into my underwear.

OK, here's the plan.  We take a symbolic portion the ashes, secure it in a
transparent ziploc baggie, and insert a visible all-caps large-font note: "These
are Grandma's ashes. They are not dangerous. Feel free to examine or to sample."

Incidentally, I can offer no confirmation to the rumor that the Department of
Transportation plans to ban all underwear. Or that it will insist that underwear
be worn on the outside. These are vicious canards.

Title: Haute Cuisine, c. 1945
Date: January 09, 2010

A friend of long standing (a Shakespeare scholar) has posted a recipe for a
dish that she calls grieven but which was known as gribbinis in our part of the
world. It was a staple of my childhood, perhaps even my favorite food. Gribbinis
also linked me to my grandma. Inasmuch as she didn't speak the only language I
knew, it was natural and appropriate for us to bond over food.

"Accumulate a cup or two of chicken fat. Render the fat in a pan with about an
equal amount of chopped onion. Slowly heat the fat and onions over a low
flame, being careful not to let the mixture ignite. The onion will turn golden,
then brown, and some of the fat will become crisp."

My friend suggests serving the resulting mixture over mashed potatoes,
but for grandma and me the preferred vehicle was a hefty portion of about 3/4
grated black radish and 1/4 onion--along with some black bread to sop up the
grease. I thought it was a delicacy for a king, not knowing, then, that it was a
dish for an impoverished  peasant in a Ukrainian shtetl.

Black radish? Not a vegetable familiar to you? Black on the outside, white on
the inside, turnip-size. Very, very, very, pungent. Not widely used here in
North America, nowadays, but apparently still common in eastern Europe, where
mouths are more acclimated than ours to allyl isothiocyanates.

Whenever I'm among folks who make a fetish of  food preparation, I fantasize
about taking them home and plunking down a trough-size trencher of black radish,
onions, and gribbinis.

Would that be hostility? Possibly, just the merest tad. Or perhaps just a need
to remind myself where I came from when, perchance, I find myself among tender
and exquisite palates.

Title: The Shop on the Corner
Date: January 11, 2010

From our window, looking left across the street, we can see a squat old cinder-
block building that sits diagonally on its corner lot.  I remember when it
housed a gas station, then a taqueria, and afterward, for at least a decade, an
import rug store that was always 'going out of business,' until, contrary to
all expectations, it went out of business. The building lay vacant for a year
or so, but now it's found a new purpose. It's a medical marijuana "dispensary."
(Marijuana, when used for the relief of pain or nausea, is legal in Colorado).

When we're curious, and willing to make the effort, we watch the arrival of the
chronically afflicted patients. The are uniformly youthful and they come by car,
on foot, on bicycle, on skates or skateboard or scooter. The only vehicle in
which they don't arrive is the wheelchair.

In fact, neither "our" dispensary nor any other dispensary bothers to pretend
that their product (aka stash) is anything but recreational. GreenLeaf Farmacy,
for example, advertises Kief Hash! at $25/gram. Boulder Wellness Center offers
"High Quality Medical Marijuana: Tinctures, Vaporizers, Ointments, Teas, and
More." TopShelf Alternatives competes at $10/Gram and with "your choice of 34
home grown strains. Edibles include Mile High Ice Cream." DrReefer specializes
in "clones." Boulder MM Dispensary is "an upscale establishment with high
quality medicine."  Colorado Patients First, "where compassion for patients and
quality of medicine comes first," offers "Sour Kush, Big Blue, Opium, AK-47,
Maui Mist, Jack White, and Pot of Gold." For each painful disease, apparently,
its own uniquely targeted variety of ganja. To judge by the exuberance of the
clientele, the "medicines" must be alleviating tons of pain.

How did it happen?  Some years ago, voters approved an amendment to the
state constitution legalizing the medical use of marijuana. The argument was
compelling (and I voted for it).  Marijuana mitigates chronic pain and also
minimizes the nausea that accompanies chemotherapy. Until this year, the state's
Department of Public Health had limited individual physicians to five such
suffering patients. But then a judge ruled that the constitutional amendment
did not impose such limits, and, in the words of John Milton, "all hell broke
loose."

There's no zoning (as with liquor outlets), no sin tax (because marijuana is a
prescription drug), and no decorum.

"The latest data from the Medical Marijuana Registry maintained by the Colorado
Department of Public Health and Environment shows that as of Dec. 15, 2009, 
a total of 820 licensed physicians had authorized medical marijuana for 15,800
patients. Of those 820 physicians, just 15 accounted for 73 percent of total
patients, and just five have authorized 49 percent of all recommendations."
There are now more than eighty marijuana dispensaries in our town. (There are
just ten traditional pharmacies.) It makes one wonder about the size of the
underground economy.

It's the Wild West -- unregulated, unbridled capitalism!  It's a growth
industry!

It's also massively hypocritical.

Why don't we just legalize marijuana, and then regulate and tax it the way we do
liquor and tobacco? Of course, neither liquor nor tobacco pays its way -- the
social cost of both drugs well exceed their revenues -- but that's a topic for
another day.

There are bills in the legislature to regulate the marijuana industry and
everyone knows that within a year there will be tight new restrictions. But
until then, we will much enjoy the scene at the corner store.

[Update March 15, 2023.  Pearl Maneli writes:  MMJ, as it's often called, is now
legal in Colorado, but the store visible from our window no longer sells it; the
building has been transformed into an upscale i.e. expensive pizzeria.]

What would prompt a guy to dream that his carrots were growing upside-down?
Their abundant orange roots pointing straight into the air?  What point is my
dreamatorium trying to make?  In this particular nightmare, I'm absolutely
perplexed about photosynthesis. If they're upside-down, how do they..?

There's more. In the dream, my lettuce is growing right-side-up, but it's
encrusted with some sort of white stuff that forms a collar around the base of
the plant.

Courageously, I taste it. It's -- by gosh -- feta cheese. Salty, but still quite

Title: The "Motor" vs. the Horse
Date: January 18, 2010

Edith Wharton loved the "motor" but never lost her nostalgia for the horse drawn
vehicles of her youth.

A passage in A Backward Glance (1932) conveys the novelty and thrill of her
virgin voyage.

"There were no motors in 1903; but as a toy for the rich they were beginning to
appear. My old friend George Meyer was the owner of a magnificent specimen. I
had never been in a motor before, and could hardly believe that we were to do
the run from Rome to Caprarola and back (fifty miles each way) in an afternoon.
The car was probably the most luxurious, and certainly one of the fastest, then
procurable; but that meant only a sort of high-perched phaeton without hood or
screen, or any protection from the wind. I had the high seat like a coachman's
box. Off we tore across the Campagna, over humps and bumps, through ditches
and across gutters, windswept, dust-enveloped, I clinging to my sailor hat. I
spent the next days in bed, fighting an acute laryngitis. In spite of this I
swore then and there that as soon as I could make money enough, I would buy a
motor, and having a delicate throat, scoured the country in the hottest weather
swaddled in a stifling hood with a mica window, till some benefactor of the race
invented the wind-screen and made motoring an unmixed joy."

The early twentieth-century "motor" was hectic, prone to breakdowns, and
erratic. In contrast, the vehicles of Newport, Rhode Island of Wharton's
aristocratic youth were dignified and stately, as much for display as for
utility. "Young ladies, married or single, expected to be taken for an afternoon
drive by the master of the house. The vehicles of the fashionable young men
were either dog-carts (drawn by a pair driven tandem) or a high four-wheeled
conveyance called a T-cart, which was drawn by one big stepper, while the older
men drove handsome phaetons with a showy pair, and an impressive groom with
folded arms in the rumble. Carriages, horses, harness and grooms were all of the
latest and most irreproachable cut, and Bellevue Avenue was a pretty scene when
the double line of glittering vehicles and showy horse-flesh paraded between
green lawns and scarlet geranium borders."

"Dog-cart?" "Phaeton?"  T-cart?"  What do these words signify?  And moreover,
what the heck was a daumont, "preceded by outriders, which swayed gracefully on
its big C-springs to the rhythm of four high-stepping and highly-groomed horses,
a postilion on one of the leaders, and two tremendous footmen perched high at
the back."

Title: One Heck of a Big Miller
Date: January 22, 2010

The miller in The Miller of Angibault is, according to George Sand, really,
really huge. "The big miller descended, stretching, from his corn-loft, cracking
the joints of his long arms and legs. He was well-proportioned, robust, easy in
his movements, and strikingly featured. This specimen of the countryside was
remarkable for a region whose inhabitants are generally on the short side." 
How tall was this "tall miller?"

Nineteenth-century novelists rarely give us hard data, but George Sand provides
the exact measurement for this "specimen." "Grand-Louis" is exactly five feet
eight inches tall!

Le Meunier d'Angibault was written in 1844. It's in Thackeray's Pendennis
(1850), I think,  that one of the female characters is described as a "maypole"
of five feet four inches.

I wonder how tall Shakespeare imagined Helena -- the famous "painted maypole"
of A Midsummer Night's Dream.  Probably just as tall as the boy who played the
part, but how much would that be in inches?

Height is believed to have increased a centimeter a decade in western Europe
from 1850 to 1950.  Is it possible that the great heroes of antiquity --
Hector, Samson etc. -- were all under five feet tall?  My grandfather was just
a hair above five feet tall.

The average height of American males was 5' 8" in 1960 and is 5' 9 1/2" today. 
How tall would a Louis have to be today to be called Grand-Louis?

Title: A Visit to the Post Office
Date: January 25, 2010

Package to mail, so off I go to the post office. When I arrived, eight people
are on line ahead of me. I took my place. There were only two clerks on duty
and let me tell you they were not breaking any speed records. They were moving
as though through mucilage. If I had to guess, I'd say that they were working
at just above the speed in which all molecular motion ceases. Their pace seemed
carefully calibrated, as if in answer to the implicit question, "what's the
least possible amount of energy I can expend and still retain my job?"  There
was some grumbling on the line: "Only two clerks on duty!" It took me twenty-
five minutes but I completed my transaction. When I left, there were ten people
behind me, letters or packages in hand, shuffling and stamping their collective
frustrated feet.

How much time wasted?  Well, here were nineteen productive citizens taking
twenty minutes or half an hour to do five minutes worth of work. You do the
calculation. If there had been another clerk, and if the clerks were to move at
normal human speed, I would have been in and out in a flash. Multiply the TWF
(time waste factor) by all the post office stations in urban America. What an
astonishing, third-world loss of productivity.

The post office has been essentially privatized. It's not allowed to run a
deficit, so it cuts back on services and continues to raise the cost of mailing
an envelope. And makes people wait.

But it retains from its former incarnation the lifetime-employment uncivil-
service mentality. It combines the worst of free enterprise with the worst of
public ownership. It's a truly remarkable solution to the implicit question, can
we design a completely dysfunctional bureaucracy?

About a decade ago, some idealistic postmaster-general announced a campaign
to serve every customer within ten minutes of arrival. To that end, a large
clock was set in a prominent spot in the every office in the land (in ours, just
where the line commences).  A big PR fuss was made. About a year later, all
the clocks were quietly removed.  I wonder, where did they go. Does the USPS
maintain an old clock warehouse somewhere in central Nebraska? Or were they
discarded? Or taken home by the local postmasters. In any case, the campaign was
a total disaster. The system did not move.

The USPS didn't even do a good job of removing the clocks. When I stand in line,
I stare at a wire sticking out of the wall where a clock used to hang.  I stare
at it for ten minutes, for twenty minutes, for half an hour....

Title: Another Long Night
Date: January 27, 2010

Last night, I had a specific sense that I hadn't been sleeping in clover.
I worried for hours and I worried about everything. I started, I think, by
brooding on the inevitability of a comet striking the earth and extinguishing
life as we know it. From there I moved to the collapse of the ecosyste. The
earth will soon (in geological terms) be hot, waterless, and lifeless. In
the nearer future, monsoons, tornadoes, tsunamis, hurricanes and other "acts
of god" will occur with increasing frequency. My pillow was hot, and the bed
sheet somehow managed to tangle itself around my legs.  I worried about the
possibility of nuclear weapons or vials of botulism falling into the hands
of jihadists. I worried about the declining population of our swifts and
swallows, our frogs and toads, our bats and bees and about the certainty that
the Asian longhorn beetle is about to do to the maples what the blight did to
the magnificent chestnuts and the Dutch elm disease did to ulmus americanus. Not
to mention the wooly adelgid that is intent on making hash of our hemlocks. I
worried about the decline of the American economy, about the rebirth of bigotry
and know-nothingism among the Republicans and about the pitiful fecklessness
of the Democrats. I was working myself up to quite a state, sweating into my
blankets. What about our radical-reactionary-interventionist supreme court?
Oh my gosh, I forgot to worry about all those poor people in Haiti! At about
four in the morning, I switched to more local worries: my apical hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy, my increasing failure of memory, and my lifelong tendency
toward procrastination, once resisted but now re-emerging with a vengeance. I
reviewed the recent deaths and diseases among my age-cohort of friends:  --
K's polycynthemia vera, R's brain tumor, S's alcoholism, J's obstructed colon,
B's shingles, C's lung cancer, my brother's sudden death of stroke or embolism
or who knows what it was. I thought of the friends to whom I should have been
more kind, more concerned. I worried about my children and grandchildren, all
apparently thriving, but you never know. I fell in and out of sleep. I got up
and paced.

Toward dawn, I straightened the bedclothes, took a leak, ate some yogurt, and
tried again. I woke up in a cold sweat, having dreamed that I was painfully
plucking hairs out of my lips. Not hairs, exactly. More like boar's bristles.
And that every handful of bristles was infested with spiders and other verminous
insects.  Eew, hairy lips. How disgusting.

I did not worry about dying.

Death: no more nightmares, no more insomnia, forever.

Title: Reposted:  Salinger
Date: January 28, 2010

J. D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye is an anti-bildungsroman -- a "novel
of education" without the least shred of moral, intellectual, or spiritual
growth. Holden Caulfield, the novel's naive yet jaded narrator, learns
absolutely nothing either about himself or about life. Unable to profit from
his various encounters, he dismisses almost everyone he meets as "phony."
That one adjective, repeated incessantly and ad nauseam, might lead a reader
to hope that Holden will find authenticity somewhere in his horizon, but The
Catcher in the Rye is not a novel that rewards optimism.  It concludes with
a vision of Holden's pre-pubescent sister Phoebe going "round and round" on a
symbolic carousel-- going nowhere, it would seem -- and in a brief coda Holden
himself has been institutionalized and placed under the care of an unsympathetic
psychoanalyst. Nor does the whiff of Humbertism in the relation between Holden
and young Phoebe contribute any last-second learning or cheer.

Even in the 1950s, The Catcher in the Rye enjoyed a cadre of fiercely loyal
partisans who powerfully identified with Holden Caulfield. I didn't believe
then, and certainly don't believe now, that Holden mirrored the anguish of my
own particular soul. I was not a true believer, and I was not entranced by
Holden. For me, the novel was nothing more than a better-than-average coming-of-
age story -- although a dispiriting one because Holden Caulfield does not mature
but instead remains stranded in perpetual, painful adolescence.

A novel without hope, The Catcher in the Rye has become an inspiration for the
hopeless. In Los Angeles, in 1989, twenty-one-year-old Robert Bando shot and
killed a young actress whom he had been pestering with trinkets and messages.
In a nearby alley, police found a .357-caliber handgun, a bloody shirt, and
a copy of The Catcher in the Rye. Two years later, John Hinckley shot and
crippled James Brady and almost succeeded in assassinating Ronald Reagan.
Hinckley had fantasized that killing the president would impress the actress
Jodie Foster, whom he imagined that he was wooing. In his pocket he carried
a well-read, tattered paperback of -- you guessed it --The Catcher in the
Rye. In 1980, on Manhattan's West Side, Mark David Chapman, concealing his
pistol under a copy of The Catcher in the Rye, shot John Lennon five times at
point blank. He had inscribed his copy of the novel with the words "To Holden
Caulfield from Holden Caulfield" -- Chapman had tried to legally change his
name to that of Salinger's troubled narrator. From jail, the proud murderer
issued an endorsement: "My wish is for all of you to someday read The Catcher
in the Rye."  At his trial Chapman asserted that he had killed Lennon because
the singer had become "phony," and at his sentencing he read to the judge the
section of the book in which Holden tells his sister Phoebe that he imagined
himself in a field of rye with "thousands of little kids" whom he must prevent
from falling off "the edge of some crazy cliff."

The Catcher in the Rye still sells well (15,000,000 copies in print by 1996) and
has become a fixture in the high school and college classroom, where successive
generations of adolescents can calibrate their degree of angst against Holden's.
But increasingly, and paradoxically, attention has turned from the novel to
Salinger himself, who has not published anything since 1965 and, secluded in his
Cornish, New Hampshire retreat, has become the world's most notorious hermit
since St. Simeon Stylites mounted his pillar in sixth-century Antioch. Although
he is a hermit, Salinger is anything but a saint. In 1987, in a bizarre echo
of Holden-obsessed stalkers, Salinger, then sixty-eight years old, flew to
California and barged onto the set of the TV show Dynasty in search of one of
the series's starlets, Catherine Oxenberg, with whom he had apparently fallen
into long-distance electronic infatuation. He was "escorted" off the set.
Did Catherine Oxenberg have a precursor?  She did, indeed she did. Several,
in fact, including Joyce Maynard, described as "the Lolita of all Lolitas,"
who was eighteen and a freshman at Yale in 1972 when Salinger, at the age of
fifty- three, initiated a romance by sending her a fan letter. These and other
even less savory details about Caulfield-Salinger's life can be found in Paul
Alexander's thin, amateurish biography Salinger (Los Angeles: Renaissance Books,
1999), which does not propose, although it might, that J. D. has learned as
little about life as his most famous character.

Title: Compliment/Complement
Date: January 29, 2010

Here is a sentence drawn from a contract for new condominium construction.
"The laundry room flooring is a composition tile called Stonewalk; it is a
warm light color that compliments all of the wood floor options." And here's a
second sentence from the same contract: "bedroom carpets are a warm light color
that compliments all of the wood floor options."  Compliments?  As every
schoolchild is taught, "to compliment" means "to praise."  The wording of the
contract therefore asserts that Stonewalk, a composition tile, speaks highly of
the wooden floor. The bedroom carpets join in the chorus of adulation. No doubt
that it's a praiseworthy floor, but are the warm light carpets and the warm
light tiles fully qualified to make so positive a determination?

Surely the highly-skilled and well-compensated lawyers who drew up the contract
meant to write (if they subscribe to conventional canons of usage) that "the
color of Stonewalk complements the color of the floors." That is to say, the one
color "completes" or "makes perfect" the other.

For example:  you may compliment the sommelier, but the sauvignon rouge
complements the rosbif or the biftek. Them's the official rules.

But should they be?  Is the distinction between compliment and complement
meaningful? Or is it pedantic and arbitrary?

What can history tell us about these twins?

In Shakespeare's Love's Labor's Lost, Don Adriano de Armado is "a refined
traveler of Spain..., /That hath a mint of phrases in his brain;/ One whom the
music of his own vain tongue/ Doth ravish like enchanting harmony;/ [He is]
a man of complements."  But is a "man of complements" a courteous man who
offers gratuitous compliments, or is he rather a fulfilled or a complete man. 
Clearly, Shakespeare's word conflates the two meanings. A second example, this
one from King Lear:  "There is further complement of leave-taking between
Burgundy and [Lear]."  Does "complement" mean, "politeness" or "formal
civility," which would be "compliment";  or does it mean that Burgundy and Lear
have finished or completed or brought to perfection their parting sentences? 
Once again, both meanings are possible. Examples of such blurring can be
multiplied. Falstaff (in The Merry Wives of Windsor) says this: "I see you are
obsequious in your love and I profess requital to a hair's breadth; not only,
Mistress Ford, in the simple office of love, but in all the accoutrement,
complxment, and ceremony of it."  Complement, compliment; take your pick. 
Either is possible;  both make perfectly good sense.

It's obvious that the doctrinaire distinction between the spellings has been
imposed since the time of Shakespeare. In fact, the dictionaries tell us
that the introduction of a second, separate word is an example of learned
Frenchification. OED:  "Compliment (Fr) is a doublet of complement (the form
directly from Latin). The latter was in use before the introduction of the
French form, which slowly took its place between 1635 and 1715." The twins have
been, and still are, closer in meaning than traditionalists allow (which is why
the condo contract writers got it, so to speak, "wrong").

What to do?  My suggestion: let's overleap the conservatives and embrace the
truly reactionary. Let's declare that from now on, "compliment" and "complement"

brains over "i" and "e," no more anxiety, no more guilt.

Title: This Old House
Date: January 31, 2010

"It was irresponsible for me to have bought this house," he thought. "And yet
it is so glamorous, so desirable.  I should have inspected it more closely. 
There are many parts of the building that I've never even looked into. Take
this room, for example.  It's far too long and narrow to be useful  I must
have been attracted to the bookshelf and to the books. But now that I look
closely, I see that the books are tattered and  worthless. I thought that they
were valuable, but they're just thrift store discards. And the kitchen -- I
don't think it's functional. These hand-carved boards, which I thought were so
beautiful -- they obstruct the sink and the stove. I'll have to remove them. And
in this room -- what is it, a bedroom? -- the murals are nothing more than the
scrawls of children. What could I have been thinking? I have purchased a house
that is a shambles. It's going to cost me a fortune just to make it habitable.
Look, in the living room the wallpaper is pulled off and the lath is exposed.
And here, in the grand ballroom, there's been leakage around the window frames.
This huge fireplace is falling in. This passageway, which ought to go to the
nursery --it's been blocked off. And this sitting room has no outside wall. No
protection from the weather at all. The wind could blow right through. It was
self-destructive of me to buy this house. It's financial suicide. What could
have attracted me to it? Let's walk around the outside. There are entrances that
I didn't know existed. Anyone could come in. It's not secured; there are no
locks, no doors. And a garage -- but the garage floor isn't concrete or paved
-- it's just sand and rocks. And this outside wall, which I took for marble
or granite -- it's just old loose, cracked, unpainted stucco. The yard is a
complete wreck -- all concrete and razor-wire, nothing alive. Who's that strange
man prowling around?  Why was I attracted to this place?  Why do I still find
it alluring, despite everything that I know about it?"

Later, we all went for a drive in the mountains. It was cold and the roads were
completely covered with snow and almost impassable. We arrived too late for the
party. "Let's all meet at the Unitarian church," one of the other guests said.
"I'm going to kill me a chicken," said another.

Burks said. "I've got real bad tendentious in my leg. He said he thought I

Nothing worse for team solidarity than a tendentious leg in constant squabble

Title: Insects, Drugs, Science Fiction
Date: February 08, 2010

In the course of their long evolution our insect friends solved the problem of
adolescence.While we humans grow ever so awkwardly from childhood to sexual
maturity, your efficient, clever insect larva merely sequesters himself for a
few weeks or months and then emerges as a completely fledged adult. No whining,
no rebellion, no pimples, no door-slamming -- one day a child, and then, presto,
a full member of society. There's not a beetle on what Antigonus called "the
whole dungy earth" who ever had to "find himself."

I wish that my own pupa-hood had been so quick and painless, but in fact, it
was a commonplace mix of anxious folly and meaningless alienation. My most
successful strategy for coping with the mess was to escape into the imagination.
Not my own imagination, of course, for I had little or none, but into other
people's. In my pupal stage, I was an indiscriminate reader of the genre known
as fantasy and science fiction. Inhabiting, as I did, the wrong body, and having
been birthed in the wrong time and place, I preferred fantastic alternative
universes to so-called "real life." I subscribed to a bunch of pulp mags and I
also gobbled the extensive collections of sci-fi in the local public library.
Not everyone will recognize the writers who were then my literary heroes,
but for me they were names as familiar as Koufax and Drysdale or, for that
matter, Truman and Eisenhower. Does anyone out there remember these folks:
Robert Heinlein, James Blish, L. Sprague de Camp, Richard Matheson, Isaac
Asimov, Robert Sheckley, Arthur C. Clarke, William Tenn, Poul Anderson, Fredric
Brown, Fritz Leiber, Theodore Sturgeon, Clifford D. Simak, Fletcher Pratt, Ray
Bradbury?  Names to conjure with, so to speak.

Here's a paradox. While I vividly recall the names of these authors, I can
remember almost nothing of what they wrote. I was fully immersed in the genre
and yet it's evaporated from my memory -- leaving less of a mark than does
the grub that becomes a butterfly. I seem to recall a novel or story about a
planet in which the trees were murderous -- they would send their roots through
ventilating ducts and strangle people in their beds. I have a hazy recollection
of a story about a society in which overconsumption was the norm and in which to
take a sofa and a set of chairs off the hands of newlyweds was an act of love.
I recall some precocious evil children endowed with supernatural powers. Do I
remember, or do I just imagine that I much admired a story about human beings
shrunk to infinitesimal size who had to go mano-a-flagellum with paramecia. I'm
certain that I encountered a superfluity of post-apocalyptic stories: after
the A-bomb, after the plague, after the invasion from another planet -- all
such fictions obvious symptoms of cold-war paranoia. Why in the world should
an adolescent earthling have consoled himself with stories of extragalactic
invaders spaceshipping to our green earth to exploit, or colonize, or enslave,
or, occasionally, to butcher and stew us? In the 1950s, aliens were always
hostile. None of my authors, as far as I can remember, could envision them
greeting us with the outstretched tentacle of peace.

Although I think that some of the stories were imaginative, most of them were no
more than starwarslike space operas-- Westerns but with death rays instead of
six-shooters.

It's been many a year since I could abide fantasy. The genre is now repugnant to
me.  I can't read Tolkien or Harry Potter, I can't watch movies about ghosts,
or satanic possession, or space travel, or time travel, or about people stuck
in other peoples' bodies. All such nonsense bores the living heck out of me.
Nor is it merely the lowbrow stuff. I can no longer read Spenser or Ariosto
and my least favorite character in Shakespeare is the magician Prospero. Is it
a failure of imagination on my part?  Perhaps. But I don't feel it as a loss.
There's more than enough of the non-fantastic to keep me joyfully occupied. I'm
grateful that sci-fi served my pupal needs, but it's gone forever.

Nowadays I tend to think back to my adolescent reading only when I'm at the
drugstore filling a prescription. The names of the new concoctions devised
by Big Pharma all sound extraterrestrial to me. For example: Cyclessa is the
queen of the distant planet Pulmicort which circles around the star Ativan in
the galaxy called Levaquin. Cyclessa’s evil brother Coumadin, along with his
henchmen the evil twins Zantac and Zocor, have attacked the queen, using their
secret weapons Restoril and Ritalin. They're accompanied by the enchantress
Ambien, aka Zolpidem, who causes her enemies to fall into profound sleep. But
deep in the forest, young Prozac awakens from a spell, mounts the great horse
Oxycontin, and with the aid of his sidekick, the amusing but randy Cialis, who
has escaped from the clutches of the evil witch Prevacid....  Etc., etc.

Title: Some Mondegreens
Date: February 15, 2010

When, In a Canterbury bar many years ago, I ordered a cider, the East Kent
cockney bartender responded with a question that I interpreted as "strong
Boer what knees?" Why would he ask me about the joints of a South African
farmer? I was absolutely befuddled even when he repeated the question several
times. Finally, in frustration, he held up two bottles of cider: the first was
labeled "Strongbow" and the second "Watney's." He was simply asking me if I
preferred Strongbow or Watney's -- but how was I to know?  Some years afterward
I mentioned this incident to an English friend who countered with a story of her
own. On her first visit to New York City, she said, she ordered a sandwich and
the counterman asked her "fur rear oughta go?"

I recalled these events while musing on two moments of childhood linguistic
extremity. The first was when I asked one of my P. S. 217 friends what they did
during Religious Instruction (in the 1950s, Roman Catholic kids were released
from class for two hours a week to study at the local parish church, which in
my neighborhood was St. Rose of Lima -- popularly known as "Roe Salima."  Our
teachers took the opportunity to catch up on the local newspapers while students
twiddled the collective thumb). My friend's answer, "Cat kiss 'em." It was many
years before I understood that the word I had no hope of understanding was
"catechism." I was even more puzzled when a Jewish student, who could not know
that I came from a family that regularly celebrated Yom Kippur with a roast
pork dinner, asked me, "do you put on to fill in?" I construed the question to
be some sort of insult, but after a decade or so I realized that I had been
asked something rather serious: "Do you put on tefillin? -- tefillin being small
leather boxes containing biblical verses donned by observant Jews during morning
prayers.

In my neighborhood, it was common for people to shout "doozie pots" at each
other.  I had no idea what that expression meant, except for a strong feeling
that it wasn't praise. It was not until I studied a little Italian that I
understood that what I heard as "doozie pots" was a Sicilian variant of tu sei
pazzo, "you're crazy."

None of these misunderstandings, strictly speaking, meet the mondegreen
threshold;  let's call them near-mondegreens. (The best-known mondegreen is
"I led the pigeons to the flag" -- a mishearing of "I pledge allegiance to the
flag." The word mondegreen derives from one of the Child ballads: "They hae
slain the Earl of Murray/ And laid him on the green," the second of these lines
misheard as "And Lady Mondegreen"). In my long list of personal mondegreens,
the two that are most vivid in my memory are connected to my incomprehension
of religion.  They are a) the luscious "round young virgin" of Silent Night,
and b) the theologically implausible "The Lord is ice, the Lord is made of ice"
in one of the choruses of The Messiah ("even so in Christ, shall we be made
alive"). Here's another mondegreen from my childhood:  "Who knows what evil
lurks in the hot cement?" March 12:  Last night at dinner, I remarked  that
one of my favorite innovations of the second half of the twentieth century was
"fitted sheets."  A guest said, "You're right;  we didn't used to have feta
cheese."

Title: News from the World of Nose Ornamentation
Date: February 16, 2010

Although youngsters sometimes try to piss off their parents by inserting
into their nose a modest jewel or a gold circlet, we (as a nation or as a
civilization) aren't terribly enthusiastic about decorating the old schnozzola.
While the English language has words for many kinds of jewelry (ring, earring,
brooch, bracelet, necklace, tiara, pectoral), it is vacant of vocabulary
for objects that are affixed to or hang from the nose. Consequently, this
magnificent piece of gold jewelry, crafted in Peru two thousand years ago, which
certainly bore a name in proto-Quecha or whatever was spoken at the time, is now
simply called a "nose ornament."

It's spectacular, isn't it? The four jolly, fat spiders in their intricate
communal web of mesh are truly lovely. We moderns can't compete.  We have
nothing to offer.

Here's another beauty, this one from the area that is now Columbia.

This nose ornament is five inches long from top to bottom, which means that it
would cover the mouth and hang well below the chin. The small gold discs and
the long flattened cylinders are loosely attached, so the ornament was designed
both to catch and reflect the light and to jingle. This one, like the spider
ornament, is glittery, ostentatious, and unapologetic.

I imagine that like most such jewelry, these nose ornaments were designed to
say, "I''m rich, I'm powerful, and I'm sexy. Come mate with me." To me, they
also say, very loudly, "I can endure massive rhinal discomfort." It appears
that these nose ornaments were inserted between the nostrils and attached to
the septum. To wear such an ornament would be painful even if the wearer never
sneezed or blew his nose, but to insert and remove it would be sheer nasal
agony. Those sharp points would dig into the tender flesh. And the object must
have been frequently removed,  because with the ornament in place, drinking
or eating would be impossibly messy. While the nose ornament might get a guy a
date, it would certainly inhibit chat or flirtation, and would also become a
major impediment if he got lucky.

I'm not impressed by the pitifully small nose ornaments worn by modern
teenagers, but I would definitely respect the child who was willing to brandish
something equivalent to these wonders. Especially the one with the spiders.

Title: Shakespeare, Eggcorns
Date: February 20, 2010

In The Second Part of King Henry the Fourth, the Hostess (also known as Nell
or Mistress Quickly) regularly makes fritters of the English language. At one
point in the play, she is beside herself -- apoplectic, in fact -- because she
believes that she has been abused by Falstaff. Reaching for words to equal
her anger, she tries for "homicidal" three consecutive times. First she calls
Falstaff a "honeysuckle villain," then a "honeyseed rogue" and finally she
settles on "hempseed." Although "honeysuckle" and "honeyseed" are amusing
guesses, we feel --or perhaps I should speak only for myself-- I feel just a
bit guilty that I've let Shakespeare amuse me at the expense of an illiterate
woman's linguistic lapses.

I have the same reservations about Charles Dickens's jokes on the unlettered;
the word "apoplexy," for example, appears as "happyplexy."  It makes a second
appearance in Great Expectations, when Jo Gargery, of whom much is made that he
has never learned to read or write, explains that his father died of a "purple
leptic fit."

I think that pillorying linguistic errors is more fun when the perpetrators
are not illiterate but pretentious. Such is the case in Sheridan's The Rivals
(1775), where Mrs. Malaprop, striving for "pinnacle," refers to a character as
"the very pineapple of perfection." The most famous sentence in The Rivals:
"Sure, if I reprehend any thing in this world it is the use of my oracular
tongue, and a nice derangement of epitaphs" (apprehend, vernacular, arrangement,
epithets).

In the last couple of years, there's been an attempt to distinguish a subset
of such malapropisms as "eggcorns." The neologism derives from the unlearned
collapse of "acorn" into "eggcorn" (a substitution which is more intelligible
when the word egg is pronounced as in rural "aig"). An eggcorn is supposed to
be a special variety of malapropism in that "the new phrase makes sense on
some level ('old-timer's disease' for 'Alzheimer's disease'). But what sort
of sense?  Why is "baited breath" for "bated breath" anything more than a
simple spelling error?  For that matter, "honeysuckle villain" and "honeyseed
rogue" also make a kind of sense -- a Shakespearean and psychological sense. The
Hostess unconsciously reveals that she's sweet on Falstaff.

In any case, there's now an eggcorn database on the internet.  A goodly
number of the eggcorns are errors that have appeared time without number on
student essays. I can't guess how often I used to encounter "peak (or peek)
one's curiosity," "leech" for "leach," "peon" for "paean," or "pier" for
"peer";  or how many times students would "pour" over their work. I remember
being stunned the first time that I encountered "morays" for "mores," but I
eventually acclimated to that formidable shock. What can it possibly mean to
"reek" havoc?  Others common student errors: "spade" for "spayed" (sometimes
pluperfectized to "spaded"; "verses" for "versus"; "phase" for "faze"; along
with the exceedingly respectful "sirname." I believe that the amount of space
I enclosed by circling these common errors as they appeared on coffee-stained
student submissions would roughly equal the surface area of Weld County.

The eggcorn database contains some "learned" malapropisms that are new to me.
"Hare's breath" and its funhouse mirror twin "hair-brained"; "beyond approach";
"Cadillac converter"; "garbage shoot"; "wet one's appetite." I can't picture
"well-quaffed hair," but I can certainly visualize a "wind-powered turban." "It
finally donged on me" makes some sense, but "crutch of the matter" is utterly
nonsensical. How laid back is a "mellow drama?" To "give up the goat" may have
meaning in pastoral societies. My absolute favorite: "pus jewel," as in, "his
adolescent face was covered with pus jewels." The avian reference in "one fowl
swoop" (for one fell -- i.e. fatal-- swoop) was well anticipated by Macduff: 
"What, all my pretty chickens and their dam/ In one fell swoop....  O hell-
kite."

And speaking of chickens (and eggs), there's also chocolate "eggclair" and
"eggtopic" pregnancy, both of which are weirdly inventive, but neither worth
(drumroll, maestro!), a pullet surprise.

The hype and hoopla at sports arenas are truly deplorable, especially to aged
eyes and ears. At a Washington Wizards game in DC a couple of weeks ago, members
of the starting team were introduced not only with spotlights, screeching, and
"music" but also with bursts from a high-powered flame thrower. Even fifty
yards away, I could feel the toasty heat.

Wild over-the-top absurdity and irrelevance, in my opinion. I go to a basketball
game to see a basketball game, not to be danced at, kiss-cammed at, or showered
with gift certificates, free pizza, and t-shirts.

I'm back home in Boulder again, and last night I heard performances of
Prokofiev, Beethoven, and Brahms by the ever-so-formal Escher Quartet. Lord-a-
mercy, did they ever make me long for a little sporty glitz. The Eschers (three
men and a woman, all of whom appeared to be in their 20s) conducted themselves
as if they just woken up from a long day of sleeping in their coffins. They
were utterly joyless. They resolutely avoided looking at each other or at the
audience or betraying the least emotion. The expressions on their faces did
not say, "magnificent music"; they said, "is that curdled milk, or what?" They
plucked and sawed at their instruments with as much enthusiasm as if they were
cleaning out the septic system. Their playing was exact but uninspiring--but
what can you expect from three mortgage brokers and a dental hygienist?  The
Eschers acknowledged the generous applause of the audience as if they were
feudal overlords hearing the petitions of dung beetles.

Whenever I go to chamber music concerts, I feel young. Actually, I am young,
because in the chamber-music crowd, anyone without a walker or an oxygen bottle
is a kid.

The Escher should loosen up a bit -- and perhaps attract a younger and
livelier audience.

Here's the fantasy. Cue spotlight. Cue big-voiced announcer. "And now, on cello,
from Thousand Oaks, California, in his fifth year, out of the Manhattan School
of Music, Andy Janss." Janss runs on to the stage, carrying his cello overhead,
his rhinestones glittering in the lights. He high-fives the other members of
the group, shakes the confetti off his shoulder-length hair, tosses some talcum
powder into the air....etc. etc.  Crowd roars. He plays with enthusiasm. So do
his comrades.

But let us not sacrifice the dignity of classical-music. No flame throwers.

The grand-daughter, age 10, visited here last December.  She showed me her new
cellphone. She was "texting" with a friend.  I asked her how she does it, and
she gave me a lesson, even though she was startled and horrified, I imagine,
to realize that, although an adult, I didn't know that it's one click for a
d, two for an e, and three for an f. Her thumbs flew, mine limped, but I got
the idea -- and then forgot about it until, a couple of days ago, when  was
waiting in the doctor's office without a book and wasn't in the mood for Golf
Magazine. I started to play with my two-month-old entry-level cellphone and
discovered that if you press Menu, and then Messaging and then Send Message and
then Enter Number that you can "text" -- of which I had no idea, my cellphone
skills being usually limited to "what is that noise coming from my pocket I'd
better check."  So I laboriously scribed (or thumbed) my first message to the
grand-daughter: "Thank you for teaching me to send text messages."  And then,
miracle of miracles, a few hours afterward (after fifth grade had been dismissed
for the day, I suspect), I received an answer, which I now reproduce verbatim:
"when ur txting u dont have 2 use full sentences."

Title: Alcohol, Education, Logic
Date: March 01, 2010

A sorority girl fell off the roof of her house last week.  She was, of course,
staggeringly drunk. She messed herself up pretty badly but she will live.
Accidents of this kind happen regularly in our college town. Kids fall off
roofs, kids drive drunk and kill someone or themselves, or kids just binge-drink
themselves to death. It's regrettable that we've become accustomed to such
stories. I think it's the saddest thing: a family raises a child for twenty
years, sends him or her off to college with great hopes -- and two weeks later
the kid has crashed the car, fatally, or choked to death on her own vomit.

As a result of this latest incident, the neighbors have been engaged in an
internet war. One noisy faction insists that it's our policies that are at fault
-- that kids drink themselves to oblivion because alcohol is legally prohibited
until age twenty-one. If alcohol were legal, the argument goes, students would
then do their drinking in a controlled environment, such as an adult-supervised
party or a bar with rules on over-serving, and they wouldn't indulge in private.
It's a paradoxical argument -- alcohol would be safer if it were not prohibited.

After a great deal of back-and-forth and uninformed argumentation, one of the
neighbors, an epidemiologist who has actually studied the problem, presented
some data. That when New Zealand lowered the drinking age from 21 to 18, binge
drinking and accidental deaths increased. That binge drinking is higher in
European countries, some of which allow alcohol at age 16, than in the U.S.
That underage drinking declines, sometimes by as much as 40%, when rules are
enforced. That when alcohol is less available, alcohol consumption decreases,
and conversely, when it is made more available, consumption increases. That
the unformed brains of teen-agers are particularly subject to being addled by
alcohol.

The advocates of lowering the drinking age were unmoved by the evidence. One
resident, whom I will call BB, wrote in to say this: "Surely, had this 20 year
old woman been of legal drinking age, she would have been in the regulated
environment of a drinking establishment and not at an underground party. The
likelihood of her being overserved in that regulated environment and then ending
up drunk on the roof of her sorority would be considerably diminished. Unlike
Dr. F's and others' studies, this is a real life study that happened right down
the street. Let's open our eyes and start to learn from these events."  BB's
takes the position that we can ignore the data, forget the scientific studies,
and replace them with his interpretation of this particular event. BB's is a
good example of what is called "anecdotal thinking." But anecdotes, standing
alone, are not evidence nor can they replace the systematic gathering of
evidence and statistics. Meanwhile, another neighbor of long standing, KW,
answers the evidence with his own simple argument: we all drank when we were
young, there were laws in place then but we ignored them, nothing will ever
change, why make it hard for kids, let them drink at 18. KW is not much more
logical than BB. He argues ahistorically, quite oblivious to the fact that
alcohol is used differently in different cultures and in one culture a different
times in history.

BB says, it's cold today, there can be no such thing as global warming;  KW
says, there's always been weather, and it's always been warm

When I was a teacher, I tried over and over again to explain to my freshmen that
a) you can't build an argument on an anecdote, and b) that the experience of
an individual is not necessarily universal -- that to gather data, to consider
the context, and to apply logic were the hallmarks of the educated individual.
Neither BB and KW, both of whom, I believe, graduated from college, ever took
the first step in their freshman "critical thinking" class. They have their
views, and they're not going to let facts get in their way.

Is it relevant that both BB and KW are Republicans?  I believe it is.

But what should we do about alcohol abuse?  It's an intractable problem we're
not going to solve it immediately, but we have an instructive analogy in the
case of tobacco, where in the U. S, the consumption of tobacco has declined
significantly. We decreased tobacco use by a) prohibiting advertisements that
made smoking glamorous and alluring, b) increasing taxes, c) disseminating
information on lung cancer and low birth weights, etc, and d) by making tobacco
less available. We could try the same with alcohol, where billions are spent
by distilleries and breweries to make make alcohol use seem sophisticated
and ennobling. Instead, we could discuss incarceration rates, fetal alcohol
syndrome, homelessness, domestic violence, puking in the streets and choking in
the bed. We could limit the number of bars and alcohol outlets. We could make
drinking more expensive by raising the taxes to cover the civic cost in police,
judiciary, accidents, and prisons. We could tax wine less and hard liquor more.
We could rigorously enforce existing drinking-age laws. We could also encourage
the use of less dangerous drugs.

In addition, we could try to improve our educational system, so that when the
neighbors came to talk about alcohol abuse, they could conduct their discussion
with respect for fact and logic.

Title: Happy or Else
Date: March 10, 2010

Every week or so there's yet another breakthrough 'scientific' survey to tell
you which city is the healthiest, or the least obese, or the richest, or the
most educated, or whatever.  There's a new one out -- a poll by Gallup-
Healthways that has determined that the "happiest" place in the entire U. S. of
A. is my very own city  B---ld--r, C-l-r-do. I don't have the slightest idea
how the pollsters chose to define happiness, but I do know that the conclusion
drawn by the B--ld-r Camera (a dreadful gray newspaper that could not possibly
add the least dollop of joy to the life of any subscriber of intelligence,
imagination, or self-respect) makes no sense at all.  The Camera suggests
that people who want to be happy should move right here to B--ld-er. Can't
be right: if everyone came, the cheerful and morose alike, we'd immediately
and automatically fall right back to average. Actually, we'd fall even below
average, because of the misery caused by the spike in traffic.

Perhaps we're all dancing on our toes because we've legalized marijuana.

I suppose that the news that I'm happy should make me feel better, but instead
it just makes me anxious. Even though I'm of a moderately equable temperament, I
do have my gloomy spells.  When I'm in a funk, or a brown study, or I'm feeling
the blues  -- tell me, am I failing in my civic duty?  If I'm not pulling my
own happy wagon, am I discomfiting some other poor soul.  Putting a burden on
him to be inordinately cheerful in order to maintain our reputation.

Gosh, living in a happy city is so guilt-provoking.

On the whole, I was a lot more cheerful before I learned about the poll.

Every once in a while, a mountain lion creeps into the fold and snares a lamb,
a foal, or a German shepherd. At even more infrequent intervals, a mountain
lion attacks a human being (usually a child). Whenever there's a human-lion
interaction, there comes a deluge of letters to the local newspaper demanding
that the authorities exercise “lethal control" over the big cats. Killing
catamounts is neither hard nor dangerous. They were hunted nearly to extinction
in the nineteenth century. Dogs chase the animal up a tree. The brave hunter
takes aim and shoots.

But Is it a good idea to extinguish the mountain lion? In the United States,
there’s an average of one death by mountain lion a year. Here in B--ld-r
county, there’s been one such death in the last hundred years. One is a very
low number, especially when, in the country as a whole, snakes cause a dozen
deaths a year, lightning claims seventy-five, bee and wasp stings a hundred.
Dogs, when they’re not out hunting mountain lions, account for between twelve
to twenty deaths a year –- a couple of hundred a decade-- many of these, it's
sad to say, infants in the crib. Given the numbers, It’s hard to believe that
calls for the extermination of mountain lions aren’t motivated more by fear
than by facts.

Domesticated dogs are responsible not only for a dozen to a score of deaths,
but also for an estimated 4 to 7 million (that’s right, million!) cases of
dog-bite a year, almost 800,000 of which require medical attention. Dog bites
cause 368,000 emergency room visits, or (do the math!) one thousand such visits
a day.  The social cost of dog bites is estimated variously, but the Center for
Disease Control in Atlanta claims that the direct medical costs of dog bites per
year is $165 million, with many more millions in ancillary expenses.

Mountain lions, which are relatively harmless, inspire terror, but dogs, which
are far more dangerous, are our sacred cows -- loved, in my opinion, beyond all
propriety. It’s hard not to cringe when otherwise sensible people –- good
decent people --tell me in all seriousness that Towser is a full member of their
family, or that Fido is about to undergo an expensive hip replacement. The run-
of the-mill doggie in America enjoys a better diet and better medical care than
90% of the human beings on the planet -- a situation which I consider to be a
thoroughly indefensible skewing of resources. Dogs are not human beings, and
it’s immoral sentimentality to treat them as such. It’s embarrassing.

The ancients, following Aristotle, divided their possessions into three
categories: an object was an instrumentum mutum, an animal was an instrumentum
semivocale, and a slave was an instrumentum vocale. By eliding the differences
between humans and animals, the Greeks and the Romans made slavery both easy and
natural.

I used to worry that people who treated animals as humans would be tempted
to treat humans as animals. But it's not true; the people I know who are
sentimental about animals and "animal rights" are extraordinarily sensitive to
human rights -- but then, perhaps my sample is skewed. All of my friends are
sensitive to human rights; if they weren’t, they wouldn’t be my friends.

I wonder whether the love of dangerous dogs and the fear of the cats who are by
and large indifferent to us isn’t an instinct acquired over millions of years.
Our ancestors, armed at best with flint-headed spears, spent countless millennia
at the mercy of feline predators larger, more powerful and more terrifying than
100-pound mountain lions (the extinct European lion, panthera leo fossilis,
was taller, stronger, and and a foot and a half longer that the modern African
lion).  Some 50,000 years ago, an ancient Einstein conceived the idea of
domesticating wolves and selecting their population for useful traits. Humans
and proto-dogs started to cohabit; dwellings and caves came to be littered with
coprolites. Co-evolution began, and over the course of time, dogs and humans
came to be sensitive to each other's traits. Those early dogs were our first
allies on this lonely, hostile planet. They could raise a ruckus when a couple
or three lionesses prowled about the cave door.

We're indebted to dogs and so we tolerate their bad habits.  By the same token,
the over-hasty cry to kill the mountain lions is also an inheritance from our
fearful ancestors.

Title: My Life in Periodicals
Date: March 19, 2010

When I was a mere tad, perhaps seven or eight years old but already an
enthusiastic reader, I was given a subscription (by whom?) to a children's
magazine, perhaps Jack and Jill. It arrived once a month and took perhaps ten
minutes to read. It was certainly my older brother (who later owned a large
house that had twice as many mirrors as books, who said, "you still readin'
that thing for babies?" Always susceptible to public criticism, I soon turned
against the publication. Since then, I've subscribed and unsubscribed to dozens
of periodicals, many more than I can remember.  Here are a few: in my pathetic
teens, Mad Magazine, of which I was a serious enthusiast (and had been so since
Mad's Harvey Kurtzman comic book days). Closest I ever came to anarchy. Also,
Sport Magazine -- a precursor of SI.  Pre-steriods, pre-scandal, the athletes
profiled were virtuous, sober, and generous family men who had overcome venomous
small town upbringings and acute physical handicaps to rise to the top of the
mound or sit astride the Derby winner. Also, when I went though my adolescent
fantasy phase, various pulp sci fi mags -- Astounding Science Fiction and Galaxy
Science Fiction and probably others that came and went. I was much enamored
of the stuff, which was monumentally escapist and therefore analogous to my
sports obsessions. In the '60s, I matured to political magazines: The Reporter,
The Nation, and before it went totally and bizarrely wrong, The New Republic.
A decade later, when I had set out to study literature through a social lens,
I subscribed to Local Population Studies, The Journal of Interdisciplinary
History, The Psychohistorical Review, and The History of Childhood Quarterly.
When I became serious about Shakespeare I was an assiduous reader and collector
of the Shakespeare Quarterly and Shakespeare Survey and the Shakespeare
Newsletter and Shakespeare Research and Opportunities and the Shakespeare on
Film Newsletter. Closely related: English Literary Renaissance,  to which I
sent a number of my own contributions, and the George Herbert Journal (of which
I at one time owned every issue). In the '70s or '80s, Organic Gardening (sample
title -- "How We Grew Papayas on our Vermont Hillside Using Organic Methods
and Faith in God"); later, Fine Gardening (sample title: "How We Converted a
Defunct Brick Brewery into an Extremely Expensive Bed-and-Breakfast Complete
with a Replica of an 18th-century Capability Brown Landscape").  At then at
various times: Scientific American, Science News, Bluebirds Across Vermont, the
newsletter of the Southern Vermont Dairy Goat Association, One Two Three Four (a
magazine briefly in existence that concerned itself with the early history of
rock and roll), the Atlantic, The Skeptical Inquirer. Newspapers:  The New York
Times, Valley News, United Opinion (since renamed  the Journal-Opinion), Behind
the Times, the B--ld-r Daily Camera. Nowadays: Harvard Magazine, New Yorker, New
York Review of Books, Northern Forests. A long list, but note: no movie star
mags, no style, no self-improvement, no golf, no detectives, no alternative
healing, no finance, no how-to-pyramid-your-money, no automotive, no weapons. It
appears that I'm a person of narrow but eclectic interests, magazine-wise.

Title: My New Mirror
Date: March 22, 2010

There's been some criticism -- justified, I must admit -- about the dexterity
of my shaving. It appears that my face has become more, what shall I say?
intricate over the last years, and has developed some interesting crannies that
resist the approach of the razor. In order to improve my shaving technique, I
bought one of those circular magnifying mirrors that allows you to view your
face in such great detail that you can hunt down and harvest that last otherwise
inaccessible follicle. The mirror seemed like a good idea, but, dear friends
of a certain age, I do not recommend this purchase. Big mistake.

It had been many years since I studied my face so intently. Things have
happened. While I can still locate the remnants of the scar on my forehead,
where, when I was a boy, I was pushed into a subway pillar, the mark used to
reside just at the hairline. Now, the hairline has migrated a good three
inches to the north of the scar and -- thanks to the new mirror -- I can
clearly detect that the first remaining inch or so of brown-gray hair, which
I had thought to be of a healthy bushiness, consists of no more than a few
well-spaced strands. And what's this cross-hatching on my forehead? Not just
the prominent horizontal furrows but new vertical ones as well -- when did they
appear? And the deep gorges around my eyebrows! And the eyebrows themselves --
when did they become parti-colored? Randomly black and white? And how many
years ago did these long recurved eyebrow hairs begin to sprout? Fie upon it
--'tis an unweeded garden that's gone to seed. Why are the eyebrows themselves
so utterly asymmetrical? and what should I make of the thicket of whiteheads
-- or whatever the heck they are -- at all four corners of my bloodshot eyes? 
Was it always the case that my eyes were set so deeply into those wrinkled
dells? And my nose-- thanks to the new mirror, I can plainly see the scars
where the pre- cancerous lesions were frozen off. What in the world has
happened to the tip of my nose?  Was it always so preternaturally pointy? I
could use it as a letter- opener. When I lift my head just slightly, I see
that my nostrils, which I always took to be a matched pair, have set out on
separate paths. The right one now sits at a 45 degree angle to the left. It's
wandered off-center, like the eye of a flounder. And those nasty black hairs
jutting from my nostrils -- I must attend to them. And look, there are long
hairs coming out of my ears as well. And hanging, floppy earlobes marked with
deep lines. What are these fleshy nobs at the sides of my mouth? Were my lips
always covered with white flakes?  How is it that the left side of my underlip
is so much thicker than the right? And my pearly whites? Cracked and chipped
and not much of a row: sixty or so years of gnawing has given each tooth its
own unique size, shape, color, and identity. And what's this under my chin? A
single off-center hanging wattle? No symmetry even in Wattlelandia? Friends,
this magnifying mirror is a disaster. I should have stopped shaving entirely
and grown a camouflaging beard.

But hold on, there's some good news. It may not be a youthful or symmetrical
face, but It's not unfriendly. There's no sneer, or lip curl, or disdain, or
anger. Puzzlement, certainly. Wryness, perhaps. Curiosity, for sure.

Folks, at least we're not in a wicked-Dorian-Gray-kind-of-situation.

Wear and tear, yes; villainy, no. Things could be worse.

Title: Existence pre- and post-
Date: March 22, 2010

Last night, one of our dinner guests said that at least we no longer have to
worry about "pre-existing conditions." Persnickety about language as always, I
pointed out that the phrase "pre-existing condition" was a ridiculous piece of
jargon. What is meant is "existing conditions?" A condition can't exist before
it exists.

"Aha," said another of my guests, a Lutheran minister,"now you've opened a
theological questions." He was referring to the disputed doctrine that the
existence of Jesus preceded his incarnation in the womb.

But if "pre-existence" is only taken seriously by theologians and by insurance
executives, then I'm going to stand on my claim that the phrase is both
obscurantist or bureaucratic and should be discarded from common use. "Existing"
is sufficient.

Moreover, the notion that insurance should be granted to the healthy but
denied to the ill is a more dangerous travesty than the mystification of "pre-
existence."

Title: Grandpa Tells a Whopper;  Cornell Takes a Shellacking
Date: March 26, 2010

Last night, the grandkids had a little fun with the old guy. Miss T. (b. 1999),
concluded that Grandpa's electronic and computer skills were (her exact words)
"stone age."

Is she correct? Let us review the circumstances. I was here, in B--ld-r, trying
to watch the Cornell-Kentucky sweet-sixteen on streaming video (CBS again gave
the Big Red the back of its network-y hand) while simultaneously following the
Kansas State-Xavier double-overtime epic on Tivo (slightly behind real time so
as to sidestep the mini-dramas on the subjects of beer and deodorant). Miss T
and Mr. O were snuggled in bed with their mom out there near the Pacific shore
and we and they were sending messages back and forth on Facebook chat. Hey, not
exactly a "stone age" situation.

The kiddies were testing my knowledge of IM acronyms, and I was failing badly.
I didn't know ROTFL or JK or TMI or LMAO. Then Mr. O became dissatisfied at
the pace of the conversation, so he started sending me messages ("texting" me
is the jargon) on the cellphone, thereby giving me another device to manage.
Which is when I ran out of hands, and in frustration, told what HF (according to
SLC), also known as MT) calls a "stretcher." I said (or wrote, rather) to Miss
T. and Mr. O., something to the effect of "what do you mean I don't know about
electronic media. I used to IM all the time with my grandparents."

Frankly, they didn't buy it. I can't blame them; they know that my grandparents
didn't have much English.

Meanwhile, the Ivy League fell further and further behind, mostly because
Kentucky was quick enough to step around the screens and stop Cornell's three-
point game. In the other bracket, Kansas State lasted it out.

I know that it's negligent not to enlighten myself about useful chat acronyms.
Nevertheless, I suspect that the o-so-up-to-date grandkids at the other end of
the IM line are also missing something. They probably think that a "whopper" is
a hamburger. They probably don't know what a "shellacking" is. Or shellac, for
that matter. Probably think that it's something that originated in the Stone
Age.

Title: Pretty Poison (1960);  Tuesday Weld (1943-     )
Date: March 27, 2010

Pretty Poison was released in 1960 to excellent notices. I remember adding it to
the must-see list. But I didn't get around to it at the time, probably because
the film wasn't widely distributed. But Pretty Poison stuck in my mind -- or
rather it was the combination of Anthony Perkins and Tuesday Weld that excited
my interest. During the VHS years I made another attempt to see the movie,
but it was apparently stuck in some sort of royalty-and-ownership dispute
and never made it onto tape. And then another twenty years elapsed and I tried
again, this time typing the name into my Netflix queue, and, mirabile dictu,
there it was.  So at last, after fifty years, a cd of Pretty Poison appeared
in the mailbox.

It's a fine film, well worth the wait. I don't know what I would have
thought about it in 1960, but in 2010 it seems like a late variant of
1950s film noir and an important but unacknowledged way station on the road
from Double Indemnity to Body Heat. It offers a dangerous jeune fille fatale
in the high school cheerleader Mary Ann Stepanek, some great plot twists, and a
creepy young man who's not as clever as he thinks (very similar to his lineal
descendant, the fatuous lawyer Ned Racine). The photography, all sunlit and
cheerful, disguises the noirish themes and keeps the audience off balance. The
screenwriter, Lorenzo Semple Jr., was, if I remember correctly, just emerging
from the McCarthy blacklist, which may be why the film stresses cold-war themes
-- spies and sabotage and the like. Can it be accidental that, in the last year
of the Eisenhower administration, a well-meaning but ineffective government
employee as given the name Azenauer?

At the very time Tuesday Weld, scion of an ancient Massachusetts family
performed in this film, I was taking courses in Cambridge, in Weld Hall. How
could anyone not be struck by her great name? Tuesday Weld is linked, in my
mind, not only to the Saltonstalls, Peabodys, and Lodges but also to Billy
Sunday, Rick Monday, Joe Friday, January Jones, Fredric March, May West, June
Jones, August Busch, Susan Sontag, Domenico Scarlatti and Jeudi Garland.

Title: Bronte Notes
Date: March 29, 2010

I have just read, for the first time ever, Agnes Grey (1847) by Anne Bronte,
and what an infinitely sad book it is! Poor Agnes, an impoverished clergyman's
daughter, goes as a governess and is daily humiliated by monstrously spoiled
children and their grotesquely insensitive parents. Her sufferings are
poignantly particularized. The novel is structured as if it were a comedy
(after extended tribulations, Agnes marries a decent young curate) but it is
nevertheless barren, desiccated, and joyless. Even the long-awaited marriage
proposal receives the shortest of shrifts:

"And so now I have overruled your objections. Have you any others. "No --
none."  "You love me then," he said, fervently pressing my hand.  "Yes."

And that's all the romance that this poor downtrodden, passive, beaten-into-the-
dust emotionally-stunted "heroine" is granted.

Nevertheless, my own personal sadness while reading this novel arose not
from Agnes Grey's suffering, but from Anne Bronte's -- there being not a
skin-of-the- teeth space between the bedraggled writer and the bedraggled
protagonist. Agnes's experiences as a governess exactly mirror Anne's --
except there was no saving curate to snatch the wedding chestnuts out of
the fire. Poor Anne returned home defeated, virginal, and alone, to die
at age 28, of tuberculosis. Nor is it simply the doormat heroine or the
downtrodden novelist that is so distressing -- it's the general oppression of
women in the first part of the nineteenth century that must draw a tear from the
stolidest of eyes. Here's a society that offered no decent options for women,
and even Anne Bronte, as talented as she was, hadn't the least ability to
think her way through attitudes toward women that proved to be paralyzing and
ultimately fatal.

I turned to Agnes Grey because I had recently read Anne's older sister
Charlotte's Villette, a novel that perplexed me more than any book I've read in
years. I couldn't make sense of it. I've read my share of nineteenth-century
novels, and I would like to think that I have a general sense of how they're
made, and, after I get a few chapters in, how they must conclude. In Villete,
all the early markers point to the eventuality that young Lucy Snowe, after the
customary and appropriate difficulties and misunderstandings will have been
resolved, will marry the handsome young Dr. John. But somewhere in Book II,
the game changed and the poor reader (me) became confused. Dr. John is allowed
to make some bad choices -- sufficiently wrong that he becomes superfluous and
gradually fades into the background. He metamorphoses from a major character
in the first half of the book to a minor character in Book III. His place as
Lucy Snowe's suitor is taken by a teacher, M. Paul Emanuel, who is nasty and
unattractive when introduced but who becomes more and more acceptable as the
novel proceeds. I couldn't comprehend the seismic shift until I read the truly
excellent biography of CB by Lyndall Gordon (Charlotte Bronte, A Passionate
Life (1994). It turns out the plot of the novel parallels CB's experience
in Brussels. Initially attracted to a young man who lost interest in her,
she fell deeply in love with a teacher at her school. Alas, M. Heger was not
available, either matrimonially or emotionally.

But at least Charlotte, unlike Anne, was willing to take a risk -- which is why,
in Charlotte's greatest novel, witty, forthright, independent Jane Eyre, for
all her weirdness, remains such a striking and refreshing alternative to the
ordinary oppressed nineteenth-century heroine.

Title: Lascivious Wassails
Date: April 06, 2010

In Anthony and Cleopatra, Caesar, who is disciplined and ascetic, both
envies and scorns Anthony. In one of the play's greatest moments, Caesar
apostrophizes his hedonistic, indulgent rival. "Anthony," he begins, "Leave
thy lascivious wassails." "Lascivious wassails" is a most marvelous phrase --
not only because of its serpentine hissing, but because it is so colorful. In
another context, the word "wassails" might signify conviviality, but in this
case it is so contaminated by the wickedness of "lascivious" that it can
only be taken to signify bouts of drunken excess. "Lascivious wassails"
is glancingly oxymoronic and consequently embodies Caesar's confused and
contradictory feelings toward Anthony.

It's an especially pertinent phrase because the speech that follows
celebrates those qualities of Anthony which Caesar most admires (and which he
simultaneously finds most threatening) -- his Spartan, soldierly ability to
put aside luxurious food and drink and to subsist on "the bark of trees," and,
if necessary, to drink from "the gilded puddle that beasts would cough at."

"Lascivious wassails" is brilliant in its freestanding self and without doubt
entirely appropriate to its context. It's one of Shakespeare's all-time-great
encapsulations -- a condensed and beautiful phrase.

Except that it's not Shakespeare's. Or, more precisely, it is probably not
Shakespeare.

The Folio text of Anthony and Cleopatra seems to have been set from a transcript
of Shakespeare's manuscript. It's the only early printing (there are no
Quartos). In the Folio, the line appears this way: "Anthony,/ Leaue thy
lasciuious Vassailes." "Vassailes" was, for the first hundred years of its
existence, understood to mean "vassals." Caesar, it appears, wants Anthony to
take leave of not his cups but his followers. In the fourth Folio of 1683, the
irregular spelling "vassailes" was regularized to "vassals." "Wassails" did not
arrive on the scene until 1724 and was the ingenious, inspired invention of
Alexander Pope. Every single editor since Pope, no doubt taken with the beauty
of the phrase, has printed "wassails."

It's not as though "vassals" doesn't make sense. It's perfectly fine. It's
just the "wassails" is better. In this instance, let's face it, Pope outdid
Shakespeare. If not for Pope, it is highly likely that it would have been
"lascivious vassals" until the end of time. Who beside a great poet would have
thought of "wassails?" Certainly not I.

Editors aim for authenticity -- to print what they believe Shakespeare wrote.
Shakespeare probably wrote "vassals" -- but "wassails" is so clever that editors
cannot help but succumb. They follow the illogic that if it's brilliant, it must
be Shakespeare. And so authenticity gladly yields to beauty.

The most famous, I think, must be Itzhak Perlman, who is the earth's most
versatile and distinguished violinist -- and is also father of five next-
generation members of the musical tribe. Almost as widely known but perhaps not
so spectacularly talented, is Rhea Perlman, better known as Carla Tortelli,
mother to many. The most brilliant of the clan, and certainly the most
eccentric, is Grigori Yakovlevich ("Grisha") Perelman, the mathematician who
solved Poincare's conjecture and then refused both the Fields Medal (the
Nobel Prize of mathematics) and the $1 million Clay Millennium Prize. Grisha
demonstrated what most of us simply take for granted: that any closed three-
dimensional manifold where any loop can be contracted to a point is really just
a three-dimensional sphere. There's also Ron Perelman, a consummate and ruthless
corporate raider, once the richest man in America, now, alas,  fallen to 18th
-- nor any longer contracted to nonce-wife #4, Ellen Barkin. The most amusing
of all Pearlmans is surely Brooklynite S. J. Perelman, screenwriter of two
great Marx Brothers vehicles -- Horse Feathers and Monkey Business. The most
reprehensible of the cousinhood is certainly Lou Pearlman, accomplished Ponzi-
artist and the mogul behind the bubble-gummy Backstreet Boys, whom he used and
possibly sexually abused to the tune of $300 million -- and who is now serving
a 25-year term in federal prison. Infinitely more respectable is the composer
and conductor Martin Pearlman, who learned his trade at Cornell and who is a
harpsichordist as well as the founder of the Boston Baroque. Nor should any
Pearlman census overlook Ron Perlman, aka Amoukar the Ulam, who many years ago
quested for fire. Nor sportwriter Jeff Pearlman, pitcher Jon Perlman, writer
Edith Pearlman, film critic Cindy Pearlman; nor the great rhetorician of a prior
generation, Chaim Pearlman.

And also: standing at the top of the heap in the world of fiction is The

It's a patache, and George Sand (in The Miller of Angibault [1852]) offers a
detailed account. The patache, it would appear, was a blast from the past even
in the early nineteenth century.

"Madame de Blanchemont left in a simple patache, that respectable relic of
our forefathers' plain tastes, becoming rarer with each passing day. The one
which it was Marcelle's unhappy fate to encounter was of the purest native
construction and an antiquarian would have contemplated it with respect. It was
as long and low as a coffin; no springs of any sort diminished its charms. The
wheels were as tall as the cowl. The cowl itself was made of a sort of wattle
and daub, so that every little bump rained clods of clay down on the travelers'
heads. A thin but ardent little stallion drew this rural carriage quite nimbly,
and the patachon, the driver, seated himself on the car-shaft with his legs
dangling down."

The patache, which seems to be a country cousin of the "springless kibitka"
combined with elements of the basket-carriage, may now be added to the long list
of obsolete horsedrawn carriages.

Title: Strange Flesh
Date: April 13, 2010

Plutarch makes much of Antonius' "hardness in adversity notwithstanding his
fine bringing up." Shakespeare knew these words very well; in fact, his copy of
Plutarch was open to this exact sentence when he mended his quill and began to
compose the famous speech in Anthony and Cleopatra that begins "Anthony, leave
thy lascivious wassails."

Here are Plutarch's words (exactly as they came to Shakespeare through Sir
Thomas North's translation). The passage that particularly stimulated the
playwright appears (thanks to the magic of word processing), in a font of vivid
blue.

"Hirtius and Pansa, then consuls [were sent by Octavius Caesar] to drive
Antonius out of Italy. These two consuls... besieged the city of Modena, and
there overthrew him in battle, but both the consuls were slain there. Antonius,
flying upon this overthrow, fell into great misery all at once, but the chiefest
want of all other, and that pinched him most, was famine. Howbeit, he was of
such a strong nature that by patience he would overcome any adversity, and
the heavier fortune lay upon him, the more constant showed he himself.... And
therefore it was a wonderful example to the soldiers, to see Antonius, that was
brought up in all fineness and superfluity, so easily to drink puddle water, and
eat wild fruits and roots; and moreover it is reported that even as they passed
the Alps, they did eat the bark of trees, and such beasts as man never tasted of
their flesh before.

Shakespeare kept the sense of the passage but put Plutarch's words into the
mouth of Octavius Caesar, who despises, envies, but also fears Anthony,
his absent rival.

Anthony,

Leave thy lascivious wassails.  When thou once

Was beaten from Modena, where thou slew'st

Hirtius and Pansa, consuls, at thy heel

Did famine follow, who thou fought'st against,

(Though daintily brought up) with patience more

Than savages could suffer.  Thou did'st drink

The stale of horses, and the gilded puddle

Which beasts would cough at.  Thy palate then did deign

The roughest berry on the rudest hedge.

Yea, like the stag, when snow the pasture sheets,

The barks of trees thou browsed.  On the Alps,

It is reported thou did'st eat strange flesh,

Which some did die to look on.  And all this

(It wounds thine honor that I speak it now)

Was born so like a soldier, that thy cheek

So much as lanked not.

Plutarch is shocked that high-born Antonius could bring himself to eat "wild
fruits," but Shakespeare, ever willing to push an idea to the limit, makes
Anthony's diet even more crude. "Thy palate then did deign [i.e. find worthy]/
The roughest berry on the rudest hedge" -- that is to say, Anthony eats not
just "wild fruit," but the less palatable "roughest berry." In an even harsher
transformation, Plutarch's "puddle water" becomes "the stale (i.e. urine)
of horses, and the gilded puddle/ Which beasts would cough at."  It may be
stoic to drink "puddle water," but it is a far greater challenge to a dainty
constitution to survive on horse piss. As the passage continues, Anthony's diet
becomes progressively more exotic. Plutarch says that Antonius consumed "beasts
as man never tasted of their flesh before," and seems to imagine Antonius as an
adventurer at the utmost boundary of culinary experience. But when Shakespeare
suggests that Anthony ate "strange flesh/ Which some did die to look upon,"
Anthony becomes not just a soldier/explorer coping with natural adversity but
a demi-god or some other kind of supernatural figure able to triumph over
enchantment or magic -- one who can incorporate fleshly food that would kill at
a glance men with natures less powerful than his own.

Shakespeare characteristically intensifies, exaggerates, or hyperbolizes
Plutarch's already extravagant tale. He raises the rhetorical ante. Whatever
Plutarch proffers, Shakespeare doubles and redoubles.

The animal theme that runs through this series of transformations begins with
the evolution of Plutarch's phrase "by patience he would overcome any adversity"
into Shakespeare's "patience more than savages could suffer." More patience than
savages?  What would that be? Shakespeare provides an answer to an implicit,
unspoken question, which is, What is a more, or worse, or a lower being than
a savage? The answer seems to be "an animal" -- and consequently Shakespeare
employs images of bestiality throughout this speech: the horses whose stale must
be guzzled, the beasts who cough at the gilded puddle, the stag who browses
the bark of trees under sheets of snow, and, climatically, the strange magical
flesh that some -- but not Anthony -- die to look upon. In a characteristically
Shakespearean paradox, as the passage proceeds Anthony becomes both more animal
and more heroic -- at the same time both baser and yet more transcendent.

And what is that strange and magic Alpine flesh?  It's impossible to say, and
Shakespeare offers no clue. Perhaps it's mere hyperbole -- an author carried
away by his own rhetorical power. Does Anthony violate the ultimate food taboo
and become a cannibal?  Some readers have thought so, but the evidence is
lacking.

There is, however, a hint that Octavius himself thinks that the strange flesh
episode is nothing more than a tall tale. "On the  Alps, it is reported.... "

Title: "Cat Got Your Tongue"
Date: April 14, 2010

So it was 1946 and I was in first grade in P. S. 217 and I must have been
throwing my massive seven-year-old weight around because one of the "class
mothers" took me aside and accused me of quote picking on unquote her dear son
Michael who was at least six inches taller than poor poor pitiful skinny me. I
remember that I was astonished and taken aback but that I was still in my own
head poised enough to think, what a jerk Michael must be to tell on me to his
mother -- although frankly I don't know now and didn't know then what I could
have done to earn her enmity or deserve the reproach. I was innocent! What I
remember most clearly is that I was rendered quite speechless when Michael's
mommy asked an explanation or apology from me and especially that she two
or several times demanded of me, scornfully, "what's the matter, cat's got
your tongue? Cat's got your tongue?" I had never heard that expression before
and didn't know what it meant, but it sure added a deal of mystery to the
confrontation. My tongue was still in my mouth and not in the possession of some
feline and I was neither clever enough nor bold enough to stick it out at her.

What does it mean, "Cat's got your tongue." It's still a mystery to me even
today. Interestingly enough, the expression isn't of ancient origin and
apparently dropped to earth only in the late nineteenth century. It's a puzzle,
though. Why a cat?  But then, why "cat's pajamas?" Why "cat o' nine tails?" Why
"cat's meow?"

In any case, I was nonplussed that Michael's mommy spoke to me so obscurely and
Iwas indignant to be accused of misbehavior. In fact, sixty plus years later 'm
Istill indignant.

Is it possible that the cat-and-tongue episode stimulated my interest in
language?

I really don't know why this antique event swam out of the dark backward and
abysm of the past. Just yesterday, when I mentioned it to Mrs Dr. Metablog, she
recalled that one day, also in 1946, when she was in elementary school and she
was not sitting as still as we were then expected to sit, she was accused of
having "ants in her pants."  She's indignant.

Except for its title, which misses the mark, Edith Wharton's "Roman Fever" is an
exquisite and near-perfect short story. I'm not sure if I would love it quite
so much if I hadn't recently indulged myself with an Edithathon of 25 or 30
long novels, of which "Roman Fever" is a quintessence or distillation. Packed
into a few pages is all you would ever need to know about formal, repressed,
rule-bound upper-class New York society in which no-holds-barred competitiveness
is masked by lifted-pinky manners. The story is so cleverly designed that the
last satisfying sentence more than fulfills a reader's wickedest expectations.

Mrs.  Ansley and Mrs. Slade, both well-tended New York widows who've pretended
to like each other for a lifetime, chat on a Roman balcony. Each is expert at at
one-upmanship. Their apparent friendship masks hatreds and sexual jealousies as
obvious (once the curtain is lifted) and as brutal as those of lions living in
the less habitable portions of the Kalahari desert.

I know of no work of fiction that is at once so polite and so ferocious. And so
chilling.

Title: Earthquakes - Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc -  King Lear
Date: April 23, 2010

We all remember, and we're all still shocked and amazed that the late,
unlamentable Jerry Falwell proclaimed that the 9/11 attacks on the US were
caused by "the pagans, and the abortionists, and the feminists, and the gays,
and the lesbians." How to understand either the logic or the brain of such a
thinker? We moderns tend to reason in terms of cause and effect, and cause
and effect just doesn't cut it with Falwell. Was he thinking something like,
feminists cause sin (a debatable proposition) and Al-Qaeda wants to cleanse
us, so they run the airplanes into the towers. That would be unbelievable
nonsense, even for Falwell. Here's another attempt to divine his mind:
feminists are dangerous and evil and therefore the good old US of A has become
Sodom/Gomorrah/Ephesus and the Big Guy in the Sky is offended and therefore he
engaged Al-Qaeda to punish the US for its sins by enabling or permitting those
young Saudi jerks to fly planes into the towers in order to persuade us to
repudiate the feminists. Does that make sense? Very little.

Similarly, Pat Robertson deduced that Hurricane Katrina was all about abortion.
In this case, the Ancient of Days didn't even bother to enlist human agents.
Noticing that there were abortions being performed in the US, he let loose the
winds from the caves in which he had confined them and instructed them to bust
up the New Orleans dikes and drown a lot of people.

Jerry and Pat are a pair of idiots, not only because they lack intelligence, but
also because their view of the world is five hundred or a thousand years behind
the times. They'd be mainstream in dark/medieval Europe when Attila the Hun and
Timur (or Tamburlaine) the Great competed for the title of Scourge of God --
the flagellum dei. They pillaged and burned and raped over vast areas of the
world not because they were  imperialists and conquerors but because they were
instruments of god. They wreaked vengeance on our sins. It was orthodoxy. Cause
and effect? Sorry, not part of the picture.

The fallacy post hoc ergo propter hoc  -- "after this therefore because of
this"  -- means that just because B comes after A doesn't mean that A causes
B. Just because an abortion is followed by a hurricane doesn't mean that the
abortion caused the hurricane. Just because someone prays to one or another god
and recovers from illness doesn't mean that the prayer caused the cure. The
volcano isn't quiescent because we sacrificed the maiden. No religion, not a
single one, can bear the light of post hoc. Fully honored, it puts them all out
of business. Along with all the other varieties of magical thinking.

All this hardly bears mentioning except that a couple of days ago, a 'senior
Iranian cleric" Hojatoleslam Kazem Sedighi, pronounced that very soon a massive
earthquake will devastate the city of Teheran and that the earthquake will
be caused by "women who do not dress modestly. [Such women] lead young men
astray, corrupt their chastity and spread adultery in society, which increases
earthquakes." There's a chain of logic for you. A guy catches a glimpse of a
lock of hair, or, god forbid, a bit of bosom, and boom -- earthquake.  But
it's not his fault -- it's that his natural chastity has been compromised by
them there female blandishments. Delilah all over again. Forget the movement of
tectonic plates. The energy released in earthquakes isn't caused by subduction.
It's ankles.The senior Iranian cleric has not correctly grasped the meaning of
the demotic phrase, "the earth moved."

Sedighi is a boob and is even more presumptuous and illogical than Pat and
Jerry. The earthquake hasn't even occurred and he's already blaming it on the
outfits. He's launched a pre-emptive strike on post hoc. His is a fallacy so
monumentally illogical that hasn't yet earned a name.

It's instructive that Shakespeare, writing before the age of reason and before
the scientific revolution, offered a full debate on the subject. In King Lear,
Gloucester takes the traditional view. Eclipses, like hurricanes, are filled
with meaning. Gloucester does not hold with reason or with the logic that he
calls "the wisdom of nature."

"These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no good to us: though the
wisdom of nature can reason it thus and thus, yet nature finds itself scourged
by the sequent effects: love cools, friendship falls off, brothers divide.
In cities, mutinies; in countries, discord; in palaces, treason, and the
bond cracked 'twixt son and father... We have seen the best of our time: 
machinations, hollowness, treachery and all ruinous disorders, follow us
disquietly to our graves."

Gloucester's bastard son Edmund dismisses tradition and argues scientifically
and rationally.

"This is the excellent foppery of the world, that, when we are sick in fortune
-- often the surfeit of our own behavior -- we make guilty of our disasters the
sun, the moon, and the stars: as if we were villains by necessity, fools by
heavenly compulsion; knaves, thieves, and treachers, by spherical predominance,
drunkards, liars, and adulterers, by an enforced obedience of planetary
influence, and all that we are evil in, by a divine thrusting on. An admirable
evasion of whoremaster man, to lay his goatish disposition to the charge of
a star. My father compounded with my mother under the dragon's tail, and my
nativity was under Ursa Major; so that it follows, I am rough and lecherous.
Tut, I should have been that I am, had the maidenliest star in the firmament
twinkled on my bastardizing."

Gloucester is, in our terms, superstitious and simple, but he's also orthodox
and reverent. Edmund is realistic and rational, but he is also as loathsome a
villain as Shakespeare ever created. Shakespeare is a late medieval writer,
which is why he should not necessarily be looked to for moral advice but rather
for great poetry, great stories, and aesthetic bliss.

Meanwhile, the "excellent foppery of the world" has become the province of
fundamentalists of all stripes.

Title: All-Awkward
Date: April 28, 2010

While I admire the highly skilled, I am also much attracted to the guys who do a
lot with less. It's good to throw 100 mph, but my hat goes off to the pitchers
who succeed with little more than desire and guile.

I don't mean just baseball. I've been watching the NBA playoffs and I'm now
prepared to name my All NBA Overachievers, guys, who, metaphorically, can throw
65 on a good day.

Center: Joakim Noah. The most awkward center in the league and one of the most
effective. It's terrifying to watch him try to dribble the ball downcourt. His
outside shot is, to say the least, unorthodox. But he works hard on every play
and when he's knocked down, as is frequently the case, he bounces up like some
mythological figure who draws strength from the earth. Plus there's not another
center in the league who's fluent in French and Swedish.

Forward. Paul Pierce. Can't run, can't jump, but is a perennial all-star and
the go-to guy at the end of a close game. I've seen him play hundreds of games
(since he was at Kansas, in fact), and I've never seen him "fill the lane." He
can't get there in time. Great shooter, though, even if you can't figure out how
he does it, year after year.

Forward.  Shawn Marion. He must have the ugliest shot in NBA history. He seems
to hold it out in front of him and push it off with a stiff arm. And yet it goes
in. He couldn't have gone to basketball camp as a youngster. He does everything
"wrong" and yet he's tremendously effective. And he's an outstanding defensive
player.

Guard:  Andre Miller. He's slow, he can't jump, he has no muscles in his arms,
and he can't shoot 3-pointers. But he's intelligent, makes the right decisions,
and throws the best alley-oop pass in the league. He's a marvelous player, way
undervalued.

Guard.  Omigosh, I can't think of another active all-overachiever guard,
so I'm going to go with Mark Jackson, now retired, who's the archetype. Not
particularly athletic, not big, not quick, not a leaper by any means, and yet
third on the all-time assist list. Smart though -- a Brooklyn boy.

Title: Boustrophedon, Rongorongo, and the Phaistos Disc
Date: May 03, 2010

In a previous post, I expressed fascination that writing could go in any
possible direction. I began with Swift, who satirized both "women" and the
English when he described the fanciful Lilliputian script: "their manner of
Writing is very peculiar, being neither from the Left to the Right, like the
Europeans; nor from the Right to the Left, like the Arabians; nor from up to
down, like the Chinese; nor from down to up, like the Cascagians; but aslant
from one Corner of the Paper to the other, like Ladies in England."

To Swift's curious catalog (the Cascagians are of course his own invention), I
added boustrophedon, a system that Swift did not know but one that would surely
have delighted him.

In boustrophedon (a lovely Greekish word that signifies "turn like an ox
plowing"), alternate lines move in opposite directions. Lines one, three, five
and seven and so on proceed from left to right; lines two, four, six, and
eight from right to left. Ancient languages such as Safaitic were written in
boustrophedon; some Etruscan inscriptions, still undeciphered, seem to follow
the same pattern.

Boustrophedon is not unreasonable, but it's certainly awkward for those of us
who have made a fetish of left to right. Here's how Shakespeare transforms
boustrophedonically. The passage takes a bit of effort to read but it's
certainly intelligible.

It is the cause, it is the cause, my soul,—

!srats etsahc uoy, uoy ot ti eman ton em teL

It is the cause. Yet I'll not shed her blood;

,wons naht sreh fo niks retihw taht racs roN

And smooth as monumental alabaster.

.nem erom yarteb ll'ehs esle, eid tsum ehs teY.

Right, left, up, down, aslant, and back and forth might seem to have exhausted
the possible formats. But such is not the case. Rongorongo, the language
of Easter Island, is written in still another style, that of "reverse
boustrophedon." In Lost Languages (2002), Andrew Robinson describes how this
most peculiar system works.

"To read a Rongorongo tablet, one started at the bottom left-hand corner and
read along line 1 to the right-hand corner. Then one turned the tablet through
180 degrees and began reading line 2 from left to right again,  At the end of
line 2, one repeated the 180-degree turn so that the tablet was in the same
orientation as at the beginning, and read line 3 from left to right and so
on....  Every even-number line is written back-to-front and upside-down in
relation to an ordinary English text."

I don't believe that even Jonathan Swift could have invented a manner of
composition so counter-intuitive, so odd.  But then, those Easter Islanders
(or, more properly, Rapanui) danced to a drummer who is uniquely their own. I
don't believe that there's a second reverse boustrophedonesque culture anywhere
on the planet.

Is that all? Are there no other possibilities? Yes indeed, there's also the
phaistos disc, which (according to Andrew Robinson once again), "was discovered
in 1908 by Luigi Pernier in the ruins of a palace at Phaistos in southern Crete.
The archeological context suggests that the date of the disc is 1850-1600 BC.
The disc is 6.5 inches in diameter and .75 inches thick and is made of fine
clay. On both sides is an inscription which consists of characters impressed on
the wet clay with a punch or stamp before it was fired. They are arranged in a
spiral around the center of each side."

The writing begins at the outermost circle and works its roundabout way towards
the center, which means either that the scribe knew exactly how many letters (or
ideographs, or syllables) he intended to use, or that he started at the center
and wrote backwards until he reached the circumference of the disc. Neither
method is particularly convenient or flexible, so it's not surprising that
spiral writing never caught on. It certainly wouldn't do for people like me who
revise heavily.

The phaistos disc cannot be translated.

Novacaine was discovered sometime around the turn of the last century, but it
hadn't reached the backward interior of Brooklyn during my childhood. As a
result, I endured hours of drilling and filling without anaesthetics. It was
horrible.

The local dentist was named Dr. Caress. It would have been more appropriate if
he had been called Dr. Butcher.

There were no high-speed drills. Dr. Caress used a mechanical drill -- a motor
attached to a system of small pulleys, if I remember correctly, at the business
end of which was some sort of bur. It was slow and awkward and It took forever
to drill out a cavity. There was lots of starting and stopping and moaning and
readjusting and rinsing and spitting. I can still remember the pain. It was not
a "discomfort" kind of pain. It was a torture kind of pain.

All this in the office of Dr. Caress.  I can't even imagine what it was like
across Ocean Parkway where the local dentist was named Dr. Yankowitz.

Title: Ditch the Didge!!
Date: May 09, 2010

The downtown mall is home to a motley assemblage of street buskers. Some
are excellent and welcome performers: the occasional string quartet, the
accomplished visiting bluegrass band, a witty gaggle of a cappella singers.
Others are less excellent but still tolerable; the contortionist, the magician
with the rings that divide and rejoin, the sword-swallower, the zip-code
man, the fire-eater, the too-young violin student supervised by his mommy,
the juggler whose act hasn't changed since the days when he was known as a
joculator. And then a step lower still: that inaudible French girl who struggles
with her ukelele. Less welcome are the drummers: bang, bang, bang with no
discernible rhythm, just noise great enough to set off sympathetic vibrations in
your own personal pancreas. But the worst of the worst is the didgeridoo-master.
After decades of practice, all that the didge player can produce is an ugly
drone. One note. It goes on and on, relentlessly, and it's dull, grating and
loud. If you haven't heard it, imagine a big old bagpipe, playing one note
at the bottom of its range, for ever, and ever, and ever. Worse still are
didgeridoo assemblies: didgetets or didgeridoo chamber orchestras.

The didgeridoo comes to us from northern Australia, where it was invented
more that 1500 years ago. Perhaps it hasn't evolved because it's thought to
be sacred. While the rest of the world developed wind instruments that played
a variety of colorful notes, the non-innovative didge people embraced an
unchanging and exceedingly boring drone. They are patient people. One by one,
native Australians said no to the bassoon, the clarinet, the horn, the sax, the
flute, the piccolo, the trumpet, the tuba, the oboe bright and cheerful, and
decided that a branch of a eucalyptus tree, naturally hollowed by termites,
was all that they needed in the way of wind-instruments. In another fit of
imagination, they invented the bull-roarer, an instrument that hasn't yet taken
a bow on the mall, but trust me, it won't be long.

Let's face it;  the didgeridoo is an instrument that hasn't produced a pleasant
sound in many thousands of years. It has no plans to do so. Didgeridooists are
barking up the wrong tree -- it's never going to be music. It's always going to
be noise.

Which brings me to my point, which is that would-be mall performers should
not be permitted to busk until they have passed a performance test and have
been granted a license. The Board of Acceptability would consist of some of
the more traditionalist faculty of both the Music School and the Department of
Theater and Drama. The chairman would be an open-minded but engaged citizen,
such as Me.  Approval must be unanimous. We (the Board) would strictly enforce
standards of artistic excellence. Life would improve.

Title: Mrs. Peixada by "Sidney Luska" (1886)
Date: May 10, 2010

I've just read, and much enjoyed, a novel called Mrs. Peixada, by one Sidney
Luska. The novel was published in 1886 by Cassell & Company, Limited, at 739
Broadway, in New York City. I had it recalled it from the library's archives,
where, from all the evidence, it hadn't been touched for a hundred or so years.
Why did I read this book? Because a) I'm reading stuff from the last two
decades of the nineteenth century, and b) because the novel is listed in the
bibliography of the wonderful anthology Victorian Love Stories (1996) edited and
illuminated by Kate Flint -- an anthology which persuaded me that although I
think of myself as moderately well read in Victorian fiction, there are untold
riches out there of which I am embarrassed to be unaware.

Mrs. Peixada isn't exactly a shower of gold, but it's a revelation. The author
"Sidney Luska" turns out to be a pseudonym for Henry Harland, who is better
known for his second career as an editor of the Yellow Book. I guess that
Mrs. Peixada falls into the broad category, novel of sensation, but it's also
a mystery story laced with occasional touches of social comedy and progressive
social thought.

The plot could be next year's blockbuster movie. Arthur Ripley woos and falls in
love with the mysterious young widow, Ruth Lehmyl, who has recently moved into
an apartment in his Beekman Place neighborhood. We're treated to the details
their sophisticated and modern courtship  -- music, museums, poetry. At the
same time, Ripley, a lawyer, has been engaged to track down a murderess named
Mrs. Peixada, who fled New York after being acquitted on grounds of insanity of
murdering her husband. Ripley tracks her from Vienna to Rome and to London, but
then loses her trail. He marries Mrs. Lehmyl --  only to discover that she and
Mrs. Peixada are one and the same person.

Although there are holes in the plot through which a daumont or shandrydan could
be driven with room to spare, the novel is engaging and intriguing. But then I'm
an easy mark.

Perhaps our screen writers aught to do some looking at the lower tier of
Victorian novels  -- especially if (as it seems) they're interested in making
lower-tier movies.

But for me -- it's time to learn more about Henry Harland.

Title: Crackanthorpe's Wreckage
Date: May 11, 2010

The Crackanthorpe name is not as well known as it should be. The short stories
in Wreckage (1893) are a good sharp antidote to the pieties and sentimentalities
of Victorian fiction.

There must be hundreds of novels which feature a virtuous, long-suffering
heroine, who, however mistreated, turns cheek after cheek until her patience is
rewarded with a beau and an unexpected inheritance. Think Jane Eyre.

Here is Hubert Crackanthorpe's version of this archetype:

"A blind desire to silence [Aunt Lisbet], to stamp the life out of her, swept
over Lilly. Seizing the parasol, which lay on the kitchen table, with all her
strength she Aunt Lisbet across the side of her head.

And over the thought of that blow she lingered, recalling it again and again,
repeating it in her mind with a strange, exquisite pleasure. For into it she had
put the hatred of years.

Aunt Lisbet uttered a low, plaintive moan -- the curious moan of sudden pain --
and fell, dragging with her on to the floor a pile of plates.

The crash sent every nerve in Lilly's body tingling, but when, a moment later,
Aunt Lisbet moved to get up, the blind, murderous desire returned. Another
brutal blow of the parasol, and she knocked her back again."

Hubert Crackanthorpe drowned (perhaps accidentally, perhaps taking his own life)
at age 26. His fiction is sometimes compared to that of de Maupassant, but I
prefer to think of him as the Dostoevsky that England never produced.

At the coffee shop, reading Crackanthorpe and drinking my horrid decaf tea, a
phrase from the conversation of the important-looking business guys at the next
table wafted my way. "We don't have to re-invent the wheel." Wow, I thought to
myself, does anyone still perpetrate that old cliche -- and do so without a
shred of irony or self-awareness?  I listened more closely to them and in less
than five minutes plucked the following flowers of wilted rhetoric:

"From the get-go" -- "chicken-and-egg problem" -- "here's the pressure point" --
"low-hanging fruit" -- "where the rubber meets the road" -- "that's the genie
coming out of the bottle" -- "it's fifty-fifty"  -- "here's my quick pitch."

All useful phrases, I suppose. Shorthand. But, nevertheless, kind of
embarrassingly banal.

If these guys sensed my disapproval, why, they'd probably laugh all the way to
the bank.

My advice to them, and to others similarly situated: when you use cliches, try
to think outside the box and turn it into a win-win situation. You don't have
to knock the ball out of the park, language-wise, but you don't need to throw
anyone under the bus either. It's all water under the bridge that we'll cross
when we get there. Can we agree to disagree?  When you look at this problem
from the 30,000 foot level, then, and only then, can you eat the elephant one
bite at a time. So, let's give it 110%. And, you know, if you fail to plan, you
plan to fail. Are we all on the same page?

Title: Still Another Directional Dyslexic Anxiety
Date: May 21, 2010

One of the awkwardnesses that we dysgeographicoids, or directional dyslexics
(or whatever you want to call us) have to come to grips with is -- being asked
for directions. You might just be walking down a street, more or less aware
of where you are, and a car pulls up next to you and a lady leans out of
the window and asks, how do you get to, let's say, the football stadium. I
don't know about you, but I immediately break into a sweat. Especially if
it's a place that I've been to a hundred times and ought to know like the
back of my hand. The best way to deal with the tension and anxiety generated
by such questions is to pretend complete ignorance: "I'm sorry, I'd like
to help you, but I'm a visitor here." Sure, it's an itsy-bitsy lie, but a
useful one, because the lady in the automobile is going to get much better
instructions from the next person she asks, who will probably be completely
normal, direction-wise.

I remember a particularly tragic instance of direction-giving-panic from my time
in England. I used to walk, once a week, from Charing Cross Station to the
British Museum. The streets were all a-tangle -- not a one of them parallel or
perpendicular. I carried a detailed map but nevertheless, week after week, I
managed to lose myself in the maze. I would have thought that I appeared to be
totally bewildered, but nevertheless, I was several times accosted by tourists
and asked the way to some monument or tube station. Of course I didn't have the
least clue.

Yesterday, walking to the library, a lady in an automobile asked me the
directions to Whole Foods. I  tried not to panic but I could feel the clammy
hand around my heart. "Which Whole Foods," I asked, stalling. "Nearest one."
Well, I've been there a hundred times, so I made an effort. Plus I knew it
was only two right turns. "A few blocks this way," I said, pointing, and then
turn right until 30th Street. Big shopping center on the left."  So the car
drove off and I spent the next ten minutes wondering whether I had given the
right directions. Is it after or before 30th Street? Is there an easier way?
Is the other Whole Foods closer than the one to which I sent her? What would a
directionally-gifted person have said?

But at least I hadn't sent her in the absolute wrong direction. I think.

Prokhorov wants to change the team's name to something more germane. It's a
monumental challenge to find the correct moniker. After all, what Brooklynite

with a storied history of failure, mismanagement, and dysfunction. Who can

Should the Nets be renamed the Brooklyn Dodgers? Too presumptuous by

My good friend Otis Jefferson Brown proposes Brooklyn Eagles. I think it's a
brilliant idea. It has history, especially for those who remember the Brooklyn

Morton, familiar from her role as Hattie in Sweet and Lowdown, is endowed with
the most expressive face in the history of cinema, and the director of In
America, Jim Sheridan, is smart enough to take advantage of her features.

The story is not unfamiliar -- immigrants in America, culture-clash and
assimilation, poverty and a bit of triumph at the end.  he film skirts
dangerously close to cliche and occasionally falls over the precipice -- I'm
sorry but I've seen too many movies in which an emotionally-stunted hero waits
until the final frame before he breaks into tears.

In America is at heart a drama about replacing the dead child. Johnny and Sarah
Sheridan lost a boy to a brain tumor and they've been off balance ever since. 
They're not going to be whole until they make another baby. Sarah's pregnancy is
precarious and the parturition difficult, and in a contrived piece of hoakum,
the baby doesn't begin to thrive until the suffering soul of a dying friend is
mystically infused into her.

No thought is given (nor should it be) to the poor baby, whose whole life will
be colored by her entrance into the world as savior and redeemer and who will be
freighted with expectations that she will never be able to fulfill.

"I grew up in Durban and in Cape Town. It was a privileged enclave. I had no
idea what was going on except that when I competed in sports, there were kids
who had no shoes. That was my first awareness. I went to government schools, but
everyone was white. The teachers were not allowed to talk politics but we knew
how they felt. When I was eighteen and finished high school, I could either go
into the "police" or to jail.  f you were in the police or in the army, you
were going to fight the guerrillas in Angola or you were going to put down the
natives. My mother was British, so I had a British passport. I left the country.
I was a triathlete. Sometimes we were sent to train in South Africa. I knew then
that I could never come back. I lived in France for fourteen years. We lived in
southern France, in Marseilles and in Avignon. There were many Arabs and they
would jeer at my wife when she went running. We came to Boulder because of the
running community. It's a great place for children. It may be a bubble, but it's
a good bubble. I don't run anymore but I coach triathletes. It's what I know how
to do.

Mandela was amazing. He was very forgiving. I don't know if it will always be
forgiving. I completely understand the resentment."

Date: June 03, 2010

It had been a while since I last flew Frontier --the airline with the cute furry
anthropomorphic talking mammals on their tails. There have been some changes
-- all of them for the worse. There's now an extra charge for each piece of
luggage. Those free meals are a thing of the remote past. So are the days when
you would get the entire can of ginger ale or tomato juice. It's now a splash of
juice in a cup of ice. No free TV -- you swipe your card, they swipe your cash.
The seats are smaller, too. More rows,less leg room. Wasn't there a time when
air travel was glamorous? Now it's just a big Greyhound in the sky, a warehouse
on wings.

Not only was my seat compressed, but the back didn't recline.  Somehow I had
signed up for a seat that bordered on the emergency exit row. In earlier planes,
such seats used to recline, but I'm guessing that Frontier has gained a few
inches by rendering the backs immobile -- at the cost of my comfort (but not at
reduced cost).

Adding to the insult is an unapologetic sign on the back of the seat in front
of me inscribed with the words NO RECLINE THIS SEAT. I wonder what language
the author of this sign think he is using. Not English, that's for sure. "No
recline this seat" does not even come close to parsing. What would it have cost
Frontier to affix a sign that read "the seats in this row do not recline." Where
do they outsource their signs -- to Mars? No recline this seat!!  Come on,
frontiersmen; you can do better than that. If you have no respect for me, at
least have a little respect for the language. The talking animals speak better
English.

To the chief of sign-makers at Frontier I say, "No hire this job."

There was another sign for me to stare out while I sat there, miserably cramped,
watching the clock. "LIFE VEST UNDER YOUR SEAT."  Is Frontier banging the
frugality drum a little too hard? The sentence might have read, "Life vest
IS under your seat."  How much could a trifling copulative verb cost?  If
Frontier wanted to be truly prodigal, it could even have raised the cash to
provide an indefinite article: "A life vest is under your seat." Wow. A complete
sentence!. What a concept!

Title: Childhood Memory and Prolegomenon to Any Future Epistemology
Date: June 17, 2010

I would have been six or seven years old, so it was 1945 or 1946. I was
visiting the apartment at 334 Eastern Parkway where my grandmother lived
with Aunt Mollie. Mollie and my father were engaged in an earnest conversation
of which I understood not a whit. I suspect that they were speaking the
language of the old country. Very likely they didn't want me to know what they
were saying.

I was on the floor studying what I now realize was some sort of halftone
illustration. Perhaps a magazine illustration -- something from Life or Look or
Collier's. Halftone is a style of reproduction in which a picture is comprised
of a myriad of tiny dots. When halftones are done inexpensively, as in comic
books, the dots are plainly visible. When they're done expertly, they're almost
beyond the perception of the human eye. But they're not invisible to the
inspection of a small child.

I said to my father and to my aunt something to the effect that "if you look
at this picture closely, you can see a lot of dots." I passed the illustration
to my father. He said, "No, there are no dots there." I said, "Look again. I
can see dots."  He looked again and so did Mollie. "Nope, no dots," they both
agreed. They handed back the picture and resumed their discussion. I had been,
in modern terms, totally dissed.

"Who are you going to believe? Me, or your own eyes?" says Chicolini in Duck
Soup.

I was shocked. My father, whom I knew to be correct in all things -- to deny
the existence of something that I could plainly detect. And my aunt as well.
Two adults, neither one who had ever been wrong about anything! What was going
on here? What was a child to think? It was a moment of great revelation, and a
turning point in my worldly experience.

Well, I wasn't about to argue with such formidable figures. But I knew in my
heart that I was right and they were wrong, wrong, wrong.

I also knew that I had to choose between Authority and my own senses. And of
course I chose sensation. The picture was made out of dots, no matter what they
said.

But my infant mind did not rest. At that moment, I knew that I would never ever
put blind trust in authority, never again. If my own father couldn't see the
dots and I could, then how could I believe anything that was contrary to the
evidence of my senses. My infant bosom got its back up, and I became a skeptic
-- and I've remained a skeptic.

It was not until many years later that I realized that the senses themselves
could be untrustworthy.  But by that time, my habits were fixed. In a contest
between authority and the evidence of the senses -- it would be sense all the
way.

Title: An Unsettling Anecdote
Date: July 13, 2010

There's an article in the current Harvard Magazine on the subject of
caregiving. (I've been thinking about caregiving quite a bit the last while,
because I've been the recipient of a lot of it, having been bedridden for a
couple of weeks with a slipped, or herniated, or ruptured disc). Taking care of
me has been a chore, performed with great grace and generosity by Mrs. Dr. M,
by Dr. M's oldest son, and by his son's wonderful wife.

The article on caregiving begins with a striking, unsettling anecdote.

In 1966, as a visiting medical student at a London teaching hospital, I
interviewed a husband and wife, in their early twenties, who had recently
experienced a truly calamitous health catastrophe. On their wedding night, in
their first experience of sexual intercourse, a malformed blood vessel in the
husband’s brain burst, leaving him with a disabling paralysis of the right
side of his body. Stunned and guilt-ridden, the couple clutched hands and
cried silently as they shared their suffering with me. My job was to get the
neurological examination right and diagnose where the rupture had taken place.

The author's point is that a diagnosis is incomplete in the absence of
compassion, not only in this most dramatic case but in more ordinary occasions.

It has been difficult for me to keep my mind off this traumatized young couple
--- stepping enthusiastically and it would appear naively into a first adventure
in sexual expression only to be overwhelmed by an out-of-the-blue horror. It's
a sorrow beyond ordinary sorrow. I wish that the author had added a paragraph
in which he reported that the young man recovered, that surgery corrected the
defect, and that the couple went on to live a long and satisfying life. I fear
that the absence of such a report means that there was no good news. Starting
with an aneurysm in the brain, it's easy to descend into scenarios of doom.

Ah life! So many potential disasters out there, so many bullets to dodge.

Even while I'm lying here, unable to get around without pain, I know that I've
lived a most fortunate life. No intercourse-related aneurysms, for one thing.

Title: On Pain
Date: July 16, 2010

Regular readers of this blague have got to be wondering -- where have you
gone, Dr. Metablog? A hungry readership turns their lonely eyes to you (woo
woo woo}. We're missing your pithy and astute commentary. All these athletic
contests come and gone, even including the World Cup, and all those political
follies, and not a word of commentary?  How can it be, Dr. M? Cat got your
tongue?

Well, dear blogreaders, the fact of the matter is that Dr. M. has been sidelined
with an injury and has been languishing on the disabled list. Ruptured his disc,
he did. L5 if you want to be specific. On his back now these last two weeks,
gulping the oxycodone, enduring a series of trips down there to the regional
hospital. Dependent on family and friends for succor and sustenance

Lying here, solitary for longer periods than is his wont, Dr. M,, who never
had a mind for philosophy, has had an opportunity to meditate on a subject of
particular relevance to his condition. He's been thinking about pain. About
dealing with pain.

Sometimes even Dr. M has to deal with very practical problems.

At the hospital, various "providers" ask me, over and over again, to "put
a number from 1 to 10 on the degree of your discomfort."  "Imagine," they
say, that 10 is the worst pain that you can conceive, what is your number?"
For me, this becomes a very difficult question, and one to which I don't
know how to respond honestly or accurately. For one thing,  I have a rather
vivid imagination, and for another, I've read more than is healthy about
ingenious systems of medieval and "renaissance" torture. It's true that my
back hurts, and the pain is real, but it's nothing compared to the worst that
human beings have endured or can be compelled to endure. I'm sorry to say that
I can imagine pain an order of magnitude beyond what my questioner can begin to
conceptualize.

But if I should say, "one" on a scale of one to ten, they'd throw me out of the
hospital and give my place to a more deserving patient. So I say, "eight and a
half" or "nine" -- not because such a number has the least bit of meaning but
because I think I've given my interrogators the magic number that will allow me
to get the care I need.

I have a friend who had a very painful form of arthritis, but couldn't get the
attention of the medical establishment for many horrible months -- until he
answered the pain question with "I'm going to go out in the backyard and shoot
myself." Then he was diagnosed and put on medication in an hour.

Moreover, I don't know how to measure my pain against another's. My eight
might be someone else's five, or vice versa. I don't want to be theatrical
(I can't bear to be a spectacle), but I also have no desire to be excessively
stoical. A ruptured disc hurts. Ask anyone who's been there. Is it equivalent
to childbirth? I suspect not. I know that burns are supposed to be infinitely
more agonizing. I got to the point of wincing and moaning and feeling faint,
but not to fainting or writhing or screaming. And I could always get relief
from oxycodone, which is not always the case in more serious situations. I even
had some morphine, which, at the time, was surprisingly ineffective. Now I'm on
the road to recovery, I believe, and the pain is very much handled with those
horse- size ibuprofen. But ten days ago it was all narcotics, all the time. And
I was grateful for them. Very much so.

I am reminded once again that pain is isolating. It separates you from your
friends. You live in the pain, and with the pain, and you deal with the pain.
You can't communicate it and you don't want to communicate it.

I fault myself for not having been sufficiently empathetic during my lifetime to
the pain that other people have experienced.

While I've been lying here, I've read two books by daring people who do not
hesitate to court pain. The kind of person who decides to climb an unclimbable
mountain, break his leg and then drags himself miles, freezing, starving,
crippled. The kind of person who leaves warm hearth and happy home to walk to
the South Pole dragging a two hundred kilogram sledge. These folks endure all
sorts of horrors, voluntarily. Then they write books about their pain (whole
paragraphs which I involuntarily skim and skip). When I read these stories, I
feel like a wimp to complain about a ruptured disc. On the other hand, I feel
sane -- not to have deliberately injured myself for the sake of some wild,
inexplicable impulse.

Title: Miss Dusenberry
Date: July 17, 2010

Miss Dusenberry, an English teacher at Erasmus Hall High School, was a
formidable presence.

It was 1954 or 1955 and I was a junior, carrying just sixteen years of
experience on my skinny back. To my shy, inhibited self, Miss Dusenberry (Edna?
Grace?) was perceived as ancient (50s), statuesque (5' 10"), domineering (she
spoke authoritatively on all things literary) and wildly eccentric. She wore
fragrant cosmetics and bedecked herself with so many bracelets and bangles that,
striding imperiously around the room, she jingled atonally and constantly.

My schoolwork did not please her. Miss Dusenberry derailed my educational
career, demoting me from the honors track in English (where the bright students
were grouped and where lessons were taught) to the general track where
classrooms were disorderly, students ranged from noncompliant to sociopathic,
and it was assumed that nothing would be learned, and it wasn't.

Yesterday, on an odd nostalgic impulse, I re-read Hawthorne's Young Goodman
Brown for the first time in close to sixty years. The story is more shocking to
me now than it could possibly have been in the 50s, when I had no background
to understand puritanism or the manichean view of the world. The story is more
alarming in what it takes for granted about American culture than for what it
consciously critiques. Hawthorne's world is not and never has been, my America.

Not only was I distressed by the story, but my mind flew back, or regressed,
to Miss Dusenberry herself, who tried to present the story to unsophisticated,
un- empathetic me back there in the Duke Snider/Joe McCarthy/Sid Caesar
era. No wonder that I flopped in Miss D's class. Good grief, was I ever
unwordly/unPuritan! On my intellectual horizon, the big worry was whether Roy or
Gil might go hitless two days in a row. I had not the merest tad of experience
(or even reading) to bring to bear on the elucidation of a dark allegorical
treatment of severe Calvinist soul-sickness. Didn't, for that matter, know what
Christians were talking about, except that the women and the kids dressed up and
went to mass on Sundays (in our Neapolitan and Sicilian immigrant neighborhood,
men stayed home and washed the car). There were no devils, real, imaginary, or
allegorical in my deep, mysterious forests -- and no forests either, in concrete
Brooklyn. I had no concept of spiritual despair or sin or damnation or salvation
or any such things -- still don't in fact -- not in any personal way.

Anyway, back in Erasmus Hall, Miss Dusenberry led the class through some
stories by Hawthorne. We might even have read The House of Seven Gables --
that other novel, the one with the A-word, would have been far too sexual and
embarrassing. Then came the unit exam and that's when the allegorical world of
Calvinism hit the fan of naive Flatbush literalism. The topic on which we were
assigned to write an in-class essay was -- "Is there balm in Gilead?"

I got to tell you, I was buffaloed.

It's easy to look back now, sixty years later, and translate Miss Dusenberry's
question into "in Hawthorne's view, is there hope for spiritual redemption in
a fallen universe?" An invitation, I must say, to turn the bullshittery up to
eleven. But I didn't know the word "balm" and I had never heard of "Gilead."
I didn't know the hymn and I most certainly didn't know that there was any
such thing as a Book of Jeremiah which contained relevant dark sentences to be
interpreted allegorically or mystically.

So I failed, ignominiously. Not the worst failure of my childhood -- being
thrown out at home plate when I had been sent in as a pinch-runner was a
far greater ignominy. But to tell truth, I've never made my peace with Miss
Dusenberry. Her bangles occasionally rattle my sleep.

Hawthorne? well, I've just kind of set him to one side.

Title: Paternal Wisdom
Date: September 13, 2010

Regular readers of Dr. Metablog know that the good doctor has been flat on his
back for a couple of months.  However, I'm glad to say, the crisis has passed
and I'm upright once again.

While lying there I had an opportunity to think about old times. I began to
recall some things that my father used to say.  I wouldn't say proverbs or
gnomic wisdom or anything so formal -- just sentences that would occasionally,
casually, pass his lips.  Here are a few of them, lightly annotated.

1."Never omit an opportunity to do a someone a favor, and never be embarrassed
to accept a favor." My father would say, "people like to help each other."  My
own experience has confirmed my father's wisdom and I've tried to follow his
example. However, there was a time that I ran into a stone wall with this one, 
I was forced into close dealings with a man whom it was impossible to help --
because whenever I did something for him, he thought that it meant that he had
outwitted me. My favor, offered freely, became his triumph. Needless to say, our
relationship did not prosper.

2.  "Anyone can get rich if he makes it the entire effort of his life."  My father was the least materialistic person I've ever known. He had no possessions and wanted none. Not only did money hold no allure, but he was contemptuous of those who felt the need to acquire it. But was he right? Can "anyone" get rich?  I don't think so. I've known people who tried and have gone down in flames.  But I certainly understand my father's point.

3.  "When the stock market is going up, everyone's a genius." I know that my father owned one stock in his entire life -- because a friend insisted. He would have kept his cash in the mattress if he could have. I think that recent world economic events confirm his sentence and lead to a corollary -- "sometimes the geniuses only seem to be geniuses."

4.  "Never get into an argument with a drunk." He was certainly 100% on target on this one. There's just no odds -- even if you win the argument, the drunk doesn't know it. Plus the jerk is liable to throw the beer bottle at you. (I doubt that my father was drunk a single time in his entire life. I was drunk once, in 1962, and it was enough).

5.  "Try to do the things you're not good at." He said that when he was younger he would say, "I don't like to swim" when the truth of the matter was that he wasn't a good swimmer. (He was a fine athlete.)  He would counsel me -- "do what if you're not good at it. Try it."  I wish I could say that I've honored this precept, but in all honesty, I haven't. Sorry, pop.

6.  "Don't forget to wash behind your ears."

7.  "Always try to appeal to the better side of human nature."  For example, in raising children, you should not punish a child; instead, you should say, "you don't want to be the kind of person who would do such-and--such."  I believe this saying of his to be practical and useful. Needless to say, my father didn't respect  that side of the political/ religious/ social spectrum that considers human beings to be fallen, inherently depraved and selfish creatures. He was basically optimistic -- though his optimism was certainly tempered by the public events of his last decade.

8.  "Never run with the crowd for the sake of being one of the boys."  This saying was central to his view of the world. I believe it came out of some particular experience of his youth but he never shared the details with me. I can certainly say that I've honored this precept -- perhaps to a fault. I could have been more sociable, more "clubbable"

Title: "Scamels from the Rocke"
Date: September 17, 2010

Not only Shakespeare specialists, but lay readers and playgoers are puzzled
by Caliban's mysterious "scamels."

From the context, it's clear that scamels are an easily obtained food. Listen
as Caliban lists some of the items he can gather from his island's prodigious
storehouse:

I prithee let me bring thee where crabs grow;

And I with my long nails will dig thee pig-nuts,

Show thee a jay's nest, and instruct thee how

To snare the nimble marmoset.  I'll bring thee

To clust'ring filberts, and sometimes I'll get thee

Young scamels from the rock.

Alas and alack, there is no such thing as a "scamel."

Caliban's taste in food is catholic, as is to be expected of a hunter-
gatherer. Nevertheless, his is not an appealing diet. "Crabs" could refer
either to crustaceans or to crab-apples. "Pig-nuts" are barely edible tubers. A
"jay's nest" does not sound gourmetish, and even if Caliban means the jays
themselves, he's not chosen a species of bird famous for flavor. The "nimble
marmoset" is a small monkey which a 1613 pamphlet (too late for The Tempest,
written c. 1611) acknowledged to be "good meat". "Filberts"  Shakespeare's
spelling is 'Philbirts') are also called hazelnuts, the North American variety
of which -- the unappetizing beaked hazelnut -- is better browsed by our native
deer than by homines sapientes. But what, prithee, are these peculiar scamels?

Among the older guesses: shamois (young kids); scannel (a kind of hawk); scams
(a dialectical word for limpets, or snails); seamar, or wild trefoil; sarcelle,
the French word for the teal; scallion; seagull.

But modern scholarship has coalesced around "sea-mell." It's now thought (by
90% of those who have studied the question) that Shakespeare knew a manuscript
report about a shipwreck called "A true repertory of the wreck and redemption
of Sir Thomas Gates, Knight, upon and from the islands of the Bermudas...July
15, 1610," which was not printed until 1625 in Purchas his Pilgrimes. Among the
details that Shakespeare found in the "true repertory" was a brief account of
a bird called a "sea-meawe": "a kind of web-footed fowl there is, the bigness
of an English plover... [which] hovering in the air made a strange hollow and
harsh howling.... Our men found a pretty way to take them, which was by standing
on the rocks or sands ... whereof the birds would come flocking to that place
nearer and nearer."

"Sea-meawes"  (a variant of seamell) was the word that Shakespeare encountered
in the manuscript letter.

I believe that he read the second letter of sea-meawe not as an "e" but as a
"c", or, alternatively, Shakespeare's own ms "e" was misread as a "c" by Ralph
Crane, the scrivener who prepared a fair copy of Shakespeare's holograph for
publication --  or perhaps even the compositor  who was assigned to set the
Folio page A5v misread Crane's fair copy. A "scamel," I'm .9 positive, is a
seabird hunted from a rock; it's a sea-mew or sea-mell.

The Tempest is filled with words compounded of the prefix "sea" and a second
element: sea-nymphs, sea-sorrow, sea-change, sea-swallowed, sea-marge. Why would
Shakespeare not have been enchanted by the fortuitous "seamell?" Scamel indeed!

Title: Wood Heat, c. 1611
Date: September 19, 2010

There are many curious ideas and events in Shakespeare's Tempest. Here's a
trivial one that both bothers and amuses me. For what reason does Prospero
keep Caliban in his service and close to home even after he has tried to rape
Miranda? Here's the puzzling explanation offered by the great magus himself: 
"We cannot miss [do without] him.  He does make our fire,/ Fetch in our wood,
and serves in offices/ That profit us."

The very vague "serves in offices/ That profit us" tells us that even
Shakespeare had a hard time justifying Caliban, whose only occupation, it would
seem, is to keep the Prosperian fireplace well stoked. He's certainly not
keeping the books.

My puzzle: Prospero is a great magician. He can raise storms, put people into
trances, devise supernatural banquets and shows, release spirits from cloven
pines, and even (though we don't see it) raise the dead ("Graves at my command/
Have waked their sleepers, oped, and let 'em forth.") If he's so supremely
golldarned powerful why can't he magically gather his own firewood? Come to
think of it, why does he need firewood at all? Instead of using a stove or
fireplace, why does't he just command Ariel to warm things up a bit.

Now I am aware that my concern here is a little on the ridiculous side.
Shakespeare is simply making up an excuse to keep Caliban around because Caliban
is essential to the play. Nevertheless, it's an odd justification -- although
in truth no odder than that Shakespeare feels it necessary to give Caliban a
practical, down-to-earth function in such a wildly unmoored-to-reality play.

(When I was a teacher I would always run aground of the engineering student
who would explain to me that Gregor Samsa's metamorphosis into a beetle was
unrealistic because a beetle of human size couldn't be supported on insect
legs and would be too large to breathe through spirochetes. "It's a story," I
would respond. "A fiction. You have to suspend disbelief. You can't accept the
transformation but boggle at Gregor's breathing.")

Similarly, it is foolish for me to believe, so to speak, in Caliban, and yet to
worry about his log-carrying. Or about the temperature of Prospero's home.

But I think there is a point to be made about Shakespeare. He could imagine
magic but he could not get his mind around practical, down-to-earth post-
Baconian technology. He had no trouble making his characters fly, but he
couldn't imagine a room (or a cave) being heated except by wood, magically
chainsawed and laboriously stacked. In Cymbeline, impatient Imogen, in need of
quick transport to Milford Haven, asks for a horse with wings, not a helicopter.
Shakespeare was not a technological visionary.

Title: Brief Remarks on Fritters and Turnips
Date: September 22, 2010

Shakespeare's The Merry Wives of Windsor is a moderately successful play but
not among Shakespeare's greatest hits. Nevertheless, there are two fragments
of first-class witty dialogue that continue to tickle me even after all these
years. The first is Falstaff's indignation at Parson Evans's Welsh-accented
transformation of the words "cheese" and "butter." EVANS:  Seese is not good to
give putter. Your belly is all putter."  FALSTAFF:  "'Seese' and 'putter.' 
Have I lived to stand at the taunt of one that makes fritters of English."
There's no mystery about the the imaginatively inappropriate word " fritters" --
it simply means chopped meat fried in a batter.  I don't know why "fritters"
amuses me so, but it does. It's off-target and off-kilter and yet so very
concrete and specific.

The second, and even funnier moment, is when Anne Page, one of the few sensible
characters in the play, makes it clear that she won't marry the foolish Dr.
Caius. "Alas," she says, "I had rather be set quick i'th'earth/ And bowled to
death with turnips."  "Set quick" means "buried alive," presumably up to the
neck, but it's the lovely, unexpected "turnips" that produces the laughter,
perhaps because no one before or since has thought to employ the usually
harmless vegetable as a deadly weapon.  I read the police blotters, I should
know.

For the record, Shakespeare never, In the 38+ plays, used either word again. He
knew that he had squeezed meaning enough out of both "fritters" and "turnips."

Title: Somnus Imago Mortis

It's an ancient commonplace -- sleep is the image of death.  In some versions,
it's a preparation for death: God has provided us with sleep to get us ready for
our inevitable end.  "Somnus imago mortis" is all over Shakespeare:  "sleep
thou ape of death,"  "death-counterfeiting sleep," etc.

My own personal sleep is so wracked with awakenings and nightmares and night-
sweats and fluff in the lung and a feverish tongue that I can't easily think of
it as a preparation for anything.  For me, sleep is rather a task, an effort,
than a period of oblivion.  I want my tombstone to be inscribed with the motto,
"No more insomnia, forever."

But just six weeks ago, I experienced a pure "somnus imago mortis" moment.  I
was on a gurney, drugged, prepared for surgery.  I was wheeled into a room. 
Time came to a complete halt.  And then several hours later I was awakened.
Nothing -- nothing -- intervened from the time that I was put under until the
moment when I came to. (Perhaps there was an amnesic in the drug cocktail -- I
wouldn't know.)

It was such a profound and eventless sleep that it has, in fact, prepared me for
the sleep of death.  There was not a whisper, not a thought, nothing.  Now, at
last, I know how it will be.

In the hospital, there was a very welcome rebirth.  But why, then, does the
phrase, "I have been half in love with easeful death" continue to resonate in my
brain?

Title: "Beyond Beyond."
Date: September 29, 2010

I sometimes think that I must be the world's number one fan of Shakespeare's
Cymbeline, which I have just re-read twice during the past week. Here's a play
that is seldom performed, infrequently read, rarely referenced, and omitted from
most university courses on Shakespeare. Although it's generally grouped with
the last plays or, as they have come to be called, the romances, surely fifty
people know The Tempest for everyone who is familiar with The Winter's Tale and
ten people know The Winter's Tale for everyone who knows (or has even heard the
name) of Cymbeline. Nevertheless, I love the play; it's perpetually entrancing.

Cymbeline is the most densely plotted of all of Shakespeare's plays and as
a result, it's difficult to follow, especially on the first dozen or score
of readings. It's so dense with plot that, in order to cram everything in,
Shakespeare devised a most elliptical and condensed style of speech. There are
some sentences to which I must still refer to the footnotes for explication --
and sometimes the footnote says, "seems to mean," or "perhaps means, but might
also mean."  Moreover, it's a hard play to read for those who don't come to it
with a deep familiarity with other of Shakespeare plays, because sometimes the
author seems to condense into a phrase or two an idea which he had explored more
fully in an earlier work. For example, in a number of the comedies there is an
opening scene in which characters discuss their unhappiness -- simply in order
to establish a situation in which the play can proceed from sadness to joy. And
frequently there's an early reference to the contrast between private emotion
and public posture.  n terse, economical Cymbeline, Shakespeare gets these
forms out of the way in a flash. An otherwise unknown "Gentleman" begins the
play: "You do not meet a man but frowns. Our bloods/ No more obey the heavens
than our courtiers/ Still seem as does the King."  And we're off and running. 
(Brief translation of the proceeding lines: everyone is sad because they attend
to the King's disposition.) It's a forbidding start -- but it covers an enormous
lot of ground. As it must, because Cymbeline brings on stage a wicked queen and
her doltish son, a physician expert in drugs that cause a person to simulate
death (just as in Romeo), a fair princess later to disguise herself as a page,
two brothers stolen from the court in swaddling clothes who will become military
heroes, an invasion of England by Roman forces, a low-born suitor of great worth
who will suffer exile but eventually return to claim his bride, an Italian
schemer who wagers than he can seduce a princess, and, moreover, the dream-
vision appearance of the hero's dead mother, father and brothers -- and finally
a guest appearance of Jove himself who descends on a machine to intervene
and prophesy. The play spends four and a half acts tying up thick plot-knots
and then a half an act unloosening them. Twenty-four misunderstandings are
clarified in couple of hundred lines. The conclusion is a miracle -- or rather,
a succession of miracles. Cymbeline is as manipulative as manipulative can be,
but I've never been able to read its last lines without dropping real tears.

My favorite scene, just to give an idea of how complicated and outrageous a play
it is, comes when Imogen (or in some modern texts Innogen), the princess, awakes
from drugged sleep to discover the ass Cloten (who "Cannot take two from twenty,
for his heart,/ And leave eighteen) to be dead, his head having been struck off,
but wearing the clothes of her lover Posthumus Leonatus (a long story). Imogen
naturally takes the one for the other, their bodies being apparently of the same
stature. She mourns her headless enemy as though he were her friend. It's a
truly bizarre, grotesque and wonderful scene. It is, as Imogen says in another
context, "beyond beyond."

Cymbeline is a rare treasure -- but it's not for the faint of heart, not for
skimmers.

Title: Beast of a Book
Date: October 03, 2010

I read Anatomy of a Beast by Michael McLeod, cover to cover, but I'm gol-durned
if I know why I did so.  A bad habit, finishing bad books.  And it is a bad
book -- badly written and badly edited.  Well, I'm exaggerating.  It's not all
that bad.  There's enough material in its 222 padded-like-an-old mattress pages
to make a good 2200 word essay.  Why is this book published by the University
of California Press when there are so many serious academic manuscripts unable
to find a publisher.  Anatomy of a Beast has "trade book" written all over it
-- the breathless first-person narrative, the transparently-contrived Quest, the
anecdotal style.

Good golly, Miss Molly, I'm allowing myself to get carried away.

What's it about?  Anatomy of a Beast examines the Bigfoot legend.  Finds it
false, a concoction of fakery and gullibility.  So far so good.  But that's
as far as it goes.  There's no persuasive analysis of the phenomenon and no
serious attempt to relate it to other frauds, conspiracy theories and other
spiritualisms and mass delusions.

Why is the famous Bigfoot film of 1968 still taken seriously years even after
the man who wore the gorilla suit has confessed?   I don't know.  Nor do
I know why crop circles are given tv-time after the man who perpetrated the
fraud described exactly how he did so.  Why are there posters on billboards
all over my town, today,  advertising "A Course in Miracles" to be offered by
a guy whose credential is that he just returned from India having studied with
some revered swami (and this 250 years after Hume's Essay on Miracles)?

Why do people -- apparently sensible people -- ask me if I think that
Shakespeare really wrote the plays?   Why do a majority of Americans not
"believe in" evolution?

Has the Age of Reason been cancelled?

A better, more challenging discussion of Bigfoot and other "cryptozoological"
fantasies might have earned a place in the story.  Not this disappointing book.

Title: A Conversation in Romeo and Juliet
Date: October 04, 2010

The artistry of Romeo and Juliet I.v.30-41 is, I fear, under-appreciated. It's
an utterly revolutionary moment in the history of the drama, but it's so subtle,
so art-that-hides-art, that it easily slips under the radar. Let me quote in
full.

Capulet.  Nay sit, nay sit, good cousin Capulet,

For you and I are past our dancing days.

How long is't now since last yourself and I

Were in a masque?

Cousin Capulet.   By'r Lady, thirty years.

Capulet.  What, man, 'tis not so much, 'tis not so much.

'Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio

Come Pentecost as quickly as it will,

Some five and twenty years: and then we masqu'd.

Cousin Capulet.  "Tis more, 'tis more, his son is elder, sir:

His son is thirty.

Capulet.    Will you tell me that?

His son was but a ward two years ago.

Romeo.  What lady's that which doth enrich the hand

Of yonder knight?

Romeo and Juliet is a play of rhetorical experimentation. In its course,
Shakespeare employs extravagant puns and wordplay, rhyme, prose, embedded
sonnets, stichomythia, two passages of contrived, Petrarchan oxymora, outrageous
bawdy, lament both real and parodic -- everything, in fact, that was in the
garner of a 1590s playwright.

The overlooked conversation between old Capulet and his cousin is an
innovative piece of rhetoric of Shakespeare's own invention. It's simply
everyday, colloquial conversation -- in his time, a complete and utter novelty.

It's two old guys talking the way old guys talk when they're savoring the past.
Repetitions: "'tis not so much, 'tis not so much" and "'tis more, 'tis more";
mock challenge: "will you tell me that"?; references to details known only to
the participants: "Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio..."; homely exaggerations:
"His son was but a ward two years ago." Even though Shakespeare casts the
passage in blank verse, he manages to capture the authentic sound of real
people engaged in real conversation.

But why?  It's all a trick or device to set off the sentence of Romeo's that
follows.

Unlike the Capulet cousins, Romeo is wholly captured by the language
of splendid and hyperbolic love-longing. Shakespeare therefore encourages his
audience to contrast the everyday quality of "His son was but a ward two
years ago" with Romeo's "What lady's that which doth enrich the hand/ Of
yonder knight." Needless to say, there are no knights at this merchant-class
gathering. "Knights" are a creation of Romeo's imagination. So is
the slightly archaic phrase "yonder knight," which is directly out of the
world of romance and clashes magnificently with the context that Shakespeare
has so carefully contrived. So too the inversion "what lady's that" instead of
"who is that lady" and the highly poetical (and supremely beautiful) "enrich
the hand."

Romeo's sentence is at the same time very serious and highly comic -- a triumph
of Shakespeare's original and  almost invisible craft.

Title: Horse Feathers (1932) /Everyone Says I Love You (1996)
Date: October 06, 2010

Goodness gracious! I should have known that the two films were distant cousins
-- after all, Woody Allen's film (one of his very best, and certainly his most
genial) ends with an extended tribute to Groucho in which everyone wears
phony mustaches and pretends to puff on stogies. But not having taken a look
at Horse Feathers in twenty or thirty years, I failed to realize how much
Woody had borrowed. How could I have forgotten that Everyone Says I Love
You extracts and transforms two songs from Horse Feathers: "I'm Through With
Love" as well as its own title song. And of course it shares its liberated
and episodic series- of-skits structure not only with Groucho but with all
vaudevillians. Not to mention a willingness to throw logic to the winds or under
the bus for the sake of a gag. Everyone Says I Love You is a lovely, gentle
film (much more mild than its raucous unsubtle predecessor).

Its exhilarating choreography is very distinctly not indebted to anything in the
earlier film.

Some ambitious scholar could write an illuminating essay on Woody's Marxism.

I had a prescription to fill for amoxicillin.  I noticed that there's a

called by the very pharmacy-sounding name Boulder Rx.  I walked in: 
very definitely not a pharmacy.  Not when there's a large illustration
of marijuana leaf and a sign that reads "Headies."  And a very thick probably
bullet-proof plate glass window separating customers from clerk.  Sign of the

I took my prescription elsewhere.

From the Boulder Rx website:  "Menu: Bubba Kush, Tangerine Kush, Sour D,
Chemdog, Godfather, Sour Kush, Purple Cinderella, Mananuska, OG Kush." 
Different strains, not doubt designed to attack different diseases.  I wonder
exactly what is cured by Purple Cinderalla.

Title: We Are All Frail/  Brooks Conrad
Date: October 14, 2010

Even moderately serious baseball-watchers know that we've just experienced a
disaster of the Mickey Owens-Willie Davis-Bill Buckner variety. Poor Brooks
Conrad, a journeyman infielder, playing for the Atlanta Braves in an important
playoff game, committed three horrible errors. He bobbled a ball, dropped a
popup, and then, with the game on the line, let a routine grounder go right
through his legs. He was nutmegged, as they say in soccer. Game over, Atlanta
eliminated. The hi-def TV camera focussed on him, allowing millions of Americans
to lipread the poor guy's puzzled, exasperated, embarrassed, "What the fuck."
Interviewed after the game, Conrad was more decorous but no less defeated: "I
wanted to dig a hole and go to sleep in it."

Sleep won't do it, because Conrad's errors will be re-played forever and ever
and ever.

The play that lost the game was one that Brooks Conrad has made time and time
again -- at Arizona State, during his ten years in the minors, and during
his three-year (229 at bats, 53 hits) and now completed major league career.
He wouldn't have been in the game -- as a substitute for the injured Martin
Prado -- if he didn't have the ability to put a glove on a pop fly or handle
a ground ball. One of the announcers called it accurately:  "they say you
make errors with the glove but in this case the problem is right between his
ears."  Brooks Conrad somehow lost the ability to do things that should have
been entirely routine  -- which is why I feel so sorry for him, and why I
identify so strongly with him.  It could happen to anybody, anytime. I remember
once driving along on a big four-lane and for a second I forgot which foot
operated the accelerator and which the clutch.  I panicked, momentarily, but I
recovered, and no one ever knew.  didn't have millions of people watching me
and clucking.

I'm glad to say that the next day, when Brooks took the field during warmups (he
was mercifully held out of the game), Atlanta fans gave him a big cheer. "We are
all frail," as Angelo says, and it's not wrong for us to be reminded of it once
in a while. But poor Brooks, condemned to a lifetime of waking up in the middle
of the night, Buster Posey's grounder skidding past his glove and through his
legs, runners endlessly, one after another, in an infinitely loop, crossing home
plate to the deafening roar of the crowd.

Title: Milagro 51, Ciencia 49
Date: October 18, 2010

A Chilean newspaper, El Espectador, has reported the results of a poll of
its readers. When asked about the recent rescue of the thirty-three Copiapo
miners, 49% of readers attributed the success to "ciencia" while 51% judged it
a "milagro." A miracle?  It what universe?  What could they be thinking? The
rescue was all hard work and ingenuity and high speed percussive drilling.
There's nothing the least bit supernatural about such a triumph.

Nor does it do any good to blame those primitive superstitious Chileans.
Americans would have divided  similarly -- with a higher score for "milagro" in
our ultra-benighted South and a somewhat lower score in the only semi-benighted
North. Even on my very own Facebook page, a number of friends of "friends" (not
my own "friends" I'm glad to say), posted exultantly, "This proves that God is
real."  No it doesn't -- it proves only that the true believers have no use for
evidence or reason. Why does the great signifier in the sky get the credit for
the rescue but no blame for the collapse that caused the disaster. And would the
god-enthusiasts have abandoned their belief if the men had died. Not a chance.
They would fallen back on the old bromide, not for us to question the will of
god -- or employed some other kind of trapeze artist illogic.

A miracle! Humbug! If a superman-like hand of god had come down from the heavens
and drilled the hole, I would vote milagro also. Otherwise, ciencia.

What is a miracle, anyway?  I thought that David Hume finished off miracles
a quarter of a millennium ago. Miracles are not "unlikely events," he said.
 "They are events that are contrary to nature." The mine rescue may have been
a long odds situation, but it wasn't unnatural. It was entirely in accord
with what we know about the world and human psychology and the ciencia of
mining. (Hume capped his argument by saying that there can be no such thing as a
miracle, because if it happens, then it's not contrary to nature. It is nature.)

But all of us use the word "miracle" very loosely. I may know, with one part of
my brain, all about eggs and sperm and DNA, but I still feel that it's something
of a miracle whenever a baby is born. Although it's a common miracle -- billions
strong --I'm awed by each and every newborn. As I am by the Chilean miners and
their rescuers. I'm awed, I'm relieved, I'm joyous, I'm dazzled, but most of
all, I'm proud of the compassion, the resilience, and the intelligence of my
fellow human beings --and there you have my understanding of the word "milagro."

Title: Prostituting that Past-Cure Malady
Date: October 24, 2010

i''ve read All's Well that Ends Well many times (thrice just in the last
week), always with puzzlement and  dissatisfaction. It's a confused and
confusing play. My best guess is that Shakespeare got going on some appealing
but intractable material and struggled with it for many years but was never
able to bring it to a satisfactory conclusion.

Until this last reading, I had never paid much attention to the King of France
who is, I think, more of a plot mechanism than a rounded character. Shakespeare
never even bothered to give him a first name -- he's "King" but whether Charles
or Louis or Lothair we're never told. He plays a crucial part in the fable,
because, dying of a "fistula," he is cured by our heroine Helen and in exchange
grants her the husband of her choice (her obsession, actually) -- the handsome
soldier and crass lout Bertram. Later in the play, after Bertram has fled from
the marriage, the King again intervenes to restore him (against his will) to
Helen. The King is short-tempered and highly conscious of his regal status -- as
Kings are in literature -- but he is not particularly eloquent or interesting.

But in my most recent reading, I was struck by some lines that I had not
registered in my salad days. Helen urges the King to allow her to try her
"receipts" (i.e. prescriptions or drugs) on him. He resists, of course, simply
so that Helen may overcome another contrived obstacle. But the King's sentences,
fable apart, are very pertinent, most particularly to those of us who have
staggered to life's endgame:

We thank you, maiden,

But may not be so credulous of cure,

When our most learned doctors leave us and

The congregated college have concluded

That laboring art can never ransom nature

From her inaidable estate. I say we must not

So stain our judgment, or corrupt our hope,

To prostitute our past-cure malady

To empirics, or to dissever so

Our great self and our credit to esteem

A senseless help, when help past sense we deem.

"Empiric" is Shakespearean for "phonies."  The King will not compromise his
rationality or his dignity by indulging himself with the sixteenth-century
version of faith-healers, herbalists, reiki masters, homeopaths, naturists or
any other of the enormous plague of quack-quacks who litter our anti-rational
landscape.

Good for him, I say, even though, as it turns out, he's wrong and the maiden
successfully works her receipts. Shakespeare keeps us out of the sickroom,
so we don't know exactly what she prescribes (just as well), but we do learn
that the credulous bystanders attribute the cure not to science but to divine
intervention. As the very orthodox and conventional Lafeu puts it, "They
say miracles are past, and we have our philosophical persons to make modern
(i.e. routine, everyday) and familiar, things [that are] supernatural and
causeless.  Hence it is that we make trifles of terrors, ensconcing ourselves
into seeming knowledge when we should submit ourselves to an unknown fear
(i.e. fear of the unknown)" -- an interpretation that might made sense in
Shakespeare's scientifically-ignorant late medieval world, but which is no
longer applicable.

Nevertheless, I trust that when my time comes, I will follow the King's good
example and come to terms with reality rather than succumb to irrationality and
"esteem a senseless hope."

Title: Scary News from Longmont, Colorado
Date: October 25, 2010

Sometimes I can't make the slightest sense of what I read in the newspapers. 
Here's an example.  But first some sheep news.

The desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis nelsoni), smaller than the ordinary
bighorn and one of the rarest and most endagered our native mammals, has
been reduced to dry ranges in Nevada and California, near rocky cliffs in
almost waterless environments. "Hunting has been prohibited or controlled
since the early 1900s, but much illegal poaching still occurs.  The subspecies
Ovis canadensis auduboni of the Black Hills and adjacent areas has already
become extinct."

Now the newspaper report.  The Longmont Times-Call celebrates a local
heroine, Ms. Sara Brandenburg.

"At age 15, Brandenburg became the youngest female in the world to the earn the
North American Grand Slam after shooting and killing four different species of
North American wild sheep — a dall, a stone, a Rocky Mountain bighorn and a
desert bighorn.  She shot a 230-pound dall sheep Aug. 17, 2009, in Alaska and
pinned her final animal — a 220-pound stone sheep — in the Yukon Territory
on Aug. 8, four days before her 16th birthday.The previous record-holder was
a 32-year-old, according to the Grand Slam Club/Ovis.When she shot the stone
sheep — the final one for her grand slam — tears poured down her face.
“It’s a big emotional rush when you get it,” she said.  While working
on the record, Brandenburg, who is a sophomore at Longmont Christian School,
missed two months of classes. She ended the year with a 4.0 grade-point average,
in part because she hauled textbooks on hunts. Moments before shooting her
desert bighorn sheep in Mexico’s Baja Desert, she was finishing algebra
homework.  Her father, Rod Brandenburg, taught Sara and her older sister,
Katey, 18, to hunt at an early age, instilling in them the same pioneer spirit
his great-grandfather had when he moved from Germany to homestead in the 1870s
in Westcliffe, Colo. He estimated it cost about $120,000 to arrange for Sara
to kill four sheep. When friends remark about the cost, Brandenburg says it was
worth it.  “I couldn’t afford not to,” he said.  When he watched Sara
shoot her final sheep, a wave of relief, exhilaration and admiration washed
over him, he said.  Last month, she took up archery and hopes to repeat the
grand slam with a bow this time or advance to the Super 10 title, which is
awarded to hunters who shoot and kill 10 North American big-game animals.  In
addition to sheep, Sara Brandenburg also has shot and killed three antelopes,
one white-tailed deer and one black bear, as well as a gemsbok, an eland, a
wildebeest and a zebra during a hunting trip in South Africa."

I don't understand blood sports.  I find them repulsive and inhuman.

Am I missing something?  The Brandenburg family values ($120,000 to kill four
rare sheep) are disgusting, sociopathic, and barbaric.   Are these people
locked into the Stone Age?

Title: Who Is Violenta?  What Is She?
Date: October 27, 2010

Here's a puzzle about a character's name that will interest detectives
or dedicated Shakespeareans -- and perhaps only the most dedicated of
Shakespearean detectives.

As everyone knows, the "heroine" and dominant figure in Twelfth Night is
an audacious, sensitive, and intelligent young lady to whom Shakespeare
gave the name Viola. It is Viola who, shipwrecked on the Illyrian shores,
disguises herself as a man, enlists herself as a servant to Duke (or Count)
Orsino, whom she rapidly comes to admire, and is then dispatched by
Orsino to woo in proxy his beloved, Lady Olivia the recalcitrant. Viola
has the misfortune, while in mannish guise, to provoke Olivia's romantic
interest. The complications that arise from these mistakings take five amusing
acts to resolve. But it's Viola's play, from first to last, and there is no
question about her identity or her name.

Viola first comes on stage in the second scene of the play. The stage
direction in the 1623 Folio is unambiguous. Enter Viola, a Captaine, and
Saylors. In the speech headings throughout the play, Viola regularly appears
as Vio., just as Maria is Mar., Clown is Clo., and Malvolio is Mal. There
is but one exception to this practice -- and here begins the mystery. In
the middle of Act 2, scene 5, Viola comes as ambassador to Olivia but the
stage direction reads, inexplicably, Enter Violenta. Who is Violenta, what is
she? Inasmuch as Viola's name has been and will continue to be Viola, how
did it happen that just this one time she comes to be called by a similar
but very different name? The most likely explanation is that it's a mere
slip -- either an error of the compositor who set the Folio line, or an error
of the scribe who made a fair copy of Shakespeare's manuscript, or of W. S.
himself, nodding over his quill and inkhorn.

But for Shakespeareans, "Violenta" is most interesting name. While the
playwright created no characters named Violenta, there was one time when he
came very close to doing so. The near-Violenta almost appears in  All's
Well That Ends Well, the play that is printed in the Folio just before
Twelfth Night. In All's Well, Helen, who is obsessed with Bertram, pursues
her absconded and disloyal husband to Florence. There she discovers that
Bertram has been wooing a woman called Diana. But Diana was not originally
conceived as Diana. She had a momentary and evanescent pre-existence
as Violenta. Enter old Widdow of Florence, her daughter, Violenta and
Mariana, with other Citizens." So says the stage direction, but in the scene
that the s.d. introduces, there is no Violenta. No person of that name says
a word. In her stead there appears a Diana (or Dia.), whose entrance onto
the stage is unannounced. Diana appears where Violenta was heralded. Clearly
Shakespeare changed his mind.

It is therefore clear that the Folio compositors were working with a holograph
that preserved Shakespeare's first thoughts. Diana, the o-so-pure maid whom
Bertram cannot conquer, was orignally intended to be Violenta, who, it is
reasonable to infer from her name, would have repelled the young seducer's
advances not with virtue but with shrewishness. Later, when Shakespeare
altered his conception, Violenta turned into the mirage or ghost who both is
and is not present in All's Well.

The Violenta of All's Well can therefore be understood as a first pass at
Diana. But what possible explanation is there for the substitution of
Violenta for Viola in Twelfth Night?  It's a hard question, and the
not-entirely- satisfactory but best answer is that the typesetter who worked
on both of these plays (Compositor B, so-called) carried the name from one
play to the other. Let us suppose that he had just set "Enter... Violenta"
in All's Well when he resumed work on Twelfth Night. There he encountered
the abbreviation "VIo." and, the longer name still reverberating in his
mind, expanded Vio. to Violenta.

That's the end of the story. But there's a fascinating postscript. When,
in All's Well, Bertram makes his move on Diana, there's this exchange
(including the introductory stage direction):

Enter Bertram, and the Maide called Diana.

Ber. They told me that your name was Fontybell.

Dia. No, my good Lord, Diana.

Fontybell? Beautiful fountain? It would seem that Diana/Violenta once had
still another name. Or that Shakespeare wants us to think so.

"They told me that your name was Fontybell" is a pure, lovely, and haunting
line of poetry, but it's unrelated to anything else in the play. It's a
free-standing mystery, utterly without explanation.

at a ball coming off a bat and run to the spot where it's going to land and
stick out a glove and catch it?  How do they instantaneously calculate and plot
their course?  Why did I, as a youth, start in, veer left, turn right, and
then circle about in hopeless confusion?

Why is it that the only act of the human brain at which I am

Title: In Which the Blogger Loses his Cool
Date: November 02, 2010

The Takacs Quartet graces us with six superb concerts a year.  It's true
that they sometimes hanker after strange new composers -- Psathos, Part etc.
-- whose compositions set my teeth on edge like the vile squealings of the
wry-necked fife or like a brazen canstick turned or like the gratings of a dry
wheel on an axletree  -- but mostly they play what distinguished Quartets are
ordained to play, that is, the great central European tradition from Haydn
to Brahms.  But last night, the Takacs, eek and alas, ventured into new
and grim territory.  Horribile dictu, they offered an original, commissioned
Drama that purported to be Serious and Illuminating.  It warn't.  It was
a interminable playlet about Beethoven's last years founded on the composer's
letters and conversation books.  It was barren.  It was predictable,
uninsightful, reductive, shallow, witless, dull, and pretentious.  I started
to squirm (boredom feeding on embarrassment and embarrassment on boredom)
after a couple of minutes, then broke into a sweat, but after a few minutes
resigned myself to my middle-of-the-row captivity and I did what I always do
in such situations -- recited to myself long-ago-memorized poetry.  When the
Drama mercifully ended, I was consoled to hear the woman in front of me (a
member of the music faculty) say to her companion, "Do you think they know how
bad that was?"

Do they?  I hope so.  I hope that the playwright, a tyro named  ------
Morse, recognizes that he's not Tom Stoppard or even Tom Stoppard diluted to
a 1% tincture, and that he takes up a profession that inflicts less pain on
innocent bystanders.

I left dispirited, especially for the actors, who tried to force a marriage
of Shakespearean style of performance to prosaic vocabulary and sentence
structures.  I do not use the word "Shakespearean" in a good way:  I refer
to that highly artificial, unnatural way of speaking and moving that, inherited
and debased from an ancient tradition, has stupefied and narcotized dutiful
culture- hungry audiences at summer festivals all over America.  Shakespeare
himself was clear that he did not want his actors to strut and bellow, but strut
and bellow was what they did last night.  If the actors did not split the
ears of all the groundlings, they certainly split mine.  Why do they speak
in that ridiculous manner when their aim should be "to hold the mirror up to
nature."  It's wrong of me to say so, but I felt that I could look into the
soul of the actor who played Beethoven and see a man who imagined that  he
was playing Lear at the Old Vic, when he was in fact performing in a play that
might, just might, satisfy the requirements for an M.A. in creative writing
at some off-brand college ("he's worked very hard on this so we might as well
pass him"), and that he was going to show "them" how it's done, but instead he
offered us sufferers a copy of a copy of a pale copy.

Egads, I'm breaking into a sweat again just thinking about it.

I pay good money to hear the Takacs -- and concert after concert, I get my
money's worth, and much more.  I want Schubert.  I want Mozart.  If I wanted
amateur theatricals, I would go to he local dinner theater.  Or to the high
school around the corner.

Title: Gamboge-coloured Bluchers
Date: November 08, 2010

I have, on occasion, noted that modern readers of the great classic novels of
the previous era are unaware of the social significance of horses and horse-
drawn vehicles.  As I wrote, right here on this blague a couple of months ago,
"no, I'm not obsessed, it's just that I have this little bee in my bonnet about
the fact that we gasoline-era moderns understand exactly what is meant when
our hero arrives in a jeep, Jaguar, Jetta, or jalopy, but we are utterly
clueless as to the valence of barouche, basket carriage, berlin, britchka,
brougham, buckboard, buggy, cabriolet, caleche, cariole, carryall, chaise,
chariot, clarence, concord wagon, coupe, croydon, curricle, cutter, daumont,
dearborn, dennet, diligence, dog-cart, fiacre, fly, four-wheeler, gig, go-cart,
governess cart, hansom, herdic, jaunty car, jersey-wagon, kibitka, landau,
phaeton, post-chaise, rockaway, shandrydan, shay, spider-phaeton, spring-van,
stanhope, sulky, surrey, T-cart, telyezhka, tilbury, tarantass, trap, troika,
victoria, vis-a-vis, wagonette, or wurt."

I'm not the only person who has taken note of the variety of horse-drawn
vehicles.  In an early essay (one of the Sketches by Boz), Charles Dickens
reported that the road to Greenwich Fair was "in a state of perpetual bustle. 
Cabs, hackney-coaches, "shay" carts, coal-waggons, stages, omnibuses, sociables,
gigs, donkey-chaises -- all crammed with people... roll along at their utmost
speed."  What, pray tell, is a "sociable?"

In another of Dickens' sketches, a newborn is taken to be christened in
a "glass-carriage." It can't be made of glass;  it must be windowed.

On an "assembly night", "a 'double-fly' was ordered to be at the door of Oak
Lodge at nine o'clock precisely."  A "double-fly" would appear to be twice as
large as your run-of-the-mill fly.  Twice as long?  Twice as wide?

As little as I know about vehicles, it appears that I know less about
nineteenth-century clothes for men.  What does it mean that one of
Dickens' characters wears "cordury knee-smalls?"  Fashionable or ridiculous? 
What about "spotless inexplicables?"  "Black knee-shorts?"  "A black-glazed
stock?"  "Cloudy Berlins?"  "Drab shorts and continuations?"   "Knee-cords
and tops?" What does it mean that a man had "various particles of sawdust,
looking like so many inverted commas, on his inexpressibles."  And what,
finally, are "gamboge-coloured Bluchers?"  I can't even begin to imagine. 
Help!  I need an annotated Boz.

Title: All About Antres
Date: November 14, 2010

"Antres" is among the rarest of rare words. Shakespeare's Othello speaks of
"antres vast and deserts idle" in the magnificent oration in which he takes
issue with the Venetian bigotry that claimed that he was only able to win
white Desdemona by employing drugs and witchcraft. No, it wasn't because he
was a sorcerer; it was because he was accomplished, heroic, romantic. "Antres"
is one of the exotic words that defines the great African general as a
non-Venetian -- an outlander, an "erring barbarian," an "extravagant and
wheeling stranger."

Shakespeare coined "antres" just for the occasion, deriving it from Latin
antrum, a cave. He never used "antres" again, nor did anyone else until
Keats fleetingly revived the word two centuries afterward. "Antres" never
domesticated into English and remains curious and remote, eternally in need
of an explanatory footnote. It is unlikely that Shakespeare expected that a
popular or even a courtly audience would grasp "antres" at first hearing. It's
a risky word, but Shakespeare didn't become Shakespeare without taking risks.

The playwright coupled the neologism "antres" to another shiny new Latinism
to produce "antres vast," a phrase which translates into the language
of 2017 as "really big caves." Yet no translation can do justice to
the spacious resonance of "antres vast." The caverns to which Othello
refers are monstrously huge -- grown grander and even more inaccessible
because Shakespeare ingeniously placed the modifier after rather than before
the noun. "Antres vast" are a hundredfold more mysterious -- darker, more
echoic, more glinty with stalactites and stalagmites -- than "vast antres."

"Antres vast" occurs in tandem with a second and equally remarkable noun-
adjective combination: "deserts idle." Othello reports that before he came to
Venice, he had not only traversed "rough quarries, rocks, and hills whose
heads touch heaven" but had also dwelt among "antres vast and deserts
idle." Strictly speaking, deserts cannot be "idle," but they can be vacant
or useless. "Deserts idle" reinforces and augments "antres vast." Taken
together, the two phrases are infinitely more evocative than either alone.

As a structure of sound, "antres vast and deserts idle" pivots on the "d"
of "and" and the "d" of "deserts" and it positions "antres" and "idle"
in symmetrical opposition. The two key words are dissimilar yet cleverly
interlinked, each comprised of an open vowel (Antres, Idle), a dental (anTres,
iDle), and a liquid (antRes, idLe). It is not by accident that "antres vast
and deserts idle" is such a euphonious and mouth-filling phrase.

Shakespeare not only invented "antres" for Othello's oration but also took
care to surround it with other linguistic novelties. For example: Othello
claims to have encountered "cannibals that each other eat/ The anthropophagi."
"Cannibal" is now a commonplace noun, but in 1604 it was a newcomer to the
language. "Cannibal" derives from "Carib," the name of a recently-encountered
people-- reputed to be man-eaters --who gave their appellation to the sea in
which they lived. "Cannibal" was sufficiently strange--it had only made harbor
in England (arriving by way of Spain) in the 1550s--that Shakespeare felt a
need to define it, which he did once in English ("that each other eat") and
once in Greek ("anthropophagi"). "Anthropophagi," a word that had originated
with Herodotus, was as new to English--and as seldom employed--as "cannibal."

"Antres vast," "deserts idle," "cannibals" and "anthropophagi" play crucial
parts in Othello's stirring autobiographical fragment.

I spake of most disastrous chances,

Of moving accidents by flood and field,

Of hair-breadth scapes i'th'imminent deadly breach,

Of being taken by the insolent foe

And sold to slavery;  of my redemption thence,

And portance in my travel's history:

Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle,

Rough quarries, rocks, and hills whose heads touch heaven,

It was my hint to speak -- such was the process.

And of the cannibals that each other eat,

The anthropophagi, and men whose heads

Do grow beneath their shoulders.

It's an astonishing story, each element more incredible than the one that
precedes it. Hair-breadth escapes?  Every hero can boast of them. Redemption
from slavery? A bit less likely. Hills whose heads touch heaven? A pardonable
hyperbole. Cannibals?  Surely, less believable still. The Othello landscape
then crosses the border from exotic to fabulous when it adduces "men whose
heads/ Do grow beneath their shoulders." These headless men are the
blemmyae -- Nubian or sometimes Ethiopian -- who were a feature of 
pseudo-anthropological folklore from Pliny to Sir Walter Raleigh. The skepticism
that these monstrous creatures ought to provoke is diluted because the road to
the blemmyes passes through "antres vast and deserts idle." If audiences
had not been lulled and seduced by "antres," they might dismiss Othello as a
mere braggart soldier-- rather than admire him for the near-magician that he
becomes in his self- dramatization.

Shakespeare had yet another purpose for "antres vast." In the sentence that
treads on the heels of the "men whose heads/ Do grow beneath their shoulders,"
Othello abruptly turned his attention to Desdemona. His language dulls. "This
(i.e. his exotic narrative) to hear would Desdemona seriously incline,/ But
still the house affairs would draw her hence." Shakespeare strategically
contrasts Othello's vocabulary to Desdemona's when he juxtaposes "antres
vast" to "house affairs." Only the tinnest of ears can fail to be struck
by the difference between the two phrases. Antres vast--house affairs; house
affairs-- antres vast. The gap between these two most pregnant phrases is small
enough to allow the electric impulses of sex and romance to spark, but is too
wide to allow genuine understanding or empathy to shoot the gap. The tragedy
of Desdemona and Othello arises out of the unbridgeable space between "antres
vast" and "house affairs."

Shakespeare therefore knew exactly what he was about when he invented the word
"antres."

If he had been in a more antic mood, less determined
to characterize Othello's massive dignity, he might have coined a word from
another Latin word for cave, e.g. spelunca.  But "spelunkies vast" --
or even "spelunkies splendid" -- could not possibly do the work of "antres
vast."

Title: Antres, Antrees, Antars
Date: November 19, 2010

One of my loyal readers (see "Comments" to previous post) wants to know how the
word "antres" was pronounced. It's a reasonable inquiry but like many questions
about Shakespeare, its answer is not easy.

I myself pronounce "antres" just as I would "antlers," but without the "l".
If I were to guess at an Elizabethan pronounciation (and it would be a guess,
even though I've stumbled through the volumes on Shakespearean pronunciation by
Kokeritz and Cercignani), I would say the word with a more open initial vowel: 
"ahnters." But can we ever be certain how words were pronounced four hundred
years ago?  Especially nonce-words like antres?

Moreover, Shakespeare did not spell antres, "antres.'  Antres is a brilliant
editorial intervention that made its initial appearance in Lewis Theobald's The
Works of Shakespeare in 1733.

The first time that Othello saw print, in the 1622 quarto, antres was
"Antrees." The second time, in the first Folio of 1623, antres was "Antars." 
Are either one of these spellings, each of which yields a different
pronounciation, authoritative?  It is impossible to know. With some plays, it's
clear that F was set from Q, and that therefore any divergences are likely to be
errors. But in the case of Othello, Q and F descend independently from a lost
original (and it's been suggested that Q reveals evidence of the interpolations
and misunderstandings of actors). Neither "Anteers" or "Antars" is definitive.
Either pronunciation can therefore be justified.

Perhaps Shakespeare changed his mind. Perhaps a scribe or a typesetter,
struggling with a unique and unfamiliar work, took a guess. The rest is silence.

Title: First Week in the West, August 1969
Date: November 20, 2010

Our final stop on the road westward was Gothenburg, Nebraska.  We set up the
old canvas tent in a park in the heart of town and slept to the screeching of
cicadas (a sound new to me).  (In those days we couldn't possibly have afforded
the $10 or $15 for a motel.)  By noon the next day we had reached Crook,
Colorado (population 128 in 2000 but considerably more in 1969 -- the town was
then large enough to support a restaurant and a gas station). We ate lunch but
when we got back into the green Dodge station wagon, purchased ($2500) for
our new life in the Rockies, we discovered that something had gone terribly
wrong with the gears and that the car would only go backwards. I worried that
we were going to be stuck in Crook with two boys under four years old while
we waited for a transmission part to be trucked in from Detroit. Filled with
financial trepidation, I backed the car around the block (there was only one
block, fortunately) to the town's lone mechanic. He said he'd "take a look." He
did, got himself a great big screwdriver and banged away under the hood for a
few minutes. "Fixed it." When he charged me $1.00 for the service, I began to
think well of Colorado. We piled back into the car and continued with the last
150 miles of the trip, gazing at the mountains in the distance and the arid
steppes, populated only by the occasional cow -- with nary a human being in
view.

We made it to Boulder sometime in that  same afternoon. It took a while to find
the house we had rented by mail. We missed it on the first pass and drove by
the old Pioneer Cemetery, which became our first landmark. We had no idea that
we had rented a cute small 1915 arts and crafts bungalow with the original fir
woodwork still intact -- what a change from our Manhattan apartment overlooking
Broadway. Our few sticks of furniture were delayed in transit (and would be for
three weeks), so we all slept on air mattresses for the while.

The Daughter (at whose request I am writing this reminiscence), was conceived
before the furniture arrived.

Our landlord and next-door neighbor was Jack David Angus Ogilvy, a rangy cowboy
and professor of Anglo-Saxon who was, contrary to all expectations, a distant
relative of the queen of England.  (Was it 1969 or the next year that I met
Jack's cousin, a pimply English boy named Angus, known across the sea as Lord
Ogilvy)?  That was a surprise. Another surprise:  the alley behind our house
was bordered with a huge crop of wild plums. The boys discovered the plums very
soon after our arrival.

I was taken by surprise by the Colorado light.   had always lived in the
cloudy east, and that bright western sun was a complete surprise. High altitude,
no humidity, and very big sky. I'm still not quite used to it.

Boulder was not the sophosticated, foodie, high-tech, trendy town it has become.
It was all white bread, the downtown unMalled and still dominated by banks, car
dealerships, Valentine's Hardware, Smith's Shoes, a big old Woolworth's and
wide empty streets. There were only a few restaurants -- I remember the Harbin
Inn, a mediocre Chinese joint, and the Gondolier ditto but Italian (still in
business but much changed). And our favorite, the Aristocrat, a breakfast place
with portions that could remedy in a single sitting those dangerous drops in
cholesterol.

On our first day in town, we drove by Boulder High School. Mrs. Dr. M. said,
"That's where I want to teach when I go back to teaching." Which she did, a few
years later and then for many years.

Title: Dentists I Have Known
Date: November 23, 2010

When I was a child, there were two neighborhood dentists.  One was named
Caress and the other was named Yankowitz.  My parents chose Nathan Caress,
possibly for onomastic reasons, but they might have made a mistake;  Nathan
Caress should have been called Nathan Butcher.  Dentistry sixty years ago was
much inferior to dentistry today, especially in our dark corner of the universe.
 There was no anaesthetics, no novacaine.  Baby teeth that developed cavities
were summarily yankowitzed with a pair of what looked like industrial pliers.
 Adult teeth that needed repair were excavated with a low-speed mechanical
drill, then sterilized with carbolic acid, and filled with a mercury compound
that has over the years not doubt lowered my IQ by dozens or scores of points.
Dentistry was painful. No, it wasn't painful, it was torture.  Dr. Caress,
whose office was in the living room of his house on Rugby Road, had a big black
ugly mole on his left cheek. I studied that mole for many too many hours.

Sometime in my early teens I was sent to an orthodontist, Irving Pollack,
who had a very official suite of rooms in a high-rise on Joralemon Street, a
subway ride away.  I am grateful to him because, although he made a miserable
adolescence even more miserable, his "appliances" helped keep my mismatched,
askew anthology of teeth in my head.  In fact, I have all but one of them to
this day.

No thanks to my next dentist, T. Gorfein of Cambridge, Massachusetts, a genuine
criminal who asserted that I had twenty-two cavities and set out to fill them. I
left him after a couple of weeks, not because I was wise enough to suspect that
he was  a cheat, but because while he was working on me, he called over his
assistant and said -- genuine historical quote coming here -- "Would you look
at that sucker bleed."  At the university clinic, the dentist to whom I was
assigned could find only two cavities, which she (my first female practitioner)
painlessly filled. I must have had other dental experiences before Colorado's
Amiot and Johnson, both of whom were competent but both of whom insisted on
talking Republican nonsense to defenseless me while my mouth was filled with
equipment and fat fingers. Johnson left a crown too high, causing enormous pain;
searching for an alternative for his ham-handedness, I remembered that I had
bus-commuted with a dental student who seemed intelligent. She became a dentista
of high regard for many years until she took very early retirement from the
trade -- I never knew why. She sold her practice to another competent woman who
charges outrageous sky high prices for her services, but keeps me healthy.

So the score as we head into overtime:  one fake tooth, two root canal jobs,
a couple of tender spots, two unerupted wisdom teeth waiting to cause trouble,
but unabated ability to eat and enjoy corn on the cob. Nevertheless, lots of
residual Caress-caused nervousness every time I need to see someone in the tooth
business.

Title: My Swiss Cheese Brain
Date: December 03, 2010

As a youth, I could memorize poetry with great ease.  Nowadays, with a toe
into the water of my eighth decade, what was once a snap has become a
frustration.  But inasmuch as the authorities continually remind us geezers
that we need to keep the intelligence well-lubricated, I persist.  Yet it now
takes two or three hard weeks to memorize a speech in one of Shakespeare's
plays that, fifty years ago, I might have learned in less than an hour.

I've been trying to commit to the old brain Othello's magnificent speech about
wooing Desdemona -- the one with "antres vast and deserts idle" -- about which
I reported last week.   Instead of memorizing fluently and quickly, my swiss
cheese brain continually generates gaps, fissures and holes.  For example,
take this passage.

This to hear would Desdemona seriously incline

But still the house affairs would draw her thence

Which ever as she could with haste dispatch

She'd come again, and with a greedy ear

Devour up my discourse.

There's no reason why this sentence shouldn't be easy enough.  I read and
study it, but when I shut the book and try to recite, it comes up this way:

She'd come again and with a  greedy [empty space]

Devour up my discourse.

The word "ear" has evaporated, or rather fallen into the black hole of memory,
or gotten stuck in the synaptic link between two nerve cells.

I peer into the book once again and take a second crack.

She'd come again and with a greedy ear

Devour up my [empty space].

Ear appears, discourse disappears.  And so on through the thirty-two line
passages.  Nouns sink beneath the waves and then bob to the surface.  And
these lacunae occur again and again. And again.

It is fascinating to me that I retain the rhythm of the pentameter line and
that I always know that I am missing a two-syllable noun.  Nevertheless, the
precise word will not emerge -- at least at the moment that I need it.  But
it's there, coated with polysaccharides, lurking in an obscure empty space
behind a neuron.  It's astonishing that the words that disappear are almost
always nouns.  I have very little trouble with other parts of speech.  But
then noun- loss is a recognized characteristic of your "mature" brain.

Because it has taken so long to memorize, I have become extremely well-
acquainted with the speech.  Slow motion has its advantages.  Othello
tells us that Desdemona would come "with greedy ear [to] devour up [his]
discourse."  It wasn't until I had gone over that sentence a hundred
times that I realized that Shakespeare used "devour" to connect with the
"cannibals that do each other eat" in the earlier part of the speech.  It's
a purposeful comparison: while wandering and errant Othello encountered
anthropophagi, domestic Desdemona, confined to house affairs, was only able to
eat words.

Clever fellow, that Will S.

My first railroad (not subway) trip was in 1945 -- a New York Central train
from NYC to Glens Falls, New York.  I was dazzled but queasy;  it was
a coal-burning engine and the smoke was both visible and smellable.  I
spent my infant time looking out the window and studying the adjacent set
of tracks as they combined and separated -- a most vivid memory.  I was
born into a sedentary family and have no further recollection of being in
a train again until 1952 when Aunt Mollie took me to Washington. We ate
dinner on the train, a marvelous luxury.  in 1956, testing my adolescent
independence, I voyaged to Ithaca on the old Lehigh Valley R. R. (the
"Leaky V.), then in its dotage and quite seedy.  During the late 1950s,  I
occasionally rode up to Utica NY on the NY Central.  The round-trip fare
was an astonishingly steep $20.50, or half a week's work.  But afterwards
it was almost all automobiles.  I don't know that I was on a train again
until 1975-76, when I commuted weekly from Canterbury (second class with the
accompaniment of Cadbury chocolates) to Charing Cross station.  Calais
to Paris, 1976. I can remember also Lugano to Florence to Rome, c. 1990,
and Stockholm to Copenhagen a decade later.  NYC to DC, on Amtrak, many
times around the turn of the new millenium.  Not a great deal of train
travel, but then, as we all know, the railroads are a glorious but dying
institution, at least in the US.  Nor adventuresome either:  no Orient
Express or Trans-Siberian.  Planes?  My first trip was from NYC to Ithaca,
on a 12 seat Mohawk -- perhaps to this day my smallest plane and bumpiest
flight.  Many, many trips from Boston to NYC (Eastern Airlines), from Logan
to LaGuardia and back.  A dozen or so jumps across the water to Europe,
all of them accompanied with headaches and disorientation.  My longest so
far:  Denver to Port Elizabeth, South Africa.  To Hawaii and back. To San
Jose, Costa Rica.  Innumerable, far too many,  domestic flights from Denver
to NYC, Denver to Oakland, Denver to DC -- all highly routinized.  At first,
decades ago, flying was romantic;  dinner was served;  people dressed up for
the experience.  Now it's being sardined into a grudging Greyhound in the
sky, with bodyscans and shoe checks to boot.  And waste:  all that time and
money thrown into the sea looking for plastic explosives secreted in  my
retired-teacher/ grandpa orifices.

The word Greyhound reminds me those horrible 1950s trips (midnight to 8am)
from the Port Authority on 34th and 8th to Ithaca with "rest stops" in
East Stroudsburg and Scranton at 3am, with no food available except rancid
sandwiches from the slot machines.  I cannot shake the memory of the awful
smell of spoiled tuna, gas fumes, eructations and flatulence on those filthy
cramped buses.  Nor of the degenerate displaying his private parts in the
men's room in Hackettstown, New Jersey one slushy night.

But put me in a car on a two-lane anywhere west of the Mississippi, with no
particular place to go, and I'm one happy guy.

Cherry pie in Hannibal, Missouri or breakfast at the Jesse James Cafe in Casey,

It's been a Charles Dickens revival here.  The Dickens formula -- "make them
laugh, make them cry, make them wait" -- works as well for me now as it did
fifty years ago.

I was curious to fill in the gaps in my knowledge, so I trotted over to
the library and found a newish biography of Dickens.  It looked eminently
respectable:  St. Martin's Press and its author a "Professor of English
Studies" at the University of Stirling.

But youch, what a travesty the new "biography" turned out to be.

Here follow some sentences (none of which I've altered in the least) from
a book which has the temerity to call itself Charles Dickens, A Literary
Life.  Prepare yourself for pretention, bathos, meandering metaphors and
syntactic peculiarities marinated in post-modern obfuscation.  Savor these
monstrosities.

"'Dickens,' a convenient and perhaps unavoidable label, masks a range of
Dickenses, which, taken together, constitute a highly complex whole."

"In short, this book will attempt to separate out at least some of the
contextual forces that flowed through Dickens's pen along with the ink at the
moment when he sat down to the ostensibly solitary and private process of making
that series of black marks on white paper that we call novels."

"Suffering is a crucial part of the artistic process and the artist is seen as
quite different from the ordinary run of people through his possession of a
creative power akin to that of God in His creation of the world."

"This aspect of his career can be explored in a number of ways, in his deep
respect for his own activity as a novelist as well as in an intense concern
to extract his full pound of flesh financially from publishers and also, in a
sense, from the public."

"A dramatic opening and an exciting climax are desirable features of any
narrative, but the desire to impose them on historical narratives may distort
the flow that is an inherent aspect of historical process."

"But the facts and arguments of this chapter show that the point at which
Pickwick Papers came into being was one of turbulence in publishing which
carried with it, as periods of turbulence always do, possibilities of movement
in a variety of directions."

"The serial violates the decorum appropriate to high art and the imagery of the
passage embodies a distate of profusion which could be likened to a class-based
disdain for the crowded urban environment and dislike of such new-fangled
phenomena as the railway."

"Public school meant the classics and, in England, university spelled Oxford or
Cambridge, 'advantages' which Dickens conspicuously lacked."

I could wisecrack about each of the above sentences, but I'm in a more-in-
sorrow-than-in-anger frame of mind.   Why oh why do academics feel they have
to write this way?  Such woeful prose and trumpeting obviousness compromise
the reputations of sober scholars and teachers.

Does the author of this book realize that he's bamboozling himself?    Does
he know how ridiculous he is?

Title: Season's Greetings
Date: December 08, 2010

In the summer of 1963, we were somewhere in southern Illinios on our first
cross-country adventure (the first of many).  I was not an experienced
driver and the Nash Rambler was not a superb-handling car.  We were driving
a two-lane, and it was raining hard , and something happened (can't remember
what) that caused me to brake much too hard. The car spun out of control,
first swinging into the oncoming lane (empty, thank you very much) and then
rotating into a three or four foot ditch on the right side of the road.

I was grateful to be alive but I knew that I was in a predicament.  How to
get the Rambler back on the road?

Within a minute, a small truck pulled up behind me.  A hale-fellow Elks-Lions-
Rotary-Presbyterian kind of guy stepped out, assessed the situation, hitched a
cable to the Rambler and winched us out of the ditch.  Took him two minutes
max.  He said, "you OK?" and drove off.

Many thanks to that man.

In 1984, I had to fly from Lebanon, New Hampshire to Salt Lake City through
Boston.  We were fogged in at Lebanon and I didn't arrive at Logan until a few
minutes before my next leg was about to leave.  Logan consisted then (probably
still does) of half-a-dozen separate terminals linked by a bus line.  I
went up to a man in a uniform and I asked him where, in the jumble, would
I find Continental.  I told him that I had less than twenty minutes to
board.  He said, "wait right here.  I'll get you there on time."  He was
not a policeman, as I thought, but a uniformed chauffeur to some Rich Person. 
After a few minutes he returned, having launched his employer.  He took me
to his extra-long Cadillac limousine and speeded me to my terminal.

Many thanks to that man

And to all the other anonymous people who have helped me with life's travels
and travails.

Am I becoming sentimental?

Title: Favorite Garments,  A Lifetime List
Date: December 10, 2010

Sometime in the early 1950s I was given a great gift: a hand-knitted gray-and-
white Norwegian sweater. It may have been a bit too large for me, but I wore it
almost every day through high school and college and for many years thereafter.
True, it became a little ratty around the waist, but my mother-in-law, a skilled
knitter, was able to repair it, and did so, more than once. The leather elbow
patches were my own contribution, and if they were not exactly symmetrically
placed, so what?  I disagreed with those who felt that the beauty of the
garment was compromised by the vivid mustard stain on the right sleeve. I was
still wearing the sweater in the 1980s, when my daughter begged it. Of course
I gave it to her, but I now believe that she was in surreptitious league with
other members of my family to get the sweater out of my hands and off my back.
I've never seen her wear it.

It was in the 1970s that I received another gift of an important garment -- a
Guatemalan shirt -- a camisa -- of the sort worn in Todos Santos: a multicolored
embroidered --  or is it brocaded -- piece of fabric attached to a blue-and-
white striped shift that hung down to mid-thigh -- very convenient for use as
towel or hot cloth. I loved that shirt and wore it even to work. It's possible
that some people dismissed me as an eccentric or that others presumed that I
was making an anti-colonial statement, but in fact I just thought the shirt was
comfortable and handsome. I remember overhearing  a student -- one of the
brainless ones -- who hated college, hated literature, and hated me -- mumble
under his breath (in those days I could still hear), "Well, at least he's not a
dull dresser." I don't know what became of the camisa. I suspect that it was
desaparecida.

Another favorite garment was a yellow leather shirt jacket which I wore until
it shredded. This jacket ran into trouble on a cross-country trip when it was
packed on top of the car, under a canvas. It lay too close to a dyed leather
coat (not mine) and during a flash Nebraska rainstorm was thoroughly  soaked
and acquired a large purple stain. I didn't mind, because the stain was in
the back, but I bowed to social pressure and gave it up, which was a shame,
because I didn't get more than twenty years use out of it.  And then there
was that lovely orange-brown corduroy jacket that I bought at the Presbyterian
thrift store for $2.00. That was real beauty.  So was the tailored denim suit
coat which I have vainly tried to replace -- they just don't make them like
that any more.

Still another memorable garment: a green hooded cotton sweatshirt that, after I
had worn it for a decade or so, was nicely broken in. It had lots of wear left
in it, but I made the dreadful error of mentioning to  my daughter-in-law
that, wearing it, I had twice been taken for a homeless person. She snatched
the sweatshirt away from me and threw it into the garbage (I rescued it for
rags). She then immediately went out and bought me a perfectly lovely new
Carhartt hooded sweatshirt, very high quality, with a zipper and everything,
which I have worn every day during the cold months for two seasons and which
will, within a dozen or so years, no doubt become quite comfortable.

Title: Nineteenth-Century Vehicles Yet One More Time
Date: December 13, 2010

In order to illustrate the precarious social standing of Mr. Smouch, who takes
Pickwick into custody for debt, Dickens described his carriage as neither one
thing or another.

"The vehicle was not exactly a gig, neither was it a stanhope.  It was not what
is currently denominated a dog-cart, neither was it a taxed-cart, nor a chaise-
cart, nor a guillotined cabriolet;  and yet it had something of the character
of each and every of these machines.  It was painted a bright yellow, with
the shafts and wheels picked out in black, and the driver sat, in the orthodox
sporting style, on cushions piled about two feet above the rail.  The horse was
a bay, a well-looking animal enough;  but with something of the flash and dog-
fighting air about him, nevertheless, which accorded both the vehicle and his
master."

The original readers of Pickwick Papers would have known exactly what is meant
by a "guillotined cabriolet."  I suspect that there's a joke there, but the
joke has perished.  I certainly don't get it.

Is there also joke in "bright yellow?"  What is the usual color of a gig or
stanhope?

There might be all kinds of jokes in the following list of socially-
crepuscular horsedrawn vehicles, none of which precipitate hilarity, but
of which the sum amuses me greatly:  barouche, basket carriage, berlin,
britchka, brougham, buckboard, buggy, cabriolet, caleche, cariole, carryall,
chaise, chariot, clarence, concord wagon, coupe, croydon, curricle, cutter,
daumont, dearborn, dennet, diligence, dog-cart, fiacre, fly, fourgon,
four-wheeler, gig, go-cart, governess cart, hansom, herdic, jaunty car,
jersey-wagon, kibitka, landau, patache, phaeton, pill-box, post-chaise,
rockaway, shandrydan, shay, sociable, spider-phaeton, spring-van, stanhope,
sulky, surrey, T-cart, telyezhka, tilbury, tarantass, trap, troika, victoria,
vis-a-vis, wagonette, and wurt.

Title: What We Watched in the Fifties:  Rebel Without a Cause (1955)
Date: December 20, 2010

I watched Rebel Without A Cause last night in a state of constant twitching
puzzlement.  Why has this film become a cult classic?  How can we account
for the iconic appeal of James Dean, who moves me not the least bit?  How did
thirty-five-year-olds manage to pass for high school kids in 50s movies?  Why,
in those ancient days, did every male seem to wear a tie and jacket round the
clock?

The movie seemed like a period piece, dug up from some archive  --  which
is odd, because I was 16 and a high school student in 1955 when Rebel
Without a Cause was released.  It should have spoken to me then, or now.  But
didn't and doesn't, not a bit.

The Eisenhower decade was the great age of suburban "juvenile delinquency,"
so- called.  What do these kids want?  They all have their expensive cars and
the war is over.  The teen-agers, all of them, are utterly inarticulate. 
They're also shockingly unfeeling.  When Buzz Gunderson dies in the "chickie
run," he is not mourned, even for a femtosecond, and within a few hours, his
girlfriend Judy has fallen in love with Buzz's rival, Jim Stark.

Nor, in this film, is the adult generation is any more admirable -- the wives
and mothers are shrews, the men grotesquely henpecked.  The film has a strong
gay subtext throughout -- most apparent in the Jim Stark-Plato relationship. 
I'm sure that I wouldn't have noticed it in 1955, but it kind of jumps at you
nowadays.

1950s juvenile delinquents came in two categories:  urban deprived and rich
suburban alienated.  I was of neither one class nor the other.  True that we
had to be constantly on our toes to keep clear of the one group, but the other
(those depicted in this film) might just as well have been living on another
planet.

A dangerous planet, as it turned out, for the makers of Rebel Without a Cause. 
James Dean was already dead when the film was released, having been killed in an
automobile accident.  Sal Mineo was murdered in 1976.  Natalie Wood, drunk,
drowned in 1981.  Nick Adams died of a drug overdose in 1968.  The film's
talented director, Nicholas Ray, discovered his wife, Gloria Grahame, in bed
with his thirteen-year-old son, whom she later married.  Ray died prematurely
of drugs and alcohol.

Title: Every Directional Dyslexic's Worst Nightmare
Date: December 21, 2010

In Pickwick Papers, Pickwick checks into the Great White Horse Inn in
Ipswich, is shown to his room by a chamber-maid only to discover that he's
left his watch downstairs.  He retrieves it but then cannot find his way back
to his room.  He's utterly, hopelessly lost. "Rows of doors... branched off
in every possible direction.  A dozen times did he softly turn the handle of
some bed- room door which resembled his own, when a gruff cry from within of
"Who the devil's that" caused him to steal away....  He was reduced to the
verge of despair when an open door attracted his attention.  He peeped in....
There were the two beds, whose situation he perfectly remembered."  Pickwick
steps inside and has removed his clothes when another person enters the room. 
He conceals himself.  Bad turns to worse.  "Mr. Pickwick almost fainted with
horror and dismay.  Standing before the dressing-glass was a middle-aged woman
in yellow curl-papers, busily engaged in brushing her hair....    'I never
met with anything so awful as this,' thought Mr. Pickwick, 'what a dreadful
thing.'  Uncertain how to proceed, Pickwick 'ha-hums.'  "Gracious Heaven!"
said the middle-aged lady, "what's that?"  "It's -- it's -- only a gentleman,
ma'am."  "A gentleman!" said the lady, with a terrific scream.  "It's all
over!" thought Mr. Pickwick."

The expected complications ensue.  At last, Pickwick flees, carrying his
clothes and dropping his shoes.  But the nightmare continues because he still
can't locate his assigned chamber.  Fortunately, he runs into his servant, Mr.
Samuel Weller, who escorts him back home.

Clearly, Mr. Pickwick is directionally disabled.

Am I the only directionally-challenged person for whom Pickwick's story is a
horrible fear.  I've had repeated nightmares of exactly this complexion.  In
fact, I've dreamed this very dream dozens, perhaps scores of times.  I check
into a hotel, go for a walk in a strange city and then, for some reason, the
elevator doesn't go to my floor, or the staircase comes to a sudden end, or the
room numbers go from 401 to 405 when I know that my room is 403.  I wander
endlessly until I wake up in a sweat, heart pounding.

And now I have to admit that I once narrowly dodged this embarrassment.  In
real life.  I was staying at a bed-and-breakfast somewhere in the west of
Ireland.  There was no private bathroom -- the facilities were down the hall
and a half a flight downstairs.  In the middle of the night, after obeying a
call of nature, attempting to return to my room, I stepped into a room that
was not mine.  I was just about to get into bed with a strange party when I
realized my predicament.  Fortunately, I was able to escape without waking
anyone.  I found my own room (good thing there were only two to a floor) but I
was in quite a state for an hour or so.

As I'm writing this, I'm guessing that most of my readers will harrumph their
feelings of superiority.  "Couldn't happen to me." My directionally dyslexic
friends, however, will understand.  And they will also know why I sympathize
and empathize with poor Pickwick.

Title: Secession Nostalgia
Date: December 22, 2010

The Sons of Confederate Veterans celebrated themselves with a $100-per-person
Secession Ball on Dec. 20 in Gaillard Municipal Auditorium in Charleston. 
The event centered on a play highlighting key moments from the signing of
South Carolina’s Ordinance of Secession 150 years ago.  Jeff Antley, who
organized the event, said that the Secession Ball honors South Carolinians who
stood up for their rights.  “The secession movement in South Carolina was a
demonstration of freedom,” said Antley. “What I’m doing is honoring the
men from this state who stood up for their self-government and their rights
under law."

Is the act of secesion a "demonstration of freedom?"  What sort of freedom? 
Let us now read from South Carolina's Articles of Secession, which asserts that
the federal government has impinged upon states' rights.

"The right of property in slaves was recognized [under the Constitution] by
giving to free persons distinct political rights, by giving them the right to
represent, and burthening them with direct taxes for three-fifths of their
slaves; by authorizing the importation of slaves for twenty years; and by
stipulating for the rendition of fugitives from labor. We affirm that these ends
for which this Government was instituted have been defeated, and the Government
itself has been made destructive of them by the action of the non-slaveholding
States. Those States have assumed the right of deciding upon the propriety of
our domestic institutions; and have denied the rights of property established in
fifteen of the States and recognized by the Constitution; they have denounced
as sinful the institution of slavery; they have permitted open establishment
among them of societies, whose avowed object is to disturb the peace and to
eloign the property of the citizens of other States. They have encouraged and
assisted thousands of our slaves to leave their homes; and those who remain,
have been incited by emissaries, books and pictures to servile insurrection. For
twenty- five years this agitation has been steadily increasing, until it has now
secured to its aid the power of the common Government. Observing the forms of
the Constitution, a sectional party has found within that Article establishing
the Executive Department, the means of subverting the Constitution itself. A
geographical line has been drawn across the Union, and all the States north of
that line have united in the election of a man to the high office of President
of the United States, whose opinions and purposes are hostile to slavery. He is
to be entrusted with the administration of the common Government, because he has
declared that that "Government cannot endure permanently half slave, half free,"
and that the public mind must rest in the belief that slavery is in the course
of ultimate extinction. This sectional combination for the submersion of the
Constitution, has been aided in some of the States by elevating to citizenship,
persons who, by the supreme law of the land, are incapable of becoming citizens;
and their votes have been used to inaugurate a new policy, hostile to the South,
and destructive of its beliefs and safety."

Yes, it's true.  Citizens of some states have not captured fugitive slaves or
returned them to their owners, have denounced slavery as sinful, have elected
a president who is hostile to the "peculiar institution," and have (horror of
horrors! even granted citizenship to former slaves.

The South Carolina document is extraordinarily clear.  Can anyone fairly doubt
that there would have been no secession and therefore no need for a Secession
Ball except in defense of slavery?  The "demonstration of freedom" is nothing
more than a celebration of the  freedom of one person to own another.

Nowadays, when slavery is no longer defensible, "conservative" South Carolinians
are reduced to protecting their guaranteed right to make life difficult
for gays and immigrants.  And keep women in their places.  A far cry from
their glorious past.

But they continue to nurture that nostalgia for the great old antebellum
days.

Title: What Have We Come To?
Date: December 31, 2010

Just back from the post office, where I mailed the granddaughter her gift, a
zester. What is a zester, you ask?  It's a kitchen device designed to remove
the "zest," that is, the outermost skin of a citrus fruit.  The granddaughter's
zester is an inch and a half wide and thirteen inches long, including its five
inch handle. Essentially, it's a hand-held grater, very useful if you're a
cooking enthusiast. And why, you ask, would I venture out in 15F, snowy weather
to mail the zester to California, when the grand-daughter could have put it in
her backpack when she returned home? Because, I was creditably advised, the
zester would certainly be confiscated by airport security.

What have we come to, when, rightly or wrongly, we seriously entertain the
idea that an eleven-year-old child could hijack an airplane armed only with a
zester?  What would she do, abrade the pilot to death?

Title: Cornell English Then and Now -- 1
Date: April 22, 2025

Here's a truth that blows my freakin' mind: since I earned my B. A. in English
from Cornell University in 1960, sixty-five years have come and gone. Glaciers
have melted and rivers have changed their course since, way back when, in a
prior millennium, I was first introduced to serious literature -- to Chaucer and
Milton and George Eliot.

My professors in those far-away-and-long-ago days were exclusively male and for
the most part veterans of WW2 or the Korean war. They wrote definitive scholarly
articles for the Philological Quarterly or for Modern Philology; they published
learned monographs on canonical poets and novelists; and they taught courses
with such forthright titles as The Seventeenth Century and Wordsworth and
Coleridge. Although I was an indifferent student before I arrived at Cornell,
I found an intellectual home in the Department of English. Inasmuch as I did
not have a brain for rigorous science or for the tough analytic philosophy that
was then in fashion, I was fortunate that the work of English suited my limited
abilities -- curiosity, patience, a good memory, and something of a feel for
language.

Just yesterday (and what, pray tell, prompted me?), I took a peek at the
current website of Cornell's English Department. (In the index-card 1950s, when
the manual typewriter was the acme of technology, the word "website" would
have signified a dark corner colonized by spiders.) Even at first glance, the
2025 Cornell website said to me "very very different, very 'now'." While an
occasional word or phrase was recognizable, it was the novelty -- the modernity,
I guess -- that flared from the electronic page and dazzled mine eyne. Time
marches on, no doubt, but whether it marches boldly forward or plunges over a
cliff remains to be established.

First of all, it's no longer the Department of English. It's now, hurrah!,
the "Department of Literatures in English." What a welcome redefinition --
an assertion that English is a world language and that it houses a world
literature. Nowadays, if I sit down with a work of fiction, I'm just as likely
to read a novel by a writer from Africa or India or Australia as one from the
British isles or North America. There's not a reason in the world why Chinua
Achebe or Abdulrazak Gurnah should not be studied in an English Department. I
respect this shift in focus and I regret that my 1950s Beowulf-to-T. S. Eliot
English department was so parochial, so provincial. I can only admire the fact
that the Department of Literatures in English has annexed to itself whole
continents of writing -- a case of academic imperialism that this time seems
wholly right and just.

The website also reveals that, in a nation in which the study of the humanities
in higher education is at risk, Cornell's English is a huge thriving enterprise.
There are fifty-one people on permanent staff, almost all of professorial
rank. Of this number, twenty-seven -- or slightly more than half -- are women.
And among those pictured on the site, a significant number are "of color."
Undoubtedly, the present department is a far more representative collection of
individuals than my 1950s faculty. Moreover, the chair, the associate chair,
the director of undergraduate studies, the director of graduate students, and
the director of writing are all women. It may once have been the case that the
occasional female interloper was a token for display only, but not so now.

And what do these handsome and distinguished men and women study? Fortunately
for me, members of the faculty list their areas of concentration. Most claim
two or three specialties, some as many as five; a few recalcitrant individuals
list none, leaving me to wonder whether they are polymaths or just ornery
uncooperative academics. Among the fifty-one, the single expertise most commonly
claimed is "cultural studies." This preponderance set me back a bit, because
"cultural studies" is not a term I recognize nor one that existed, as far as I
know, in the 1950s, when the word "culture" was synonymous with "civilization"
-- sometimes just Western Civilization -- and when "cultured" meant something
equivalent to "educated" and possibly even "socially established." But now,
apparently, "cultural studies" is, and I quote a respected source, "an academic
field  that... investigates how cultural practices relate to wider systems of
power. These include ideology, class structures, national formations, ethnicity,
sexual orientation and gender." Am I correct, and is it possible, for me to
infer from this litany of nouns that "cultural practices" comprehends just about
everything that we as a society say or do? Clearly the Department of Literatures
in English lays claim to a heck of a lot of intellectual territory -- and that
it is a far more aggressive entity than is revealed by its mere absorption of
Anglophone novels. I was initially suspicious of these extensive claims, but
after reflecting a while I recognized that, if I set to one side the self-
aggrandizing listing of ideology, ethnicity, class... etc,), cultural studies
may in practice simply bring to the forefront such elements as imperialism and
nationhood in Robinson Crusoe or race and gender in Othello. Wouldn't it be
comforting if "cultural studies" is at least in part merely traditional wine in
spiffy new bottles? I, for one, certainly hope so.

After cultural studies, it is "literary theory" that claims the largest group
of adherents -- thirteen, or about a quarter of the faculty. This revelation
surprised me because I would have guessed that "theory" had long since gone the
way of the aurochs and the mouflon. "Theory" had its herd of enthusiasts in its
obscurantist heyday in the last century, yet it seems to be alive and kicking at
Cornell -- but only, I suspect, as a vestigial remnant of an earlier time and
only among the more senior members of the Department.

Following "theory" in popularity among the professoriate are the seven members
who stake their claim to "gender studies." Six other say "African-American." The
nine who announce a specialty in creative writing may not know that they are the
successors and the beneficiaries of the late revered Professor James McConkey.
Not a single member of the faculty offers "Shakespeare" or "Milton" as an area
of expertise. I do not doubt that the study of gender and African-American and
Asian-American literatures is a good thing, but I would have wished that the
authors of the finest works of art in all of Anglophonia be accorded equivalent
attention and status.

Would a reincarnated Youthful Me elect take a degree from such a faculty? 
I'm skeptical, but I can't say for sure because I don't know whether or not,
in the classroom, the scrupulous examination of literature and ideas has been
undermined by transitory and faddish ideologies. I must confess that the biases
of the website make me feel old and wary and out of touch. And tired.

Well then, what does take place in the classroom?

Let's sample some evidence.

In days of yore, I enrolled in "Elizabethan and Jacobean Drama," a course taught
by the distinguished scholar and teacher David Novarr. The course was organized
as a chronological march from Kyd and Marlowe in the 1580s right through to Ford
and Massinger -- the last playwrights of significance before the theaters went
dark in 1642. I remember savoring some delightful comedies by Ben Jonson and
Francis Beaumont and also a couple of ferociously brilliant tragedies by Thomas
Middleton -- writings, I suspect, that 2020s English majors are not destined
to encounter -- even though an acquaintance with these plays is essential
background for understanding the timeless works of Shakespeare.

There's no equivalent course in the present curriculum, but there is an
analogue, and it appears in the catalogue of offerings thusly:

ENGL 3240. Blood Politics:  Comparative Renaissance Drama

Blood is everywhere. From vampire shows to video games, our culture seems to be
obsessed with it. The course examines the power of "blood" in the early modern
period as a figure that continues to capture our imagination, not only as a
marker of racial, religious, and sexual difference and desire, but also as a
dramatic player in its own right. How does a politics of blood appear on stage
when populations are being expelled and colonized for reasons (mis)understood in
terms of blood?.... Topics include honor, revenge, purity, the body, sexuality,
conversion, and death.

The course description itself is a mess -- both incomprehensible and
meretricious. I'm shocked by the catchpenny pandering. Do 2020s teachers need to
lure students into their classrooms with "vampires" and "videos?" The assertion
that "blood is a dramatic player in its own right" is nonsense. The description
reads like advertising copy for a cheesy low-budget horror flick playing at some
louche all-night grind house.

Moreover, "blood" isn't "everywhere." Goodness gracious!

I'm afraid that these entrancing plays are doomed to be put through the
"cultural studies" homogenizer. Or "theorized" out of all compass.

Ah, well.

Back in 1960, I had a summer job in Ithaca and therefore happened to be loafing
around the campus when the University hosted its returning alumni. Among the
returnees were the old folks  -- some few of them members of the class of
1895 -- who had walkered and wheel-chaired to their Sixty-Fifth. Geezers, I
thought. It's sobering to realize that those codgers were the same age -- 86 --
as I am now. Should I  return to Ithaca this coming spring, for my very own
Sixty-Fifth, I will be perceived by the young 'uns exactly as I observed those
Class of 1895 guys: as ancient and irrelevant.

It follows, therefore, that my reservations about the 2025 English curriculum
have their exact parallel in the 1895ers perspective on my 1960 curriculum. It's
not hard to imagine that they -- I mean the members of the class of 1895 --
who had been educated in elocution and Old Norse, would have been shocked and
perhaps outraged by the 1950s "modern" curriculum that I found so enticing and
illuminating.

And now, because I don't want to go full curmudgeon and become the kind of
superannuated guy who shakes his ebony stick at the modern world and deplores
the decline of civilization, I'm going to make an effort to find out what's
really going on in 2025. I have therefore set myself the task of reading a
representative sample of the books written by members of the present-day English
faculty.

I'll report on my studies right here.

Stay tuned.

[January 18] Bernhard Starr writes:  "Vivian, you are right about the course
description. It's a disgrace. It's badly written and ridiculous. Why didn't you
include the name of the prof. who wrote it?  He/she needs to be exposed. What
"populations are being expelled and colonized" by Volpone or The Changeling? 
And did you look other course descriptions -- are they equally silly?  What's
worst about the course description is that it doesn't respect the plays that the
class is going to examine. They're not important interesting dramas to the
teacher -- they're just fodder for an ideology.

[January 19] Vivian de St. Vrain replies: "Mr. Starr, I didn't identify the
author of the course description because the website doesn't identify him/her.
Just as well. Also, I didn't read other course descriptions though I might do so
in the future. I think you're correct that the course description does not
respect the dramas or their authors. Which is, as you suggest, mighty
disappointing."

[January 19] Bernhard Starr replies:  "I think I'd rather study Old Norse."

[February 4] Thurston Dale replies:  "I guess I'm a geezer, too (Cornell, '65).
I'm glad I majored in English before criticism turned crazy. Great teachers --
Mizener, Abrams, Parrish, Novarr."

[March 17] Anatole Miles Webber writes: "Vivian, you were naive back in the
1950s and you're still naive now. You assume that the Cornell English Department
of your youth, 65 years ago, was normative and normal. You were then and still
are oblivious to the fact that the Department's 1950 curriculum was the product
of stress and change and compromise. Try to remember that there were at least
three forces at work and that various faculty members had various degrees of
commitment to them. The first group was the oldest -- the traditionalist who
studied, as they had always done, literature as history and biography and
philology. Get the text and the context right was their primary concern. Then
there were the 'new critics" -- heirs to Leavis and Scrutiny in England and the
southern agrarians (Ransom, Tate, Warren) in the US. But the main intellectual
current riling English Departments were the fierce critics out of New York
(mostly Jewish) circles (Kazin, Trilling, Fiedler, Paul Goodman, Irving Howe,
etc). In retrospect, even though Cornell brought both Lionel Trilling and
Cleanth Brooks to Ithaca during your and my years there, the new winds made
little impression on our education. Cornell was peaceful, isolated and non-
ideological. It appears from your writing that you preferred it that way and
still do. It was stable until the theory people brought in novelty and confusion
and excitement.

Title: Cornell English Then and Now -- 1
Date: April 22, 2025

Here's a truth that blows my freakin' mind: since I earned my B. A. in English
from Cornell University in 1960, sixty-five years have come and gone. Glaciers
have melted and rivers have changed their course since, way back when, in a
prior millennium, I was first introduced to serious literature -- to Chaucer and
Milton and George Eliot.

My professors in those far-away-and-long-ago days were exclusively male and for
the most part veterans of WW2 or the Korean war. They wrote definitive scholarly
articles for the Philological Quarterly or for Modern Philology; they published
learned monographs on canonical poets and novelists; and they taught courses
with such forthright titles as The Seventeenth Century and Wordsworth and
Coleridge. Although I was an indifferent student before I arrived at Cornell,
I found an intellectual home in the Department of English. Inasmuch as I did
not have a brain for rigorous science or for the tough analytic philosophy that
was then in fashion, I was fortunate that the work of English suited my limited
abilities -- curiosity, patience, a good memory, and something of a feel for
language.

Just yesterday (and what, pray tell, prompted me?), I took a peek at the
current website of Cornell's English Department. (In the index-card 1950s, when
the manual typewriter was the acme of technology, the word "website" would
have signified a dark corner colonized by spiders.) Even at first glance, the
2025 Cornell website said to me "very very different, very 'now'." While an
occasional word or phrase was recognizable, it was the novelty -- the modernity,
I guess -- that flared from the electronic page and dazzled mine eyne. Time
marches on, no doubt, but whether it marches boldly forward or plunges over a
cliff remains to be established.

First of all, it's no longer the Department of English. It's now, hurrah!,
the "Department of Literatures in English." What a welcome redefinition --
an assertion that English is a world language and that it houses a world
literature. Nowadays, if I sit down with a work of fiction, I'm just as likely
to read a novel by a writer from Africa or India or Australia as one from the
British isles or North America. There's not a reason in the world why Chinua
Achebe or Abdulrazak Gurnah should not be studied in an English Department. I
respect this shift in focus and I regret that my 1950s Beowulf-to-T. S. Eliot
English department was so parochial, so provincial. I can only admire the fact
that the Department of Literatures in English has annexed to itself whole
continents of writing -- a case of academic imperialism that this time seems
wholly right and just.

The website also reveals that, in a nation in which the study of the humanities
in higher education is at risk, Cornell's English is a huge thriving enterprise.
There are fifty-one people on permanent staff, almost all of professorial
rank. Of this number, twenty-seven -- or slightly more than half -- are women.
And among those pictured on the site, a significant number are "of color."
Undoubtedly, the present department is a far more representative collection of
individuals than my 1950s faculty. Moreover, the chair, the associate chair,
the director of undergraduate studies, the director of graduate students, and
the director of writing are all women. It may once have been the case that the
occasional female interloper was a token for display only, but not so now.

And what do these handsome and distinguished men and women study? Fortunately
for me, members of the faculty list their areas of concentration. Most claim
two or three specialties, some as many as five; a few recalcitrant individuals
list none, leaving me to wonder whether they are polymaths or just ornery
uncooperative academics. Among the fifty-one, the single expertise most commonly
claimed is "cultural studies." This preponderance set me back a bit, because
"cultural studies" is not a term I recognize nor one that existed, as far as I
know, in the 1950s, when the word "culture" was synonymous with "civilization"
-- sometimes just Western Civilization -- and when "cultured" meant something
equivalent to "educated" and possibly even "socially established." But now,
apparently, "cultural studies" is, and I quote a respected source, "an academic
field  that... investigates how cultural practices relate to wider systems of
power. These include ideology, class structures, national formations, ethnicity,
sexual orientation and gender." Am I correct, and is it possible, for me to
infer from this litany of nouns that "cultural practices" comprehends just about
everything that we as a society say or do? Clearly the Department of Literatures
in English lays claim to a heck of a lot of intellectual territory -- and that
it is a far more aggressive entity than is revealed by its mere absorption of
Anglophone novels. I was initially suspicious of these extensive claims, but
after reflecting a while I recognized that, if I set to one side the self-
aggrandizing listing of ideology, ethnicity, class... etc,), cultural studies
may in practice simply bring to the forefront such elements as imperialism and
nationhood in Robinson Crusoe or race and gender in Othello. Wouldn't it be
comforting if "cultural studies" is at least in part merely traditional wine in
spiffy new bottles? I, for one, certainly hope so.

After cultural studies, it is "literary theory" that claims the largest group
of adherents -- thirteen, or about a quarter of the faculty. This revelation
surprised me because I would have guessed that "theory" had long since gone the
way of the aurochs and the mouflon. "Theory" had its herd of enthusiasts in its
obscurantist heyday in the last century, yet it seems to be alive and kicking at
Cornell -- but only, I suspect, as a vestigial remnant of an earlier time and
only among the more senior members of the Department.

Following "theory" in popularity among the professoriate are the seven members
who stake their claim to "gender studies." Six other say "African-American." The
nine who announce a specialty in creative writing may not know that they are the
successors and the beneficiaries of the late revered Professor James McConkey.
Not a single member of the faculty offers "Shakespeare" or "Milton" as an area
of expertise. I do not doubt that the study of gender and African-American and
Asian-American literatures is a good thing, but I would have wished that the
authors of the finest works of art in all of Anglophonia be accorded equivalent
attention and status.

Would a reincarnated Youthful Me elect take a degree from such a faculty? 
I'm skeptical, but I can't say for sure because I don't know whether or not,
in the classroom, the scrupulous examination of literature and ideas has been
undermined by transitory and faddish ideologies. I must confess that the biases
of the website make me feel old and wary and out of touch. And tired.

Well then, what does take place in the classroom?

Let's sample some evidence.

In days of yore, I enrolled in "Elizabethan and Jacobean Drama," a course taught
by the distinguished scholar and teacher David Novarr. The course was organized
as a chronological march from Kyd and Marlowe in the 1580s right through to Ford
and Massinger -- the last playwrights of significance before the theaters went
dark in 1642. I remember savoring some delightful comedies by Ben Jonson and
Francis Beaumont and also a couple of ferociously brilliant tragedies by Thomas
Middleton -- writings, I suspect, that 2020s English majors are not destined
to encounter -- even though an acquaintance with these plays is essential
background for understanding the timeless works of Shakespeare.

There's no equivalent course in the present curriculum, but there is an
analogue, and it appears in the catalogue of offerings thusly:

ENGL 3240. Blood Politics:  Comparative Renaissance Drama

Blood is everywhere. From vampire shows to video games, our culture seems to be
obsessed with it. The course examines the power of "blood" in the early modern
period as a figure that continues to capture our imagination, not only as a
marker of racial, religious, and sexual difference and desire, but also as a
dramatic player in its own right. How does a politics of blood appear on stage
when populations are being expelled and colonized for reasons (mis)understood in
terms of blood?.... Topics include honor, revenge, purity, the body, sexuality,
conversion, and death.

The course description itself is a mess -- both incomprehensible and
meretricious. I'm shocked by the catchpenny pandering. Do 2020s teachers need to
lure students into their classrooms with "vampires" and "videos?" The assertion
that "blood is a dramatic player in its own right" is nonsense. The description
reads like advertising copy for a cheesy low-budget horror flick playing at some
louche all-night grind house.

Moreover, "blood" isn't "everywhere." Goodness gracious!

I'm afraid that these entrancing plays are doomed to be put through the
"cultural studies" homogenizer. Or "theorized" out of all compass.

Ah, well.

Back in 1960, I had a summer job in Ithaca and therefore happened to be loafing
around the campus when the University hosted its returning alumni. Among the
returnees were the old folks  -- some few of them members of the class of
1895 -- who had walkered and wheel-chaired to their Sixty-Fifth. Geezers, I
thought. It's sobering to realize that those codgers were the same age -- 86 --
as I am now. Should I  return to Ithaca this coming spring, for my very own
Sixty-Fifth, I will be perceived by the young 'uns exactly as I observed those
Class of 1895 guys: as ancient and irrelevant.

It follows, therefore, that my reservations about the 2025 English curriculum
have their exact parallel in the 1895ers perspective on my 1960 curriculum. It's
not hard to imagine that they -- I mean the members of the class of 1895 --
who had been educated in elocution and Old Norse, would have been shocked and
perhaps outraged by the 1950s "modern" curriculum that I found so enticing and
illuminating.

And now, because I don't want to go full curmudgeon and become the kind of
superannuated guy who shakes his ebony stick at the modern world and deplores
the decline of civilization, I'm going to make an effort to find out what's
really going on in 2025. I have therefore set myself the task of reading a
representative sample of the books written by members of the present-day English
faculty.

I'll report on my studies right here.

Stay tuned.

[January 18] Bernhard Starr writes:  "Vivian, you are right about the course
description. It's a disgrace. It's badly written and ridiculous. Why didn't you
include the name of the prof. who wrote it?  He/she needs to be exposed. What
"populations are being expelled and colonized" by Volpone or The Changeling? 
And did you look other course descriptions -- are they equally silly?  What's
worst about the course description is that it doesn't respect the plays that the
class is going to examine. They're not important interesting dramas to the
teacher -- they're just fodder for an ideology.

[January 19] Vivian de St. Vrain replies: "Mr. Starr, I didn't identify the
author of the course description because the website doesn't identify him/her.
Just as well. Also, I didn't read other course descriptions though I might do so
in the future. I think you're correct that the course description does not
respect the dramas or their authors. Which is, as you suggest, mighty
disappointing."

[January 19] Bernhard Starr replies:  "I think I'd rather study Old Norse."

[February 4] Thurston Dale replies:  "I guess I'm a geezer, too (Cornell, '65).
I'm glad I majored in English before criticism turned crazy. Great teachers --
Mizener, Abrams, Parrish, Novarr."

[March 17] Anatole Miles Webber writes: "Vivian, you were naive back in the
1950s and you're still naive now. You assume that the Cornell English Department
of your youth, 65 years ago, was normative and normal. You were then and still
are oblivious to the fact that the Department's 1950 curriculum was the product
of stress and change and compromise. Try to remember that there were at least
three forces at work and that various faculty members had various degrees of
commitment to them. The first group was the oldest -- the traditionalist who
