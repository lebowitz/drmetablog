Title: "I could have been a better prairie dog"
Date: January 03, 2020

In a lifetime with pen in hand  or with fingers at the typewriter (or,
latterly, at the word processor), I've written a lot of bad sentences and a
handful of good ones. But last week, I composed my absolute best sentence ever.
It's pure Olympic gold; a bottom-of-the-ninth walk-off bases-loaded HR; a
sensational buzzer-beater. Deathless prose.

Let us pause to savor this extraordinary sentence. "I could have been a better
prairie dog."

Aficionados of Vivian de St. Vrain (fit audience, though few) will remember that
this mellifluous sentence appeared just a few days ago, right here. You can
appreciate it in context, if you will, but heck, the sentence stands alone.

It is beautiful in itself but one can only marvel at its delicate but meaningful
irony. Moreover, (bonus) it's near-perfect iambic pentameter.

It's become, for me, a mantra of sorts. Whenever I start to bemoan my fate, or
deplore my state, or bother myself over some missed opportunity or long-ago
failure, I mumble, "I could have been a better prairie dog."  And I immediately
regain perspective. So it's a sentence that's utile as well as dulce -- as
useful as it is sweet. Classic.

I'm absolutely confident that "I could have been a better prairie dog" will
help me through episodes of middle-of-the-night self-laceration. In fact, it's
working just as I write this.

Title: Slavery in Brooklyn, Oh No!
Date: January 05, 2020

Of all human institutions, slavery must be the most loathsome and soul-
distorting (although wars, genocides, massacres, pogroms, and wrongful
executions are certainly contenders for worst of worst).

It's easy to think that slavery is something ancient and foreign. Not something
to concern ourselves about -- not part our life, nor my life. And yet American
slavery was only eighty years into the past -- the blink of an eye -- when I was
growing up in the 1940s in Flatbush. At P.S 217 or at Erasmus Hall, neither our
textbooks nor our teachers made much of its recency. Slavery was not our past;
not here, not in Flatbush. It was a crime of the distant South -- of Mississippi
and Alabama, long ago. In the land of cotton, not the land of Coney Island and
Jackie Robinson. Slavery was distant chronologically and geographically.

What an unpleasant revelation, then, to encounter the story of Flatbush slavery
in Thomas J. Campanella's painstaking and eloquent history, Brooklyn, The Once
and Future City (Princeton, 2019).

The facts: "slavery was an essential element of New York life in the 17th and
18th centuries." "Only Charleston, South Carolina surpassed New York (i.e.
Manhattan) in the number of enslaved residents." Campanella reports that there
was "no place in New York that had more slaves per capita than Kings county,
where one in three residents was in bonded servitude." One in three? In my
neighborhood?  How could we not have known this?  How have we remained
oblivious?

Slavery, I now learn, was especially established in "Dutch towns like New
Utrecht, where 75 percent of white households owned slaves." And also "in
Midwout [our Midwood] where African-Americans constituted 41 percent of the
population in 1790."

In 1790, the population of the town of Flatbush -- my Flatbush -- included 378
enslaved people, 12 free black people, and 551 white people – 75% of whom
were slaveholders.The farmers of Brooklyn "formed a Southern planter class in
miniature."

And it was the farmlands of Brooklyn -- Flatbush, Flatlands, Gravesend, and New
Utrecht -- that supplied Manhattan with grain and fruits and vegetables raised
with slave labor. No slaves, no Brooklyn; no Brooklyn, no Big Apple.

In 1799, the New York state legislature passed the Gradual Manumission Act:
all children born of slave women after July 4 were to be free though they must
remain indentured to their masters until the age of twenty-five for women and 28
for men. Though it seems a weak and toothless compromise, the new laws led to
the rapid decline of slavery. In 1827, one hundred and ninety-three years ago,
slavery was declared illegal in New York. (Vermont, to its credit, had abolished
slavery two generations before, in 1777).

Here's a Brooklyn bill of sale for "one certain neger girl called Anna" to Jan
Lefferts for thirty-eight pounds. Her owner, Gilleyam Cornel, was illiterate. He
signed with "his mark."

From what I've learned in the past about the history of Brooklyn, and with these
revelations, it's undeniable that the haunts of my childhood (East 9 Street, P.
S. 217, St. Rose of Lima, Newkirk Station), were not very long ago farmed with
slave labor. It's horrible and disillusioning, but it must be acknowledged.

Title: Sleep, difficulty with
Date: January 09, 2020

The hardest part of my day is the night. Sleep does not come easy -- has never
come easy. I regularly wake at 2:00 am, and stay awake for two or three hours.
I use this time to fret about the state of the Earth (precarious), the state of
the nation (doomed), and whether that new black spot on my left ankle will lead
to agonizing death, or perhaps (best case scenario) merely to amputation at the
hip. I then sleep fitfully until dawn, the last hours of the night crowded with
grotesque, humiliating nightmares, worse by a long shot than anything Gregor
Samsa could possibly imagine.

Last night, up again, I experienced a moment of clarity -- a revelation, an
epiphany. Here it comes:

My mattress is just the right degree of firmness -- I sleep neither on the hard
earth nor on a gunny sack of corn husks. My blankets are soft Egyptian cotton
-- not leaves or newspapers. I rest my head on an authentic goose-down pillow.
There are no rats scrabbling under my bed, no poisonous spiders descending
from the ceiling, no lions roaring outside the door. No bedbugs or parasites
or mosquitoes or scorpions. I'm dry and warm. The temperature of my bedroom
is well-regulated: forced air heat in the winter, cooling breezes or air
conditioning in the summer. I'm well fed, not kept awake by gnawing hunger. No
noxious smells or hideous shrieks. No pains, cramps, headaches, or wounds.

I know that my situation is luxurious and is certainly superior to all of my
ancestors and to 99% of the human beings on the planet,

I am thankful that I have nothing whatever to grumble at, but I feel that I'm
unappreciative. To lie awake as I do, not sleeping, is to scorn society's gifts.
How my forebears would have reveled in my taken-for-granted comforts!

No question but that I should be much more grateful.

"Lack of gratitude" will be the principal worry during tonight's insomnia.

Title: Amnesia on Film:  Unknown (2011)
Date: January 10, 2020

Just when you think that the movie industry has run the amnesia well bone dry,
along comes still another wild riff on the subject of forgetfulness. What a
great disease for screenwriters! a disease that keeps on giving -- and with no
end in sight.

This time, Dr. Martin Harris, ostensibly a biotechnologist but in reality a
professional assassin, is involved in an automobile accident. Harris wakes up
in the hospital but of course without memory. He comes to believe that he's
actually the scientist he's pretending to be -- and so do the amnesia-naive
among the audience. (I'm giving away the gimmick, but it doesn't matter because
no one is going to see this movie ever again. No audience, therefore no spoiler.

Implausible, derivative, threadbare. No cliche left unborrowed: two separate car
chases, a coma, a mysterious new girlfriend, double agents, an international
assassination syndicate, a sadistic hit man, doctored photos, phony passports,
suspenseful countdown to the explosion of the terrorist bomb, etc. The usual
stuff.

On the other hand: Unknown is slick, expensive, well acted, well paced; well
photographed,

It's a quick fix for those who enjoy "thrillers." Bad medicine for those who
prefer psychological credibility. Candy for connoisseurs of the infinite variety
of movie amnesia.

By the way, what's happened to Liam Neeson's nose?  It's become Durante-esque.

Title: Frequentatives Perplex Me
Date: January 24, 2020

Frequentatives perplex me. Even on good days, I can't tell a frequentative from
an iterative or what used to be called a present progressive or even from a
simple present that expresses a continuing action, such as "he walks to work" --
in the sense that he walks every day or many days, not just once. So instead of
struggling with definition and nomenclature, I'll confine these paragraphs to
old-fashioned frequentatives formed in the traditional way -- by the addition of
an "-er" or "-le" suffix.

"Wrestle" is a gold star, certified frequentative. The verb "wrest" means "to
grab" or "to snatch." The verb "wrestle" implies that the grabbing or snatching
does not occur in one unique instance, but continues over a stretch of time.
Wrestle is therefore the frequentative of wrest. In the English language, such
frequentatives were once upon a time regularly produced. No longer, apparently;
more's the pity. Frequentative productivity has hit rock bottom.

Frequentatives in "-er" are not always obvious, inasmuch as the "-er-" suffix is
also used for agency and for comparison. But frequentatives do follow a pattern:
blab yields blabber; gleam yields glimmer; climb, clamber; float, flutter; put,
putter; slide, slither.

"-le" frequentatives are more common and more varied. Consider the relation
between "fond" and "fondle". '"Fond" meant something like "to be in love, to
dote." Somewhere before its first appearance in print in 1796, fond acquired an
-le to become "fondle" = caress.  (Fondle in its turn generated "fondlesome" --
a word which went from neologism to obsolete in an 18th century flash, and whose
extinction is much to be regretted. Let's revive "fondlesome".)

Here's a short list of intriguing -le frequentatives: crumb, crumble; drip,
dribble; nose, nuzzle; prick, prickle; daze, dazzle; joust, jostle; prate,
prattle; spark, sparkle; spit, spatter; stride, straddle; suck, suckle. Not all
of these frequentatives are as obvious as wrest-wrestle and some cases must be
confirmed with the help of a good etymological dictionary.

Frequentatives have a long history. Why can't they make a comeback? Take a verb
such as "jump." Doesn't English need "jumple," a word that would accurately
describe the deportment of my twin 4-year-old grandsons. They don't just jump
-- they jumple. Sometimes they leaple. Other useful suggestions: hit, hittle;
throw, throwel; run, runnle; hop, hopple. Scream, scrimmle. The possibilities,
obviously, are endless.

The time has come for a Frequentative Renaissance.

Title: McDonald Avenue Branch of the Brooklyn Public Library, 1953-1956
Date: February 07, 2020

For all its fabled color, life in 40s and 50s Flatbush was extraordinarily
provincial. In terms of sophistication, it might just has well been central
Nebraska or U. P. Michigan. First generation working-class Brooklynites were
simply too busy making ends meet to acknowledge that there was a great world
outside. Although "The City" -- i.e. flush upscale Manhattan -- was just a 30
minute subway ride away, trust me, no tourists ever made it to our isolated
grimy neighborhood.

In the middle 50s, when I was a pupil at Flatbush's semi-famous Erasmus Hall
High School, I worked after school shelving books in the McDonald Avenue branch
of the Brooklyn Public Library. I worked two or three days a week from 3 pm to
6 pm and earned seventy-five cents large an hour. A frugal young fellow (cheap
as dirt, some say), I saved every penny, and I was proud to be able to pay
my first year's Cornell tuition ($900). It was a good job for me; I handled
a lot of books and because I was an omnivorous reader and an autodidact by
nature, I borrowed and chewed over many a volume that I wouldn't otherwise
have encountered. Plus I was able to sneak peeks at the contents of the 612.6
shelves.

It was at the McDonald library, which was barely more than a storefront, that I
experienced the first glimmer of an idea that there might be a world elsewhere.

The library staff was organized hierarchically. At the very bottom were the
part-time shelvers like myself. Masters of the Dewey Decimal System, we had no
greater qualification than the ability to remember the order of the letters
in the alphabet. A long step up were the clerks, who checked books out and
in, issued library cards, and collected fines. Clerks, like shelvers, were
native to the neighborhood. But then there was the "professional staff" -- five
people with degrees in "library science" who answered inquiries at the reference
desk, advised borrowers, and purchased books. The "pros" were not from the
neighborhood; they lived across the river In Manhattan and took the elevated
Culver Line to the stop at Ditmas, and they intrigued me.

Miss Owen -- Alice Owen -- head librarian, imbued with gloom, was an extremely
small, thin, clipped, austere woman with an unBrooklynish Maine or northern New
England accent. Archetype of the proper maiden lady -- sexless in my view, but
then, as I learned later, who can ever tell?  Miss Owen was, how shall I say
this respectfully, detail-oriented. There was Miss Warren, from South Dakota, a
fan of Senator McCarthy, who explained to me that the world's brown and black
people had benefited enormously from colonialism. Exotic Mr. O'Shea, obviously
gay (but of course I didn't recognized it at the time) from North Carolina,
a young man with more hip sway than Miss America and who actually -- hard to
believe -- referred to our borrowers of color as "jungle bunnies." I was stunned
and horrified. Miss Kyvelos, whose parents were Greek fishermen and who was as
round and warm as Miss Owen wasn't.

And then, another kettle of fish entirely, Bob Reisner, a 30ish bearded
Greenwich Village writer (not an entirely successful one, or he wouldn't have
been working at the library) who hung with jazz musicians and who was writing
a biography of Charlie Parker. He was a type entirely new to me -- skeptical,
disrespectful, "anti-establishment." Borderline hipster. In strong contrast to
the McDonald convention, his demeanor and language were lecherous, and he was
more frank about his desires than anyone I knew, though whether his lusts and
triumphs were real or imaginary I don't know. He was compiling a book called
"Show me the Good Parts" -- a catalog of the sex scenes in contemporary novels.
Pornographically speaking, he was way in advance of his time.

On the whole, the McDonald library was quite an eye-opener for provincial me.
I stayed on through the summer of 1956, then headed for Ithaca, where more
surprises awaited.

February 10. Thinking over what I've written, I can now correct my initial
memory. Miss Owen wasn't the head of the library. That position was held by
Miss Boies. Miss Owen was a figure of authority because she was in charge of
the part-time shelvers like myself. Miss Boies was also a librarian who came to
us directly from central casting by way of Ohio. At some point, she retired and
was replaced by much younger Mrs. Gerstner, who contracted cancer and died only
a few months after her arrival. I clearly remember her valedictory words to me,
"Get the most out of life."

And also, I wonder why Mrs. Gerstner and Bob Reisner took the time to talk to
me. I had nothing to offer them. Is it possible that they saw me as a youth of
promise. If so, they were over-optimistic.

Title: Dreaming Noirly
Date: February 11, 2020

I must be watching too many 1940-50s film noirs. They're infiltrating my dreams.

Last night, in my very own bedroom, I hosted a noir festival. Fragments of a
more intricate dream are all I can remember now, but the bits my memory retained
were mighty vivid. The dream featured an attractive young couple. He's handsome
in a Barry Sullivan way but unidentifiable; she's delicate, like Coleen Gray in
Kiss of Death (1947) or possibly like fragile young Janet Leigh in Touch of Evil
(1957). Some "mugs" want these young folks iced (the dream didn't say why) and
they want it done in the most painful possible manner. The scene then cut to a
rickety wood-framed house which replicated the building in the dude ranch run
by Mercedes McCambridge in Lightning Strikes Twice (1951).The goons break in
and sadistically slash the guy's throat and handcuff the girl to a post, then
set the house on fire (which copied the ending of Kiss Me, Deadly [1955]). Next
thing I knew, the young lady was alive (the dream didn't say how she escaped
the flames) and was being recruited and disguised by a trio of FBI or police
officers. Not plastic surgery, just makeup and a change of costume. The plan was
for her to go underground to identify and expose the hoodlums (a plot device
common to numberless noirs).

When I awoke, I was impressed by the imaginative work of my dreamatorium. "Not
a bad plot," I said to myself. "Not brilliant, but original enough to serve.
Add a car chase, a blonde songstress, a natty but corrupt district attorney, a
crusading newspaperman, some heavies (Moroni Olsen and Mike Mazurki, perhaps),
a heist gone bad, a skinny stoolie with a toothpick in his mouth, and a little
amnesia, and you've got yourself a movie."

I should add that this dream came to me in high contrast black-and-white.
Excellent camera work. Well-directed. Think Phil Karlson or Ida Lupino. With
gowns by Orry-Kelly.

Date: February 19, 2020

I have the hardest time remembering the number of stars in our home galaxy,
the Milky Way. Is it 300 million or 300 billion?  Either number is so far
out of my ken, so far beyond my ability to grasp, that it won't stick in my
head. Moreover, it doesn't seem to make much of a difference. But now I've
checked once again -- and it's 300 billion stars (ballpark --  not an exact
door-to-door census). That's three thousand millions of stars. Also, it's
130,000 light years from one side of the galaxy across to the center (the
radius). The mass of our galaxy is 1.5 trillion solar masses. Does that figure
include or exclude Dark Matter? I don't know.

That's just the start. The full story is even more astonishing still. In
addition to the Milky Way, there are approximately 34 billion galaxies such as
ours in the universe. Or there used to be until a few years ago; the most recent
estimate is 100 billion galaxies. From my standpoint, here on what Shakespeare
naively called "the sure and firm-set Earth" -- a smallish planet revolving
around the lucky old sun in one of the spiral arms of the Milky Way -- whether
there are 34 billion or 100 billion galaxies out there doesn't much change the
situation. In a nutshell: it's big; we're little.

Even seventy years ago, when I was a boy just starting to learn about the stars,
the universe was smaller and simpler. No one told me, because no one knew, about
the Big Bang, about star formation, about black holes and supermassive black
holes, standard candles, quasars, exoplanets, etc. Knowledge is expanding as
rapidly as the universe; it's only a few centuries ago that Galileo was sent to
his room for proving that Earth wasn't a still point at the center of the world.
"Eppure, si muove."

Actually, I'm glad that Copernicus and Galileo and Newton de-centered the
universe. I rather prefer being insignificant. Standing at the center of the
universe -- well, it was too much responsibility, too much pressure. It's mighty
consoling to be trivial. It helps to put our daily woes in perspective.

Is it more staggering that the universe is so ridiculously immense or that
members of our species have had the smarts to figure it out. Not only the
engineering skills to devise telescopes and spacecrafts to gather the data, but
the brains to think abstractly and mathematically. And the courage to do so.
We're an accomplished and admirable species when we're not torturing and killing
each other for no particular reason. I'm proud of us, some of the time.

When my father was the age I am now, he said to me, "As far as I can figure, I'm
just a link in a long chain going from nowhere to nowhere." He was exactly on
target. But we should also remember that the chain of which he spoke includes
Bach and Rembrandt and Einstein. And you and me  And as long as I remain a link
in that chain, I intend to make the most of my insignificant existence -- the
only one I have.

Title: Big Bangs
Date: February 24, 2020

Even though the universe is only 13.8 billion years old, more or less, the era
of star formation is nearly complete. Because our universe expands so rapidly,
the effects of gravity continue to lessen and therefore matter will soon cease
to clump. Existing stars and galaxies will become more and more isolated. In
a hundred billion years, the universe will be a thousand times larger than it
is now. After a trillion years, all the stars will have burnt themselves out,
except for slow-burning, feeble red dwarfs. In a hundred trillion years the
Degenerate Era arrives and the universe will be populated only by white dwarfs
and brown dwarfs, along with neutron stars and black holes, all fainter and
fainter with time. It will all be dark, except when a rare supernova erupts.
After 1034 years, atoms themselves will decay into protons and neutrons. In 1040
years, all of what we think of as matter will have become photons and leptons.
Later, black holes themselves will leak photons and disappear. It's the Dark
Era: just random electrons and positrons that rarely encounter each other -- 
an inactive universe that suffers from Heat Death. It's all dark, dead, and
cold. This sorry state will continue for all eternity.

it's a gloomy scenario, but I don't believe it. It doesn't make sense. And it
doesn't account for Dark Matter and Dark Energy, which no one knows anything
about except that they must exist perhaps in the form of neutrinos. Most
physicists seem to believe that the visible, palpable universe, which contains
the galaxies and the stars and the planets and you and me, is only about 6% of
the whole kit and kaboodle.

My own theory, unsupported by observation, evidence,  or calculation, is that
the universe will continue to expand for billions of years, and then Dark Matter
will kick in, gravity will plump up and spring to new life, and the universe
will start to contract. A few thousand billion years further on and here comes
the Big Crunch, when all matter will contract to a point and then, mirabile
dictu, another Big Bang and it's off to the races. Expand. Wait a few thousand
trillion years. Contract. More years -- expand. Contract. Expand. Again and
again. My universe pulses, for all eternity. Et saecula saeculorum; in aeternum
et ultra. No beginning, no end.

The scientific consensus universe is this: start with the Big Bang, end with
the eternal Dark Era. It's one-way ticket. My universe is round-trip. Multiple,
infinite round-trips. The astronomers have the data and the numbers and theory
on their side, but they can't explain how it all happened, or why? Why the Big
Bang? What was going on before all the Banging began? They don't have a glimmer
of an idea, not a clue; in fact, they punt and claim that it's impossible to
know what happened in the first few fractions of seconds. But my universe has no
start and no stop. It just is.

Neither their theory nor mine answers the implicit question, which some might
call philosophical or theological: "why is there something rather than nothing?"
But my idea has the advantage in that it defers that question indefinitely.
"What happened at the Big Bang? "Well, what happened is what always happens at
Big Bangs."

(Information about the end of the universe is adapted from David J. Eicher, The
New Cosmos (Cambridge University Press, 2015), an excellent introduction that
is written so lucidly that I understood maybe 60% to 70% of the whole. Well,
perhaps a little less. It's not Eicher's fault if I've gotten anything wrong.)

Title: Written for my Grandchildren
Date: February 25, 2020

Dear T, O, E, L, L, C, and A:

A friend told us that when she entered Pomona College in 1961, it was the custom
that all the newly arriving women ("co-eds" they were called in those dark days)
were "measured" by the sophomore men. She said that the women were lined up
and their measurements (height, weight, bust, waist, hips) taken and announced
to the assembled spectators. This shameful blast from the past shocked and
embarrassed me.

I'm five years older than our friend, but I'm glad to say that I never heard of
any remotely similar goings-on at the college I attended. (Maybe such things
happened in the backward, benighted frat clubs, but surely, I hope hope hope,
not in my part of the campus). In fact, I was a bit skeptical of our friend's
story -- it being so grotesque -- so I searched a Pomona alumni website for
confirmation and found this picture. I'm sorry to say that the evidence is
incontrovertible.

Tale of the tape, 1961.

Crew-cut boy is smiling, and I think I understand why. He's almost touching
shirtwaist girl's breasts. In those pre-Vietnam years, female virginity was
still a mystical virtue, mechanical contraception (there were no pills) was
near-impossible to obtain and prone to failure, pregnancy before marriage was a
life-shattering disgrace, and abortion was illegal and sometimes fatal. It might
be that taking the measure of the young lady's bosom was the sexual pinnacle of
crew-cut boy's four years in college. Nevertheless, I'm puzzled that shirtwaist
girl is so amenable to the taping. Is she actually smiling? Doesn't she realize
that she's participating in an absurd demeaning dehumanizing rite?

I asked our Pomona friend how she dealt with the ritual. "Well," she said,
"here's what I did. I went downtown and bought a large size inflatable bra.
I put it on and blew it up to monumental proportions. I brought a pin to the
ceremony. I planned to pop the bra just as I was being measured, but the thing
was so tough it didn't deflate as planned. I wish it had. That was my protest.
I should have done more. It was difficult to buck tradition. When things are
customary, taken for granted, it takes a lot of strength to go against the
system even when you know it's wrong."

Here's another story, young 'uns, from the same era. In 1960, your grandmother,
AGP, began teaching mathematics in Newton, Massachusetts. Her salary was $4200
a year, but if she had been a man, it would have been $4300. The district had
two salary scales, one for men and one for women. I remember studying a printed
schedule that had one column labelled M and one labeled F. The difference
between M and F was small, but it increased with every year of experience.
However small or large the discrepancy, it was still an insult and an injustice,
designed as much to assert superiority and inferiority as to make an economic
difference.

Both AGP and I knew it was wrong, but I'm embarrassed to say that we did not
protest. Before "equal pay for equal work," it was taken for granted that Fs
would be paid less than Ms. Why didn't we argue, agitate, organize?  Because we
were paralyzed, I think, by the powerful forces of custom and convention.

I wonder about crew-cut boy. Was he forever locked into 1960 attitudes or did he
eventually come to enlightenment? What sort of relations did he establish with
mature women? And did he, perhaps, have a daughter? Would he have advised her to
attend Pomona College, and if he did so, did he try to ascertain whether first-
year female students were still being measured?

I wonder also about the abuses in our society that we notice but tolerate
because they are so embedded in the culture. And even more so, by the abuses
we don't notice but will be clearly apparent in a generation or two. Which of
today's events will look as antiquated and rearward in fifty years as that
Pomona ritual?

"Now for my life," the doctor* boasted, "it is a miracle of [eighty] years,
which to relate, were not a history but a piece of poetry." Sir Thomas didn't
know the half of it; if his life was a miracle, then mine is a hundred times
more so. Yesterday the miracles started first thing in the morning when I drove
(I own a horseless carriage -- a circumstance Sir T. couldn't possibly have
imagined) to our spanking new hospital to have my innards inspected. The MRI
doughnut deployed a couple of teslas worth of magnetism to spin my protons into
images, a process which, though incomprehensible to me, is a heck of a lot less
agonizing than extracting the information from my personal body with scalpel
and stand-by sponge, and is significantly more informative than inspecting
my urine, which is what a seventeenth-century doctor like Browne would have
done. Later, I took a short walk to the local bank to take care of business
and moved some, well, not exactly money but virtual or magic money from one
account to another. Back home, I conversed by cell to NGP who was on the road
to Virginia in a horseless carriage of his own. Inasmuch as he was behind the
wheel, we skipped the face time feature. Nevertheless the long-distance mobile
communication experience was plenty miraculous. The climax of my day was a walk
to a neighborhood theater where Angela Hewitt blessed us with an exquisitely
rendered performance of Bach's Goldberg Variations. She was in a zone; I was
riveted. Is it more wondrous that Bach composed the Variations, that Ms. Hewitt
performed them with such delicate power, or that the concert took place right
around the corner, almost at my doorstep?  After the Bach, the day being
now almost over, along came still another miraculous moment when I watched,
supine in my own bed, in real time, the last minutes of an NBA game beamed in
from Boston, Massachusetts, two thousand miles to the east, and almost at the
Atlantic Ocean. It was an excellent game -- a stunning win for the Brooklyn
Nets, and an equally remarkable triumph for my pixel-rich widescreen TV. It was
a long day and a varied one, and I was beat, so while snuggling a-bed with the
lady friend (an intimacy that is not only a miracle but a piece of poetry to
boot), I instructed Alexa to give us a little opera. Alexa complied and chose
WQXR in NYC, and for a drowsy hour we were grateful operavores.

No question but that my day was comprised of a series of miracles, each one more
incredible than the other.

Nor do I even bother to tally daily miracles so commonplace that we cease to
notice them: water in (both cold and hot) and waste out, electricity, central
heating and A/C, refrigeration, natural gas to cook by, big bright cheerful
windows, etc.

"What wondrous life is this I lead."

Title: First Days at Cornell, September 1956.
Date: March 07, 2020

Early in September of 1956, I found my way from Flatbush to Hoboken and there
boarded the old Lehigh Valley Railroad (the 'Leaky V') for the eight-hour ride
to Ithaca. Surely I was the most naive and callow lad ever to set foot on the
grounds of Cornell University. I was ignorant and provincial and I had never so
much as visited a college campus. Although I lived a bicycle ride's distance
from Brooklyn College, I had never been either enterprising or curious enough
to ride by and take a gander. What I knew of higher education was what I had
gleaned from 1940s black-and-white movies in which mature-looking but prankish
fellows in raccoon coats smoked pipes and harmonized and made fun of the 'prexy'
and of the bespectacled 'profs' and who were unworthy of the attractive coeds
they pursued until just before the final fadeout when they reformed themselves
enough to earn a kiss and a wink. Nor did I have the slightest idea what was
signified by the wink.

I arrived at Cornell a few days before classes began. During those first days I
had three separate mind-shattering experiences.

The first: one morning, I took my newly-purchased map and set out on a long
walk (probably to avoid one of those atavistic rah-rah events which Cornell
favored and to which I was constitutionally averse). Sometime during the day's
wandering I came across a road sign that read "CITY LIMITS." It was as if I had
been struck by lightning. Until the moment that I encountered that sign, I had
no idea that a city could have limits. Regular readers of this blague know that
I spent my first seventeen years in the interior regions of darkest Brooklyn, a
large borough in an even larger city from which there was no exit and certainly
no "limit" -- especially not while on foot. My family, my family of origin, was
automobile-free and I myself had left the neighborhood precincts only a handful
of times. Although unworldly, I was nevertheless capable of extrapolation.
If it was possible to pass beyond the city limits, then perhaps it was also
possible to re-negotiate other limitations that I had assumed were eternal
or unalterable. I walked past the sign and transcended the city of Ithaca. I
couldn't go very far because my map went blank, so after a hundred or so feet I
hustled back -- but for the first time in my life I had stepped over the line.

The next day: terra incognita of an entirely different order. I wandered into
the McGraw Library and found myself in the periodical room. Until the moment
that I entered that space, I was acquainted only with magazines that would be
found in a barbershop or in a dentist's office -- Life and Look and Collier's
and The Saturday Evening Post and, for profound intellectual stimulation, the
National Geographic. And yet here was a room with an apparently limitless number
of periodicals: Journal of Physical Chemistry, Journal of Theology, Journal of
Metaphysics, Journal of Medieval Studies, Journal of Biblical Archeology. I had
no idea that there were such periodicals nor did I know that there were such
areas of knowledge. Was there in truth a subject called anthropology?  and
various shades of anthropology -- cultural, physical, linguistic? To say that
I was wide-eyed does not do justice to width of my eyes. I spent hours leafing
through these publications. I didn't understand much of what I read, but I did
realize that there were things going on in the world for which P. S. 217 and
EHHS and Flatbush had not prepared me.

A third and most miraculous occurrence. My assigned roommate arrived. His
name was Harry Wallace Blair II. He was delivered to campus by his parents
and his grandparents. I was introduced to his family, and, wonder of wonders,
his grandparents spoke English. Coming from immigrant Brooklyn, I had never
encountered grandparents who spoke English. Or imagined that there could be any
such. Italian, yes. Polish, certainly. Yiddish, of course. But English, never.
I was totally flabbergasted. I wonder whether Harry's grandparents noticed my
repeated gasps.

Oh, yes, I forgot one other event of the first Cornell week. Classes began.
I enrolled for introductory chemistry -- a big mistake. Chem, I quickly
discovered, was not where my talents lay. It was a large lecture class --
possibly 300 or 400 students. We all sat for a math screening test. Quite
in error, I was assigned to a special advanced section of twenty students
supposedly talented in mathematics. In the class were nineteen men and one
woman. Can you guess, grandchildren and regular readers, who was that woman?

Title: Amnesia on Film: The Vow (2012)
Date: March 17, 2020

Amnesia movies are not absolutely fettered to reality, nor should they be.
Hollywood amnesia, as has been frequently noted, is the most flexible and
variable of illnesses. Nevertheless, The Vow (2012) breaks new ground in want
of integrity. One reviewer called it a "heartless, soulless jumble," but that's
letting it off easy.

A young woman, played by perky Rachel McAdams, suffers an automobile accident
and forgets the five years of her marriage to a young man, played by wooden
mumbling Channing Tatum. The couple stumbles around for ninety bumbling minutes
but eventually he wins her back in cliche date-movie, rom-com tearjerk fashion.
Loss of memory, which in any close-to-reality situation would be psychologically
troublesome if not utterly disabling, proves to be of no more consequence than
the loss of a pair of shoes or eyeglasses. Simplistic, superficial, offensive.

The film advertises itself as based on real events. Loosely based, I'd say,
because in actual fact, there was an accident and she suffered loss of memory,
but he had an affair, the marriage crumbled, and they divorced. But that was in
another country, one in which real human beings might dwell.

"No redeeming characteristics" says another reviewer. The film is especially
not redeemed by expressionless Channing Tatum, who fumbles and garbles a higher
percentage of his dialog than any actor in the history of Hollywood.

Title: Deer Dream
Date: March 25, 2020

In this one, I see two deer (it's not clear whether they're mule or white tail)
lolling on the ridge line. They're semi-anthropomorphic -- they look like deer,
but they're sprawled on the ground as if in a reading position, each supporting
his head with one hand (or hoof). I climb to where they are lying and join
them, but the terrain is very steep and I tumble backward  head over heel a
hundred or so feet into a swampy thicket. The deer follow me gingerly. There's
a fadeout. Next thing I know, I'm lying on the back of one of the deer just
like in the westerns when a dead man is carried back to town  horseback.  The
deer take me home -- to a log cabin, unfamiliar to me, in the woods. My friends
unload me, and one of them says, "We should do something for the deer." I say,
"OK, let's not shoot them."  End of dream.

Once again, my nighttime life is orders of magnitude more imaginative that my
daytime existence.

Title: Susan P. (1937-38)
Date: April 04, 2020

This entry is written at the specific instruction of my daughter, who says,
"your grandchildren will want to know about your birth. It's their history too."
The following paragraphs are for them and for their descendants.

My older sister, Susan, died of pneumonia at the age of nine months on March 15,
1938. If she had lived, I wouldn't exist, nor would my ten descendants, and no
one would notice.

I was born on March 11, 1939, just one year minus four days after Susan died. It
seems obvious that I was purposely conceived as a substitute for the dead child
-- and it therefore follows that I was delivered into a disrupted, stressed
family. Was I to be treasured as a compensation for past grief or to be resented
as an imperfect interloper? Or both, simultaneously? To raise the ante, it is
also a fact that during that fatal March of 1938 when Susan lay dying, my older
brother Eugene, then just shy of three years of age, was gravely ill of the same
disease that killed his younger sister, and that although he was at death's
door, he managed to pull through.

So let us consider the situation of my parents, Manny and Lil, in June of
1938, the month of my conception. Poor Susan lay a-mouldering in her tiny
grave for just three months. The Great Depression was still going strong
and Hitler's Nuremberg Laws had been in force since 1935. Father Coughlin,
celebrity Jew- hater, was agitating thirty million American radio listeners a
week. Kristallnacht was just five months away and most everyone knew that war
was imminent. Residing on East 9th Street in Flatbush were my grief-stricken
young parents, who had helplessly watched one child die and had come within a
hairbreadth of losing another. We must imagine them reeling, tearful, clinging
to one another, dealing as best they might with heartbreaking anxiety and pain.
Yet despite public and personal disasters, they made the courageous choice to
throw the dice again, and out of their anguish to bring forth another child
-- and to run the real risk, in those pre-antibiotic days, of offering still
another sacrifice to pneumonia or some other dread incurable illness.

If my parents were still alive, I'd congratulate them, celebrate them, not
because their resilience produced me, but because to beget a substitute child in
chaotic, dangerous 1938 seems to me, now, looking back from the perspective of
2020, to be an act of unfathomable courage.

Or so I would like to think. It's also possible that I'm here not because of
their heroism but because of a failure of contraception. I'll never know.
I didn't ask; they never said, and the facts are unrecoverable. Lil and
Manny wouldn't dream of speaking aloud about anything so intimate as sex or
reproduction, certainly not with their children and, who knows, perhaps not
even with one another. In that regard, they were typical of their generation.
Personal matters were kept close to the vest.

When Lil was five months pregnant, Hitler annexed the Sudetenland. Exactly three
weeks before I landed on this planet, 20,000 Nazi supporters rallied, complete
with Fascist salutes, at the old Madison Square Garden on 49th Street. Four days
after I arrived, on the anniversary --the yahrzeit -- of the death of little
Susan, while my mother was regaining her strength in Manhattan's Park East
hospital on East 83rd Street, German tanks rolled into Czechoslovakia. For Lil,
for Manny, personal and public crises intersected. Nazis foreign and domestic
were at the gates, and inside the hospital, my mother was still mourning the
loss of the little girl whom my Uncle Dan, my mother's brother, remembered as
an "exceptionally beautiful child." And lying beside Lil in her bed was the
newborn, who was welcomed with joy, I'm sure, but with ambivalence also. Not
an eternally glowing-in-memory girl child but me --an undistinguished chap, to
put it in the most favorable light. Not "trailing clouds of glory" but instead
enveloped in a fog of danger and possibly regret.

My parents, as I have said, kept their emotions tightly buttoned, so while Susan
was not mourned or even mentioned within the family, she was never forgotten. In
fact, throughout my childhood she remained a mysterious ghostly presence. In my
parents' bedroom was a simple display -- a child-size wood-and-wicker chair and
above it, on the wall, a gold-framed picture of a very pretty infant. The shrine
fascinated me, and I would sneak into my parent's bedroom to study it. Sneak?
Yes, because their bedroom was a consecrated place not to be defiled by Eugene
or Jonathan or me. Off limits. It was the sin of all childhood sins to violate
the taboo and cross into the forbidden zone. My mother made an unholy fuss about
this rule. "You are not to go into our bedroom. Ever." Which I did, regularly,
when no one was looking --- but it felt like a midnight intrusion into a deep
dark country graveyard. Very creepy. Who is that infant in the picture? And why
is she not allowed to rest in peace? I knew better than to ask.

I never thought, then, to wonder how Manny and Lil, contemplating the gilded
idol morn and eve, could fail to compare their frozen-in-time lost infant to her
scruffy successor? Of course I was aware that my "difficult" mother was a deeply
troubled woman. But never, trust me, did I have the least glimmer that the shade
of the dead infant haunted our family -- and myself in particular. No child,
certainly not me, would have been so insightful. It's transparent now, but it
was anything but obvious then. Nor could anyone possibly have predicted that
there was to be an area of study within the discipline of psychology called "The
Replacement Child Syndrome" (RCS). And that I was unequivocally a textbook case
of such.

RCS lay dormant. Forty years later, and forty years ago, when I was in midlife,
not having thought for decades about my dead sister or her shrine or my long-
departed parents, I experienced something of a revelation. It came about
indirectly, but dramatically.

I was teaching classes on Shakespeare's plays. and I found myself paying much
more heed to Romeo and Juliet than that immature early tragedy warrants. I
was especially intrigued by Shakespeare's invention of the character of young
Juliet -- which is far more subtle than is necessary for the plot. With Juliet,
Shakespeare attempted something utterly unprecedented in any previous work of
literature. He cleverly situated his young heroine in a complicated family
in which Juliet had, in effect, two mothers -- a birth mother, Capulet wife,
who is cold, distant and aloof, and a metaphorical and therefore real mother,
Nurse Angelica, who is undisciplined but sensual and sexual. The two mothers,
carefully differentiated, precipitate or echo or explain the conflict within
Juliet between propriety and passion. One mother embraces and promulgates
Verona's rigid mores, while the other is impulsive, emotional, and anarchic. In
addition -- and now it all was starting to become extremely personal for me --
Shakespeare provided Juliet with a backstory (unusual because his characters
rarely have prior histories). It comes to light that the Nurse's own natural
daughter had died in infancy, that the bereaved mother was engaged to suckle
Juliet -- and that Angelica has been Juliet's surrogate mother and companion
for almost fourteen years. So Juliet is, for the Nurse, clearly and obviously a
replacement child. How curiously relevant! How provocative!

I then remembered that William Shakespeare himself was such a child. According
to the Trinity Church records, John and Mary Shakespeare had suffered two
tragedies before April 23, 1564 when William was born. Their first child, a
daughter named Joan, had been baptized four years earlier, in 1560, but lived
only for two months. A second daughter, Margaret, was baptized in 1562 and lived
for just under one year. A full year! and then the grave! How horrible for all
concerned! Young Will therefore entered the world as the boy child who replaced
not one but two older sisters. Even in an age of staggering infant mortality,
two such premature deaths must surely have weighed on both John and Mary and on
William himself. Is it an accident that Juliet is the only certified replacement
child in early modern English literature (at least, the only one that I can
recall at this moment)?

Mulling these matters, I soon discovered that I had failed to register some
additional facts about the Capulet family that by rights ought to have set
my heart all aflutter. Listen to the Nurse nattering on about her surrogate
daughter Juliet.

Even or odd, of all days in the year,

Come Lamass Eve at night shall she be fourteen,.

Susan and she -- God rest all Christian souls--

Were of an age.  Well, Susan is with God.

She was too good for me.

How could I have missed it?  Right at the heart of the Capulet family dynamics,
and therefore at the heart of the play, is not just a dead infant and a dead
daughter, but a dead Susan.

I have to say that this discovery put my brain into quite an epiphanic tizzy.
How could I not have recognized the parallels between the Capulet family and my
own?  And also, given my near-compulsive interest in the bonds and affiliations
among Capulet wife and Nurse Angelica and Juliet -- how could my conscious mind
have ignored information that had so vexed my unconscious?

Alerted by this 1595 play to my own personal being, I set out to learn about the
Replacement Child Syndrome (RCS) in what is charitably called the "literature"
of psychoanalysis. While almost everything I read was either obtuse or so
encrusted with obscurantist jargon as to be indecipherable, it was not hard to
distill the gist. According to the experts, a replacement is always vulnerable
and at hazard, especially so if the deceased infant has not been properly
mourned, or-- as they say -- if there has not been "closure." Such a lad or lass
goes through childhood constantly judged to be inferior to the idealized dead
child. At worst, the love that is owed to the living child may be withdrawn
and the replacement resented --  less loved, or even unloved; tolerated but
undervalued.

Had she lived, the dead girl, let us call her Susan, of infinite and golden
potential, would certainly have grown up to be an exceedingly dutiful daughter
as well as a concert cellist and a world-class figure-skater who when just two
years out of Yale would have created a state-of-the-art gynecological clinic in
an underserved village in Moldova. The other, the replacement -- me -- bawls
and pukes, bites a neighbor child on the cheek, throws a colossal shitfit over
a missing puzzle piece, shatters an heirloom lamp, steals comic books from the
local candy store, wastes weeks moping in his bedroom, totals the DeSoto, and
fails trigonometry. No wonder he's a disappointment.

Well, maybe I'm laying it on with a trowel, but that's the general idea.

Now (this is still forty years ago) reconstituted as a Syndrome, I entered
into my "poor poor pitiful me" period. I wasted kilowatts of energy and eons
of precious time conceptualizing myself as a case of "wrongful birth." I
shifted the blame for all my emotional foibles onto my parents, especially,
to be honest, onto my mother. Right at her doorstep I laid low self-esteem,
intermittent depression, fear of success, disabling shyness and even (this was
a bit of stretch) procrastination. But it didn't wash and it didn't last. I'm
ashamed and embarrassed that I allowed myself to attribute my personal problems
to my willing but helpless mother. Not that there wasn't a smidgeon of truth
to the RCS analysis. Freud says that "a man who has won the love of his mother
is always a hero in his own eyes"; well, that kind of heroism wasn't going to
be my lot. Of course I would have preferred to have enjoyed intimacy with a
smiling supportive mother. Not what happened. But it was selfish and wrong of me
to dwell on slights which were trivial compared to the traumas undergone by my
parents.They, not me, were and are the heroes of this story.

The bedrock is that the RCS, though real, was only of middling significance
to me. It was devastating for Juliet, because it led directly to her suicide,
and it may have served as a spur to Shakespeare, who became Shakespeare and,
incidentally, fathered a daughter named Susannah. For me -- well, it was it only
important for the moment. I was a wounded child -- no, not wounded, scratched
--but not a disabled one. I was healthy enough to pursue if not a distinguished,
certainly a respectable career, to become a reliable father, to meet my
obligations to my extended family and community and to form a long-lasting
marriage -- and when that first marriage was cut short by disease and death,
to achieve in old age a second mature and satisfying relationship. My parents
must have done a great deal right, for I became what my father used to praise,
without a shred of irony, as a "proper, tax-paying citizen." At this point in
my octogenarian life, there's no room for that old self-pitying me; instead,
there's great admiration and regard for both Lil and Manny, who endured. And
who, in the successes of their grandchildren and great-grandchildren, continue
to thrive and prosper.

An addendum: in the psychological "literature", I found no mention, neither jot
nor tittle, of the family configuration in which a male child replaces a female.
No doubt such situations have by now been thoroughly researched by trained
analysts, but not back then, when such a discussion might have been useful to
me. The case of Juliet, where one girl replaces another, has been explored,
but not Shakespeare's situation, or mine. I wonder sometimes whether the case
of a boy succeeding a girl might lead to gender confusion, or as they now say,
"fluidity" (if, for example, the parents unconsciously favor female traits in
their son). I don't mean sexual practice, because I myself have never been (or
wanted to be) anything other than a vanilla heterosexual. But I'm not even
slightly macho; I am strongly domestic, comfortable with roles that have been
traditionally reserved for women. I'm a gatherer, not a hunter; not the kind
of person who goes to the fights with the guys or plays rugby and eventually,
shunning the entrapment of wife or family, rides off on his horse into the
sunset. I am much more likely to clean the bathroom, weed the garden, make some
bad rhymes, play casino with the grandkids, and whip up a beef stew for dinner.

Another addendum: I always wondered why Lil and Manny decided to give me an
awkward obscure Biblical name. They had no interest in anything remotely
smacking of religion. So why choose the name of one of Job's false comforters? 
What were they thinking?  During my pitiful period, I imagined that they chose
the name because they were disappointed with me. We can't name him Susan, said
their joint unconscious, so let's give him an ugly name the diminutive of which
is female. That was my theory, but now I have another idea. Perhaps, in March
of 1939, to resurrect an obscure biblical name was to give the middle finger to
Hitler. If so, it was an act of defiance. I hope I'm right.

And finally: my younger brother Jonathan, who was as equally improbable a
replacement as I, was born in July of 1942, seven month after the Day of
Infamy. He too entered in troubling times. Jon was an extremely handsome youth,
regularly gushed over by friends and family -- and slightly envied by me. One of
his shaping childhood experiences is of my mother holding his head in her hands
and saying, "You would have made a very beautiful girl."

Jon too is a gatherer rather than a hunter, and when I'm in the kitchen slicing
the potatoes and carrots for a big pot of beef stew, it's his excellent recipe
that I follow.

Title: What Are the Odds?
Date: April 07, 2020

It's a commonplace that every one of us is improbable and accidental -- a fluke
of all flukes. The odds against you or me or any particular person being born,
of coming into life, are infinitesimal -- a positron's dimension (if positrons
have dimension) shy of nothing, of zero.

Why is any birth so unlikely?  To begin, while every sperm is sacred (as we're
told on good authority), every sperm is also unique. There are 200 million or
more of the little whipper-snappers in the normal ounce or so of human male
ejaculate -- each one a quirky unique assemblage of genes. Both your and my
individual existence depends on one particular sperm lashing itself into a
lather to be the first to break the tape. If the sperm with your name on it had
foundered, and the dark horse sperm in the next lane had penetrated the egg, you
yourself wouldn't have been conceived, wouldn't have existed. An entirely other
human being would have suckled at the breast, cried in the crib, perched in
the high chair. If you're a boy, your "other" might have been a girl, and vice
versa.

So we are all many-millions-to-one long shots. But multiply the odds against
you yourself being welcomed to the world by the even more remote odds against
the conceptions of your four grandparents. Your grandmas and grandpapas exist
only because in each case two people out of all the potential great-grandparent-
generation cohort on earth chanced to meet and find a particular opportunity
on a particular day and particular spot of time to copulate so that those
remote grandsires could launch their own flotilla of swimmers upriver. How many
accidents had to occur to compile the particular DNA which comprises your own
identity and individuality?

Then we must add factors such as the strife and wars and migrations and diseases
that united or separated our great-grandfolks and their great-great grandfolks
and yea, even unto our Olduvai forebears and to the pliopithecoids who preceded
them, and then back through the early mammals and to the dark backward and abysm
of time. Gosh, it makes you wonder how anything at all ever happens to happen in
this random chancy aleatory world -- and yet remarkable things (such as you and
I being born) continue to occur. And a good thing, too.

Title: Innogen
Date: April 10, 2020

In Cymbeline (1611?), Shakespeare, still innovating even at the end of his
career, deepens the character of Innogen by supplying her with an unusual
psychological trait. He presents her to us as an escapist or fantasist who leaps
to imagine herself a different person in a different world. Here's Innogen
early in the play, when she realizes that her cross-class marriage to Postumus
(she's a princess, he's a poor but worthy gentleman) is at risk: "Would I were/
A neatherd's daughter, and my Leonatus/ Our neighbor shepherd's son." She
fantasizes herself surrendering her nobility to become a peasant. A few moments
later, she learns that her lover Leonatus and his rival the clotpoll Cloten have
been in a sword fight and that Cloten has retreated. Innogen's reaction: "I
would they were in Afric both together/ Myself by with a needle, that I might
prick/ The goer-back". Why Africa? Because, among other reasons, it is far from
the British court where Innogen's activities are heavily restricted. So in two
short speeches Innogen has expressed willingness to being transformed in both
class and geography. Shortly afterward, Innogen describes (in another "would
that" imagining) how she would have stared at the retreating ship which takes
Postumus into exile: "I would have broke mine eye-strings, cracked them,/ To
look upon him till the dimunition/ Of space had pointed him sharp as my needle."
Indifferent to physical pain, she now imagines herself transcending not only
class and space, but also the limitations of her own body.

It was no accident that Shakespeare gave Innogen such freedom to re-invent
herself, because in the scenes that follow, she will undergo a series of radical
transformations -- from princess to a "franklin's wife," into a boy cooking
fancy food for three cave-dwelling mountain-men, and then a dutiful page to
the general of the invading Roman army, all the while avoiding betrayal,
attempted rape and apparent poisoning. It's a lot for Innogen to deal with,
but Shakespeare knew exactly what he was doing when he started her off with an
imagination equal to the task.

Title: Amnesia on Film: The Unsuspected  (1947)
Date: April 11, 2020

This time, amnesia minus the amnesia. Heiress Matilda Frazier, presumed to have
perished in a shipboard fire, returns home where she's met by Steven Howard who
claims to be her recently-wedded husband. She fails to remember him for the
good reason that she's never met him and hasn't lost her memory. It's a case
of "attributed amnesia." Not a disease at all -- merely a handy plot device,
credible in black-and-white 40s murder mysteries where amnesia is as common
as a slight cold. Matilda is temporarily deceived by Mr.Howard. So are the
spectators.

Terrific direction by Michael Curtiz, fine performance by luminous Joan
Caulfield, reliable work by steady Fred Clark, effortful ventriloquism by
Constance Bennett in a part originally written for Eve Arden.

The Unsuspected borrows much too much from Laura (1944). In addition to the
prominently-displayed portrait, there's Claude Rains channeling Clifton Webb.
Plus the heroine's return from presumed death, the curious sexless relationship
between an older man (the murderer) and a much younger woman. A smitten
investigator. Good thing there's a dollop of fake amnesia to help differentiate
the two films.

Title: Ten Things I Dislike about Films
Date: April 17, 2020

I'm a movie lover, but I'm not indiscriminate. Here follows a list of common
movie occurrences that compel me either to seek out nineteenth-century novels or
force me to bury my head under the blankets.

1. Cute puppies, especially when the boy and the girl kiss for the first time, and the director, unfazed by cliche or rank sentimentality, cuts to the pooch's just darling head-tilt. Even worse when the doggie covers his cute eyes with his cute paw. Aaargh.

2. Child actors, with rare exceptions. Some few gifted children know how to be natural, but most just make me cringe.

3. Gratuitous killing of "redskins," especially when aestheticized. How gracefully, when shot by the cavalry marksmen, do the Comanches plummet from the face of the cliff or tumble down the scree. In Western after Western, they take huge losses -- presenting themselves as targets while they ride crazily around the circled wagons -- a strategy that is cinematic but nonsensical. And also: all the retrogressive, antediluvian blackface and yellowface and brownface stereotypes that make us gasp with horror at our racist forebears.

4. Those far too frequent scenes, where the guy, pursued either by the police or the husband, goes out the 16th story window of his hotel and works his way across a narrow ledge to another window (always unlocked). Such scenes give me the willies.

5. Car chases. Boring, boring, boring. I've discussed this in the past.

6. Montage dating scenes: boy and girl meet cute. After the mandatory misunderstanding, they reconcile, and then we see five seconds of them sitting in a restaurant, smiling; next they're rowing in a boat in the park; then they're on a ferry, or at a picnic etc. etc. From this we are supposed to deduce that they're in love. Predictable cut to the predictable soft-focus bedroom. Romance, which ought to be thrilling, becomes, through repetition and want of originality, almost as boring as a car chase.

7. Funny drunks. They're not funny. Alcoholism is a destructive disease.

8. The scene in which the stoic hero has taken a bullet in the shoulder and it's going to be extracted by an amateur. No anesthetics. "Here, bite on this." Even worse, if possible, when it's not a bullet but an arrow.

9. Background music that dictates the emotions we are supposed to feel. Worse still, the background noise that is currently so fashionable. Not music, just a loud drone, which sometimes drowns the dialogue.

back to duty for one last assignment. And finally, anything with zombies,
cyborgs, extraterrestrials, robots, demonic children who vomit blood, or

Title: Amnesias on Films:  Two in the Dark (1936) and Two O-Clock Courage (1945)
Date: April 19, 2020

I've now reported on thirty-two separate amnesia movies and there are surely
many more out there to which I am unacquainted. Why so many? How come
Shakespeare didn't write an amnesia play? Why are there no classic novels about
amnesia? Didn't unsuspecting folks get themselves bopped on the head in previous
centuries? Didn't knights ever fall off their stallions and thwack their helms
and beavers?

Here's an obvious answer to the gimmick's popularity: amnesia provides three of
the major elements of all story-telling: Mystery, Quest, and Identity (or as
Lear puts it, "Who is it that can tell me who I am?") But why is it repeated so
obsessively in film?

Today a twofer, bringing the grand total to thirty-four. In Two in the
Dark (1936), an amnesiac (Walter Abel) comes to awareness on a street corner
and suspects that he has committed a murder. Rest easy; he didn't do any such
thing. But he needs the help of a good-looking out-of-work actress (Margot
Grahame) to establish his innocence. His amnesia is garden variety, "bang-bang".
One blow to the old bean and he forgets who he is; later a second whomp and it
all comes back in a flash (in the form of a flashback). Very convenient, very
tidy, but not very imaginative. The film is languidly paced, almost slow-motion.

Curiously, Two in the Dark was remade nine years afterward as Two O-Clock
Courage with the director of the earlier film serving as the producer of the
later. It was a good idea to try again, because the later film was directed by
Anthony Mann, who keeps things brisk. Although the plot and a great deal of
the dialog was copied wholesale, it's a much better and different film, mostly
because the amnesiac's fellow investigator is now a wise-cracking female taxi-
driver -- a character straight out of the screwball comedies. When she's on
screen, the film becomes a feast of badinage. Tom Conway as the amnesiac is
dignified and expressionless, but Ann Rutherford steals the show as the fast-
talking cabbie.

"Bang-bang" or "thwack-thwack" amnesia arrives and departs easily. It comes
with an on-off switch. Contrary to human psychological experience, it leaves no
residue except for a couple of neat Band-Aids -- one on each side of the head.

Date: April 25, 2020

Another automobile accident and another hospitalized amnesiac. Once again, the
poor guy might have committed a murder, but he's not sure. And once again,
there's a loyal young woman (Gina McConnell, played by Jennifer Jayne) to help
him reconstruct his past. As well as a beguiling dangerous femme fatale and a
double-dealing psychiatrist. Knockout drops, hallucinations, an escape through
a window, a clever detective, a disappearing corpse, multiple flashbacks. The
usual stuff, another day at the noir office.

The gimmick this time: Chris Smith (Robert Webber) has recovered his memory but
keeps up the pretense so he can solve the murder. Everyone is kept in the dark,
including the befuddled audience. It's a tricky move and highly unpersuasive.
The last line of the Wiki plot summary tells you all you need to know in the way
of cliche: "Chris is reunited with Gina."

Title: Blood and Lust
Date: April 26, 2020

There are so many overlaps between Richard III (1593) and Macbeth (1606) that
it sometimes seems as though Shakespeare pillaged and reformed the earlier
play when he composed the later. Both plays feature cynical upward strivers
("hellhounds," the playwright calls them both) who risk damnation to murder
their way to the throne, and then lose their kingdoms in battle and are
succeeded by spotless young heirs. Both Richard of Gloucester and Macbeth
kill innocent children and both are haunted by the ghosts of those they have
murdered.

Yet the two plays are very different. Macbeth is a tidy economical play
(Shakespeare's second shortest), while Richard III (his second longest) is
sprawling and repetitious, sometimes even bewildering, stuffed to the gills with
incident and declamation. Moreover, Richard III lacks witches, moving forests,
young Malcolm, Macduff's mysterious birth, and above all, ambitious Lady
Macbeth. While Richard is famously amusing, Macbeth hasn't the slightest sense
of humor even though he can be unconsciously ironic.

When similar circumstances arise, as they must, it becomes obvious that the
rhetorical strategies of Richard III are rudimentary compared to the richer and
more satisfying language of Macbeth.

Here is one passage in the earlier play that has an echo or correspondence in
the later. Richard instructs a follower to slander King Edward ("luxury" means
"lust")"

urge his (i.e. Edward's) hateful luxury,And bestial appetite in change of
lust;Which stretch'd unto their servants, daughters, wives,Even where his raging
eye or savage heart,Without control, listed to make a prey.

In Macbeth, Malcolm slanders himself.

There's no bottom, none,In my voluptuousness. Your wives, your daughters,Your
matrons and your maids, could not fill upThe cistern of my lust, and my
desireAll continent impediments would o'erbearThat did oppose my will.

Unbounded lust is the subject of both speeches - "servants, daughters, wives,"
expands into the even more inclusive wives, daughters, matrons, and maids.
Richard's statement is strong, its power strengthened by the litany of allusions
to the uncivil wild: "bestial," "raging," "savage," "prey." Macbeth's is
considerably more powerful, primarily because of the extended metaphor in which
lust is conceived as some sort of fluid. Many an acre foot of lust could be
contained in a "cistern" without a "bottom."  Yet in fact a bottomless cistern
would impound only a portion of Malcolm's sexual gusher which, it seems, is many
times more abundant than a single cisternfull; it's a deluge that "continent
impediments" such as embankments or dikes or dams cannot restrain. It's a
tsunami.

A second correspondence occurs when Richard engages in a moment of self-
evaluation. "But I am in/ So far in blood that sin will pluck on sin;/ Tear-
falling pity dwells not in this eye." Macbeth's improvement: "I am in blood/
Stepped in so far, that should I wade no more/ Returning were as tedious as go
o'er." Blood in both, to be sure, but there are improvements. In the earlier
passage, the key terms are sin and pity, abstractions which are rooted in the
antecedent allegorical drama. "Sin" becomes a personage: "sin will pluck on
sin." And pity or perhaps Pity, is also vivified through the use of the modifier
"tear-falling." But these harkings back to allegory hint at the less abstract
and more imaginative figure adumbrated in the phrase "so far in blood." It would
be more ordinary and idiomatic to say not "stepped in so far" but "stepped in so
deep." Unless, of course, the playwright had an idea lurking in the recesses of
his brain which he didn't quite articulate. Ten years later, Richard's puddle
became Macbeth's river or lake or even ocean, deep enough that it required
the usurper king to "wade" in it. Shakespeare pursues the metaphor to its
completion: "should I wade no more/ Returning were as tedious as go o'er" -- a
figure which makes it clear that Macbeth is overshoes, knee deep -- or even hip
deep --  in a nightmare swamp of his own making, There's no side channel, no
bridge, no way out.

So apprentice "sin" and "pity" are superseded by masterly "cistern" and "blood "
and "wade.                                                                     "

It's not by accident that Macbeth is so deeply unsettling.

Title: Amnesia on Film: The Third Day (1965)
Date: April 28, 2020

I don't know why, but It's surprisingly common, in movieworld, that if a man
stumbles away from an automobile accident, he must cotract amnesia and he must
suspect that he's murdered someone. On top of that, it's required that he will
take full ninety minutes to prove that he is innocent of killing anyone. The
Third Day hits these notes right down the middle. But The Third Day is not just
an amnesia/murder mystery/police procedural. It's also a soap opera/marriage-on-
the-rocks movie; it's a save-the-small-town-factory from corporate raiders
story. And it's a maniac-on-the-loose horror film. The Third Day is a crowded
conflation of genres which doesn't quite succeed in finding a concord to its
redundant discord.

The first ten minutes are the best. Steve Mallory, played by George Peppard,
returns to pre-amnesia life only to discover, and be dismayed, that he's a lout,
barroom brawler, a drunk, and a womanizer. Peppard is perfectly cast because
"baffled" is his default expression. It's his gift.

Sally Kellerman, later Hot Lips Houlihan, is the vamp. Arte Johnson, later
Laugh-In's Wolfgang is the maniac. Herbert Marshall has the worst role of his
career, but if there were a lifetime achievement award for finger-acting, he
would win it. Robert Webber is the detective hot to prove that Steve Mallory is
guilty, but he should have been more empathetic because earlier that same year
he had himself suffered a full ninety minutes of amnesia in Hysteria (1965).

I could almost bring myself to admire this picture. It's well-paced, well-
directed, beautifully photographed, mysterious in parts; a couple of luminous
supporting roles. It flagged somewhere half way through. So did I.

Title: Shtisel
Date: May 14, 2020

The Israeli TV program Shtisel, about an ultra-orthodox, Haredi family, is soap
opera, but with a hair fetish.  It's all about beards, peyot, and sheitals; one
female character cries the whole night through because her wig slipped and an
inch of her own natural hair was visible -- to men. Sometimes it's taxing to be
empathetic to the Shtisel clan.

But even fanatics are people, and the business of the program is the same as the
business of all soap operas -- getting married, staying married, and healing
frayed marriages.

Shitsel sustained our interest through 24 episodes because the characters are
recognizable human beings and their problems were familiar and real. What is
different and foreign about the Shtisels and their Haredi compatriots is their
triumphalism -- they are correct and everyone else is wrong -- and the many ways
in the silly rules of doctrinaire religion constrict the characters' choices
and inflict upon them unnecessary misery. Shulem, the family patriarch, enjoys
funny radio shows, but he stops doing so because it's wrong. Zvi Arye is a
splendid singer, but he can't join a musical group because joy in music might
lead him in a secular direction. Uncle Nuchem loves classical music, especially
Mahler, but he destroys his tape of the Tragic Symphony because it is worldly
and therefore endangers his piety. The lead character, attractive young Akiva,
is a gifted painter, but his father and his uncle and his fiancee pressure him
to chuck his talents and become respectable, and pious, and a travel agent. Will
he give up on his genius?  Perhaps Season 3, if it ever gets made, will tell
us. I have nothing against travel agents, but Akiva's painting touches his soul.
The writers of Shtisel are right to see art as a danger to orthodoxy. It's a
solvent. Put religion up against art, and religion might dissolve. Which would
be a very proper outcome, in my opinion.

Here's my favorite line from a week of watching:  "When you see a Jew with a
dog, either he's not a Jew or the dog is not a dog."

I think it was Oscar Wilde who said that the most terrifying words in the
English language were, "I want to tell you about my dream."

Nevertheless, I persist.

Last night, I came out of a train station in Berlin (a city I've never visited
in my daytime life) but instead of a valise or luggage I had only a banjo case,
with a banjo inside and room for a couple of pair of socks at most. But I
thought, I have cash and I can buy clothes. Then I looked in my wallet and found
only a couple of one-dollar bills. I thought, now I'm in trouble. Nevertheless,
I persisted, and set out for my hotel. Then it started to rain, pour actually,
and I realized that I wasn't wearing proper shoes, just flimsy slippers. Next I
came to understand that I had no idea where to find my hotel.

So there I am with a banjo on my knee but nowhere to go, no cash, no proper
clothes, no hotel, in an unfamiliar strange city.

But now comes the "agency" part. I announce, to no one in particular, "I don't
want to be in this dream." And I woke up.

I'm very proud of myself for taking charge. A good precedent for tomorrow's
nightmare.

Title: Petruchio and Othello?
Date: May 26, 2020

It's an unlikely pairing -- what possible connection could there be between
Petruchio, a creature of farce, and Othello, distinguished general and tragic
victim of the green monster. Yet there is a surprising point of contact -- two
similar (but very different) reminiscences. It's not usual for Shakespeare's
characters to have a "backstory," but both P and O attempt one.

Petruchio brags that a shrew can't scare him, because he's been there before.
"Think you a little din can daunt mine ears?"

He riffs on the word "din." He's inured to noise, he claims -- and how he came
to be so adds a new and improbable dimension to his character.

Have I not in my time heard lions roar?Have I not heard the sea puff'd up with
windsRage like an angry boar chafed with sweat?Have I not heard great ordnance
in the field,And heaven's artillery thunder in the skies?Have I not in a pitched
battle heardLoud 'larums, neighing steeds, and trumpets' clang?

I, for one, don't believe a word that Petruchio utters and I doubt whether
Shakespeare expects us to do so. It's all bluster, the words of an accomplished
bullshitter. Petruchio is a youthful fortune-hunter, full of bravado and
effrontery to be sure, but except in this passage, he lacks an adventurous past
or a military history. When did he hear lions roar?  While on a Roads Scholar
tour of Scythia or central Africa? And where was the sea like an "angry boar?"
Where was the "great ordnance" and "loud alarum?" More likely at Saturday
afternoon serials than in the tented field.

Othello's story, on the other hand, though more extravagant and fantastic, is
grandly persuasive. Here's a piece of it:

I spake of most disastrous chances,Of moving accidents by flood and fieldOf
hair-breadth scapes i' the imminent deadly breach,Of being taken by the
insolent foeAnd sold to slavery, of my redemption thenceAnd portance in my
travels' history:Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle,Rough quarries, rocks
and hills whose heads touch heavenIt was my hint to speak,—such was the
process;And of the Cannibals that each other eat,The Anthropophagi and men whose
headsDo grow beneath their shoulders.

Othello veers into the mythological yet his story comports with what we
otherwise know of him.

Petruchio's tale is an instance of "just-in-time" characterization. Shakespeare
needs to display Petruchio's bravery in the face of a scolding woman -- so he
produces a soldiership story. It doesn't accord with Petruchio's history, but
it doesn't need to, because it serves an immediate necessary dramatic function.
Othello's speech is part and parcel; Petruchio's is a loose end.

And the language! The first passage, in early The Taming of the Shrew, is
perfunctory; the second, in the mature tragedy, is simply magnificent. Anyone
looking for evidence of Shakespeare's progress of a poet could do worse than
compare these two passages.

Everyone has their favorite 1940s "bad girl." Some of mine: Ann Savage in Detour

(1948), Yvonne de Carlo in Criss Cross (1949), Rita Hayworth in The Lady from
Shanghai (1947, and Lana Turner in The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946) but for
my money the baddest of them all, the baddest of the bad, is sultry homicidal
Lizabeth Scott as Jane Palmer in Too Late for Tears (1948). It's not just that
she murders her first husband, shoots her second, and poisons her accomplice. Or
that she sleeps with blackmailer Danny Fuller (Dan Duryea) to enlist him to her
cause. Or that she betrays friend, foe and family.Or that she's manipulative,
vengeful, hedonistic ("I want money") and depraved. It's that she's utterly
soulless, conscienceless, and heartless. Not a tinge of fellow-feeling. She
could out-Goneril Goneril, bad girl of the canonical classics.

The ending of the film is a disappointment. Instead of Jane Palmer sent to the
electric chair or locked in the hoosegow for life, she's allowed to fall out of
a window and die. Not fair -- I wanted retribution.

On second thought, if she had been arrested, she would have corrupted the
police, compromised the judicial system, and caused the death of a handful of
fellow prisoners and prison guards. Maybe it's just as well to kill her off and
be done with it.

Famous literary doppelgangers include Mr. Hyde, William Wilson, the picture in
Dorian Grey's attic, Leggatt, and Golyadkin Jr. In film, there are the sisters,
or twins, Kate and Patricia Bosworth, both played by Bette Davis and no doubt
many more that I don't know or remember that professional movie historians could
add. Doubles abound in the world of make-believe, but also occur in "real life."
I've had two doppelgangers of my very own. They are not official or clinical
doubles but they definitely manifest or "outer" fears that are embedded in the
less accessible parts of my brain -- they're my own personal Sir Smiles. They
have haunted me because they embodied the terror of what I might have been or
what might have happened to me if I dropped my guard. I never spoke to either of
these individuals -- only observed them at a fearful distance.

Many decades ago, when I was a graduate student, there was a rumor in
circulation among my peers that 50% of the students who finished their classwork
and comprehensive exams never completed their dissertations. Naturally, I was
afraid that I that I might fall into that ABD black hole. In those days, I
haunted Widener Library's vast reading room and there it was that I encountered
my first dreaded doppelganger. He was a bespectacled gloomy fellow, not unlike
me, but taller, ganglier, and, I think, homelier. The story was that he had been
working on his dissertation for 17 years. After I would sit I down to work in
a morning, he'd wander in, choose a place, open his briefcase, spread out his
books and papers on the table, sharpen his pencils and then, after a quarter of
an hour, get up and walk out and come back a few minutes later with a copy of
The New York Times. He'd read the paper in a leisurely manner, then put it aside
and turn to his dissertation. After a while, he would check his watch and then
go out for a cup of coffee. Shortly afterward, it was lunchtime; then it was
time for tea, and then came the hour to pack up and go home. Did he do an hour's
work during the day; not much more, maybe less.

Of course I feared that I could turn into this fellow. I suspect that it was
good for me to be presented with such a scary doppelganger. His negative example
forced me to keep my nose to the grindstone. Without Sir Procrastination, who
knows, I might be sitting at that library table to this day, pretending to write
that damn dissertation.

My second doppelganger is equally frightening but more contemporary. He's a
pathetic guy who lives right here in Boulder -- somewhere nearby, because he
frequently passes my window on his way to the mall, where he hits people up for
spare change. He looks alarmingly like me -- same size, same shape, roughly
of my age, though grayer and balder and dirtier. I could have been him if a
single one of my genes on a single chromosome had failed. There I would be,
living alone in a small room stacked to the gills with newspapers and magazines,
living off welfare and emerging only to shout leftist slogans at passers-by.
Doppelganger #2 is a crazy defective version of myself; a secret sharer who
embodies my deepest fears.

I confess that I hate these two guys, not for themselves but because I know that
I could have been them if I hadn't been lucky.

Title: Money
Date: June 09, 2020

I don't know much about economics and never did --it's an area of knowledge
that has lived up to its reputation as a dismal, arcane science. It's not only
economics -- I don't even understand money, which has become more ethereal and
symbolic during the course of my lifetime.

In my first real job, at Sears, Roebuck during the now-historical 1950s, I was
handed, come Friday at 4:00pm, an envelope containing a few bills and coins.
Money as I understood it.

A guy had bills in his wallet and put some in the bank and blew some on
CrackerJacks at Ebbets Field.

That was before credit cards and electronic transfers and bitcoins, whatever
they are. Of course I understand that money is not just currency. It's a
mysterious commodity -- much prized, but  also the root of all evil. It has
no value until you spend it, and then, once you spend it, you don't have it.
The monetary value of things is often inversely proportionate to their utility:
diamonds, pearls, paintings. To have money in the bank gives you a sense of
security. Then you die.

Most people have way too little money, but some people have more money than is
necessary and more than is good for their souls. I'm enthusiastic about taxing
wealth. Let's say a guy has $100,000,000. Suppose there's an annual 2% wealth
tax and he has to contribute $2,000,000 a year to promote the general welfare.
How is he harmed?  He now has $98,000,000. What can you do with $100M that you
can't do with $98M? And moreover, how incompetent must you be if you can't make
your $98M generate a few million and restore you to $100M. You can do good and
still stay rich -- what a blessing!

In my opinion, many Americans think about wealth and money incorrectly. They're
like the Johnny Roccos who always want "more." I was fortunate to be taught by
my father, who explained to me that "no one owns anything. The most you can
say is that you have a lifetime lease." He believed in this maxim even though
he spent his life negotiating real estate deals. He wasn't much concerned with
money and it didn't seem to harm him a bit. He had enough, and "enough is as
good as a feast."

To me, wealth means very little, but standard of living means a great deal.
My standard of living is very high because my town has an excellent public
library and a thriving public school system. And fine mountain trails and other
recreational possibilities. These amenities aren't "mine" -- they're not money
in my personal bank. But they contribute immensely to my standard of living.

What would improve my standard of living? That's an easy question. I would enjoy
my life more if other people lived better. If there were no homeless people
panhandling on the mall or sleeping under bridges. If unregarded old folks
weren't thrown into corners. If refugees were welcomed. If medical help was
available to all as a birthright. Etc., etc., etc.

I would gladly pay more in taxes if my tax money was spent wisely. I'd be
"better off." There would be less money in my personal pocket but more joy in my
life.

Title: Shakespeare at Work: the Oxymoron
Date: June 18, 2020

The oxymoron, a figure of speech in which there is a sharp contradiction
between modifier and noun, has become a boon to humorists: "business ethics,"
"military intelligence," "pretty ugly," "jumbo shrimp," "Christian Science,"
"Utah Jazz."  But it's a figure that has a serious side as well. The oxymoron
expresses very well the contradictions inherent in literary and also human
life.  Life is a mingled yarn, is it not?  Both fair and foul, sometimes
in the same moment; sweet sorrow. Because Shakespeare tried to convey the
complexity of things, he employed oxymorons  throughout his career -- in simple
straightforward formulas at the early plays, but in his maturity in innovative
and sometimes startlingly beautiful ways.

The oxymoron has a long pedigree. It may go as far back as to a classical trope
called the adynaton, or collection of impossibilities. There is a treasure-trove
of oxymora in Alain of Lisle's thirteenth-century poem (or, more exactly,
prosimetron) De Planctu Naturae in which "amor" is described as "pax odio,
fraudique fides, spes juncta timor... mistus cum ratione furor,/ Naufragium
dulce, pondus leve (peace in hatred, faith in fraud, hope joined to fear,
madness mixed with reason, sweet shipwreck, light heaviness); there is a similar
passage, from the same century, in Guillaime de Lorris extremely popular Romaunt
of the Rose that begins "Love is a hateful peace and loving hate."

The oxymoron was given new life and vitality by Petrarch, whose sufferings for
young Laura famously caused him to freeze in summer and burn in winter. Many
sonneteers, continental and English, were indebted to Petrarch, among them
Thomas Watson, a poet who flourished in the years of Shakespeare's adolescence.
One of Watson's poems, which contained the lines "Love is a sour delight, a
sugared grief/ A living death, and ever-dying life" lay behind young Romeo's
modish and easily parodied oxymoron-rich rhetoric: "O brawling love, o loving
hate,/ O heavy lightness, serious vanity,/ Misshapen chaos of well-seeming
forms,/ Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health.... " Romeo was so
besotted by his own rhetoric that Juliet couldn't resist a joke at his expense:
"You kiss by the book." Romeo in 1595 owes a lot to Will in 1580.

Shakespeare knew that Romeo indulged too much of a good thing. Half a decade
later, in All's Well That Ends Well, Helena imagined her perjured promiscuous
lover Bertram at the French court dancing attendance on the ladies in a series
of tired oxymora: "his humble ambition, proud humility,/ His jarring concord,
and his discord dulcet,/ His faith, his sweet disaster."  In these lines,
Helana, and Shakespeare as well, repudiated fashionable oxymoronic couplings. On
the other hand, it is not love but hatred and anger that give rise to Timon's
oxymorons. For him, the loathed Athenians, those "smiling smooth detested
parasites, are "courteous destroyers, affable wolves, meek bears."

In Hamlet, Claudius's insincere but brilliantly accomplished oxymoron          s
camouflage his sin. He ha                                                      s

as 'twere with a defeated joy,With an auspicious, and a dropping eye,With mirth
in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,In equal scale weighing delight and dole

taken Gertrude as his wife. The pairing of "auspicious" (the root meaning of
which is looking to the heavens to prognosticate by the flight of birds) with
"dropping" is especially wonderful.

Claudius's "delight and dole" were anticipated by Richard II's rhetorical
theatricality upon his return to England:

As a long-parted mother with her childPlays fondly with her tears and smiles in
meeting,So, weeping, smiling, greet I thee, my earth.

And there's the "wholesome iniquity" of the bawdy house in Pericles -- a play
in which calm comes in the form of "litigious peace."

In King Lear, a play about, among other subjects  a "precious unprized"
daughter, there is a submerged but stunning oxymoron when (in Edgar's words)
Gloucester is at last released from his suffering: "his flaw'd heart.../ 'Twixt
two extremes of passion, joy and grief,/ Burst smilingly." "Burst smilingly" is
a phrase which the younger Shakespeare could not reach; nor could any other poet
before or since.

Title: "Bisson Conspectuities"
Date: June 18, 2020

"Bisson conspectuities" is one of my all-time favorite Shakespearean oxymorons.
Although it's not as transparent as, say, "hot ice" or "living death," it's
much more quirky and colorful. "Bisson conspectuities" appears in Coriolanus in
one of the scenes in which Menenius banters with the Roman crowd. They attack
and he parries by enumerating his own strengths and weaknesses. He concludes
with an insult that flaunts his patrician education: "What harm can your bisson
conspectuities glean out of this character?" (In this case, a "character" is a
summary statement of a person's habits or nature, a "characterization".)

The odd word "conspectuities" is an invention of Shakespeare's. He derived it
from the participial form of the Latin verb "conspicio" -- to observe, gaze,
or watch. It's a nonce word, a hapax legomenon; unlike some of Shakespeare's
more inspired coinages, conspectuities never domesticated into English -- the
OED lists only this sole appearance. "Bisson," on the other hand, which means
"blind," was not new to the language but was in fact an ancient word of Germanic
origin -- and already obsolescent in 1608, although the venerable proverb "the
bysom ledys the blynde" might still have been current in the provinces. In
Hamlet, the deliberately archaizing First Player uses the expression "bisson
rheum" for "blinding tears."

"Bisson conspectuities" means "blind sight" or "blear vision." It's an
especially striking oxymoron because its component parts are drawn from opposite
ends of the word hoard -- old and new, plain and polysyllabic, Germanic and
Latin, rustic and citified.

But there's a complication. The word "bisson" doesn't actually appear in the
Folio; there it is "beesome." "Beesome, usually spelled besom, meant and
still means, "broom." But in the context of Coriolanus, broom is meaningless;
and so, beginning  with Lewis Theobald in the 1720s, editors have uniformly
substituted "bisson" -- an inspired conjecture but still a guess. It's possible
that Shakespeare wrote "bisson" and a scrivener or printer incorrectly read
'beesome" -- but perhaps not. An oxymoron of transcendent genius might be merely
an illusion -- a creation not of Shakespeare but of editorial tradition.

"Bisson conspectuities" puts quite a burden on members of the Blackfriar's
audience. It's hard to believe that Shakespeare thought his first hearers
would grasp the phrase's meaning on the fly. It's easy for us to understand it
now, four hundred years later, with a treasury of annotations at the foot of
every page. Perhaps Shakespeare didn't care if the audience comprehended? Is
it possible that he was writing just for his own delight, for his pleasure in
words? For readers rather than playgoers? Or perhaps he had already divined that
he was writing for enthusiasts and scholars of a latter age.

Title: Pitfall (1948)
Date: June 21, 2020

Pitfall is just shy of sensational. Error and evil intrude into a normal postwar
American suburban family. Jay Dratler and Andre de Toth, writer and director,
hit all the necessary film noir notes but without descending to cliche. The
beautiful blonde, is, for once, neither a temptress nor a gold-digger, but a
decent, troubled young lady; the private eye is not a lonely warrior for justice
but a brutal stalker; the police are not jerks; the wronged housewife is not
simple and materialistic but strong and resilient. Moreover, the plot is not
predictable and its ending neither pollyanna-ish nor disastrous, but balanced,
credible and inconclusive. There are no car chases.

Lizabeth Scott, Jane Wyatt, and Raymond Burr are terrific; Dick Powell is, alas,
Dick Powell.

Title: More Oxymora; Love's Labour's Lost
Date: June 23, 2020

I'm detecting oxymorons in everything I read. Perhaps I'm even imagining them.
Love's Labour's Lost is a "great feast of languages" and also a savory banquet
of rhetorical figures. Here are some of the oxymorons (or "cross-couplers," as
Puttenham called them) that I came upon in my latest re-reading of the play.
Some require explanation.

"Civil war," not 'civil" as in the American Civil War but civil as in "civility"
or good manners (like the "merry war" between Beatrice and Benedick). "Trencher-
knight" because a trencher was generally a wooden dish, not suitable for knights
-- and therefore a trencher-knight would be a low-born knight. "Living art,"
where the art is a portrait or a statue, and therefore not living and breathing.
"Loose grace,' where "loose" means worldly rather than spiritual. "Profound
simplicity." "Evil angel." "Dainty Bacchus," because Bacchus was notably
disorderly. "Sweet misprision," because misprision is a dereliction of duty and
therefore not sweet but sour or bitter. "Rational hind," whether hind refers to
an animal or to a person of exceedingly small intellectual gifts. In addition,
two near-oxymora: "merry days of desolation," "as swift as lead."

These figures of speech are not as obvious as those in Romeo and Juliet, but
they allow us to observe Shakespeare at work, experimenting with the ingredients
of language, just as he was hitting his stride.

Title: E & L Chafetz Family Circle c. 1946-1952
Date: June 29, 2020

When I was a boy in the 1940s and '50s, I was -- yearly or semi-yearly -- hauled
off to gatherings of the E & L Chafetz Family Circle. "Chafetz" was the maiden
name of my maternal grandmother, Sonia Green. "E" and "L" were Sonia's parents,
but the names that the initials abbreviated are gone for good. At the Family
Circle, twenty or thirty or sometimes even forty Chafetz siblings, cousins, and
spouses would share snacks, schnapps, and gossip. No question but that, selfish
and un-empathetic lad that I was, I very much resented being scrubbed and
fancied up to attend these meetings -- especially on a summer Sunday afternoon
when the Brooklyn Dodgers might be playing a double-header. Why would a young
scamp want to miss out on Red Barber and Connie Desmond in order to hang from
a subway strap for an hour and a half while the stifling IRT rattled to some
obscure corner of the Bronx -- just to while away the afternoon with a bunch of
old folks?

The Chafetz relatives were all immigrants from Belarus and thereabouts, born,
like my grandparents, in the 1870s or 1880s. They were small people -- tiny
really -- the men topping out at or 5'3" or  5'4", the women at 5'0" or
somewhat less -- their stature a consequence of their impoverished "old country"
childhoods. They spoke Yiddish or Russian to each other and very rudimentary
English to me. They smelled peculiarly -- of chicken soup overlaid with moth
balls, their "good clothes" having been retrieved from the storage closet for
this annual adventure. They assembled, if I remember correctly, at the second-
floor apartment over someone's store. (It seemed as though they were all keepers
of small shops -- newspaper kiosks or vegetable markets or candy stores or
perhaps a delicatessen or an "appetizer." One enterprising Chafetz cousin was a
glazier.) They seemed to be mostly childless -- or, at least I can't remember
encountering any other youths at these events.

Who were these people? Why were they so asymmetrical? Bent and twisted, most of
them, their faces marred by blackheads and lumps and swellings. Their mouths
were dental nightmares. Must I admit that my ten-year-old self was repelled and
disgusted, unconscious that their distorted bodies were a testament to their
arduous troubled lives?

Who was Uncle Joe Pessin? How was he related to me? What was his livelihood?
I remember only a small dark bald man with a grating voice. Did he have a
family?  And who were indistinguishable Lifscha and Leah? Were they twins or
sisters or sisters-in-law? Why did Uncle Usher smell so pungently? Was he in the
pickle or sauerkraut business? I know only that he had a great expanse of face
and outsized shoulders and that he longed to visit his brothers and sisters in
Winnipeg.

At these gatherings, I was put on display. My mother (my father refused to
attend) would take me around the room and introduce me to the various cousins
and uncles and aunts. It was a torment, frankly. "This is your uncle Nahum."
Uncle Nahum would shake my hand. I had nothing to say to him, but Uncle Nahum
asked the question that was every uncle's question. "How are you doing? You
doing well in school?"  "Yes, I'm doing well in school." And so this uncle
would smile beneficently upon me. And then on to the next one.

Because of what I perceived as their limited communication skills (though
English might have been Uncle Nahum's fourth or fifth language), I definitely
felt superior and condescending -- an acute embarrassment to me now. In my
heart, I silently patronized these strange people.

What I didn't know, and is so obvious now, was that I was much more important
to them than they were to me. That I was "doing well in school" were words
that they dearly wanted to hear. It was for my generation and for me that they
had braved the Cossacks, sold the farm, deserted from the Russian army, left
backward Belarus or Ukraine behind, endured the miseries of steerage, slept four
to a bed for years and half-acclimated themselves to a new world utterly foreign
to them. For me. They had sacrificed themselves to invest in me. So that I could
"do well in school," go to college, live a better life. I was their emissary to
America, to the future.

What could a ten-year-old have possibly known?  It's too late to regret that I
didn't learn their language and learn their stories. That world of theirs, that
universe represented by E and L Chafetz --- it's all gone now, vanished, present
no where else but in my failing memory.

Title: North and South (1854)
Date: July 01, 2020

I read Elizabeth Cleghorn Stevenson Gaskell's North and South (1854) on the
Kindle. It's a long novel, but I don't know how long because when I don't have a
book to heft, I don't know how many pages I've read and how many more are left.
I can only say that I became impatient after a couple of days and started to
think that Mrs. G. was being paid by the word. But just when I thought the novel
would never end, I stroked the Kindle one more time, and by gosh and by golly,
Mr. Thornton finally proposed to Margaret and bam! it was all over in a flash.
I was unprepared. If I had been reading an old-fashioned "book," as we used
to call them, I would have known that I was approaching the last page, and my
reaction would have been much different. Instead of shock, closure.

North and South was originally published in parts, twenty of them, and therefore
was consumed over a period of months. Later it appeared in book form, so that
enthusiastic readers might binge for a long day or two -- a very different
experience than reading in discrete chapters, and one I prefer. Kindle-reading
is a third way. It's less satisfying to me because I want the weight of the
book in my hand and I want to track my progress by means of the physical act of
turning the page. Electronic reading will no doubt become the norm; something
gained, no doubt, but something also lost. I think I would have been more
satisfied with the novel if I had a solid object in my hands rather than words
on a screen. Strange to say, but I honestly feel that it would have been a
better novel.

North and South is self-consciously "progressive." Those money-hungry northern
industrialists turn out to be decent people after all. The strikers may be
misguided and impatient, but they have a genuine grievance. Women might be able
to live richer lives with a dollop of liberation.

I confess that I am troubled when I read books that were progressive their
own time but that seem reactionary now. I know, and I've been taught, that I
should be more historical, less time bound, less, as they say, "presentist."
Nevertheless, I was astonished, even offended, that Margaret Hale was to be
branded a loose woman because she was seen with a guy at a railway station,
unchaperoned. Good thing the man who was with her turned out to be not a
potential lover, but her brother, otherwise her gross impropriety would have
banished her, lifetime, from the list of the eligible-for-marriage.

I know that Mrs. Gaskell wanted us to think well of the mill-workers, but why
the heck did she make them speak in an impenetrable provincial lower-class
dialect which makes them seem sloppy, and ignorant-- another species entirely,
less than human?  Even though I tried to resist, the characterization of the
masses left me alienated and angry.

And then there's a problem particular to me: every time one of her characters
failed or suffered grievous injury or died (there are a number of spontaneous
deaths in North and South), Mrs Gaskell felt obliged to invoke an all-purpose
explanation -- "God's will!"  "God's will" whether thoughtful or just a tic,
becomes, in this ostensibly progressive novel, a justification for political
passivity and quietism.

I like this novel better when I read it the first time -- in 1963. Although it's
unchanged (except for the kindling), I myself seem to have become much less
empathetic and more cantankerous. Age?

Title: "In This Our Life" (1942)
Date: July 07, 2020

Talk about movie "bad girls"-- here's one of the most sordid. In this Our
Life is a doppelganger story of two sisters, one good and one evil. Roy (sic)
Timberlake, played by Olivia de Havilland, is too good to be true. Stanley (sic)
Timberlake, embodied by Bette Davis in an eye-popping, raucous performance, is
wicked at the Lady Macbeth or Goneril level. She steals her sister's husband
just for the heck of it and then drives him to suicide. Quite the scandal
anywhere, but especially in 1940s class-conscious suburban Virginia. Her very
good sister Roy marries the decent man whom Stanley betrayed -- and then Stanley
tries to seduce him back. It doesn't work, I'm glad to say, and Stanley,
failing and frustrated, runs her car into two pedestrians, killing one, and
then frames a young "colored boy" (we might say "black man") for the murder --
and almost gets away with it. There's more in this competent soap-opera romance
melodrama: a touch of incest, some distasteful bigotry, crass materialism,
morbid hypochondria. A couple or three weak, enervated men, upon whom we wait
for ninety minutes to grow backbones.

The movie was directed by John Huston and Raoul Walsh and written by Howard Koch
(Casablanca), so it has classy bloodlines. It's so overcrowded with events and
loose ends that I guessed that it must have been adapted from a novel. And sure
enough, according to Wik In This Our Life was adapted from a famous-in-its-time
Pulitzer prize book by Ellen Glasgow -- which I should have known but didn't.

In This Our Life piqued my curiosity enough to download the novel onto my
Kindle. I'm intimidated, though. Kindle says 745 pages.

Title: "In This Our Life" -- the Novel by Ellen Glasgow
Date: July 08, 2020

In this Our Life, the novel by Ellen Glasgow is richer, deeper, and less bound
by convention than the film.  Film Life follows the inherited story for its
first forty-five minutes but then sharply diverges.

In the film version, bad daughter Stanley is less conflicted and complicated
a character and eventually devolves into a stereotypical noir "bad girl."
Novel Stanley doesn't drive Peter to suicide, nor does she she bring the film
to convenient closure by driving her car down a cliff. Novel Craig is far
less worthy and more passive than film Craig and doesn't redeem himself by
transforming into a sleuth who exonerates Parry.

Needless to say, the novel offers no Hollywood ending; in strong contrast, novel
Roy rejects Craig's offer of marriage because she knows that Craig is still
carrying the torch for Stanley. Instead, she tries desperately to leave town
and start life anew -- but it's not clear whether or not she will make a clean
getaway. We hope that she will.

The most extensive revision is to the character of the sisters' father, Asa
Timberlake. In the film, he's a uxorious martyred browbeaten milquetoast who is
the long-suffering caretaker of his hypochondriacal bedridden wife. In Ellen
Glasgow's novel, much of which is seen through his eyes, Asa loathes his wife,
knows that he's wasted his life, craves affection, and even admits to himself
that he wants her dead so that he can be free. It's Asa, not Craig, who unravels
the mystery of the automobile accident. Moreover, glory be to the proper gods,
Asa has a secret lady friend, a widow/farmer a dozen years his junior, whom he
visits on his occasional day off. And he nurtures an escapist fantasy that keeps
him sane -- he wants to end his life as a simple farm laborer. He doesn't quite
get there at the novel's end, but there's hope. Kaye, his very healthy, very
appropriate mistress (we think sexual partner, though Glasgow hedges) assures
him that she will always have an opening for a hired hand.

Title: Lucasta
Date: July 13, 2020

The "plot" of the lyric is simple: the "speaker" leaves his beloved in order to
"fly" to battle (he fought, naturally, on the royalist side). He loves "honor"
more than he loves his mistress. In fact, and perhaps paradoxically, honor has a
multiplier effect on his love. And yet, although honor enhances love, honor is
always primary, love subordinate. It's a curious kind of love lyric in which a
suitor says to his beloved, I like you, but only second best.

What is "honor" for Lovelace?  It's a word with a spectrum of meanings --
nobility of soul, magnanimity, scorn of meanness, reputation, privilege of
rank or birth, even chastity or virginity. But none of these possibilities
seem to specifically apply in this poem.  For Lovelace and his Lucasta,
honor is military. It is something won on the battlefield. About this he is
uncompromising: the "new mistress" he will now "embrace" is "a sword, a horse, a
shield" -- "war and arms." Not the "arms" of a lover, but weapons.

A cynical being might therefore rewrite the last two lines of the lyric thusly:
"I could not love thee (Dear) so much,/ Lov'd I not warfare more." Flat,
imperfect poetry, but the parody is perhaps what the demystified poem actually
asserts. Make war, not love.

What sort of war?

The primary weapons in the battles of the 1640s were mortar, cannon, musket,
caliver, carbine, harquebus, and pistol. Sword, horse and shield had not
entirely disappeared. Edge weapons were still in use, and the horse would remain
the primary engine of war until it was supplanted in the twentieth century by
internal combustion vehicles. But it would have been suicidal folly to go into
1640s battle with Lovelace's museum of weaponry. For "honor" and for the benefit
of Lucasta, Lovelace evokes a romantic nostalgic world of tilt and tourney.
Single combat, knight versus knight, hot horse against horse.

Lovelace imagines himself glorious in single combat, his mistress's favor
(handkerchief or scarf) streaming from his helmet. It would not be so glorious
to be mutilated by a cannon lugged into place by a base pioner.

Lovelace easily conflates love, which is a private emotion, with military
honor, which is clearly a public achievement. Very public, indeed, which is
what led Baruch Spinoza, Lovelace's younger contemporary, to note that "honor"
is not intrinsic, not an act of personal realization, but rather "a slavish
subordination to the opinion of others."

"I could not love the (Dear) so much,

Lov'd I not a slavish subordination to the opinion of others more."

The rewrite has a different ring.

Why was I surprised that this was such a fine film? I should have done some
research before viewing. It was written by Robert Riskin and Jo Swerling. Riskin

Mr. Deeds Comes to Town. Swerling wrote It's a Wonderful Life and Lifeboat. The
Whole Town's Talking was directed by John Ford, venturing, for once, out of
Monument Valley and into comedy.

It's an amusing doppelganger movie, with Edward G. Robinson playing both Jekyll
and Hyde. His Hyde is a monster gangster of the Little Caesar variety; his
Jekyll is a meek apologetic clerk. Both of his manifestations are interested
in Jean Arthur, the wise-cracking babe, but Jekyll doesn't get her until he
assimilates some hydeishness and gets Hyde killed. That's America for you; until
you're willing to resort to violence, you're not going to land the lady.

Title: The Way We Shop Now
Date: July 18, 2020

The last time, a decade ago, that I needed a rug pad, I went hunting at various
malls and shops that might stock such an item. After a few exhausting hours, I
located an appropriate-size rug pad at one of those large import stores -- it
may have been Pier 1 or WorldMarket. The quality wasn't quite right, and the pad
was too large and too costly, but it was there --  and I do possess a utility
knife with a very sharp blade. So I bought it, struggled with it, but -- it
worked, and it's still there, doing its job, padding the Heriz.

This time, covid-time, I'm not allowed to search around town, and I don't want
to, so instead I did some internet sleuthing for "rug pad."

It's a revelation -- there are many, many vendors very anxious to satisfy my rug
pad needs: RugPad USA, Mr.RugPad, RugPads 'R Us, Rugpad-orama, eSaleRugPads,
RugPadStock, RugPadHome, RugPadSolutions, Dr. Pad, RugPad World, Royal-T
RugPads, Underfoot-Inc, and My Rug Pad, among others. Costco sells a "Mohawk"
rug pad made of "100% post industrial recycled synthetic fibers with all natural
rubber with SBR latex backing," whatever that is, not cut to exact size, and you
have to buy a shrink-wrapped package of four.

I choose RugPadUSA not only for patriotic reasons but because its site featured
a lengthy explanatory essay on the potential disasters, hazards and glories
of various species of rug pads. Are you not shocked to learn that that some
inferior rug pad manufacturers pad out their fiber with clay?

RugPad USA is a company that takes its rug pads very seriously. I am now up to
snuff on Grip, Cushion, Longevity, Sustainability, Safety, and Made-in-America-
ness. And also on materials: rubber, jute, felt, Pure Wool, hemp, and memory
foam, in their various forms and combinations (and prices).

I went with an "eco friendly Nature's Grip 100% natural rubber and plant jute."
It arrived in four days, cut to exact measure. Perfect. This rug pad is so
beautiful, let me tell you, that I'm thinking of laying it on top and putting
the old tribal Turkish Varamin tent rug underneath. Well, maybe I'm getting too
enthusiastic about my glorious new rug pad.

Advantages to internet shopping: it lets your fingers do the walking, there are
an infinity of choices, and after a while the item appears miraculously outside
your door. Disadvantages: you can't see or feel the product before making a
decision; it's a pain to return mistakes; your cash goes to an absentee merchant
(RugPad USA is located in Connecticut); local shops suffer, and also, slightly
delayed gratification. But the electronic mall is definitely the way we shop
now.

Title: Where I Stand
Date: July 19, 2020

I stand, like most in my cohort who have lived ordinary, conventional lives,
at the midpoint of a continuum stretching from grandparents to grandchildren
-- at an imaginary apex looking backward and forward, Janus-like. I remember
my grandparents, though only at the end of their long lives, and I know my
grandchildren, though only at the beginnings of theirs. Two generations back,
two generations forward and with 81-year-old me at the fulcrum.

It's been a long eventful tramp from there to here. My grandfather Isaiah
was born in 1863, a hundred and sixty seven long years ago, and my youngest
grandchildren, the twins Caleb and Asher, joined us just five years ago, in
2015. Although it was only an instant in geological terms, nevertheless, the
interval from my grandfather's birth to this moment has seen glaciers melt,
rivers change their course, cities arise, plants and animals go extinct,
governments and empires grow and decline, wars and epidemics rattle the planet.
He lived in a world of serfs and rabbis and pogroms; the grandchildren live in a
world of nuclear proliferation, global warming, threats to democracy.

There have also been tectonic shifts in the microcosm of my own family. My
Ukrainian-born grandparents would not recognize my third-generation American-
born grandchildren, and my grandchildren would have an even more impossible task
to understand or appreciate the lives of the great-great-grandparents. It's a
long leap from StaryConstantine, old Constantine, in the nineteenth century,
where my family originated in backward village Ukraine to Washington DC or
northern California or Boulder Colorado in the twenty-first. Rural to urban,
agricultural to technical, provincial to worldly, religious to secular, inbred
to genetically various. My grandparents were born into a world of carts and
horses; my grandchildren play with computers in their cribs. Yet here we are.

We're the same, but different. According to family legend, my grandfather Isaiah
left StaryConstantine and his family of origin because of a dispute about
religion. They, his father and family, were devout but he was a non-believer.
In this regard, Isaiah was a true patriarch, because he established an enduring
family template. Over the generations, we remain hostile or sometimes only
indifferent to religion -- and in its place we embrace the evidence of the
senses and the primacy of reason. Looking backward and forward from my pinnacle,
I cannot identify a single lapsed atheist or backslider in the family landscape.
I know that my father never attended a house of worship except for a rare
funeral or wedding. For him, the sabbath was sacred only to his roses and
azaleas. I once asked him if his father, Isaiah, had ever visited a synagogue.
He said, "I can't swear about what happened in the Ukraine, but I know that once
he got here he never did." For Isaiah, atheism would have been a revolutionary
fracturing; for subsequent generations, not even slightly stressful. The
precious gift of atheism I once called it.

What has replaced religion? Our extended family remains a people of the book.
Among my grandfather's forty-seven direct descendant, thirty-five of whom are
alive, six have written books, another is a journalist, and five others have
earned law degrees, where not unlike the older generations of Talmudists, they
can engage in disputations over nice sharp quillets of the law. There are
no rabbis, but I can count at least ten teachers of one secular subject or
another. My grandfather had no official schooling, but every one of his great
grandchildren is a college graduate and many of them have post-graduate degrees.

There are some families that can boast of painters or violinists or actors
in their old world heritage; not ours. Nor have we become creative or
imaginative in the new world. I count no poets, no musicians, no actors, and
except for my outlier brother who once wrote a novel and now makes bricolage
sculptures, no artists. If we make anything, it's useful. Furniture or pottery
-- not paintings. But then, no criminals or alcoholics or wastrels either.
We're substantial reliable citizens -- firmly nouveau bourgeois. We may be
conventional and dull, but we are what my father used to call, without irony and
with great pride, solid, tax-paying citizens.

Mogambo (1953), directed by John Ford, is an eternal-triangle story in which
earthy Ava Gardner and prim Grace Kelly compete for white hunter Clark Gable.
Unfortunately, it's less engaging as a romance than as a travelogue -- it offers
spectacular footage of African megafauna (hippos, giraffes, lions, gorillas,
etc.).

Whenever I watch classic films set in "the colonies," I'm fearful that the
native people will be exoticized and orientalized and trivialized, but I'm happy
to report that Mogambo is less offensively Tarzanish than most -- setting aside
a couple of embarrassing "fakelore" episodes. I would have been even happier if
the Africans weren't just animated wallpaper -- bearers or rowers or dancers
or spear-throwers -- and that they weren't depicted as entirely subservient to
their white overlords. Mogambo is based on Victor Fleming's pre-Code Red Dust
(1931) -- a much more sensual film than Mogambo and one which allowed Jean
Harlow lots of room to wink and flirt. It's most odd that the glamorous sexy
hunter in both Red Dust and Mogambo is played by Clark Gable - a rare example
of filmic auto-reprising. He's hyper-masculine, at age 30, in Red Dust but in
Mogambo it's too too obvious that his hair has been dyed a shiny black. When he
pounces on Ava and Grace and mashes their mouths with unpersuasive 50s kisses,
it is taken for granted that both ladies will immediately grow weak in the
knees.

I grew even less Gable-dazzled when I discovered a weird anecdote in Donald
Sinden's recollection of the filming of Mogambo. (Sinden played the part of
Grace Kelly's spineless, intellectual, oblivious husband). Sinden reports that
(prepare yourself to be stunned and disillusioned):

before leaving camp on the first morning [of shooting] I had been told to report
to the hair-dressing department's tent, where I found the make-up men armed with
electric clippers: 'I have to remove the hair from your chest.' 'Whatever for?'
I asked, 'Orders.' It transpired that Clark [Gable], whose chest was completely
devoid of hair, had always insisted that no other actor should appear on film
exposing a hirsute breast. This included any member of the crew not wearing a
shirt as well. He considered it a slight on his masculinity.

Surely, this is one of the most bizarre anecdotes in movie history. The King of
Hollywood, the legend whose mere presence famously set roomfuls of maidens all
a-quiver, was so sexually insecure that he required mass depilation of cast and
crew! Follicular fragility! Big-time nuttiness?

Question: was it in Clark's contract that he had the right to dictate the degree
of chest shagginess of cast and crew -- or was he just throwing his weight
around?  Suppose Sinden or some sweaty best boy had refused the electric
clippers. Would the production have ground to a halt?

It's well known that since the time of Samson and probably before, male hair
has been associated with strength, but even Delilah didn't set out to defoliate
every man in Gaza.

But Clark Gable's chest hair insecurity is only Donald Sinden's second most
curious anecdote. Even more astonishing, at least to me, is that Sinden suffered
from "negative buoyancy." Negative buoyancy is a condition in which a person is
unable to float in water. In Sinden's case, negative buoyancy was discovered, he
says, while filming a shipwreck scene in The Cruel Sea (1953). Sinden started
to sink and was rescued from drowning by his co-star Jack Hawkins.

Almost all human beings float. Bob like corks. I don't, and neither did my
father nor my male descendants. As a family, we're sinkers. I don't know why,
except that perhaps we have an eccentric specific gravity or because our swim
bladders go on the fritz, like sick fish. We regularly and uniformly plunge to
the bottom, like a stone or a heavy lump of lead.

How wonderful to know that there is a dignified name for our peculiar family
trait: "negative buoyancy."

And now we can be consoled that we're not alone.

There's got to be a support group for the negatively buoyant out there,
somewhere.

Title: "The Small House at Allington" (1863)
Date: July 29, 2020

The nation is in an uproar -- the Covid-19 pandemic, mass unemployment, racial
reckoning, disorder in the streets, Russians sabotaging our elections, ignorant
authoritarian leadership.

We ourselves are sheltering at home, and are healthy, thanks to the masks and
the cooperation of friends and neighbors, but there's little hope of a getaway.
We certainly can't travel. What to do for an escape? There's no frigate like a
book, so it's time to read a long leisurely novel by Anthony Trollope.

The Small House at Allington is the fifth of six in the Barsetshire series. Had
I read it before? Certainly, but it doesn't matter. To read a Barset novel is to
put on well-worn old clothes. Loose slippers. The Small House is comfort food.
It's the mac and cheese of novels.

It's not 2020, it's 1863. Outside of Barsetshire, millions of working-class
Englishmen are living in grinding, soul-destroying poverty. Cholera is rampant.
India is being pillaged. Ireland is trying to recover from famine and mass
emigration. There's a second Opium War in China. British ships are running
the Union blockade of Confederate ports. But all is as ever in the perennial
untouched Allington microcosm.

Should the Dales continue to stay in the dower house even though the squire is
sometimes impolitic?  Should Adolphus Crosbie choose to marry Lily Dale (yes!)
or Lady Alexandrina de Courcy (big mistake)? Will Plantagenet Palliser run off
with Griselda Grantly -- don't do it, Planty Pall!  Should Lucy Dale accept
a dinner invitation from the Earl de Guest? Why won't Isabella Dale agree to
accept her cousin Bernard as a husband? -- everyone in the family thinks it's a
good idea, except Bell herself, who prefers poor but faithful Dr. Crofts.

Political and economic problems do not intrude into the small world of the Small
House. Finding a mate, keeping a mate, repairing a frayed relationship is its
subject; equally important for men, is to locate a woman of means, so that one
can support a comfortable style of life without stooping to real work.

Adolphus Crosbie, although far from our favorite, accurately describes the
three things that he requires in a wife: that she be of a good family, that she
have money, and that she be beautiful. Does Mr. Crosbie possess these qualities
himself?  No. But he does have a handsome set of whiskers, which seems to be
sufficient.

Title: My Life in Objects -- I (Tumblers)
Date: August 09, 2020

I bought these water glasses (sometimes called tumblers) about 35 years
at a long defunct antique shop in Lafayette, Colorado. They fall into the
large category known as Depression Glass in the trade and they were probably
manufactured in the 1940's or 50's -- but that's just an unsupported speculation
on my part. I don't know the name of the manufacturer so they are works of art
without provenance. I love the clean lines -- straight at the base and then
slightly flared at the top -- and also the way the glasses fit so elegantly into
the human hand. The tumblers are entirely unadorned and if they have a style
other than vernacular I suppose they might be called Art Deco. I once had a few
more of these tumblers -- perhaps as many as eight, but because they are in
constant use there have been losses. There's no saying how long these beauties
will survive -- the rims are a bit fragile and vulnerable in the dishwasher.
Although they have no monetary value, they are in my opinion both classy and
classic.

Title: My Life in Objects -- II (Owen Pots)
Date: August 10, 2020

This appealing pitcher and vase set were thrown by Ben Owen II, a potter
who lived and worked in Seagrove, North Carolina. In September of 1966, we
visited Tom and Margaret in Chapel Hill and they took us on an excursion to
Seagrove, where we bought these fine works of art. Ben Owen was very much a
traditionalist, sticking closely to tried-and-true shapes and glazes. He was
"old-fashioned," and I am equally so. Lots of weird things have been done with
clay during the last sixty years, but these shapes are more pleasing to my eye
than modernistic distortions and abstractions.

The glaze is called "frogspit" but "frogskin" would make more sense.

When I moved to a new home in 2009, the Ben Owen pots disappeared. I thought
they had been lost in the move, but after a couple of years of searching, I
located them. In fact, I had packed them so carefully and securely that they
were virtually buried. But I persevered.

These splendid objects have now (except when they went AWOL) been on prominent
display wherever I've lived for more than half a century. It's curious, and a
fact, that not one guest has ever asked a single question about them. They've
not been noticed. Are my friends unobservant?

I think that the pitcher and the vase are so discreetly beautiful that they
don't demand attention, a fact which makes me love them all the more.

Title: Words of My Life -- Umpire
Date: August 10, 2020

Despite its marvelously odd sound, there was no word more familiar to me as
an infant than "umpire." "Umpire!!"  Say it, savor it, roll it about in
your mouth. It's a downright peculiar word. Am I exaggerating when I say
that "umpire" came into my ken right along with the initial acquisition of
language? And that it was accompanied by such other linguistic weirdnesses
as "inning,""fungo," "shortstop," "blooper," "rosin bag," "balk" (pronounced
"bawk,"),"dugout," "fan","knuckleball," "southpaw," "mitt," "bullpen," and
"slump" (among many others). Common baseballese words, all of them -- but
"umpire" is the strangest of them all, so foreign-sounding that some of the
lesser lights in the PS 217 schoolyard pronounced it "empire." The abbreviation
"ump" ("Kill the Ump") sounds less like a word than a stifled snort or
eructation.

The word came to us by a devious roundabout route. The "p" and "r" in umpire
descend from the Latin "par" (equal). Old French had nonper which came into
Middle English as noumpere. "A noumpere" became "an umpire"; it lost its "n" by
the same process of rebracketing or resegmentation by which "a nadder" became
"an adder" and "a napron" became "an apron" (and "an ewt" became "a newt").
"Noumpere" was not a sporting term; it signified a neutral arbiter of a dispute.

So Don Adriano de Armado in Love's Labor's Lost,  a man of "fire-new words," is
an "umpire" of mutinies, where mutinies simply means disputes. And Juliet says
that "twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife/ Shall play the umpire" -- a
phrase which Samuel Johnson glossed as "this knife shall decide the struggle
between me and my distresses."

Umpire did not acquire a sporting turn until 1861, just in time for the arrival
of the national pastime.

Most American sports feature a judge or a referee rather than an umpire, though
American football, which is highly policed, offers a referee, a head linesman,
a line judge, a back judge, a side judge and a field judge, in addition to an
umpire, who does not call balls and strikes, but instead counts the number of
players on each side, checks their uniforms, and watches out for an offensive
lineman who might illegally wander downfield. Because umpires are positioned
behind the defensive line they are subject to inadvertent concussions and
dislocations -- still another justification for my personal boycott of football.

In 1950, Beans Reardon and Jocko Conlan and Al Barlick were names as familiar as
Hodges and Campanella. Nowadays I could not name a single major league umpire.

Title: My Life in Objects -- III (Rug)
Date: August 11, 2020

Althea bought this rug at an auction in Warren, New Hampshire in 1968 -- and it
is the first rug we ever owned -- the first of many. I was startled when she
bid on it because we were in the market for crockery and glasses and chairs,
not for decorative objects, but she saw and appreciated its beauty. It's a rug
for a wall because it's too old and fragile to be tread upon by the shod. Rug
expert MP says that it's from the Caucasus -- specifically it's a Konaghend
Kuba -- from the late nineteenth century. Of course we didn't have the faintest
idea of its provenance but we knew that it was very appealing. In fact, I
was so inattentive that I owned and admired the rug for forty years before I
noticed that it was a prayer rug -- the mihrab is not much pronounced. Nor did I
appreciate the abrash; the indigo blue ground disappears two thirds of the way
down. It's probable that the woman who wove it ran out of wool from a particular
dye lot, but it's also possible that the weaver was nomadic.

When Althea lived in Washington for a year in the 1990s, she took this rug with
her -- the only personal possession (aside from clothes, of course) that she
brought. And then many years later when she entered the Alzheimer's institution,
I hung it on the wall facing her bed. I thought it would be a comfort to her --
but alas she did not remember or recognize it. When she died I  brought it back
home where it belongs.

This sugar and creamer are the only objecs I own that deserve to be in a museum.
They were made by Bauhaus potter Marguerite Wildenhain at her Pond Farm studio
in Guerneville, California, near the Russian River, sometime around 1972. I
don't think that the picture captures the strength or beauty of the workmanship.
They're beautifully thrown, beautifully glazed. To eye or hand they convey
almost magical power.

My charismatic, chaotic sister (technically sister-in-law) Phyllis brought these
to us from Guerneville, where she studied pottery for three or four summers with
"Marguerite." We sent her some cash to buy pots by the artist but these were
the only ones that we actually received. Phyllis bought many but she couldn't
bear to part with them. And then one by one her treasured possessions would slip
out of her hand or be knocked off the shelf by her cats or otherwise wind up as
shards. For many years after Phyl's untimely death I preserved in a shoebox the
shattered bits of one of Marguerite's most magnificent creations -- a landscape
pot which depicted  a dozen or so cavorting animals. Where is that shoebox now?

I rarely use these works of art -- they're too magnificent to put at risk.

On the bottom of the creamer, still visible next to the words "Pond Farm,"
Marguerite has pencilled a price: $12.50. But it's priceless.

Title: Pure Religion
Date: August 12, 2020

For me, the summer and autumn of 2010 was a bad period, even though it led
to the only moment of prayer and reverence in my entire life. Readers and
fans of this blague know that I have more than once reported that I was born
into a purely, even aggressively, atheistic family and that have remained an
unquestioning atheist to this day. So what happened, you ask, in 2010 to cause
me to lapse once and only once from a lifelong want of belief?

It began with a ruptured disc, which is, as fellow-sufferers know so well, an
extremely painful condition. Surgery was recommended, but by every statistical
measure, surgery works only half the time, and therefore I was reluctant and
frightened to be cut, and instead figured that if I could just wait out the
pain, perhaps the affliction would heal itself, as, I was assured, it usually
does. So I lay on my back, crawled to the bathroom once a day, and started
taking drugs. Powerful drugs: oxycodons every four hours, those big 600 mg
ibuprofens several times a day, lots of valium to deal with the agitation,
steroids (some by mouth and some injected directly into my back), and because of
the insomnia, more ambien than was absolutely necessary along with some other
miscellaneous pills and tablets, the names of which I can't quite recall. It
was my fault, in part -- I had too many doctors and no one was in charge, so
various medical people prescribed various pills, and because I was in such pain,
I gobbled them all.

After two months, I was still in acute debilitating pain and I had to face the
fact that my plan wasn't working and that something had to be done. I submitted
to surgery at the end of August down there at the Mary Hitchcock Hospital in
Lebanon. Relief was instantaneous -- why had I waited so long? But I was now
faced with the problem of drug withdrawal. Not having good medical advice, I
became the coldest of turkeys.

My digestive system went completely out of whack. For days, perhaps two or three
weeks, I could tolerate only the blandest foods. I survived on baked potatoes
and very little else. My heartbeat was very high and settled to an even 110 for
six weeks. I was agitated and nervous.I suffered from dramatic night sweats
-- two or three times I woke up with nightclothes soaked and dripping. Muscle
cramps.

And also severe constipation which led to badly bleeding hemorrhoids. For six
weeks, whenever I had to "honor a call of nature," I'd look into the pot --
bright bright red. Day after day. "O no! When is this going to end?" And then
one blessed day -- and here at last comes the moment of pure religion -- I
hesitantly inspected the bowl, and miracle of miracles-- no blood. And I cried
out, spontaneously, without forethought, these words: "Glory be to God."

What god? I wasn't in a theological frame of mind, but in retrospect, it may
have been Cloacina, the Roman goddess of sewers, to whom I directed my fervent
thanks. Or possibly Sterquilinus, although he was more a god of manure and
fertilizer than of the toilet bowl.

The good old Romans -- a god for all occasions! Even for me.

Title: My Life in Objects --VI (Settle)
Date: August 13, 2020

When we moved to Manhattan, in 1965, for a first real job, we had hardly a stick
of furniture. We thought we needed, in addition to a bed and a kitchen table, a
bench for an entrance hall. Wandering around Greenwich Village (Althea was very
big with child), we stumbled into an antique store, one of scores that populated
the area in those pre-Ebay days. Pisces Antiques, it was called and it was owned
by a young English woman named Kim Sylvester. (Isn't it astonishing that I
remember these details?) This bench (properly a settle) caught our eye, not the
least because it cost half as much as a functional bland modern equivalent at
Macy's or Wanamaker. "What is it?, I asked. Kim said, "English, Jacobean, about
1650." And so it was. A surprise.

I've since learned a bit about seventeenth-century English furniture and I'm
convinced that the large back panel is genuine. It's late medieval in style and
exhibits all three of the kinds of carving that are typical of the age. The four
central panels (stylized poppy on the outsides, stylized thistle on the insides)
are called "recessed ground." Separating the flowered panels are pieces that are
"gouge" carved. The crosspiece at the top is "incised." As for the body of the
settle, I suspect it's not very ancient, but instead assembled from old wood by
a furniture maker who had respect for the carved back and wanted to re-use or
re-purpose it. When was this reconstruction accomplished? It might have been
anytime before 1965, but most probably during the long 19th century. Possibly
during the so-called gothic revival period in the 1880s and 1890s.

I've admired this settle for 55 years. Nowadays It sits proudly just to the
right of our entrance door. I like it that our guests pile their coats and bags
on the Jacobean settle when they enter our home, not noticing that this discreet
piece of furniture is old and rare and singular. No one asks about it and I
don't tell. It's my secret.

Title: My Life in Objects -- V (Bell)
Date: August 13, 2020

This unassuming object played, and continues to play, a consequential part in
my life. It's a plain brass bell, unadorned, maker and age unknown. It's not
musical but when properly agitated it can make a helluva loud noise. It was
given to my mother in 1947 by her mother, my grandmother, Sonia Green. How my
grandmother came into possession of the bell, I don't know and can't imagine. A
mystery.

I begged it sometime in the late 1960s and have owned it ever since,

My family spent the summers of 1947-48-49 at Makamah Beach on the north shore
of Long Island. It was the high point of my childhood; I've written about those
glorious summers right here. The function of the bell was to call me and my two
brothers in for lunch or dinner. The clang traveled well even against the whoosh
of the wind and the rhythm of the surf. There I'd be, all alone, studying shells
or snails somewhere along the shore or on a sandbar, hungry, and I'd hear the
insistent jangle and hurry home. My brother Jon says that to this day he can't
hear the peculiar noise of this bell without salivating.

The bell was equally useful, a generation later, when my own independent,
wild children wandered freely around our Hackett Hill property. It rang,
they returned. I wonder if they associate its sound with corn-on-the-cob and
hamburgers. They have ample reason to do so.

And even now, of summers, when it's the hour for food, or just time to call the
day to a close, out comes the bell, and children, grandchildren, and guests
respond to its harsh but historic call.

Title: My Life in Objects -- VII (Tibetan Rug)
Date: August 14, 2020

I

It's not a very good picture, but then, I'm not a very good photographer. It's
a Tibetan rug, monochromatic and undramatic, but in my opinion, extremely
handsome. Sometime during the 1970s, a store selling Tibetan antiques opened in
Boulder, stayed with us for a very few months, and then closed. I fell deeply
and passionately in love with this rug, all the more so because its price was
greatly reduced during the closing fire-sale.

The rug is supposed to be "old" and it certainly wasn't recently knotted. It was
represented to me as being made of yak hair, but MP, our rug expert, fingered
it and said, "No, that's wool." MP wouldn't hazard a guess about its age, but
he did enlighten me about the symbolism: the three cranes in the center panel
signify longevity; the four corner figures are "happy bats," and happiness is
also figured by the four very small, almost unnoticeable, swastikas. So it's a
joyful rug. There are also many snakes and a number of figures that MP couldn't
identify. It's remotely possible that this rug was originally some sort of
monastic bench cover and that each of the crane figures represented a place to
sit. I doubt this theory because the sitters would have had to be very small
monks with tiny tushies.

Title: My Life in Objects -- VIII (Silverware)
Date: August 15, 2020

It's a place setting, sterling silver, "Diamond" pattern," manufactured by Reed
& Barton of Taunton, Massachusetts in 1958. I own nine such place settings as
well as a few miscellaneous serving pieces. I like them now but I didn't back
then.

In the 1950s, dear grandchildren, it was considered ideal for respectable
middle-class women to marry at a young age; if possible right after university.
Or even sooner -- when Althea graduated from high school, her Uncle Mendy, who
was never the absolute epitome of tact, said to her, "Don't worry, you'll meet
someone in college."

Despite her intelligence and experience, Althea was at heart a conventional
small-town girl, and she wanted a wedding with all the trappings -- and the
trappings included not just a cheese tray and a fondue pot, but a long white
dress and bridesmaids and a bridal registry and china and especially silver.

Althea chose "Diamond." If I was consulted -- I don't remember -- it wouldn't
have mattered. It was her decision. All I knew was that Althea and I were
moving from Ithaca to Massachusetts, I to graduate school and she to a teaching
position at Warren JHS in Newton -- and that if I wanted to wake up in the same
bed as my beloved, I had to be married (remember, grandchildren, this was the
retrogressive Eisenhower era, and men and women did not live together without
legal sanction). Apparently, in order to get married, it was necessary to go
through a series of utterly mystifying rites, all of which were arranged by
Althea and her mother. I was completely indifferent and oblivious to formal
wedding invitations and to seating charts and to the choice of music (a piano
player I believe) and most especially to the rabbi (who drowned himself in a
local lake a month after officiating at our ceremony). Honestly, I felt as
though I was just an extra who was trundled onto the set to stand next to the
bride and, when called upon, to say "I do."

But I console myself by remembering that I was not alone --that I was one
of an entire generation of bewildered half-grown gawky 1950s bridegrooms in
tortoiseshell glasses and borrowed suits.

Once I got my adult legs, I could admit to Althea and to myself that I resented
the "Diamond" silver. For 1970s me, it embodied and symbolized everything that
I disliked about the conservative prudish postwar culture into which both of
us had been indoctrinated. With the advent of the war in Vietnam, the civil
rights movement, and the series of ghastly assassinations, the silver became, to
me, an index of bourgeois conformity and pretense. It offended me, deeply. And
therefore the silver utensils went into the closet and remained there for 35 or
40 years.

When we shifted to this new address, in 2009, I took the silver out of its
banishment. I looked with new apolitical eyes. "Wow -- these things are
beautiful." The utensils were not elaborate, or fancy, or pseudo-baroque like
most such tableware, but clean, modest, spare, understated, and not at bit
pretentious. In retrospect, Althea had astonishing judgment and extraordinary
taste.

Upon investigation, I discovered that Diamond silverware is highly regarded
and much prized. It is, in the language of enthusiasts of mid-century
modernism, "important." It was created by Gio Ponti, who was, one might say,
the Frank Lloyd Wright of twentieth-century Italian designers. Among his other
achievements, Gio Ponti was the architect of the celebrated Denver Art Museum.

So now, at long last, I've restored the Diamond silverware to a place of honor,
and I enjoy setting the table with these sleek utensils. And I'm as pleased as
punch that none of my guests realize that when they spear that last fragment of
barbecued chicken, they do so with a fork of distinction.

Title: Yellowstone
Date: August 16, 2020

We watched the first season of Yellowstone (eight episodes, or about 350 full
minutes, all told). It's not our usual fare, but because a close relative, an
accomplished actor, has just contracted to appear in Season Four, it seemed
important to investigate. Yellowstone sustained our interest but in my opinion
it's mighty derivative. I think the title should be changed to The Sopranos
Go West. The principal character, played by Kevin Costner, isn't precisely a
Mafia don, but he's modeled on one. He owns a Rhode-Island-size slice of Montana
and he protects his property with gangster tactics. Like Tony Soprano, he
fights with his family, feuds with his consigliere, corrupts public officials,
strong- arms his enemies, and doesn't hesitate to bribe or ice his opponents.
Yellowstone creates a nasty dog-eat-dog Hobbesian universe that offers only an
occasional redeeming event and, among a huge cast, only two or three sympathetic
characters.

Yellowstone is not at all pastoral. The spectacular western landscape is brimful
with events common to gruesome noir and urban crime films. In the episodes we
watched, two tourists fell from a cliff and splattered, a woman was impaled by a
steel fence post, a teacher who tried to intervene in a playground scuffle was
accidentally struck to the ground and developed a brain hemorrhage, a cowboy
trying to leave his job was shot in the head and his body dumped in a ravine, a
new Yellowstone employee was branded on the chest with a red-hot iron, a woman
was crushed to death by a horse, two brothers-in-law were shot and killed in a
gunfight, a 10-year-old boy was stranded in a culvert with a rattlesnake twice
his size, a real estate developer was kidnapped and hanged, and a meth house
blew up and burned its occupant to death. I didn't keep a running tally of the
various atrocities so there were probably a few that I've forgotten.

We're hoping that our relative has a continuing part in the series (he's
supposed to play a doctor), but we're fearful that he'll be on screen for a
minute and a half before he gets his throat slit or loses a limb or two to an
enormous John Deere harvester. We won't know for a year.

It's called a transplant shovel, and it's manufactured by Sneeboer, a company
located in Holland. If you want to buy a garden tool from Sneeboer, you get on
the virtual line, and then wait until your number comes up. Worth waiting.

I have a weakness for well-made garden tools. This one might be the best I own,
my favorite, although the Felco #2 hand pruner is also a work of art.

Note the construction. The V-shaped blade is one piece of solid steel. It's not
screwed or bolted to the ash shaft, but rivetted, twice. The "D-handle" itself
is carved out of a single solid piece of hardwood, so it can't fall apart.

I use the shovel to dig plants from crowded areas of the perennial garden
to transplant or to separate. It's also ideal for poaching ferns from the
forest. The shovel is the only tool that lets you easily divide a woody clump of
Siberian irises (or any other clumping perennial). With a standard spade, when
you try to get a little purchase, you fall to left or right or to the ground,
endangering your cranky old vertebrae. It's a superbly balanced tool, a pleasure
to use. It's going to be around for many more years.

We call it the "magic shovel."

invisible, but if I had to be seen, I wanted to look as much like everyone else
as possible. The frames speak to the moment -- bland, ordinary, ugly.

But a few years later, during that period in the 60s and early 70s when there
were the bombings on the CCNY campus, anti-war marches and riots, and constant
social upheaval, I went rimless:

These were frames that I inherited from my father, so my new presentation was
part an anti-establishment statement, part paternal homage.

However, rimless glasses were not a good choice for a new father with three
active grabby young children. They required far too much repair and attention,
and so were always in and out of the shop. Eventually I was forced to switch to
glasses that were less political but much sturdier  -- titanium, in fact, which
is where I have remained for several decades, resisting design fads such as
huge, tiny, aviator and spangled.

Title: My Life in Objects -- XI (Typewriter)
Date: August 19, 2020

This is a picture, found on the internet, of the Underwood portable that was my
dear companion for many years. I bought it for $20 in the summer of 1956 at a
second-hand shop on Flatbush Avenue and I brought it with me to college. I even
transported it to Vermont for many summers and depended on it until the 1980s
when it was superseded by the word processor. In my mind's ear, the clickety-
clack of all those letters home as well as undergraduate and graduate-school
essays, and later, typed and re-typed manuscripts, still resonate. My fingertips
remember the cupped, pseudo-ivory keys.

It was a sturdy machine, only needing repair once, when, in a moment of
compositional enthusiasm, I hit the return bar so hard that I snapped i off.
Many were the ribbons that I wore to a frazzle.

I had enrolled in a course in "touch typing" at Erasmus Hall HS -- asa, ada,
afa, sdf, for twenty weeks. I took only the first semester of a two-semester
sequence because I was interested in the letters and not the numbers. My typing
has always been distinguished more by rapidity than by accuracy. I once claimed
that I typed so fast that my ribbon would break into flame -- a slight hyperbole
(but I admit that have always been a trifle vain about the speed of my fingers).
I am a noisy power typist and to this day I bang the keyboard of my computer
many times harder than is advisable or necessary. But heck, I learned my craft
on an imperfectly lubricated old monster of typewriter, probably purchased by
the NYC school district in the 1920s.

Where is that old Underwood now? Most likely buried in a landfill somewhere.
I should have reverenced it for all the hours we spent together. Given it an
honorable retirement.

Rest in peace, partner.

Title: My Life in Objects -- XII (Chair)
Date: August 20, 2020

This is my favorite chair. It's made of solid oak and was constructed at the
turn of the last century, possibly as early as 1880. In style, it's cross-
cultural, a hybrid -- part European and part pure American. The top rail, the
apron and the central splat are Gothic or Renaissance Revival, though they
are not carved as they would be if authentic, but pressed. Attached to the
stiles are matching extensions, the formal name of which I don't know, which are
pierced with what looks like a double keyhole -- an element of medieval style.
But it's a rocking chair -- and rockers are distinctly American in origin --
sometimes credited to Benjamin Franklin himself. I think it's a handsome chair,
but I must admit that it's not at all graceful. It's foursquare and clunky. Tho
body sits awkwardly upon the rockers. It's appropriate for me but it's not a
chair for the dainty.

I bought this misbegotten Gothic rocking chair at an auction, either in Fairlee
or Thetford, Vermont, in 1970, for $3.75.

The armrests are darkened from fifty years of supporting my sweaty forearms.

There's been lots of good sitting in this chair.

Title: My Life in Objects -- XIV (Puppy)
Date: August 21, 2020

This woebegone object was once a plump and thriving stuffed animal -- a bear, in
fact, though for some reason my children always called him "Puppy." Their only
other stuffed animal, a snake, was named "Snakey." Pedestrian nicknames to be
sure. I admit that our family wasn't very imaginative about naming our mascots.

Even though Puppy is past his prime, he's still a most treasured critter. If
the house broke into flames, and I could only rescue one item, I'd have to grab
Puppy and leave to their fates the jeweled goblets, the ancient diamond tiara,
the Stradivarius, the Vermeers, and the First Folios. Puppy is more valuable.

Puppy looks as though he was abused, but it's not so. He was only loved to
death. Because he was our only bear, the three children struggled for ownership.
Poor Puppy was a field of combat. He was pulled, stretched, thrown, dunked,
employed as a soccer ball, and in at least one memorable instance, voluminously
vomited upon. Over the course of the decades, the sad fellow lost almost all his
fur, his corneas, his entire snout, two-thirds of his stuffing, and both of his
original ears. I myself attached two prosthetic leather ears, only one of which
survives -- and also sewed on his asymmetrical leather mouth. In addition, early
in Puppy's career, I performed a delicate musicboxectomy.

Why only one stuffed bear to be struggled over? Why not three -- one apiece --
as would be sensible in families that hope to avoid sibling strife? Why the
paucity of stuffed animals? Because both Althea and I came from families that
were ideologically opposed to such indulgences. Grandma Anne, Althea's mother,
wouldn't allow stuffed animals in her home because they were "unsanitary."
My parents didn't much believe in toys of any kind -- kids were supposed to
make their own entertainment out of pots and pans. (My father came from so
impoverished a family that a stuffed bear would have been an inconceivable
luxury.) Therefore my brothers and I grew up deprived of warm, furry, reassuring
"transitional objects," which had no consequences whatsoever, for me, setting
aside the periodic gloom and the vast existential void in my soul.

Puppy is now in my care because my children can't decide to whom he properly
belongs. I hope they don't fight over him after I die -- he can't take any more
pummeling. I stow Puppy in a drawer of the old Irish desk, but because of his
long service to the family, he deserves much better. Rightly, Puppy should lie
in state, ensconced in an illuminated lucite display case atop a stately jasper
or malachite plinth.

Title: My Life in Objects -- XIII (Nang Yai)
Date: August 22, 2020

This is the most unusual and perhaps the most beautiful object I've ever
owned. It's a rawhide or leather puppet used in traditional Siamese theatrical
performances. On the reverse, it's dated 4 IX 85, or September 4, 1885,  which
I presume is the day the puppet was acquired (or "collected"). I purchased it
from an antique store in Denver in the early 1970s. The dealer explained that he
bought from the estate of a local man who had been a foreign service officer in
Thailand in the last part of the nineteenth century. I had never seen anything
like it, didn't know anything about it, but fell for it in a big way, and have
enjoyed it ever since.

It's called a Nang Yai puppet, and I've written a bit about it here.

She's a musician who plays a mandolin-like instrument. She wears an elaborately
decorated outfit with long sleeves and pants. For many years, she hung in a
north-facing window (our fierce Colorado sun would destroy her in a summer if
she faced south). Now she has a light box all her own, and when she's lit, she
dominates the room, but only in a benign way. She's harmoniously proportioned,
graceful and not without a touch of majesty. To my eyes, she's radiant. She
ennobles her surroundings.

Although my mother loved classical music and listened daily to WQXR, our family
did not own a phonograph. Eventually, sometime around 1953 or 1954, a record
player appeared courtesy of my older brother Eugene, who set it up in his
bedroom and also bought a few albums. His collection consisted of a few Broadway
musicals and some pop standards (Sinatra and the Mills Brothers for sure). He
allowed me to use his machine when he wasn't at home. What an opportunity! I
memorized Oklahoma and Guys and Dolls, among others.

When I was eleven or twelve years old, I was home from school of a week. Was it
whooping cough? The radio became my constant companion (no TV in those years).
Every day for a week, I listened to a "dramatization" of a novel by Dumas. I
believe it was Twenty Years After, but I can't be positive. The story was not
memorable, nor were the performances, but the "background music" was to my ears
astonishingly beautiful. On Friday, when the story came to conclusion, it was
announced that the music that had entranced me was the New World Symphony.

After I gained access to Eugene's record player, I saved my nickels and for
$1.98, the standard price of LPs at that time, I bought a copy of the Symphony.
It was an expenditure of significance, even for someone who was pulling down
$.75 an hour shelving books at the local public library.

Having discovered that one could buy and own recorded music, I little-by-little
added to my collection. By the time I graduated from college, I owned ten or
a dozen recordings. I remember Dennis Brain's performance of Mozart's Horn
Concertos, Paul Kletzki's version of Mahler's Symphony #1, an Angel recording
of Bach's Magnificat, and a Prokoviev Lieutenant Kije Suite. There were a few
others that I can no longer remember. But none of them were as important as the
Szell Dvorak, which was my gateway to the classics.

I'm listening to it now. Via Alexa.

Title: My Life on "The Hill," 1969-2009
Date: August 26, 2020

We settled on University Hill by lucky accident. Shortly after accepting a
teaching position, I received a letter from my then-chairman Harold Kelling,
urging me to write immediately to Professor J. D. A. Ogilvy, who had a house to
rent near the University. I jumped to follow instructions and in August, 1969,
the four of us (ages 30, 29, 4 and 2) took up residence in a small and lovely
jewel of a Craftsman bungalow at 9th and College. It was not only a splendid
home in which to start life in Boulder but it was also conveniently located:
walking distance to Norlin Library, to the bus to Denver and to the Boulder
Public Library, as well as just a block and a half from Highland Elementary
School. We lived in that fine house contentedly until January of 1973, when
(we were now 5, Eve having joined us in June of 1970) it became clear that we
needed room to grow. The boys, Nathaniel and Ben, were adamant that we must
remain in the Flatirons school district (Highland had been closed and abandoned
-- a significant loss to the community). The children had good instincts;
Flatirons Elementary was a wonderful school. It was led by Robert Rea, the
finest principal I've ever known. During the winter of '73, we migrated from 9th
all the way to a 10th street house that had, as they say, "good bones" but which
had been "modernized" -- actually brutalized -- by a succession of owners who
had trashed almost all of its Arts and Crafts splendors in favor of oversized
mirrors, bright green shag rugs, beaded curtains, flocked wallpaper, and plate
glass (replacing stained glass) windows. But heck, it was spacious for a family
of five even though fabulously expensive ($46,500). We felt fortunate. There was
a bonus: when Althea returned to work after a seven-year interval of pregnancy,
birthing, and nursing, she was able to walk back and forth to Boulder High
School, where she taught mathematics for many years. With the purchase of the
house, our commitment to the Hill strengthened.

10th street was our home for 35 years. Over the course of the decades, we
restored our abused home to the extent that our resources permitted. We
added insulation (its first) and a modern kitchen, refinished the oak floors
and stripped the paint from the warm fir woodwork, replaced the wallpaper
and allowed the ornate brass registers to glow once again -- and moreover,
transformed a backyard wasteland into a pleasing peony-iris-daylily garden.
I'm proud to say that we left the house in much better shape than we found
it. Meanwhile the neighborhood, sad to say, did not improve along with us but
spiraled downward. In 1973, when we arrived, three quarters of the 24 houses
on our street were owner-occupied; when we departed in 2009, only four or five
houses remained in family hands and the rest had devolved into rentals --
occupied and often over-occupied by CU students. Our block was representative
of developments that took place on the Hill during our years of residence.
While the Hill had once been an essentially peaceful place, with only a rare
disturbance, by the turn of the century, it had deteriorated into a combat zone
where we and our adult neighbors engaged in constant struggle with graffiti,
overflowing trash bins, weedy untended lawns, noisy late night and early morning
sleep-obliterating parties, neglected barking dogs, gratuitous intermittent
fireworks (explosions, actually!), thefts, vandalism, as well as fraught face-
to-face encounters with rude entitled young malefactors.

What had happened between 1969 and 2009? What caused the decline from a thriving
pacific neighborhood to a disorderly student ghetto? There were a host of
factors, a few of which I can enumerate. Probably most important is that the
University added at least 10,000 students during those years and did not provide
housing for a single soul. The Hill, just across Broadway, was easy pickings for
enterprising landlords, many of them decent but some unscrupulous, who bought
advantageously, and (inasmuch as rental licensing codes were largely ignored and
unenforced), maximized their income by dividing dignified, solid old Victorian
or Arts and Crafts homes into rabbit-warrens. Many of the new occupants were
first-time-from-home students who came from far away, spent a semester or two
boozed up and hung over, failed out, and left behind their tuition money, their
damage, and their trash. What might have been profitable for CU was disastrous
for the neighborhood. Along with the increase in the absolute number of students
came a resurgence of fraternities. During the late 60s and early 70s, when
many students opposed the Vietnam war and conceived themselves to be anti-
establishment, fraternities were among the institutions that were disfavored.
Membership in the frat clubs declined significantly, but then recovered with
the coming of the more conservative, less troubled Reagan era. I need not dwell
on the fact that the burgeoning fraternities, flaunting an ethic that was anti-
intellectual and pro-alcohol, were a major cause of increased neighborhood
disruption. Along with these factors, came the replacement of marijuana, the
drug of choice during the antiwar era, with beer. Marijuana, at least in the
mild varieties of the 70s, is a contemplative drug while beer is a noisy one.The
turn to alcohol had the effect of increasing the number of bars at 13th and
College; while there had only been a couple of drinking establishments when I
arrived (Boulder had been "dry" until 1967), by the time I left, there were
more than twenty such, and the area had become a drinking "destination" that
attracted outsiders to the street and inevitably also to Hill fraternity and
house parties. And then sometime during the 70s or perhaps early 80s, the
University moved many classes from a Monday-Wednesday-Friday to a Monday-
Wednesday schedule, which meant that the weekend, and weekend drinking, now
began on Thursday night and continued until Monday morning. It was sometime
during this period that a couple of national magazines proclaimed CU as the
nation's Number One Party School, which I must assume negatively impacted its
pool of applicants. In addition, the welcome liberation of women from oppressive
social restrictions had an unintended consequence: it led to much more alcohol
consumption by female students. What had once been a rarity -- a drunken woman
-- became, I'm sorry to say, commonplace. (I had become accustomed to male
revelers untrussing and pissing on my roses, but I was genuinely flabbergasted
to see young women pull down their panties to squat on my front lawn). Still
another factor was the advent of the cell phone, which made it easy for small
nomadic bands of young people to find each other and rapidly coalesce into
sprawling alcoholic hullabaloos. Both the city government and the university,
two institutions that should have noticed these developments, remained supine
and indifferent.

Then came the riots. In 1971 there had been a protest, which turned violent,
against Nixon's secret bombing of Cambodia. But the scary riots of the 80s
lacked a political or social agenda -- as far I or anyone else could tell,
they were meaningless expressions of anomie, anarchy, and vandalism. Asked
for justification, students claimed that "there's nothing to do in Boulder
but drink" -- an unpersuasive argument about one of the most prosperous small
cities in the nation, one in which gymnasiums, theaters, libraries, hiking and
climbing trails, swimming pools, and other recreational opportunities abound.
The Hill experienced four riots in three years -- associated, if I remember
correctly, with Hallowe'en or homecoming. Sloppy, reeling revelers crammed the
streets, overturned vehicles, and hauled couches off porches to set dangerous
street- corner fires. I remember one instance in which rioters on the prowl for
fuel appropriated a substantial section of the wooden fence at the alley side
of my lot. At last, the city took notice. A commission was empaneled to study
and make recommendations. I attended a few of these meetings and was impressed
by the seriousness with which the panel took its responsibilities. Members from
the Hill neighborhood were Terry Rodrigue and Annie Fox. A report was issue and
recommendations were made, but to no perceptible effect, and the deterioration
continued.

The riots led to the re-founding of the University Hill Neighborhood Association
by the late Jane Stoyva, Rosemary Crowley, Steven Walsh, Lisa Spaulding, and 
Eleanor DePuy, among many others. With my children now departed for college,
I was able to become a contributing participant. Simply put, the Association
was divided into two camps, which I thought of as the "enforcers" and the
"socializers." The enforcers (among them Terry Rodgers, Gregg deBoever, and Ken
Wilson) patrolled the neighborhood on Friday and Saturday nights, calling in
violations to the police. The "socializers" (myself and many others) tried every
which way to integrate the students into the community. In retrospect, neither
the one nor the other technique had much of an impact.

Nevertheless, the effort to socialize the young folk had very beneficial social
side-effects, at least for me. For example, I was a member of a small group
(with Kathy Tucker, Terry Rodrigue, and LeRoy Leach) that established the
annual Beach Park Party (does it still exist?). Not only did these neighbors,
who had been until then no more than faces to me, become my friends, but I
had the delightful experience, several years in succession, of dishing out
free ice cream to both adults and children. It was my best job, ever. On 10th
Street, Althea and I initiated an annual block party, where, for many successive
Septembers, we explained to new arrivals over hamburgers and beans that they
were welcome to the neighborhood but that they should respect the people with
jobs and young children who also lived on the street. For three or four years
I was part of a group that met monthly at The Academy, trying to figure out
how to make use of that institution's resources to benefit the community. I
made a lasting friend with one of the participants, Ron Roschke, then pastor
of Grace Lutheran. I edited an upbeat, cheerful bi-monthly newsletter that
was distributed throughout the hill to permanent and new residents alike. In
addition, I represented aggrieved neighbors at restorative justice hearings,
where young scamps were counseled by their practiced attorneys that to clear
their records and escape punishment, all they needed to do was to grovel a bit
and feign remorse. I attended and spoke at many City Council meetings. I made
many friends by patrolling our street on Sunday mornings with a black plastic
bag, picking up beer and soda cans, empty cigarette packs, those ubiquitous red
beer cups, and various pieces of discarded clothing. (If there's a good reason
why a bra should lie in the gutter on a weekend morning, I can't imagine what
it might be.) I made my best Hill friend, Vin Scarelli, when we met at 2 AM,
both of us on the hunt for "trumpet man" -- a student who like to pop out of his
house in the wee hours, blow his trumpet (it might have been a bugle) as loud
as possible, and then scurry inside before anyone could nab him. The reward for
these activities was that I became member of a vibrant community -- and there's
nothing like a common enemy to bring people together

I left the Hill in 2009 in part because I was exhausted by the fight but also
because Althea's illness had progressed to the point that we needed to live on
one floor, with an elevator.

I reside now in an age-appropriate downtown condo, but I regret that I can no
longer walk around the block and enjoy a brief "how are you" with neighbors with
whom I've collaborated on one project or another. I miss the society of the
Hill, but not its disorder. Among its other virtues, there could have been no
better place to raise children.

One might succumb to nostalgia -- except that when I sit on my Walnut Street
balcony on a summer evening, I can hear distant booms coming from up there on
the Hill, and I remember that they were exceedingly jarring and disturbing.
The far off blasts remind me why I relocated and they cancel out any longing
to return. But let me confess that if I were to come back to the Hill, I would
return as a committed "enforcer."

Can the Hill be saved, or is it doomed to further decline?  There's no better
location -- everything is at your doorstep -- schools, libraries, Chautauqua,
foothills, all the diverse riches of a large University. It's a neighborhood
of great architectural integrity -- an outdoor museum of 1900-1920 American
design, almost as interesting as antebellum New Orleans or Art Nouveau Riga.
Its housing stock is unparalleled in Boulder; in a better world, it would be
a tourist destination. UHNA does a wonderful job of advocacy, but it's in an
unequal contest with powerful political and business forces. I think it was
during the 90s that a few of us, the late Neil King most prominently, tried
to engage the university in an improve-the-Hill project. We proposed that
the neighbors and the university (we hoped also for grant support) pitch in
to create an entity that would buy houses on the Hill and rent them to, say,
newly-arriving professors or staff who would otherwise be forced to commute
from Lafayette -- nowadays, Erie or Ft Lupton. And by doing so little by little
to undo and reverse the tipping point and rebalance the ratio of adults to
students. Although Neil was persuasive and influential (he had once been city
attorney), he could not develop any traction with either the city or CU. I am
not sure if our plan was workable, but I learned that to save the Hill will not
be easy and will require big money, big thinking, and the coordination of many
disparate groups.

In the meanwhile, the struggle between the  enforcers and the socializers
continues. Should police educate or should they arrest and ticket our student
hooligans?  Let's do both. If a new first year student arrives in Boulder on a
Thursday, misbehaves during the weekend, and the following Monday forwards to
his mommy and daddy the news of a $5000 fine -- well, that will certainly be
educational, will it not?

Title: My Life in Objects -- XVI (Cart)
Date: August 27, 2020

It's a lawn mower, or as the John Deere people like to call it, a lawn tractor.
We call it a "riding mower." I've spent a thousand hours upon it and upon its
used-to-death predecessor. Keeping up the lawns take just about three hours --
twice a week in May and June, bi-weekly come a dry September. It's a useful
machine -- uncomplicated, rarely out of service, finely engineered. With its
wide cutting deck, I can maintain the lawns with minimum of fuss. It's a royal
pain when it does break dow. You can read such a failure here.

But it's not the mower but the #10 cart that has changed my life for the better.
I came into possession of the cart twenty years ago, and have used it, hard,
every summer since. Sometimes it develops a flat tire, but otherwise, it's
perfect.

In the pre-cart days, from 1968 to 2000, I possessed only a battered old
wheelbarrow. If you want to move manure from the pile to the garden, you can
fill a wheelbarrow with about two cubic feet of material. Then you use your own
personal arms and legs to haul the wheelbarrow to its target, always uphill, and
dump it. But if you  use the cart to move manure, you can fill it with a full
cubic yard or perhaps more of the "well-dried." Then you hop gracefully onto the
lawn tractor and let the mower pull the cart to your garden. The machine does
the hard work and your back doesn't "go out." (The rear panel of the cart is 
removable and with not much effort the front of the cart can be raised to dump
stuff out the back). You drive away a few feet and the cart empties itself.

Same thing with brush. If you've accumulated a couple of hours worth of brush
and weeds, and you want to move it to the brush pile -- why then, a trip's worth
is only what you can carry in your arms. But with the cart, you can stack and
compress the stuff and move ten times as much, especially if you've learned how
to make use of bungee cords. And again, you don't have to carry or drag; you
let the machine do the hard work. Some decry the gasoline engine, but I'm all
gratitude.

The cart allows me to do many times the amount of work as a wheelbarrow, and at
much less cost to my aging body. It's a gol durn miracle.

(Those are NGP's miniature donkeys, Big Joe and Little Joe, in the background.
They may not be aware of it, but they've also made important contributions to
garden fertility.

Title: My Life in Objects -- XVII (China)
Date: August 31, 2020

These very pretty pieces of china mean nothing to the world at large but they
have great importance to me.

When I was a boy, the only holiday that was celebrated at 539 East 9 Street was
Thanksgiving. Why was it not forbidden along with all the others? The reason, I
suspect, is that it was the holiday least tainted by religion.

My parents were not sociable people and Thanksgiving was the only time of year
that our house ever saw a guest or that I experienced conviviality -- which is
why this particular china pattern of became important to me. My parents owned a
broken set -- perhaps a dozen or so pieces. I don't know how or when they were
acquired, or why, but I do know that they appeared, annually, in November. To me
they said, and still say, not only turkey and sweet potatoes, but friendship and
laughter.

I'm still surprised that they owned such handsome pieces -- far too fancy and
decorated for our modest utilitarian household.

I inherited these remnants because neither of my brothers expressed any interest
in them. For the record, they are Charles Field Haviland, commissioned by
Macy's, and originally manufactured in 1938, so they would have been newish
when acquired by my parents. I once knew the name of the particular pattern,
but I've forgotten it. In the catalogue they're listed as "Head 174".They are
terribly respectable and have "establishment" written on their faces, but they
have almost no monetary value. Less than nothing, in fact -- you'd have to hire
a couple of guys to cart them away.

One day, on ebay, I found on auction a full set of of what I had come to think
of as "my family pattern."  A hundred or so pieces -- three different size
plates, soup bowls, cups and saucers, serving dishes, sugar and creamer, a
butter dish -- the works. Needless to say, it was not difficult to outbid the
competition. I "won" the auction -- a small triumph which I choose to regard as
tribute to my heritage.

Now, whenever we have guests, which is a lot more frequently, believe me, than
it was in my family of origin, out come the Charles Field Haviland dishes.
Especially at ceremonies and Thanksgivings.

I'm sad that my children show not the least interest in this chinaware. But why
should they? They were not a mysterious feature of their childhoods.

Perhaps, some day, one of the seven grandchildren will be intrigued. But I'm
doubtful.

Title: Amnesia on Film: The Secret Fury (1950)
Date: September 09, 2020

t

There are amnesia movies and there are gaslighting movies. The Secret Fury is
both, and, I'm sorry to say, it fails to hit two separate marks.

A bad bad lawyer and cadre of hired subordinates contrive to gaslight rich Ellen
Ewing (Claudette Colbert) into believing that, while amnesiac, she killed a
man. In any recognizable universe it would be impossible or at least extremely
difficult to persuade a sensible, mature woman that she suffers from a loss of
memory. Not in NoirThrillerMysteryLand, where amnesia is just about as ordinary
as a case of summer sniffles. So Ellen takes the amnesia bait and gets herself
consigned to a mental hospital until her boyfriend David McLean (Robert Ryan),
who is not the swiftest, finally figures out what's going on, and after a
frantic fistfight, rescues and vindicates his lady.

I myself was thoroughly confused by the multitude of loose ends in the plot. Who
was it who strangled the hotel maid, played by Ethel Mertz aka Vivian Vance? And
why?

Bosley Crowther of The New York Times, who hardly liked anything at all, was
more-than-usually outraged by this film. He called it "wantonly unintelligible"
and "cheap and lurid trash." I rarely agree with BC, but in this case he he went
easy on The Secret Fury. I was equally infuriated -- The Secret Fury is a film
without a shred of integrity. But what's to be expected when a phony case of
false induced amnesia is at the heart of the matter?

I feel for Philip Ober, who put his heart into playing the villain and was
forced to mouth with a straight face some of the most ludicrous dialogue ever
composed. I feel also for Jane Cowl, a graduate of Erasmus Hall High School,
who played bland Aunt Clara. Jane Cowl had a long career and appeared in many
respectable films. This one is an embarrassment.

So is the crowded, unartistic poster.

Title: My Dreamatorium
Date: September 14, 2020

The house was surrounded by bears. They were, I must admit, not very convincing
bears -- my dreamatorium didn't seem to be able to generate realistic grizzlies.
Instead, these bears looked like actors in bear costumes. Even though they were
silent, they were menacing and I was frightened. I remained inside the house
trying to protect some children who may or may not have been my own offspring. I
thought, if I just fire my pistol into the air a few times, I should be able to
scare the bears and drive them away. So I started to look around for my pistol,
but no luck. I searched the drawers, several of them, and also looked through
my luggage. No weapon. Then I had a revelation. I remembered that it's not in
this dream that I have a pistol -- that was in an earlier dream, a few days or a
few weeks ago. If there's no pistol, how do I deal with the bears?  I was out
of ideas, but just then a woman, not someone known to me,  but middle-aged and
blonde, appeared, and inquired, do you want me to get rid of the bears? What is
your plan, I asked, and she responded, with the "performance." A "performance"?
She added that it would cost me a bit of money but that we would settle about
the payment later. I agreed with the plan and told her to go ahead with the
performance. Which she did -- she gathered a number of people, including some
very young children, who formed themselves into a circle and sang a song (more
like a chant) and danced. The performance chased the bears away, so I woke up. I
never did settle with her about the fee.

It wasn't my best dream -- but it's not entirely without interest. I'd give it a
B-plus at most. I admire the details about the wrong-dream pistol and about the
"performance."  By the way, I've never owned a pistol and haven't had a weapon
in my hands since ROTC in college, and I have no idea why my dreamatorium is so
convinced that I did so.

I continue to be amazed that my nighttime life is so much more inventive than
my daytime. In actuality, I'm not at all an imaginative person. When I set out
to write fiction or poetry, which I have done at various times in my life, it's
a disaster. The truth is that I have nothing to say. No plots, no situations,
no dialogue, no wit, no insights. And yet, night after night, I find myself in
crazy, bizarre but also imaginative situations. I wake myself out of dreams,
like this one, that refer back to past dreams -- as if Tuesday's dream, were a
continuation of Monday's and Monday's a piece of a continuing narrative -- as if
my dreams were chapters of a long novel or perhaps episodes in a TV serial.

My dreams are almost always nightmares. I'm lost in a strange city, can't find
my way back home. Surrounded, defenseless and alone, among enemies. Infinite
variations on themes of helplessness and hopelessness.

The pleasant dreams are very few but they can be inventive and fun. Once I
dreamed that I could swim like a fish, not by flailing my arms but rather by
swiveling my entire body. I was as as quick as a pickerel. And several times, I
had gravity-defying dreams in which I compete in the long jump, but don't come
down, just skim along the surface of the earth like a Greek goddess. A very
liberating fantasy.

It wouldn't be difficult to interpret the bear-pistol-performance dream. Life is
dangerous (the bears), there are possible remedies (the pistol), but community
support (the performance) is more effective than individual action. If I were
feeling Jungian, I could find all sorts of bear or half-bear archetypes in the
folklore. I'm absolutely positive that sometime during the long haul from the
Olduvai Gorge to Ellis Island, one or more of my ancestors, living in a cave or
a daub-and-wattle hovel, faced off against carnivorous creatures. Perhaps the
dream emerges from some atavistic portion of my brain or is embedded in my DNA.

But I don't believe it. I attach little meaning to dreams. Surely, they reflect
one's anxieties, but they don't predict the future or explain the deeper
mysteries of life. I think that they're nothing more than the chemical circuits
of the brain going haywire. It takes a lot of effort to keep the synapses
under control, and when we sleep, those controls are compromised. We become
unhinged. Didn't WS say something like lunatics and dreamers are of imagination
all compact?  Or did he?  Well, lunacy and dream and imagination are closely
related, whether he said it or not.

Title: New Light on Vikings
Date: September 19, 2020

I read all 599 pages of Neil Price's just-published Children of Ash and
Elm, a detailed history of the Vikings, and I'm mighty proud of myself for
persevering.  It's a long book bristling with details and data. The author,
an archeologist, has made his own original contributions to Viking research.
To produce this synthesis, he seems to have read every relevant article and
monograph of generations of scholars. An impressive feat. I wonder, how much
will my intermittently faulty memory retain?

Has my understanding of the Vikings changed? Yes, I think it has. I knew that
the Vikings were famous for cruelty, plunder, pillage and rape, but I had no
idea that they were so deeply involved with human sacrifice and slavery. 
"The Vikings," says Price, "were not only slavers, but the kidnapping, sale,
and forced exploitation of human beings was always a central pillar of their
culture." Slaving was "the main element" of commerce with Russian and Ukraine.
The chapter on Viking slavery is grim reading indeed. It won't make you proud of
your species.

Here are a couple of Viking slave collars

In his new book on the Vikings, Neil Price uses some words that I didn't kno  w.
Some old, some ne                                                             w.

"Haptic" -- relating to the sense of touch. A "byre" is farmhouse in which
humans live in contact with livestock. A "volute" is a spiral or scroll-like
ornament. An "allodium" is land held absolutely and not subject to feudal duties
or burdens. A "skald" is a Norse poet. "Theophoric" refers to words, often
place names, that embed the name of a god or goddess. "Futhark" is an early
or older form of the runic alphabet. A "quern" is a simple mill for grinding
grain and consists of two stones, one on top of the other. A "dirham" is an
Ottoman coin; the word derives from the Greek drachma. "Tephra" is fragmental
material produced by volcanic eruption. A "sigil" is a symbol used in ritual
magic. "Lamellar" is the adjectival form of "lamella," which is a thin flat
overlapping scale, in this case used to describe a kind of leather armor. A
"hydrarchy" refers to the rule of a piece of land from shipboard, and also to
"a pseudogovernmental system of law between pirates at sea." "Emic," a fire-new
word, describes the analysis of a culture from the perspective of a member
of that culture. And my favorite (how could I not have encountered this word
before?) -- an "ogonek" is a diacritical hook placed under the lower right
corner of a vowel.

Title: Bleak House Once Again
Date: October 01, 2020

I just completed another long stroll through Bleak House. It's either my fifth
or sixth time through -- or almost once a decade since 1958. During this
reading, which will no doubt be my last, I felt that I was imprisoned by the
novel, hogtied; that I couldn't do anything or read anything else until I made
it to the end of entire 900 pages. Dickens took over my life, and not for the
first time. It was a struggle, perhaps made worse because my eyes are not as
good as they once were and because the print in my Oxford Classics edition seems
to be growing tinier and grayer.

It was a willing surrender and I was a willing captive. How can I not be dazzled
and impressed by the profusion of Dickens' imagination and by his genius at
keeping a dozen plot-balls in the air.

Nevertheless, I don't ever remember being quite so angry and impatient at Mr.
Dickens.  "Let 'em wait." Well, I waited for five days, which as fast as i can
trot nowadays.

The good parts of Bleak House are as good as anything in the language. The death
of Jo the crossing sweeper ("And dying thus around us every day") remains the
single greatest paragraph in the long history of the English novel. "Dead, your
Majesty." The encounter of Sir Leicester and Rouncewell was much better than I
remembered it. Mr. Chadband, the oleaginous preacher, was, this time, remarkably
pertinent. Mr. Bucket is a triumph. Lady Dedlock's long repressed love for
Captain Hawley was more poignant.

But I've lost my admiration for some other parts of the novel. I could hardly
bear Esther Summerson's goody-goodiness; and, this time, I have to say that
Esther's relationship with her dear darling Ada seemed suspect. Far too
sentimentalized. Ada herself, still in mourning seven years after the death of
her misguided weak husband -- unbearable.  The Jellyby and Pardiggle satires
seemed misguided, excessive.  I was not amused by Mrs. Snagsby's jealousy or
by the relentless pillorying of poor Mr. Guppy. Harold Skimpole's infantile
nattering has lost its charm.

There's never been a novelist with more heart or less intellect than Dickens. He
is the best of novelists, the worst of novelists.

Title: My Life in Objects XVIII-- The Menhirs
Date: October 02, 2020

This standing stone might look like an ordinary piece of granite, but it has a
rich history. If you look very closely, you can almost see the two deep holes
that have been drilled into it. Though it's now merely a garden ornament,
decorating a perennial border, it was once a working fence post. Hinges would
have been hammered into the holes.

We found this post up on the hill, deep in the second-growth forest, very close
to the remains of what was either a well or a cesspool and beneath the giant
senescent maple that must date from pre-Colonial times.

There's also a second megalith, also drilled but not visible in this picture,
that now guards a parallel perennial border. Long ago, the two posts flanked
an old farm road but the wooden gate that once stood between them had already
rotted and disappeared fifty years ago when I first happened upon the posts.

The area where the post stood is surrounded by numerous substantial stone walls
that once delineated the boundaries of various fields. Tom Roberts, who farmed
the property from 1926 to 1967, told me that he grew apples and potatoes on the
hill. There's no need for a gate for potatoes, so the posts must date from a
previous era when the land was used to pasture sheep.

We decided to honor the posts by placing them in a more prominent position, so
one day we loaded them into the bucket of the Deere tractor and brought them
down. We dug a hole about a third the length of the post, chained it to the
bucket, and lowered it into place. NGP is getting to be mighty skillful at
maneuvering the tractor. The posts are handsome in their new situations. Robins
like them too, as places to perch.

Title: "My Week": the Secret Diary of D*n*ld Tr*mp
Date: October 06, 2020

Dear Diary: why is everybody always picking on me? It's been a really bad month,
even before someone deliberately gave me the virus. Sometimes I want to cry,
it's been so tough, but Daddy Fred would hate me for that. The press, the TV
people, some of those losers at Fox (not Hannity). Even my own niece, Mary, who
claims that I cheated her out of millions of dollars. What an ugly bitch she
is!  And then someone leaked that I called American soldiers losers and suckers
for dying -- I never said that, and if I did, it was private. They claimed that
I wouldn't visit that frog cemetery because it would mess up my hair -- well,
I paid $70,000 for my hair and they want me to go to some foreign cemetery for
some war that nobody's ever heard of -- in the rain. Fuck, not me. That's for
dummies. Then I went to Tulsa for a celebration of me me me and nobody showed
up. Parscale was responsible for that mess;  I got rid of him. Someone will try
to get him to rat on me, but he won't. I've got him by the pecker because of
all the money he's embezzled. And then some disloyal son of a bitch leaked that
I said that the virus was good because I could get away without shaking hands
with donors, Of course I don't want to touch them, they're disgusting losers,
full of germs. But I got to take their money, I don't want to spend mine. I'm
already into Putin for millions. My pussy advisors tell me I have to pretend to
be friendly, when I'd rather relax at Mar-a-Lago and eat cheeseburgers and spend
time with Hope. Then, a couple of days ago the nasty, failing New York Times has
a big story about my income taxes. Fake. Fake. Fake. I pay plenty, of course a
lot less than loser teachers and nurses who don't know how the system works.
Then Woodward, who I thought would give me good press, says that they're all
ganging up on me behind my back. Cowards and losers. Woodward says that wacko
Mattis, the turncoat, said that I had the understanding of a fifth or sixth
grader. How can that be -- my uncle taught at MIT? Plus I had great SAT scores.
Dummy Kelly thinks I'm an idiot and unhinged. That blimp Omigault says that I'm
a racist, a misogynist, and a bigot. Wacky nut job Gary Cohn says I'm as dumb as
shit and corrupt McMaster called me a dope. Publicity-seeker Bannon says that
I'm like an 11-year old child. Lightweight grandstander Tillerson called me a
moron. What's with all the name-calling? Good thing Jeffrey Epstein pulled his
own plug, if he really did, he had me worried for a while. Then all these dumb
women! All out to get me!  Katie Johnson and Summer Zervos and Jean Carroll and
twenty others. They all wanted it bad and then they changed the rules and now
they're out to cash in. Sad! Low IQ slut Stormy still trying to make me look
bad. And Rudy lobbying me every day to pardon Manafort and Roger Stone and his
other friends. Sometimes I just want to go to Russia and move in with Putin. God
I love that guy. I wish Roy Cohn was still alive. So much smarter than disgraced
idiot Michael.

Why is everybody always picking on me?

Title: Natural Disasters, Fear of
Date: October 11, 2020

It's unlikely that I will be killed by a tsunami. I just don't get to the
seashore very often -- the last time was five years ago -- and I happen to
reside most of the year at an altitude of 5300 feet. It would have to be one
heck of a tsunami that would find me here -- 1200 miles inland. An ordinary
rainfall-caused flood is a more likely cause of death. We have a big one every
decade or so. But still, I live on the second floor of a concrete and steel-I
beam building and even a thousand-year event wouldn't touch me. I might be in
danger if I happened to be hiking in one of our many narrow canyons, where you
see signs that say "in case of sudden flood, climb to safety." But I'm not
much worried about a narrow canyon situation because I like to stay home and
in bed when it starts to rain or even when there's a threat of rain. For the
same reason, I'm not afeard of dying in an avalanche. I don't ski and I don't
climb mountains, especially in the winter. In fact, I tend to stay at home,
sipping hot cider, on cold days because I'm afraid of slipping on the ice and
busting an arm or a leg or a hip. A volcano, then? Not likely. There are no
active volcanoes nearby and those hotspots under the geysers in Yellowstone
aren't scheduled to explode for a few hundred thousand years. I just can't
see myself racing ahead of a pyroclastic flow. A forest fire? Always a danger
because they've become more frequent with global warming. Nevertheless, I don't
think a forest fire is likely to kill me because even though I live less than a
mile from the mountains, there's enough buffer between my home and the forest
that it's pretty impossible for a fire to cross into my zone. (A house fire is
even more unlikely, especially because of the up-to-date built-in sprinkler
system and the cinderblock-enclosed staircase). I suppose I could be killed by a
lightning strike but I'm not likely to be outside dancing during a sudden storm.
A hurricane -- well, we don't have any here and although I spend a significant
amount of time in New Orleans, I limit my visits to the late winter or early
spring, so I'm not in residence during  the bad season. A tornado is a remote
possibility. Once again, I'd have to go far to find one, because they don't seem
to come into my city. I once identified a funnel cloud out to the east, but it
didn't touch ground. A blizzard? Well, I've certainly experienced blizzards
and once I was caught in one, but frankly, unless I should happen to drive the
Subaru into snowbank and freeze to death, or go out for a long walk in the
open space in the midst of a storm, I'm not likely to perish. Then there are
earthquakes, which would be a real possibility if I lived in California or along
a fault, but not here in the stable Rockies. So on the whole, I don't think I'm
going to die in some natural disaster.

Wait, what about a meteorite falling from the sky and bopping me on the head?

Actually, that sounds like a good way to go. No long period of fear and anxiety
waiting to drown or burn or be buried, just instant death while strolling in the
park on a sunny afternoon. A perfect ending.

Which reminds me of the death of Aeschylus, who, according to the story, while
walking on a beach, was killed when an eagle picked up a turtle, and trying to
break its shell, dropped it on him, thinking that his bald head was a large
rock.

Death by falling turtle -- ridiculous. Death by meteorite -- glamorous and
romantic. A story for latter generations to savor.

Oh, oh. I just thought of another natural disaster. Sinkholes. I don't want to
be swallowed by a sinkhole. Not at all glamorous. Memorable, yes. Glamorous, no.

Title: Montaigne, Kinship with
Date: October 14, 2020

There is no author with whom I feel greater kinship than with Michel de
Montaigne and there's none with whom I've passed more hours and days, except for
Shakespeare. For many years, Montaigne's Essais has been my bedside companion,
first in the old Everyman Library edition as translated by John Florio, a book
which I early discovered among my father's small collection, and latterly in the
1958 version by Donald Frame. Of the two writers, Shakespeare is the greater,
but he is unknowable and certainly not a comrade. "Negative capability" --
and all that. Shakespeare, the human being, lies hidden behind a profusion of
characters and borrowed stories. Sometimes I think I can catch a glimpse of the
man himself in recurring images or in a repeated motif, but how can I be sure?
It's all guesswork and supposition. Shakespeare is an auctor absconditus. He can
be admired, even revered, but he's too mysterious ever to be a pal. Montaigne,
on the other hand, is insistently present. He talks directly to me, guy to
guy, teaches me, argues with me. Even though there's a universe of differences
between me and this astonishingly erudite sixteenth-century French Catholic
skeptic, I feel that we are good friends.

Why the kinship? Montaigne is so various, so mutable, so inconsistent, that he's
difficult to define, but nevertheless exhibits traits with which I l am in deep
sympathy. Of all the important thinkers, he's the least systematic -- which is a
benefit, at least for me. I can't make heads or tails of his near-contemporaries
Spinoza or Descartes because both are too orderly and logical for my unsubtle
head. But Montaigne works differently -- he advances an idea, modifies it,
retracts it, illustrates it with a dozen anecdotes, and then announces that
he can't come to a definitive conclusion -- which is the way my mind works,
although obviously at a much lower order. And then Montaigne's brain is a
hodgepodge, a gallimaufry of formidable learning strewn in heaps, like the last
scene of Citizen Kane. So is mine, although it's a cramped attic compared to
Montaigne's warehouse. And of course, Montaigne writes almost exclusively about
himself, as I do in these fragmentary blague entries.

Moreover, we both seem to be at least in part writing for the same purpose.
I compose these essaylets for what I conceive of, pretentiously, as dynastic
reasons. Because I I so much wish that I had some artifacts or writing of my
grandparents or great-grandparents, who left nothing behind, no scrap remaining,
I want my descendants to have something of mine. Montaigne agrees: "What a
satisfaction it would be to me to hear someone tell me of the habits, the face,
the expression, the favorite remarks, and the fortunes of my ancestors. How
attentive I would be. Truly it would spring from a bad nature to be scornful
of even the portraits of our friends and predecessors, the form of their
clothes and their armor." [Montaigne came from a family with a strong military
tradition, unlike mine, which is epitomized by grandfather's desertion from
the Russian army.] "I keep their handwriting, their seal, the breviary and a
peculiar sword that they used, and I have not banished from my study some long
sticks that my father ordinarily carried in his hand." I have no "sticks," but
as I sit here pecking at the word processor, I see out of the corner of my eye
my father's library ladder, used for retrieving just the right law book.

Montaigne is not done with the topic. He continues by exploring an idea about
which I also have ruminated. For whom do I devote these hours, if not for
myself?  He is eloquent upon the subject.

"If no one reads me, have I wasted my time, entertaining myself for so many idle
hours with such useful and agreeable thoughts. In modeling this figure upon
myself, I have had to fashion and compose myself so often to bring myself out,
that the model itself has to some extent grown firm and taken shape. Painting
myself for others, I have painted my inward self with colors clearer than my
original ones. I have no more made my book that my book has made me -- a book
consubstantial with its author, concerned with my own self, an integral part of
my life....  Have I wasted my time by taking stock of myself so continually, so
carefully. For those who go over themselves only in their minds and occasionally
in speech do not penetrate to essentials in their examination as does a man who
makes that his study, his work, and his trade, who binds himself to keep an
enduring account, with all his faults, with all his strengths."

I wish I could say that I'm as honest as Montaigne; I'm not. I recognize that
the "me" that appears here is to some degree different from the me that is
me. Although I do not lie about myself, I conceal some of my most flagrant
deficiencies. Nor do I blow my own small trumpet. As a result, the portrait that
has emerged is solider and also less troubled than the true-to-life person.
Don't say I didn't give you notice, unwary descendants.

Title: The "Yips"
Date: October 16, 2020

The yips have been big news this week because Jose Altuve, Houston's golden-
glove second baseman has made three throwing errors in two games. Glaring,
costly errors. He's bounced balls to first base and to second base -- throws of
twenty or forty feet which he has made successfully thousands of times in his
outstanding career.

The "yips" is sports jargon for the sudden, inexplicable inability to make
an ordinary or routine play. It's commonly used by golfers when they start
missing short putts --but baseball has its famous yippers -- Steve Saxe, Chuck
Knoblauch (both of them second baseman who have the shortest, easiest throws) 
and now, possibly Altuve. Sometimes a good pitcher will lose his control and
start to miss badly; the retired pitcher at the microphone will say, "he's
lost his release point," which is a yippish diagnosis without using the word.
Athletes think that the problem is psychological but it's possible that the
condition is merely neurological - a "focal dystonia" or muscle spasm in the
wrist. Basketball yips? Yes, sometimes a good foul shooter will miss four or
five in a row.

I suspect that the yips may not be a sports-only syndrome.

Once, a decade or two ago, I was driving across the country on a four-lane and
needed to brake. For some reason, my feet (I was driving a standard transmission
so both feet and the clutch pedal were involved) couldn't remember which was
the brake pedal. I flailed with both feet and was utterly panicked for about
five long seconds. Then I came to my senses, put the correct foot on the correct
pedal, and continued on in normal fashion. Life continued. But if I had crashed
the car and killed myself, which was certainly a possibility, investigators
would have thought that I had fallen asleep at the switch. They'd have been
wrong; it was just the yips -- a failure to perform a task that should have been
entirely routine.

I wonder how many road disasters are caused by undiagnosed yippishness.

Do actors get the yips? Do musicians? Dentists?  Airline pilots? Surgeons ("You
know, I've done that back surgery hundreds of times but three out of the last
four, I've sliced entirely through the guy's spinal cord").

Title: George Raft. Why?
Date: October 20, 2020

TCM, the indispensable channel, has been delivering us a raft of old George Raft
movies. They Drive by Night (1940) of course, but also such unmemorable noirs as
Johnny Angel (1945), Race Street (1948), and I'll Get You (1952) as well as a
couple of others so unsubstantial that, although viewed during the past month,
they've already evaporated from my tired old brain.

This last while, whenever a George Raft picture began, we'd set a challenge:
will Mr. Raft's face show an expression? Any expression! Will he smile, smirk,
pout? Will he be angry, contemptuous, happy, lustful, disappointed? Anything at
all, any human emotion? After painstaking study, I can now report that although
we've examined every single frame, slowly and carefully, not once in any of
these films has George Raft exhibited the slightest discernible human feeling.
Moreover, on even more diligent examination, I can now affirm that he has
delivered every single one of his memorized lines without the least variation in
speed, volume, pitch, or intensity. Every sentence, no matter its significance,
exits his mouth with the exact same cadence. It's all low affect, all the time.

It's a puzzlement. What was George Raft's appeal? Certainly not his skill as a
thespian. Nor his negative charisma. He's not handsome, and because of his oddly
short legs, he walks funny (and he walks at exactly the same speed when crossing
the nightclub floor to question a "canary" or when prowling a dark alley, gat in
hand.

Even more astonishing -- in a couple of these movies he's cast as a romantic
lead who gets the girl in the last scene -- a girl who is younger, prettier,
taller, and a much better actor. There's nothing more embarrassing or
impossible-to-take-seriously than a George Raft kiss and fade. The End.

Title: Where I Live, 2020
Date: October 27, 2020

For the last eleven years, I've lived in a downtown Boulder condominium. I much
enjoy living here -- it's age appropriate. The rooms are all on one floor;
there's an elevator; underground parking for the new Subaru; no snow shoveling;
hardly any upkeep. It's quiet inside and out -- but right around the corner,
just a block away, is the semi-famous Boulder Mall, with all the urban stuff
that one could want. A music venue. Restaurants, shops, a bank, a drugstore,
a barbershop, and just a half mile to the west, the very resourceful Boulder
Public Library. In season, a farmer's market. Tourists and natives peacefully
strolling. A good place for a guy my age to "hang."

There is, however, a small fly in the ointment. This past January, Ms. Reynolds,
my consort and odalisque (we don't use the W word, or the H word either) bought
a condo down the corridor from mine. As a result, both of us traverse the short
distance (75 feet) between hers and mine multiple times a day before ending
up in my place for dinner, perhaps a movie, and sleep. The difficulty is that
there's a quirk in this building's heating system. The corridor is always
frigid; for some reason that no one seems to understand, the air-conditioning,
need it or not, is always turned up to 11. The temperature stands at 58F, summer
and winter. The people who manage the building say that nothing can be done
about the arctic blasts. Hard to believe, but apparently true.

We call our passage from one apartment to the other, "braving the polar vortex."
The corridor itself is "the tundra                                            ."

In an effort to remedy this situation, I have written the following letter to
the authorities.

"Dear Managers of the Building:

Inasmuch as it has proven impossible to raise the temperature of the corridor
higher than 58F, I propose that we attack this flaw with a new and, I dare to
suggest, more imaginative strategy. If we can't raise the temperature, let us
lower it. With a little effort we can get it down to a consistent 48F. We could
then make some money by using the corridor as a sort of root cellar. I envision
a series of individual wooden boxes, say, perhaps 6' by 4', where residents at
modest cost could store their beets, carrots, onions, and potatoes (bought in
bulk at the Farmer's Market). It might even be possible to rent some of the
boxes to outsiders and bring a little extra income into the building. What a
marvelous (and ecologically sound) solution to our problem!!

Wait. On further thought, I have an even better idea. Let's lower the
temperature another couple of degrees, to 37F, the ideal for storing dry-aged
beef. The corridor could then be re-configured as a meat locker. I doubt it
woulds cost more than $100 to install a series of hooks in the ceiling, from
which residents (and outside renters) could hang their sides of beef. Everyone

maker for the property.

I don't see any possible objection to either of these ideas, but I'd want the
board to decide which one seems most promising and most lucrative.

And by the way, I noticed the other day that a pair of arctic foxes seem to have
taken up residence in the corridor. We'd probably have to do something about
them before we hang the beef, or there could be complications.

Also, I might be mistaken but I think a saw an ermine skittering right near the

Title: Overmanaging, 2020.
Date: October 28, 2020

The 2020 World Series is over, and I'm in a royal snit.

It's Game 6, the Dodgers are ahead 3-2, and Tampa Bay has a chance to win and
make the series go to seven, which is what I'm rooting for (I don't have a dog
in the hunt, because I disapprove of both teams: the Dodgers, are the despised
simulacrum of the organization that abandoned Brooklyn 50+ years ago and Tampa
Bay is from Florida, the Nowhere State -- plus it's an American League team,
but that doesn't matter this year because for some phoney-baloney covid-related
reason both leagues are using the DH. Tampa Bay is ahead 1-0 on a first-inning
home run by Randy Arozarena, who has a great short powerful swing and is either
the second coming of Henry Aaron and the centerpiece of the best trade in
history (the worst for St. Louis) or the most spectacular flash-in-the-pan in
major league history. It's the fifth inning, and Blake Snell has been pitching
a masterpiece. Nine strikeouts and not a ball hit solidly. He's throwing 95 to
the corners and his sinking curve is keeping the Dodger hitters completely off
balance. He's looking almost like Koufax, for goodness sake. So what does Kevin
Cash, Tampa Bay's manager do?  He takes out Snell and brings in Nick Anderson
and two batters later, it's 2-1 Dodgers and the game is over and the Series
is over. Removing Snell is the worst decision in baseball history, perhaps in
sports history, perhaps the worst of any human decision since the emergence of
homo sapiens.

Why was Snell relieved? Because of some bullshit trumpery statistics about
pitchers being less effective going through the lineup the third time. Not
applicable in this case; Snell had lost nothing off his fastball, he was still
hitting his spots, and he was still demoralizing the Dodgers, who looked like
dejected losers. Until -- that is, they were invigorated by the prospect of not
having to hit against Snell any longer.

Is there a word "overmanaging?"  There ought to be. Both teams were over-
managed. Too many pitching changes, too many absurd fielding shifts -- even
putting four men in the outfield--, too many pinch hitters. Baseball used to be
a players' game, and the job of the manager was to put his nine best players
on the field and let them do their jobs, perhaps calling for a sacrifice or a
steal or an intentional pass, or replacing a tired pitcher with some ex-starter
or never-was from the bullpen. But now, baseball has turned into a manager's
game, like (gasp) football. And when it backfires, as it did last night, what a
disaster! What does Kevin Cash deserve, besides firing. If I were a Tampa Bay
fan, I'd be outraged. I'd want revenge or his scalp, perhaps both.

I'm a baseball fan, and I'm outraged, livid, angry. I wanted to see what Blake
Snell could do with the Dodger hitters, third time through. More reliance on his
slider, more on the slow stuff? Could he keep getting them to swing and miss at
his fastball at the top of the zone, or just above the zone?

I'm a fan;  baseball should try to please me and the 90% of the spectators in
America who knew that Cash was making a major blunder to pull Snell. I didn't
watch the end of the game. Left the room. Boycotted.

Baseball is not as exciting as it was in the days of my youth. The players
themselves are bigger, faster, stronger, and better trained, so it's not their
fault. But because the hitters are so powerful, there are too many home runs.
Home runs are only exciting when a batter catches all of it and blasts one 440
feet into the upper deck or 40 rows back into the lower.  There's nothing more
boring than a muscular guy swinging under it and popping one up 340 feet onto
the short porch. A travesty home run. The fences should be moved back 20 feet
and raised to a mandatory 10 or 12 feet. A triple is much more exciting to
watch than a Texas League homer. When was the last inside-the-park homer with a
relayed throw to the plate, just a hair too late?

And let's put the statisticians in their place. Tampa Bay is the only team
in the league with a professional statistician on the bench -- one who never
advanced past T-ball. Is he responsible for the manager's monumental gaffe? 
And for goodness sake, let's get rid of the DH. When the pitcher is in the
batting order, there's strategy in the game. It becomes a test of intelligence,
not just a home run hitting contest. I want to admire a well-executed sacrifice
bunt.

My father had been a catcher in his younger days and had the busted fingers
to prove it.  When he was dying, I went to visit him in the hospital. He was
watching the Dodgers on the TV.  The next day, when I returned, he wasn't
watching. I said, "Dad, there's a Yankee game on the TV; you could watch it." 
He said, "Yankees. American League. DH rule. Not baseball."  He died soon
after.

I'm scared that baseball, greatest of all games, has become "not baseball."

Title: Douglas Bush's Milton Course
Date: November 12, 2020

In the mid 1980s, thirty-five years ago, I was 'in residence' for a week at the
Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, D.C., researching an article on one of
the lesser English Renaissance dramatists -- a pleasure as well as a condition
of employment. The article that I completed turned out to be not a bad piece of
academic prose, if I do say so myself, but not something for the ages either. It
was a mere twenty years since I had completed my degree in "English and American
Language and Literature" at a Large Eastern University, specifically Harvard. I
was not drawn to the Folger for professional reasons only. It was a delight and
a great privilege to hold in my very own hands and to read dozens and scores of
four-hundred-year-old ephemeral books that -- more than the canonical literature
-- helped me to understand the age of Shakespeare. Sermons by the wagonload,
biblical commentaries, almanacs, political pamphlets, poems by minor and unknown
versifiers, broadsides, medical textbooks, collections of jokes, how-to-write-a-
letter-in-Latin trots, schoolbooks. The library possessed inexhaustible troves
of such material. The Folger's plenty licensed my dilettante brain to follow its
own naturally wayward inclinations.

While doing my duty and also having some fun, I fell in with a fellow Folgerite
named Boyd Berry who was visiting from Virginia Commonwealth University in
Richmond, Virginia. Over cups of coffee, Boyd and I discussed some of the less
well-known writers of the period in whom we shared a mutual interest. I remember
that we also talked about the teacher's perennial frustration at engaging the
interest of our sometimes less-than-enthusiastic students. I do not remember
what prompted me to ask Boyd this question: "what was the worst course that you
ever took either as an undergraduate or graduate student." He replied, without
hesitation, "Douglas Bush's lecture course on Milton at Harvard in 1961." I
was flabbergasted, in part because I hadn't guessed that Boyd had been at
Harvard during my years there, but more because I had enrolled in exactly the
same course -- same time same station same year -- and because Douglas Bush's
Milton course was also my own nominee for the worst course ever. Parallel
lines had accidentally and miraculously met, so to speak. Although Boyd and
I were the same age, he was one year behind me and had taken the course as a
senior undergraduate while I had been a first-year graduate student. It seemed
an astonishing coincidence, but then, the universe of students of English
Renaissance literature is a small one. Nevertheless, the fact that we shared
the same opinion about Professor Bush's course was comforting and, as they say,
"validating." Boyd said out loud words that I had only speculated upon in petto.
Perhaps I wasn't the only outlier.

Why were we in such accord? The obvious answer is that Professor Bush, then
in the tail end of his much-celebrated career (he had uttered his infant
cries during Grover Cleveland's second presidency), was tired and bored
by his teaching and put little heart into the work. In brief, he droned,
unconscionably. Not only did he drone, but it seemed as though there was an
invisible shield between his podium and our seats. He didn't speak to us --
he addressed the empyrean. His lectures consisted of a superficial running
commentary on Milton's poems. "There's a particularly lovely passage starting
on line 695," -- as if a challenging idea would be beyond our collective
capacity. If a student broke into the drone to hazard a question, Professor
Bush's characteristic answer was, "Well, that seems self-explanatory." But
Bush's classroom style was not the only reason for my unhappiness; I had more
substantive concerns.

Let me interject a few words about Professor John Nash Douglas Bush. Although
almost forgotten today, Bush was by all odds the most formidable and learned
literary scholar of his generation. He knew everything there was to know about
English, Romance, and classical literature and had written a dozen comprehensive
critical and historical books. If the gossip can be trusted, he greeted the
dawn of each new day by reading two hundred lines of Latin poetry and a hundred
of Greek. I am sure that he knew more about John Milton than Milton knew about
himself. He had edited the volume of Milton's complete poetry (English, Latin,
Greek, and Italian) and, astonishingly, had memorized the entire twelve books
of Paradise Lost. He was an exacting scholar and a stylish and witty writer.
Moreover, he was a kindly, gentle man, cordial and generous to his students --
even to me. If he had flaws of character, I didn't know of them. To my mind,
he was an unimpeachably excellent person and scholar -- and at the same time a
teacher from whom I learned just about nothing.

I was once invited -- along with a clutch of my ambitious graduate-school
classmates -- to some sort of reception at Professor Bush's Cambridge residence.
His home was exactly as it should have been -- that is to say, if one were
making a movie about a distinguished Harvard professor, one's location scout
would not rest until he discovered the Bush quarters. It was a spacious and
civilized home presided over by gracious Mrs. Bush, who was also exactly as she
should have been. I remember that the giant main room in the house -- which
must once have been two or more large rooms that had been sutured together, was
Professor Bush's enormous study. It was more like an institutional library than
something to be found in a private home. Just as one would expect, the study was
lined floor to ceiling with handsome wooden bookcases chock full of an enviable
display of publications in many languages, some of which I could identify. I
remember being served sherry, I think, and also something preternaturally green
and fishy on an unfamiliar but I'm sure very elite kind of cracker. This dream
of an academic utopia filled me with envy. It also scared the living blazes
out of me. Why? Because for all Professor Bush's elegance and his library, and
his lovely deferential wife, his movie-set home struck me as soft, fey, self-
satisfied, and bloodless. I was dazzled and intimidated by its splendors but
at the same time wary and resistant. Only five years beyond crowded Erasmus
Hall High School in darkest Brooklyn, I knew myself well enough to know that,
however seductive, his style of life was not for me. I would have to find a more
appropriate path.

Now I want to step further back and report on two cases in which I was in
conflict with Professor Douglas Bush. Actually, the conflicts were only on my
side; Professor Bush, Olympian and serene, did not notice -- nor should he have,
frankly. These incidents continue to haunt me to this day, sixty years after
the fact. Both occurred not in the Milton course, but in an "advanced" seminar
called "Science and Humanism in the Seventeenth Century." I must explain that
the word "humanism" did not carry the meaning that it does today, as in the
phrase "secular humanism" -- an approach to the natural world that is allied
with agnosticism and which sometimes resolves into pure atheism. Professor
Bush's humanism was the altogether different "Christian humanism." It was, in
brief, the noble but ultimately unsuccessful Renaissance attempt to fuse the
"inspired" and "revealed" truths of Christianity with the thoughtful, upstanding
but unfortunately "natural" morality of the Greeks and Romans. If "Christian
Humanism" could be distilled to a sentence, it would be Desiderius Erasmus'
daring speculation -- that he would like someday to be able to say, "Sancte
Socrates, ora pro nobis", or "Saint Socrates, pray for us."

I was a humanist of the secular variety -- by birth, inclination, education
and because in my brain there was no place, not even a lone neuron, where
"faith" or "prayer' or "worship" might in more standard heads be lodged. Bush,
on the other hand, was not just a scholar of Christian Humanism, he was an
honest-to-god trapped-in-amber Christian Humanist -- and a devout one, deeply
rooted and entirely comfortable in late medieval/early renaissance thinking. In
his seminar on Science and Humanism, humanism was right and just, and science,
its antagonist, was, if not altogether bad, at a minimum a very dangerous
alternative. Did not both Bacon and Descartes assert that "nature" -- the
real world -- could be studied directly, on its own terms, rather than as
an entity infused with god's being and majesty. That we mortals might study
nature not to reaffirm the goodness and omnipotence of god, but to accumulate
objective knowledge and to reap practical material benefits. It's a fact that
the separation of nature from the "truth" of religion has over the centuries
unquestionably led to the marginalizing of Christian thinking and therefore,
according to Bush's view of the world, to the steep decline of civilization. The
world, no longer driven by revelation, has been going to hell in a heathen hand
basket, as Professor Bush said or implied every Tuesday at 4:00 pm.

Regular readers of this blague as well as Dr. Metablog's family and friends
will recognize that Youthful Me did not accept Bush's premises. In fact, in
those days, I was probably even less open to religious ideas than I am now. And
therefore, each Tuesday was a day of discomfort.

And then, one afternoon, Professor Bush began the allotted two hours by
launching a surprise assault on the then-new and controversial Third Edition
of the Merriam-Webster dictionary. The Third had shocked traditionalists.
Until 1962, dictionaries had been "prescriptive "-- that is, they explained
how language "should" be used and they stigmatized as colloq. or subst.
[substandard] those words or expressions that fell beneath the bar. The Third
forsook tradition and was not prescriptive but descriptive. It aimed to record
the language as it was really used. The Third therefore included many words
hitherto banned as slang or vulgar and it was loose and permissive with regard
to "shall" and "will", and "imply" and "infer," etc. For Professor Bush, the
Third was a plunge into darkness -- another example of the collapse of Western
Civilization as we know it, or should know it. So he excoriated the new
dictionary and its editors and its supporters. The tirade having been completed,
he turned mildly to the class and asked if anyone present had a different
opinion. Now I had learned a little about modern linguistics at Cornell, and I
was a descriptivist both by education and democratic instinct, and I knew that
Bush was completely out of step with contemporary thought. I was astonished to
discover that I knew more about this particular field of knowledge than he. But,
alas, I was totally intimidated and did not open my mouth. What abject cowardice
on my part! Nary a word did I say, and so the class segued to a discussion of
the Cambridge Platonists and their vain attempt to tame and assimilate Descartes
and Spinoza. I still wonder if any of the other 2G's around the table were aware
of my shame. Probably not -- did my peers, the late Arthur Oberg, the late Jake
Mills, the late Brian Hepworth, the late Terry Logan, the late Bill Godshalk,
and others whose names I have forgotten, notice my moral collapse? I suppose
that it's too late to worry. Nevertheless, my failure to raise my hand and voice
still humiliates me, still rankles.

Another Tuesday, another surrender. In 1961, William Empson published his
innovative study, Milton's God. While Empson was not as learned as Professor
Bush (no one was) he was a much more imaginative and challenging reader. Some
say that after Johnson and Hazlitt, Sir William has been English literature's
most insightful critic. Empson was an intellectual and social dissenter (he
had been banished from Magdalen College, Cambridge when a condom [horrors!]
was discovered among his possessions). He had written two highly influential
critical books that every serious mid-century student of literature studied
-- the first on ambiguity, the second on pastoral. Empson read Paradise Lost
through a very different lens than Bush. He was not a Christian; in fact,
he confessed himself anti-Christian because he judged there to be a serious
moral flaw at the heart of the religion -- that the sacrifice of Jesus was a
highly elaborated form a scapegoating. About Paradise Lost, he concluded that
God (that is, the character God in the epic) was confused and contradictory,
repeatedly tying himself into logical and rhetorical knots in order to justify
the unjustifiable. He also argued that irrespective of Milton's intention,
the character God became more complex and interesting when he became less
ideological and more dramatic; more, so to speak, human. He revered Paradise
Lost, but for his own, not Bush's, reasons. Milton's God was trashed by
Professor Bush, who dismissed Empson as a simple "village atheist." I was
stunned. True enough that Empson was an atheist, but true also that he was a
powerful thinker, not someone to be given the back of the hand with a flippant
ad hominem. Bush's review came out in The New York Times on a Sunday; the
following Tuesday, our teacher was lauded by my fellow seminarians. He basked
in their admiration. Did my young colleagues genuinely agree with Bush, or were
they egregious sycophantic toadies? I don't know and will never know. And then,
after the celebration, Bush asked, as if he were open-minded, "Does anyone here
have a different opinion?" If Empson had been summarily dispatched, what chance
had I? So once again, I fled the field, remained mute -- and slunk deeper into
my expensive leather chair.

Title: How I Came to Hackett Hill Road -- I
Date: November 17, 2020

What factors led a city boy, age 28, to purchase a rural property where he has
now passed fifty glorious summers? Where he is as happy as a lark with a packet
of seeds and a pruner, rake, and hoe.

It all began with my father's love for his backyard garden. "Have you ever
seen a more perfect flower than this?" he would ask, pointing me to one of
his splendid hybrid teas. During the growing season, he'd come home from work
at 6:00 p.m. on the dot, hurry through supper, change out of his lawyer suit
into his old clothes, and get to work. I never saw him more contented. He
cultivated his 30' by 40' plot with the assiduity of a Javanese terrace farmer.
I watched him carefully and participated when he would let me. I studied, with
the concentrated attention of childhood, the growth habits of snapdragons,
sweet peas, and marigolds. Then one year I was allotted a square foot of
space, right next to the dwarf peach, in which to plant seeds of my choice. 
I chose a pumpkin, a vine that did not recognize boundaries, and produced two
astonishingly large fruits. The die was cast.

There was also my maternal grandmother Sonia, originally a country girl, who
never bought an orange or a grapefruit but that she planted its seeds on the
window sill -- in one of those old wooden Philadelphia cream cheese boxes. Her
tiny apartment had a pleasant hothouse-y odor. She loved her seedlings.

And then there were the three summers ('47, '48, '49) which my family spent on
Makamah Beach near Northport on the Long Island Sound. It was my original rural
experience, and the earliest hint that there were places other than concrete and
chain-link-fence Flatbush. It was the first time in my life that I felt at ease
in the landscape.

I must not forget the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, where I spent many a happy hour.
I remember in particular its famous Japanese garden. There was also a bank of
colorful bottlebrush buckeyes that caught my youthful fancy. Many years later,
I tried to reproduce that bloom in my Vermont garden. The curve and slope of
the land were ideal, but the plant itself was not for our subarctic winters.
The buckeye has survived, barely, for forty years now and has never produced a
single flower, nor ever will.

It was at the BBG that I learned that gardening was not just about growing the
biggest pumpkin -- it was about aesthetics and design. I started to read about
the history of gardens and whenever I traveled I detoured to visit the great
examples: the Huntington, Dunbarton Oaks, the Winterthur in Delaware. And scores
more, all intimidating because they were created with the help of enormous
fortunes, huge spaces, and unlimited supplies of labor. Good thing I had my
father's example of "much in little."

Title: Brown Recluse
Date: November 29, 2020

Last night, I was lying in bed comfortably reading Michael Kulikowski's
excellent new book on the last years of the Roman Empire. I was concentrating
very hard, because it's difficult for me to retain the decisions made at Nicaea
in 325. I can read a paragraph about the Arian or some other "heresy" and five
minutes later I can't remember who was on what side, or why it matters, except
that those on the wrong side were liable to be burnt alive. What part of the
brain is supposed to retain this stuff?  In any case, I was lost in the book,
quite content, comfortable -- supportive mattress, soft pillow and all that --
while, unbeknownst to me, a spider was making its way up the backside of the
book cover. Why? Where did it come from?  All I know is that it rounded the
bend, so to speak, nonchalantly strolling into view at the very top of the verso
page.

Immediately the most primitive part of my brain was activated, I elevated out
of the bed like some sort of 1950s cartoon character, hovered for a second or
two, and then found myself on the floor, frantically flapping the sheets and
blankets, searching for the offending arachnid. Get him before he gets me!

If I understand what happened, the amygdala, the part of the brain that's in
charge of fear, governed my actions. The amygdala has been producing fear and
flight responses long before it came to be incorporated into homo sapiens.

After a few minutes we (I had called in auxiliaries) located the offending guy,
and he's now sitting on my desk in a tightly sealed Bonne Maman jam jar.

I think it's a brown recluse. It sure looks like one. The color and shape are
right out of the official catalog. According to the authorities, the only
foolproof way to ascertain if it's a brown recluse is to count its eyes -- six
rather than the usual spidery eight. But anyone who thinks that I'm going to get
close enough to this spider to count its eyes has another think coming. Brown
recluses are rare in our part of the world, but they're not unknown. My book
came via interlibrary loan from Laramie, Wyoming; perhaps the spider came along
for the ride.

Why be frightened of a brown recluse the size of a quarter, legs extended? 
"Brown recluse bites can inflict significant or even life-threatening damage.
Bites may cause severe pain, ulcers, fever, chills, nausea, joint pain, or even
seizures."  Also, necrosis. Scars from necrotic flesh can last a lifetime. A
friend of a friend lost a few months of his life and a hunk of gluteus maximus
to a bite on the butt.

The spider is quite active now in its new home -- the jam jar. It's a
beautifully engineered little creature and very industrious, unceasing in its
determination to find the way out. I admire it, behind glass, and I probably
share a lot of DNA with it -- though it's hard to feel a close kinship.

The "take-away": even though some parts of my brain have deteriorated, my
amygdalae are in splendid working order.

Title: Pairings
Date: December 09, 2020

"Kith and kin" is an excellent example of a "pairing" -- sometimes called a
"coordinate pair." A pairing is a linguistic event in which two words join to
produce a single meaning.

"Kith" has no independent existence nowadays and only exists as an element of
the pair. "Kith and kin" means "family." Originally, back then, "kith" meant
"known" and therefore signified "friends." "Kith and kin" was "friends and
relatives." No longer; now it means "family and family." "Time and tide" is
another fine pairing; "tide" meant "time" centuries before it came to refer
to the moony fluctuation of the seas, although its older meaning survives in
"eventide," "Yuletide," and similar words. Now "time and tide" seems to evoke
the inevitability of both clock and waves -- both of them joined to wait for
no man. "Kit and kaboodle" is also a lovely pairing, because "kaboodle" lacks
independent existence. It may derive from "boodle' -- a thief's bundle -- with
the "ka" added just for the fun of it. "Dribs and drabs" is more obscure in
origin and may not be a true pairing. "Dribs" is probably a variant of "drip"
but "drab" was in times past not a small amount of something or other, but an
untidy or unchaste woman. It's possible that "dribs and drabs," now a rather
neat pairing, is better thought of as a reduplicative like mumbo-jumbo or
hoity- toity. "Nook and cranny" is a pairing in which both elements survive
independently; "nook" originally a corner of a room, and "cranny" a narrow
space in which a brown recluse might hide. When someone or something grows by
leaps and bounds, it's hard to tell which is the leap and which the bound. The
same with "hot and bothered" -- the two words simply reinforce each other.
Similarly, a person might want to "pick and choose" between alternatives, but
to do so requires only one action. "Flotsam and jetsam" is an amusing pairing
of uncertain origin. It is often thought that flotsam lies on the surface of
the water and jetsam is thrown into it, but such a definition might be merely
a folk etymology derived from the words "float" and "jettison." A "hoot and a
holler" both refer to shouting, but now they mean "shouting distance." "Stuff
and nonsense" is obvious, but what sort of "stuff" is nonsensical? Perhaps
it's the very vagueness of "stuff" that it allows it to pair up and reinforce
"nonsense." "Alack and alas" is a weary but euphonious pair. "Wrack and ruin"
becomes more transparent when it's remembered that wrack is a variant  form of
wreck -- as "beck and call" becomes clearer when it is recalled that "beck" is a
foreshortened version of "beckon." The cry in "hue and cry" is obvious; the hue
is thought to derive from the OF verb huer (shout).

Null and void, bag and baggage, prim and proper, vim and vigor, are self-
explanatory.

Bits and pieces are sometimes called odds and ends. That's the long and the
short of it. Jot and tittle have been thoroughly researched and explicated
here.

Is "footloose and fancy-free" a pairing. Yes, I think so. An energetic and
imaginative pairing.

Once again, I was lost, this time in a strange city -- apparently, I was trying

and my companion (a guy totally unknown to me, by the way) asks a traffic cop
the name of the city at which we've arrived. The policeman says to my friend,
"ay, ya" and my friend says to me, and I quote this lunatic absurdity absolutely
verbatim, no embroidery whatsoever, 'He says we're in  ay-ya, which is West

Title: State of My Mind -- End of 2020
Date: December 23, 2020

It's been a rough year what with the madman president and the covid pandemic.
And also deaths and diseases among my close friends. I have at least ten male
friends who've lost their wives after long marriages. Some have bounced back,
some will never get over the grief. At the beginning of 2020, I made a joke: 
"it's going to be the year of the ophthalmologist." It turned out to be the year
of the thanatologist.

Nevertheless, I can honestly say that my dominant mood is one of gratitude.

Grateful that I've lived a long life, mostly healthily, and that my children and
grandchildren are thriving. I'm not rich, but I've never missed a meal for want
