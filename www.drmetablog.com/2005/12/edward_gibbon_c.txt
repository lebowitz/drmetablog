"At this important crisis (i. e. the attack on Rome's Balkan outposts by Huns in 375 A. D.), the military government of Thrace was exercised by Lupicinus and Maximus, in whose venal minds the slightest hope of private emolument outweighed every consideration of public advantage; and whose guilt was only alleviated by their incapacity of discerning the pernicious effects of their rash and criminal administration."Â  Gibbon, Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Chapter XXVI.
