Title: My Campaign for City Council
Date: January 16, 2006

My positions:

1)  NO DOGS WITHIN CITY LIMITS. Rationale: fatal and near-fatal dog attacks,
dog bites, barking dogs, whining dogs, ubiquitous dog "waste," dogs annoying
citizens in parks and open space, the indulgence of dog owners. But what about
seeing-eye dogs? Slippery slope, that. Sorry, no dogs (except for purposes of
vivisection).

2)  NO CHRISTMAS LIGHTS. Rationale: waste of electricity and other scarce
resources. Global warming. Bad taste.

3)  NO MUSIC WRITTEN AFTER 1897. Rationale: obvious. Why 1897? Death of
Johannes Brahms. Also, no amplified music in a motor vehicle that is audible
outside the vehicle.

4)  NO SMOKERS. Rationale: lung cancer, heart attacks, emphysema, ashes, bad
odors. Note: not "no smoking" -- "no smokers."  No going outside of city limits
to light up and then re-entering.

5)  NO IDLE CHATTER. Rationale: incontrovertible.

6)  NO VISIBLE TATTOOS. Rationale: I don't like tattoos. Why visible?  Whole-
body inspections would be intrusive.

7)  NEW ANNUAL HOLIDAY: Charles Darwin's birthday, February 12. Rationale:
uncontroversial celebration of a great thinker. I reject out of hand those
extremists who want to move the holiday to December 25. I'm a uniter, not a
divider.

My slogan:  Brilliant!  Charismatic!  Omniscient!  Hyperbolic!
