Title: One of the Only
Date: January 01, 2006

Call me prescriptive, but the all too common phrase "one of the only" offends
both ear and logic. What does it mean to say that "the $11 billion Crusader
artillery rocket system is one of the only weapons systems canceled by the Bush
administration?" If it's the "only" cancellation, say so. If it's "one of the
few," or even, one of "very few," why then, let's just go ahead and say that.
"One of the only" is an unpleasant and chilling redundancy -- it means no more
than "one of the one."  What's wrong with the word "only" that it needs help?
 Isn't "only" only enough?  Perhaps "only" is wearing out, and "onliest" --
now confined to rural or comic speech -- will someday replace it. Onliest has
the appearance of a superlative, but, logically speaking, "only" can't have a
superlative. But logic, as we know, doesn't always govern the path of language.
Redundancies and illogicalities abound, and awkward formulations such as "one of
the only" aren't all that very one-of-a-kind singly unique.
