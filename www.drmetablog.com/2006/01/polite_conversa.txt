Date: January 28, 2006

Sheldon: Hey, look what the cat dragged in. Arnie: Well as I live and breathe.
Sheldon: You know what?  Arnie: What. Sheldon: That's what. Mel: Big shot.
Sheldon: Who died and made you king?  Mel: Ask a stupid question and get a
stupid answer. Sheldon: Where were you when the brains were passed out? 
Arnie: Yeah, eat this. Sheldon: You wouldn’t know your ass from a hole in the
ground. Mel: So what. Arnie: You’re so full of shit it’s coming out of your
ears. Sheldon: Takes one to know one. Arnie: You know what's a good match? 
Mel: What? Arnie: Your face and my ass. Mel: When you're finished, you can take
the spoon out of my ass. Sheldon: Come again?  Are you cracked? Mel: Eat me.
Arnie: You and what army?  Sheldon: Ain’t that the limit?  Mel:  Hey,
honey, shake it don’t break it. Arnie: Hubba hubba, ding ding.  Sheldon: What
a pair! Arnie: Built like a brick shithouse. Mel: You got the money, honey, I
got the time.  Sheldon: Don’t mean maybe. Arnie:  All talk and no action.
Mel:  Any more at home like you?  Sheldon: She can put her shoes under my
bed anytime. Arnie: Hard work but somebody’s got to do it. Mel: Saving it
for the worms?  Sheldon: Well, back to the salt mines. Arnie: Another day,
another dollar. Sheldon: That ain’t hay. Mel: Long day, no. Arnie: We were
just talking about you. Sheldon: that’s what she said. Arnie: Well, that’s
that. Mel: I don’t bust my hump for anyone anymore. Arnie: Couldn’t care
less. Sheldon: If you don’t like it, lump it. Mel:  Who cut the cheese?
Arnie:  Another county heard from. Mel: Do me a favor. Drop dead. Sheldon: I'm
feeling bright eyed and bushy tailed. Mel: Have a coffin nail? Arnie: Don't mind
if I do. Mel: I’ve been smoking all my life and I ain’t dead yet. Arnie: I
could eat a horse. Mel: He’d lose his head if it wasn’t tied on. Sheldon: He
has as much chance as a snowball in hell. Arnie:  He’s pissing against the
wind. Sheldon: Just a spit in the ocean. Arnie: Well, doesn’t that beat the
band. Mel: Be my guest. Arnie:  Can you beat that? Sheldon: Can’t complain.
Arnie:  Doesn’t time fly when you’re having fun. Sheldon: Who pulled your
chain?  Arnie: Yeah, clear as mud. Mel: You haven’t got the brains you were
born with. Arnie: Cool it. Sheldon: Heads I win, tails you lose. Arnie: Cross my
heart and hope to die. Sheldon: It’s curtains. Arnie: Do it, or else. Sheldon:
Does a bear shit in the woods? Arnie: That and a nickel will get you on the
subway. Sheldon: Close but no cigar. Mel: You know what time it is? Half past
a cow’s ass. Arnie: Same to you. Sheldon: What a crock! Arnie: Your mother
goes down for wooden nickels. Sheldon: Your mother! Arnie: Age before beauty.
Sheldon: All dressed up and nowhere to go. Mel: Doozie pots. Arnie: You know
what. Sheldon: What?  Arnie: That's what.
