Title: An Iris Anecdote
Date: September 11, 2006

In my Vermont garden, I grow a number of different varieties of German (also
called bearded) irises. One variety -- a bicolor I inherited a decade ago from
my sister-- had died. I put a spade into the ground to see if I could discover
the source of the problem, and I found that the rhizomes had deteriorated to a
loathsome smelly unholy mess the consistency of overripe bananas. It was a truly
disgusting situation and one that I had never encountered before. For the sake
of garden sanitation, I dug out the decay and some surrounding soil and carried
the filth to the local dump.

Later in the summer, I read this sentence in a garden book: "we cannot confirm
the folk wisdom that bacterial soft rot in irises can be caused by horse
manure."Â  I knew that rot in iris rhizomes could be spread by iris borers, but
these irises were borer-free. On the other hand, I had been working the soil
with load after generous load of horse manure. So perhaps there's some truth to
the derided superstition. In any case, since I switched to fertilizing irises
with the abundant droppings of sheep I haven't had a recurrence of the disease.
But then again, I haven't been able to re-test the particular susceptible
variety--it being an iris now extinct in my garden.
