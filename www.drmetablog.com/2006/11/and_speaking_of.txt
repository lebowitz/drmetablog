Title: And Speaking of Mosquitoes...
Date: November 16, 2006

Once upon a time I had a foolproof system for clearing a bedroom of
mosquitoes.  Close the door, turn on a light, stick the left arm out of the
bedclothes, keep track of the mosquitoes by their whine, and then, as soon as
one lands on the exposed skin, smack it with the right hand.  After a few
minutes, turn out the light, sleep tight. Used to work wonders.

The system doesn't work any more?  Why?  Because my antiquated ears no longer
register high-pitched sounds. I can't hear mosquitoes until one of them pecks on
my eardrum.  I'm vulnerable to sneak attack.

It's bad: all mosquitoes are now stealth mosquitoes. It's good: I'll never again
be troubled by that nasty whine.
