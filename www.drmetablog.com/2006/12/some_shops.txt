Title: Some Shops
Date: December 16, 2006

We're just back from a week in Greenwich Village. Here are some of the stores that were within two or three blocks of our temporary residence: "Beasty Feast Pet Food Supplies"; "Cherry Boxx" (sex toys and outfits); "Golden Rule Wine and Liquor"; "Henrietta Hudson Bar and Girl"; "Badlands Entertainment" (xxx videos); "Condomania" -- all kinds of condoms and related gear; "Suds Cafe" (a laundromat and espresso bar); a shop that specializes in "eyebrow threading"; the "Sports Cap and Hat Store"; "Man + Plus" (which I read as Man plus plus); "Yuki's Chinese Restaurant" (bad corporate name); "Birthday Suit" (bachelorette-fetish, the sign clarified); the "Why Not Men's Spa"; "Pet Portraits"; "Doodle-Doos" (a children's hair salon); "Kid's RX" (children's prescription drugs); and "Cowgirl" -- I couldn't recognize anything in the cowgirl stock, certainly nothing that would home on the range; also, an admirable piece of commercial hyperbole: "Splendid Dry Cleaners." In addition, a truck bearing the name "Dr. Playground" -- mobile playground repairs, I would suppose. All in all, quite a remarkable display of capitalist initiative.
