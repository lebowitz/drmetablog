Title: Xmas Thoughts
Date: December 09, 2006

If the profoundly religious seventeenth-century founders of our country had a
single favorite Biblical moment, it might be where the Lord (speaking through
His prophet Amos) severely condemned the vanity of holidays. "I hate," said
the Lord, "I despise your feast days, and I will not smell in your solemn
assemblies."  The Lord of Hosts specifically enjoined against the attempt
to placate him by sacrificing animals (a matter of topical concern in Amos'
time).  "Though ye offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings, I will not
accept them; neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat beasts." 
Nor did He rest with these easy-to-follow injunctions, but He went on to condemn
all musical tributes as well.  Nor more chants, glees or carols: "Take thou
away from me the noise of thy songs; for I will not hear the melody of thy
viols."  Our Puritan forefathers interpreted these lines correctly; they
recognized that the Lord opposed not only ritual sacrifice and music but all
formal observance and rote piety. The Ancient of Days made it abundantly clear
that what moved him was not empty ceremony but genuine morality.  HIs solution:
"let justice run down as waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream."  Taking
these uncompromising sentences as their guide, our founders dug in their heels
against the ostentatious celebration of of all holidays, especially Christmas.

Would they not have been reduced to angry and impotent sobs by the grotesque
consumerism -- the burnt offerings and squeaking timbrels  -- that in 2006
substitute for justice and righteousness?  Could there be anything more
loathsome either to Amos or to our devout ancestors than "Silent Night" at a
shopping mall?

Ah for a twenty-first century Amos!
