Title: What We Read in the Fifties:  Arrowsmith
Date: December 27, 2006

Sinclair Lewis's Arrowsmith, published in 1924 and now hopelessly dated, was
a mere thirty years old when we read it in Erasmus Hall High School English
classes. I must confess, once again, that I recall almost nothing from my 1950s
reading -- just a vague sense that I'd been there before. Nevertheless, the
novel wasn't a bad book to present to young people. Dr. Martin Arrowsmith is
a dedicated, humorless, idealistic, workaholic scientist who eludes both the
snares of commerce and also of love and family in a single-minded pursuit of the
knowledge that will save lives. Sinclair Lewis's America is repressive, vulgar,
materialistic, and unredeemed. Why not let high schoolers read a book with such
a manic, satirical spirit?  It might have done them a world of good -- though I
can't vouch that it did anything for me.

Dr. Arrowsmith has no time anything so frivolous as aesthetics -- and it's just
as well, for neither does his creator. Arrowsmith is shapeless in form and
crude in style. It's a sledgehammer of a book, as unsubtle as America at its
worst.

Query: were we informed that Sinclair Lewis was famous for having said that
"when fascism comes to America, it will be wrapped in the flag and carrying a
cross?"
