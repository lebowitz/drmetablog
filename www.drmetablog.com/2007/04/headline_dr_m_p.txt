Title: Headline:  Dr. M. Patronized by Five-Year-Old Grandson
Date: April 07, 2007

We take the small aluminum bat and the "safety" baseball to the concrete
schoolyard and I try to pitch the ball at the exact level where the grandson
swings.  Every time he makes contact, the ball rolls a hundred or so feet until
gravity and friction kick in (I have no fielders behind me). Grandpa retrieves
the ball. The grandson says, "Grandpa, why don't you run after the ball?"

Even without running, Grandpa manages to pull a muscle in his side and
experience some interesting numbness in his left leg.

We play a board-game called Narnia. It has three separate kinds of dice; it has
"sword cards" and "event cards," "wolves" and "white witches."  Grandpa doesn't
seem to grasp the game's subtleties.  The grandson says, "Grandpa, why don't we
play something less complicated."

We play chess. Grandpa manages to lose the first game, but despite his best
efforts, takes a lead in the second match (perhaps because he's fully mastered
the way the knight moves). Grandpa makes a gracious offer: "why don't we just
say it was a draw?" The grandson responds by flying his queen over the ranks and
files and knocking Grandpa's king off the board. The grandson says, "Why don't
we just say I won?"
