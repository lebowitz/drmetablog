Title: A Mental Prosthesis
Date: June 01, 2007

Regular readers of this blague will remember that Dr. M. has long ago confessed
that he suffers from a serious case of "directional disability," or as some call
it, "geographical dyslexia" -- which means that he regularly loses his way, is
subject to travel-based panic attacks, and is consequently abused by friends and
family who refuse to recognize that he's not stupid, just utterly lost.

Advanced technology rides to my rescue. I now own a mobile navigator. It
affixes to the windshield of the car, and, using signals bounced off three
or four satellites, instructs me how to get from point A to point B. I've
fallen profoundly in love with the disembodied female British voice who
doesn't criticize me when I make a wrong turn: she just says, very politely,
"recalculating."  Then she says, "drive point five miles and turn left." 
What a boon to the chronically lost! I now drive as accurately as a migrating
bird. My only reservation: I think that my friend should congratulate me when
I get to where I'm going. She should show a little enthusiasm. But all she
says is "arriving at destination, on left." What would it hurt her to offer
congratulations?  I'm not asking for a commitment or for flowers.

The navigator has now moved into first place among my prostheses, supplanting
the incisor.
