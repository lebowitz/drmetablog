Title: World's Largest Ball of Twine
Date: June 10, 2007

Today In Cawker City, Kansas, we made a pilgrimage to the world's largest ball
of twine. It's enormous: 40 feet in circumference and 14,000 pounds (when last
measured and weighed in 1986). And still growing. We were offered some twine to
add our bit, but declined. It would be desecration -- like adding a stone to the
great Pyramid at Giza or to Stonehenge. Instead, we paid silent homage.

We didn't stop to see the world's largest prairie dog in Oakley. Or the Russell
Stover birthplace in Alton. Nor even the Evel Knievel Museum in Topeka. Can't do
everything.

And yet there are these pseudo-sophisticates who say that there's no culture in
Kansas.
