Title: Bring Me the Head of Alberto Gonzales
Date: August 14, 2007

It's public knowledge that Bush recently underwent a colonoscopy, but the
doctors' reports have not been widely disseminated. It appears that, in addition
to the polyps, way up high, lodged against the pyloric sphincter, was found
the entire head of Attorney-General Alberto Gonzales. Until this discovery, it
was not generally known that Gonzales' head was missing; according to received
Washington wisdom, it was only his brains. A second smaller mass, puzzling
at first, has now been definitively identified as the nose of Senator Joseph
Lieberman (I-Conn).

(August 16)Â  Spike Schapiro adds: "Not the whole story. Bush's head was also
found in there. It had been missing since late in his last term as Texas
Governor."
