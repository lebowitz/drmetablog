Title: Cuisine de Minnesota
Date: September 14, 2007

The Ranch Restaurant (family-owned, not a chain) in Rochester, Minnesota offered
a splendid salad bar. In addition to the conventional fare (greens, onions,
tomatoes, peppers, etc.), there were some items that were distinctly regional:
herring in wine sauce, baked beans, cherry jello topped with whipped cream,
chocolate pudding and also Watergate Salad.

Watergate Salad, new to me I must confess, is a melange of pistachio pie
filling, mini-marshmallows, canned pineapple chunks (with syrup), pecans, and
Cool-Whip. Here's a question for those who are expert in Minnesotan fine dining:
is your Watergate Salad best eaten with or without herring?

Our waiter at The Ranch, asked whether the tomato soup was prepared with cream,
replied, "It's a tomato biscuit with peas and stuff in it." He was slightly off
the mark: lots of stuff in the bisque but alas no peas.
