Title: "-way"
Date: December 29, 2007

We were in the car heading toward Palo Alto when I brought up the old bromide
that in the English language, a person drives on a parkway and parks on a
driveway.  Immediately, my fellow-passengers began to list other roadways
that contained the element ”way.”   Highway, superhighway, freeway (and
its opposite, tollway) came immediately to mind.  Then came throughway,
expressway (called in England ‘dual carriageway’), broadway, runway, 
pathway, footway, byway, subway, tramway, and skyway.  After a while, some less
common words arrived:  gangway, passageway, arborway (Boston only, as far as I
know;  Boston has also given us fenway), fairway, alleyway and causeway.  To
what cause does a causeway subscribe?  None; the word ultimately derives from
Latin calx, limestone.  As we came closer to home: doorway, hallway, archway,
entranceway, stairway, breezeway.

Ah, wellaway, there must be many others.

Well, why do we drive on a parkway and park on a driveway?  Hey, why does your
nose run and your feet smell?   Why is catnapping pleasurable but kidnapping
reprehensible?   It’s the way of language; it’s wordway.
