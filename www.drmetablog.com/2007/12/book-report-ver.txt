Title: Book Report:  Vernon God Little
Date: December 10, 2007

At  first I found Vernon God Little to be rough going.  The narrative voice
-- a popcultch-saturated south Texas adolescent idiom -- took some getting
used to. The novel is a post-mass-murder burlesque, hilarious in spots, but
not even remotely credible.  Vernon God Little won the Man Booker Prize in
2003, but I wonder whether the novel would be so highly regarded by English
literati if it had portrayed England the way it portrays the U.S -- as a
country where everyone, every single person, is either a pederast, an idiot,
a con-man, a traitor, an opportunist, an incompetent, or just fat, lovelorn,
vicious and vacant. The pseudonymous DBC Pierre, an Australian, seems to have
acquired all his information about the United States from watching trash TV. 
He's written a funny book, because caricature can be very amusing, but I hope
that unwary Europeans and Asians who read Vernon God Little don't think that
they've entered the heart of America, because they sure as hell haven't.
Caveant lectores. I wonder also about the novel's thick impasto of Christian
symbolism.  Vernon lives on Beulah Lane in a town called Martirio; he calls
himself a "skategoat."  Will he die for America's vulgarities?  And are
we supposed to take seriously Vernon's last-minute conversion to faith?  I
couldn't -- in fact, the last- chapter Hollywood ending seemed to me mighty
meretricious.
