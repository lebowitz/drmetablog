Title: Predictions for 2008
Date: December 30, 2007

Diligent readers of this blague will recall that last January, I made a series of daring forecasts about the year 2007.  It's now time to review my projections and evaluate my record.  I'm proud to say that a panel of independent experts has confirmed that I hit the jackpot.  I scored an 8 out of 8, 100%, A+.  I'm now a fully accredited prophet.

These were my 2007 predictions:

"1)  there will be unusual weather patterns in North America;

2)  a famous Hollywood actress will sue for divorce;  moreover, another (or possibly the same) Hollywood star will become pregnant; another (or possibly the same) actress will gain and lose a great deal of weight;

3)  a well-known athlete will be accused of taking drugs;

4)  a politician will be involved in a sex scandal;

5)  questions will be raised about America's food supply;

6)  there will be either a monsoon, an airplane crash, or a capsized ferry in Asia--perhaps all three;

7)  there will be fluctuations in the stock market, and, finally,

8)  there will be turmoil in the Middle East."

Did I score big-time,or what?  Note especially #4.  How did I know that "wide-stance" would become a household phrase?   Boggles the imagination.  Moreover, stock market fluctuations have been greater than even I could have hoped for (same with Mideast turmoil).  Concerning athletes and drugs, just think "Barry Bonds" and "Mitchell Report."  I knocked that one out of the park.

Is everyone ready for my 2008 predictions?

I'm staying with 1-8.  But I'm going out on a limb with #9:  "A religious leader will be involved in either a financial or a sexual scandal (perhaps both)."   And #10:  "Questions will be raised about the accuracy of the vote count."

You read it here first.  Loyal readers: check back at the end of 2008.  Let's see if Dr. M. can top his scintillating successes of 2007.
