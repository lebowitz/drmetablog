Title: Sticker Shock
Date: January 05, 2008

We're in Manhattan (New York, not Kansas) where I'm suffering from two kinds of sticker shock:  regular and newyorkish.  Regular:  at DIA, I treated myself to a cylinder of Life Savers:  $1.35.  Life Savers, as everyone knows, were invented by Hart Crane's father and are still manufactured to the formula that has made them a gourmet delight for a hundred years:  "sugar, corn syrup, high fructose corn syrup, artificial flavors (Red 40, Yellow 5, Blue 1)."  But Life Savers cost, in my childhood, exactly a nickel.  Now it's $1.35 for a small package!!  Beyond belief!!  But if regular sticker shock is bad, what about high-voltage newyorkish shock?  In my own lifetime, it was possible to ride the NYC subway for 5 cents.  Now it's two count 'em two bucks, making the lifesaverish increase seem like peanuts.  And what about this morning's breakfast?  An omelet and a cup of coffee:  $17.23 plus tip.  And the earmuffs at a boutique for brazillionaires on Madison Avenue:  $650.  After an efficient deliberation, we decided against purchasing the designer earmuffs. At a nearby shop, knockoffs just as effective were available at $32.00, which, in context, seemed like a bargain. Only $16 per ear.  But shouldn't a pair of earmuffs retail for $1.59?
