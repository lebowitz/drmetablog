Title: P. S. 217 Graduating Class:  June, 1952
Date: March 31, 2008

On your left is the official photograph of the 1952 P. S. 217 eighth grade
graduating class, contributed by a classmate who now teaches in Brazil. (Click
to enlarge). It's quite the time capsule, isn't it -- the dated costumes, the
old-fashioned hairstyles, along with the clean-cut and dewy enthusiasm of far-
away-and-long-ago youth. What has become of these promising young people? Some
of them have long since left the planet and some are no doubt still engaged in
distinguished careers. Do any of them still live in the old neighborhood? 
Sent their children or grandchildren to the old school?

A panel of experts has tentatively identified some of the graduates. Some of
these ascriptions are sure to be inaccurate. Corrections, suggestions and
comments are very welcome.
