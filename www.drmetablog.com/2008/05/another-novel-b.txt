Title: Another Novel by John Hassler
Date: May 29, 2008

Last month, I reported that I had read The Dean's List and that I was not
sufficiently impressed to enroll myself in the John Hassler fan club.Â  But
inasmuch as Hassler had been so celebrated upon his death, and I felt negligent,
I thought it only fair to give him a second try. Now I've done so: I've read
The Staggerford Flood (2002). It's a congenial satire that concerns itself with
an aging group of small-town Minnesota Catholics. It's intermittently witty,
but either too subtle or too fey for me. Hassler has been praised as a great
regionalist, but in my view can't hold a candle to the upper New York state
chronicles of Richard Russo and isn't even in the same league with the inventive
and often very beautiful Baltimore novels of Anne Tyler.
