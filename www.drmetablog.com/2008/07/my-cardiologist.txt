Title: My cardiologist treats a new patient
Date: July 05, 2008



Nurse, how good is the anaesthetist?

Does Medicare cover this procedure?

Pass me the scalpel.  I mean, the scimitar.

What kind of steriods is this fellow on?

Let's not ignore the 800-pound gorilla in the room.

He says that his name is Dr. Bruce Banner.

Doctor, wait until you see your next patient.

That's the loudest murmur I've ever heard.

Can you move it along, Doc?  The family is in the waiting room and they're getting impatient.
