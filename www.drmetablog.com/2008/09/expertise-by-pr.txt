Title: Expertise by Proximity
Date: September 15, 2008

Regular correspondent Otis Jefferson Brown inquires whether, in lieu of the
precedent by which Sarah Palin claims expertise in foreign affairs because
she can almost see Russian from Alaska, he is now a rocket scientist because,
through his bedroom window, he can, on starry nights, see the moon.

Otis, I'm sorry to say,  does not grasp the precedent.  Of course he's not
a rocket scientist, because he's not educated or practiced in that difficult
field.  However, he is certainly qualified, by the principle of expertise
by proximity, to become the head of NASA, for which position I urge him to
immediately apply, especially if he attended high school with Sarah.

Is each and every Alaskan equally qualified to be Vice President?  Of
course they are, but with a caveat.  Those who live in the western part
of the state are obviously more knowledgeable and are to be preferred to
dwellers in the Alaskan interior.  Eastern Alaskans have not achieved more
significant expertise by proximity than what would prepare them to serve as
trade representative to the Yukon, or perhaps, ambassador to Canada.
