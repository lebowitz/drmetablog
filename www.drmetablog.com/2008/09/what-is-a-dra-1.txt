Title: What is a Drag?
Date: September 05, 2008

What, exactly, is a drag?  Here's a sentence from Kate Chopin's edgy (in a
Victorian way) 1899 novel, The Awakening.  "Alcee Arobin and Mrs. Highcamp
called for Mrs. Pontellier one bright afternoon in Arobin's drag."  A drag? 
Could it be "a large four-horse coach with seats inside and on top."  O my
gosh!  It's still another nineteenth-century horse-drawn vehicle!  Along with
a cutter and a kibitka.   Memo to self: add to list.

I didn't know of the existence of The Awakening, a novel which had dropped
completely off the map, until sometime in the 1980s, when it re-established
itself in courses in AmLit.  It was a banned book for a while, not, I would
guess, because of the adultery itself, but because Edna Pontellier acknowledges
and acts on sexual desire.  Alcee Arobin, drag-owner, senses her vulnerability,
but I don't think that in this case the vehicle figures in the seduction.  It's
a fine, liberating book, the prose a little on the hothouse-gardenia side, but
well worth the re-reading.
