Title: The Libertarian Universe
Date: October 12, 2008

Out here in the west, social services are administered by the county
commissioners.  At a candidate forum last night, libertarians running for
commissioner opposed a .05% (i.e. a penny on a $20 purchase) extension of
a sales tax that would go to support battered women, the alcohol recovery
facility, mental health, walk-in clinics for the poor, etc.   The libertarian
argument: "charity" should be voluntary.  When the government collects taxes,
it will be elected officials not "the people" who decide which "charity" to
support.

It's a truly grotesque argument.  Of course elected officials (democratically-
elected officials) decide.  Its their job;  we've delegated it to them.  We
elect officials to to decide how to spend all public revenue.  What exactly is
the problem?

Moreover, I know of not a single instance in which a complex society such as
ours has been able to support the less able and less fortunate with strictly
private charity.  It hasn't happened and it's certainly not going to happen
soon.

Is private giving morally superior to public intervention, as the libertarians
assert?  I don't know that it is.  Most of us express our commitment to the
general welfare by paying our share of the burden.

I can only conclude that the libertarians, at least the ones that I heard last
night, live in an alternative and wholly theoretical universe.  They're in
thrall to a foolish and impractical ideology -- one that renders their actions
unintentionally hard-hearted and cruel.

And what makes them so damn angry, intolerant and insulting?
