Title: My Day
Date: November 05, 2008

My election day was much like that of many Americans, I betcha. In the morning, out walking the neighboring precincts, to knock on doors and rouse up the occasional procrastinator. I was greeted for the most part by enthusiastic thumbs-up Obama voters but also by apologetic laggards whom I forced to swear holy oaths that they would hustle down to the polling place "right now." I encountered one sour young woman who told me that she was so tired of being urged to vote that she was sorry that she had voted. I was on good behavior and did not respond that there was a lot more at stake than her convenience. Later in the day, after the mandatory septuagenarian nap, I talked with a candidate for county commissioner and together we made a last check of the polls. Then to a downtown restaurant where partisans had gathered to await the results. I was nervous as a cat when at first Virginia showed up in the red column and I couldn't relax until Ohio came in blue. Then, moderately joyful, off to a friend's house to watch the long parade of blue states. Lots of shouting and applause. At last the polls closed on the California coast and the US was once gain in the care of a person with brains, education, and values that I could recognize. Then home to watch McCain gracefully concede and Obama accept. Broken sleep, but this morning up early to search the archives for the flag and the flagpole. Right now Old Glory, looking might relieved and cheerful, is flying above all the Obama/Biden and Dem yard signs. A great lift to the world's spirits, and to mine.
