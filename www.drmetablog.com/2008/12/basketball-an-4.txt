Title: BASKETBALL ANNOUNCER EXHIBITS PROFOUND IGNORANCE OF BIBLE
Date: December 04, 2008

I watched the Nuggets beat the living whatchamacallit out of the Toronto
Raptors. Actually, I didn't watch the entire game -- it was a gruesome mismatch.
I can endure only so much garbage time at a single sitting. The high point,
for me, was a comment by one of our home team announcers (I'll not reveal his
name). Toronto has a reserve point guard named Willie Solomon, who acquired the
nickname "King Solomon" when he played for Maccabi Tel Aviv in 2005. "Must be a
reference to the movie," suggested our announcer.

I'm guessing that he means King Solomon's Mines.

Well, no one ever suggested that we consult TV announcers for knowledge of
scripture.
