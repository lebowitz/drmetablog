Title: Etymology of the Word "Steerage"
Date: January 06, 2009

The origin of "steerage," a word used to describe the part of the vessel
allotted to the poorest of passengers is not fully established. Some say that
"steerage" originally referred to the section nearest the rudder, but for this
theory I can find no confirmation. As far as I know, steerage passengers were as
likely to be housed fore as aft. Another guess is that the cables that ran from
the steering wheel to the rudder passed through this level of the ship. It's
also been ventured that emigrants were located on the same deck that was used
for transporting steers. This suggestion seems inherently unlikely, although it
is certainly true that in pre-refrigeration days, large numbers of livestock
were carried on ships in order to maintain a supply of fresh milk, eggs, and
meat.Â  Is it possible that the "-age" in "steerage" is used as in "storage" or
baggage?" "Steerage" seems to be unique to English. Other European languages
simply say "between decks"; so German "zwischendeck," Spanish "entrepuente,"
Swedish "mellandaeck," Norwegian "mellomdeck," French "entrepont," etc. Until
the nineteenth century, "steerage" simply meant "steering," as in Romeo's
picturesque "But he that hath the steerage of my course,/ Direct my sail."
