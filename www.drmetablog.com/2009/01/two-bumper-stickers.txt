Title: Two Recently-Sighted Bumper Stickers
Date: January 21, 2009

A.  "Tattoos Get You Sex."  A forthright, undisguised sentiment.  Here we
have an enormous advertising establishment working indefatigibly to imply
that the car, the beer, the perfume, the toothpaste, the sneakers will get
you laid.  But do they ever come out and say so directly?  No.  It's
all implication and suggestion (except for the commercials for Viagra/Cialis
-- a special case).  But here's a bumper sticker that lays it on the line. 
No sly metaphors or beating around the bush.  But is it true that there's an
alignment between sex and tattoos?  Where's the double-blind evidence?  I'll
wait until I see the utterly unbiased report from the National Association of
Tattoo Artists.

B    "Ann Coulter is a Man."  This one puzzled me a bit because it didn't
say whether Ann was born a man or had recently been surgically tranformed
into one.  In any case, I'm not all skeptical about the accuracy of the
assertion.  What else could account for the fact that Ann (or Andrew, let us
now call him/her) acts and speaks like an ignorant, show-offy, foul-mouthed,
testosterone-fueled teen-age boy?

My evaluation:  A is false in most cases;  B is certainly true.

January 30.  Here's another bumper sticker, encountered yesterday.  NO MORE
DUMB PRESIDENTS.  'Nuff said.
