I had to dispose of the corpse.

My choice was either to take it to the dump, piece by piece, weekly, or bury it on the property.  Whose body?  Don't know.  How did it get into the freezer?  I put it there, in a black plastic bag, after I killed him.  I gave careful consideration to the pros and cons of each method.  If I took it to the dump, there might be fingerprints or perhaps pieces of paper with my name on them.  And it might take weeks to complete the process.  If I buried it on the land, it would always be here.  Who knows what excavations there might be in the future.  I started to bury it, but just as I put a shovel in the earth, a small, yappy dog started pestering me.

Time to wake up.  Hey, good deal.  I didn't murder anyone.  I'm clean.
