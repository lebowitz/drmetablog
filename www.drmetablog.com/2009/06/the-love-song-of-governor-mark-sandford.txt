Title: The Love Song of Gov. Mark Sanford (in his own 'eamailed' [sic] words).
Date: June 29, 2009

-I-

You were basking

in what seems a great spot.

I am most jealous

of  your salad

under the palm trees.

I do not want to raise expectations

about feelings

and things.

You are special

and unique

and fabulous

in a whole host of ways.

I will write you a longer note

with a few more profound thoughts

tomorrow

or

Wednesday.

It won't be worthy of bedside placement.

-II-

I went out and ran the excavator with lights until the sun came up.

There is something wonderful

about listening to country music playing in the cab,

the air conditioner running,

the hum of a huge diesel engine in the background

the tranquility that comes with being in a virtual wilderness

of trees and marsh,

the day breaking

and vibrant pink becoming alive in the morning clouds.

And getting to build something with each scoop

of dirt.

It is admittedly weird.

-III-

Do you really comprehend

how beautiful your smile is?

Have you been told lately

how warm your eyes, and how they softly glow

with the special nature of your soul?

The rarest of all commodities in this world is love.

You already had

a full tank of love

in the emotional bank account.

Since our first meeting there in  the wind-swept

somewhat open air

dance spot in Punta del Este,

I felt that you had that same rare attribute.

You have a level of sophistication that is so

fitting

with your beauty.

You have the ability to give magnificently gentle kisses.

I love the curves of your hips.

I love your tan lines.

You have a particular grace and calm that I adore.

In the faded glow of night's light

that we spoke of

at the steakhouse.

-IV-

This soul-mate feel

I alluded to

is real.

How this lightning strike snuck up on us

I am still not sure.

My heart wants to get on a plane tonight to be in your loving arms.

My head says how do we put the genius back in the bottle

The bottom line is two fold.
