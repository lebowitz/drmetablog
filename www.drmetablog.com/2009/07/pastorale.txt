Title: Pastorale
Date: July 18, 2009

Sharon was here yesterday.  She has a new method to keep the raccoons and the
rats out of the food bins.  "The rats gnaw through the plastic garbage cans,
the raccons open them unless I bungee them real tight. Galvinized works, but
what we do now is buy junk refrigerators or freezers.  The rats can't get into
them.  Of course, what you spill is feast for the mice."  Sharon's husband
is a vet, but at lambing time last winter he was still recuperating from
a hip replacement.  "One of the ewes," Sharon says, "was having a hard
time delivering her lamb.  I went out to help pull.  I pulled out a head
and a leg.  The lamb must have been dead for a long time.  I whipped out the
cell phone.  I said to David, 'I don't care how long it takes to limp down
here, you're in charge.'  He took one look, got the rifle, and shot the ewe."
