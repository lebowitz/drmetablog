Title: The Slightness of the Lambs
Date: August 25, 2009

As far as I can tell, the deer generally keep clear of the back field where
the Morgans and the Scottish Blackfaces are pastured. Perhaps it's because
the domestic animals eat down the grass, or perhaps the deer just don't like
company. But a few days ago, I watched four white-tailed deer -- a doe with
three fawns, I believe, though such a group makes an unlikely family -- chase
twenty-two sheep out of the field and back to their fold. Sheep are notoriously
skittish, but then, so are the white tails. It was a battle of cowards. It was
especially painful to watch because one of the sheep was the ram, McCavish,
and it's his job (aside from the annual servicing, at which he performed
brilliantly) is to guard the ewes. McCavish is the "herd sire," new to the
flock. He was recently imported from Wisconsin; his grandfather came from
Scotland in the form of a vial of sperm packed in dry ice. What was Mr. McCavish
thinking when he ran from the field?  I was embarrassed for him and for the
entire flock. Query:  will the sheep stand their ground or will they allow
themselves to be intimidated by the wild turkeys?
