Date: September 25, 2009

Ray Chapman, the most notorious of  the dead-in-mid-career, was batting .300
when he was hit on the head by a spitball thrown by Carl Mays in August of 1920.
"Big Ed" Delahanty, a Hall-of-Famer, fell drunk off the International Bridge at
Niagara Falls in 1903.  Cory Lidle, Thurman Munson, Nestor Chavez, Ken Hubbs
and the great Roberto Clemente died in plane crashes.  Many players, including
Nick Adenhart, a pitcher of great promise until April 9, 2009, have died in
car crashes.  Danny Frisella died in a dune buggy accident.  Steve Olin and
Tim Crews ran their motorboat into a pier in 1993.  Steve Bechler was a 2003
victim of Ephedra. Tiny Bonham and Jake Daubert died of appendicitis, Harry
Agganis of a blood clot, Darryl Kile was found dead in his hotel room, having
succumbed to an unsuspected heart defect. Urban Shocker died of pneumonia,
Danny Thompson of leukemia.  Dernell Stinson, Gus Polidor, Dave Shotkowski and
Lyman Bostock were murdered.  Just last year, Geremi Gonzalez was struck by
lightning. Jim Umbricht died of cancer at age 34. His ashes were spread over
the field he loved.  Unfortunately, he played at domed stadium with artificial
grass, so after a few days, he was vacuumed up and spends eternity in a Texas
landfill.
