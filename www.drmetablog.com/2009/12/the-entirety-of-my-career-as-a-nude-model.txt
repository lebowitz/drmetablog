Title: The Entirety of My Career as a Nude Model
Date: December 19, 2009

A friend of mine was teaching a course in life drawing and was having trouble
finding models. He asked me if I'd be willing to donate an hour. Hey, it was
the drug-crazed 1960s (or perhaps early 70s) and I had long since put modesty
behind. So I agreed.

It was odd to be naked  among a roomful of the clothed. I was more sensitive
to drafts than I would have guessed. It was difficult to remain motionless,
especially with all the houseflies a-lighting on the sensitive areas. It was
peculiar and a little flattering to have so many pairs of eyes fixed upon me.
However, my clearest memory is the student, a young woman, who at the end of the
hour, asked the teacher, "Next week, could you try to find someone with a more
interesting body?"

December 20.  I now realize that, bodywise, I have become more interesting over
the last forty years -- if interesting means lumpy, wrinkled, and asymmetrical.
