Title: Tendentiousness
Date: February 01, 2010

Here's verbatim quotation from the Camera, our hometown newspaper.Â  "Willcock
[CU Buffs' trainer] said I bruised something on the side of my leg," [Alec]
Burks said. "I've got real bad tendentious in my leg. He said he thought I
pulled something."

Nothing worse for team solidarity than a tendentious leg in constant squabble
with a doctrinaire ankle and an argumentative hip.

Tendonitis is no doubt the word in question. Once again, the spellcheck fairy
has waved the wand and produced nonsense.

Does the Camera employ human beings as editors? It would seem that it does not.
