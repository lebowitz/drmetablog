Title: True-life Overheard Dialogue Accurately Reported
Date: March 19, 2010

Two derelicts on the B--ld-r M-ll, both of them victims of (I'd guess)
methedrine, beer, tobacco, certainly marijuana and who knows what else. Neither
of them looking good: emaciation, missing teeth, scraggly beards, odors strong
enough to be visible, cachexis.

A:  "What are you eating?"B.  "Some kind of corn chip?"A.  "How are
they?"B.  "Salty.  I don't like them."A.  "Yeah, I try to stay away from
salt. Not good for you."
