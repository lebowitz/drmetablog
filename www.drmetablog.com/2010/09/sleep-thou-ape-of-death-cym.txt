Title: Somnus Imago Mortis
Date: September 27, 2010

It's an ancient commonplace -- sleep is the image of death.  In some versions,
it's a preparation for death: God has provided us with sleep to get us ready for
our inevitable end.  "Somnus imago mortis" is all over Shakespeare:  "sleep
thou ape of death,"  "death-counterfeiting sleep," etc.

My own personal sleep is so wracked with awakenings and nightmares and night-
sweats and fluff in the lung and a feverish tongue that I can't easily think of
it as a preparation for anything.  For me, sleep is rather a task, an effort,
than a period of oblivion.  I want my tombstone to be inscribed with the motto,
"No more insomnia, forever."

But just six weeks ago, I experienced a pure "somnus imago mortis" moment.  I
was on a gurney, drugged, prepared for surgery.  I was wheeled into a room. 
Time came to a complete halt.  And then several hours later I was awakened.
Nothing -- nothing -- intervened from the time that I was put under until the
moment when I came to. (Perhaps there was an amnesic in the drug cocktail -- I
wouldn't know.)

It was such a profound and eventless sleep that it has, in fact, prepared me for
the sleep of death.  There was not a whisper, not a thought, nothing.  Now, at
last, I know how it will be.

In the hospital, there was a very welcome rebirth.  But why, then, does the
phrase, "I have been half in love with easeful death" continue to resonate in my
brain?
