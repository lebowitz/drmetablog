Title: What Have We Come To?
Date: December 31, 2010

Just back from the post office, where I mailed the granddaughter her gift, a
zester. What is a zester, you ask?  It's a kitchen device designed to remove
the "zest," that is, the outermost skin of a citrus fruit.  The granddaughter's
zester is an inch and a half wide and thirteen inches long, including its five
inch handle. Essentially, it's a hand-held grater, very useful if you're a
cooking enthusiast. And why, you ask, would I venture out in 15F, snowy weather
to mail the zester to California, when the grand-daughter could have put it in
her backpack when she returned home? Because, I was creditably advised, the
zester would certainly be confiscated by airport security.

What have we come to, when, rightly or wrongly, we seriously entertain the
idea that an eleven-year-old child could hijack an airplane armed only with a
zester?  What would she do, abrade the pilot to death?
