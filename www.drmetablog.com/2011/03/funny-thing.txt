Title: A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Arena
Date: March 07, 2011

Thank you, thank you. (Applause)  You're a terrific audience. (Applause). 
Hey, did you see what's going on in basketball.  A Brigham Young player
was thrown off the team for having pre-marital sex. (Audience groans).  No
kidding.  Doesn't look good for BYU.  They got rid of the only kid on the team
who could score.  (Laughter)  Wouldn't it be great if Duke played BYU in the
NCAA finals?  The Blue Devils versus the Blue Balls.  (Laughter) Thank you,
thank you.  Actually, the team isn't named the Blue Balls.  They're called
the "Cougars."  Who would name a team "cougars?" Unless out there in Provo,
Utah, they think that "cougars" means "mountain lions?"  (Knowing laughter) 
Did you know that the official airline of Brigham Young is Virgin Atlantic? 
(Hoots) And that Brigham Young players don't have numbers on their Jerseys; 
they use letters.  The team color is scarlet.  (Audience groans). Hey, just
checking -- did Wilt Chamberlain go to BYU?  (Audience is mystified)   How did
the coach find out about the sex?  I don't know but there's a rumor that the
girlfriend, a BYU volleyball player, is pregnant.  No one knows whether she is
or not,  because they can't see under her burqa. (Confusion, jeers, embarrassed
tittering)  OK, we have a great show lined up. We'll be right back. (Hysterical
laughter and applause)
