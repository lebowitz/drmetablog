Title: "See the Ball, Hit the Ball"
Date: April 28, 2011

When Manny Ramirez visited George Washington High School, his former baseball
coach, Steve Mandl, asked hm to say something to his players about the art of
hittiing.  Ramirez, one of the most spectacular batters of all time (555
home runs, .585 slugging, .313 batting average), thought for a few moments and
then pronounced "see the ball, hit the ball."  From which we can derive that
he is not looking at a post-retirement career as a hitting coach.  He may be
the idiot savant of hitting.

Good thing the coach didn't ask him about fielding.  "See the ball, fumble the
ball."

"See the ball, hit the ball" is universal  wisdom that transcends its baseball
context -- like Wayne Gretzky's famous "skate to where the puck is going to be,
not where it is."

I've heard the masterful sentence ascribed also to Pete Rose.  But it's more
far more appropriate to Manny.
