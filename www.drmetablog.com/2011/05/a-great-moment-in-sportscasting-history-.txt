Title: A Great Moment in Sportscasting History
Date: May 13, 2011

Rajan Rondo is knocked down by Dwayne Wade and falls awkwardly dislocating his
left elbow.  Even though it's gruesome, the tape is repeated over and over
again. We see Rondo's arm bend backwards and we see him writhe in pain.

Jeff Van Gundy:  "It's horrible. I can't watch."

Mark Jackson (a Brooklynite who doesn't like Van Gundy):  "You can't look?  I
always wondered where you were from.  Now I know.  You're from the suburbs."

Later, Rondo returns and heroically plays the fourth period with just one
working arm.
