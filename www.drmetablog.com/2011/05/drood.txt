Title: Re-reading Drood
Date: May 25, 2011

I can't remember when I last read The Mystery of Edwin Drood, but I'm certain
that it was before 1997.  It was in that year that I passed the age that
Dickens had attained when he left our planet, leaving Drood undone.

This time, I read Drood with a sense of Impending Doom. I think it's because
Dickens died far too young -- in the prime of his age.  Not, however, in
the prime of his genius  -- although one never knows what he would have
produced if he had lived to his allotted three score and ten. The novel struck
me as a tired and eneravated performance.  Too many of the characters are
recycled from the Dickens repertory company, the humor is too strenuous, the
clues and the red-herrings too obviously contrived.  It's only very near the
moment of truncation, when the splendid Mrs. Billicken makes her appearance,
that the novel feels inspired in the old Dickens way.

I also read in sadness. When we commit to reading a long, densely plotted
novel, we take it for granted that all its mysteries will eventually be
resolved.  Such is the bargain that the novelist makes with his readers. But
this novel is different, because Dickens didn't make it to the end. And so, we
read it always tentatively, knowing that its mysteries will remain mysteries
forever and ever. So this time, alas, Drood was a memento mori -- and goodness
gracious, I already have enough of those.
