Title: Another Great Moment in Basketball Announcerese
Date: June 09, 2011

It was an excellent win for Dallas. The series isn't over yet, but it's better
to be up 3-2 than down 2-3.  Terry, Kidd, Chandler, Marion, and Berea all
played beautifully. Dirk Nowitzki had another lovely game.

And in the booth, Jeff Van Gundy continued to mangle the language at a
yogiberra level: "Dirk Nowitzki is now a household name in every locker room
in the world."
