Title: Hemlock Tale
Date: August 02, 2011

Dr. M.:  "The John Deere guy was over here the other day and he told us a story
about a fellow who had a 450 just like ours. He had the forks on the tractor,
the kind you use for picking up the round bales. He was working in his woods,
trying to bring down a big hemlock. He notched and cut it, but left a hinge and
the tree got hung up and wouldn't go over, so he tried to push the tree over
with his forks. Somehow or other, he got the forks on either side of the tree.
The hemlock came over, picked up his tractor, spun it 180 in the air, knocked
off the canopy, drove the upright right into his chest, killed him on the spot."

Big Al:  "I knew the guy. It was Howard Beck up in North Monroe. He was a low
wattage kind of guy. It's amazing he lived as long as he did."
