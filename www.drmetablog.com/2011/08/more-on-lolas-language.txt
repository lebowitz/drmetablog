Title: More on Lola's Language
Date: August 09, 2011

Lola and I brought some windfall apples to the horses. The horses are Morgans,
very friendly, but intimidatingly large to a 22-month-old child. We stood on
one side of the gate, the horses trotted up to the other side as soon as we
announced our presence. They like to lean over the fence and look in our pockets
for apples.

Lola said, and I quote, "Back Mommy." I contrued this opaque construction to
mean "I believe that I would now like to rejoin my mother back at the house as
quickly as possible."

Lola is succinct, but she sure knows how to make herself understood.
