Date: November 24, 2011

Charlie Dressen: "You Â know something? I never read a book in my whole life...
I can read newspapers and magazines. But I never read a book. You think I
should?"

Jean Harlow (on her birthday): "Don't get me a book. I already got a book."

Anatole Broyard: "If it hadn't been for books, we'd have been entirely at the
mercy of sex."
