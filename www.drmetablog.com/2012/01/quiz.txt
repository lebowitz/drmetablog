Title: Quiz

What is a currawong? a gonolek, a boubou, a tchagra, a brubru?  a sitella,
a minivet? a drongo? a common koel?  Do you think that I've invented these
words?  Heck no. Each one is absolutely genuine and furthermore, far beyond
my powers of invention. And from the same large family come the zitting
cisticola, the bulbul, the cacique, the oropedola, the po'o-uli, and the 'o'u.
Not to mention the rhabdornis, the oxpecker. the rockjumper, the babbler, the
treecreeper, the tapaculo, the cotinga, the manakin, the pitta, the assity, the
yellow rifleman, and the logrunner.

You've probably figured it out by now. They're all passerines.

These great and new-to-me words come from The Bird (New York, 2008), a
whimsical, idiosyncratic survey, by the appropriately--named ornithologist Colin
Tudge. "What's that on that branch over there? Is it a grinning tudge?"
