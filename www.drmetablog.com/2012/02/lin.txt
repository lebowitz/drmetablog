Title: Why We Love Sports
Date: February 14, 2012

I have to admit that I'm thoroughly taken with the Jeremy Lin story. It's so wonderfully, ridiculously improbable. Asian-American guy, Harvard!! economics grad, plays OK with the Erie Bayhawks and the Reno Bighorns but is released by two not-so-strong NBA teams. A last-resort number 4 point guard on the Knicks, sleeping on a couch in his brother's apartment, he comes off the bench to lead the worst team in the league to five straight wins, drops 38 on Kobe and the Lakers, etc. etc. Tyson Chandler, grumpy all season long, is now smiling. It's not just Frank Merriwell; it's everyone's secret dream. And a morality play to boot-- keep trying, persevere, trust your own abilities, take advantage of the opportunities. An inspiration and a message in the same package.

It can't last. JLin can't keep on averaging 27/8. The Knicks will eventually lose (though let's hope not tonight against shakey Toronto). One of those top point-guard defenders, such as Avery Bradley, is going to eat him alive one of these days. But he's the real deal and if he stays healthy, remains coachable, works on his three and on his left hand, he could have a great, historic career.

Meanwhile, it's absolutely fascinating. Ama're returns tonight; that should be easy. The test will come when Carmelo's groin heals. Can Lin and Anthony work and play well together? I'll be watching.

And congratulations to Tommie Amaker, Lin's Harvard coach; he's got to be one heck of a proud guy.

Another person who's mightyÂ happy: David Stern, who's been struggling to get a toehold for the NBA in the world's largest untapped market.
