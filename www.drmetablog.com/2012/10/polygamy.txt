Title: A Man and a Woman
Date: October 23, 2012

I find it utterly fascinating that Romney and Obama, who are so unlike in so
many ways and yet both to the best of our knowledge good "family men," are both
descended from polygamists.

Barack's great-grandfather Obama Opiyo had five wives and his grandfather,
Hussein Onyango, had at least four. Such was the Luo tradition. Barack's
father's bigamy was unlawful rather than traditional -- he left what used to be
called a "grass widow" behind when he escaped Kenya.

Both of Mitt's great-grandfathers, Miles Romney and Helaman Pratt were
polygamists. Miles had four wives and thirty children, Helaman had five
wive and who knows how many offspring. Both families fled the U. S. en masse
when a divine revelation and the enforcement of the Morrill Act ended polygamy
in 1890.

And yet preachers and politicians continue to proclaim that "marriage is between
one man and one woman, and always has been, since the time of Adam and Eve."

It ain't so. Nothing could be more ahistorical or more false. The biblical
patriarchs were all polygamists and King Solomon himself, a model of wisdom,
we are told, collected an astonishing, exhausting household of 300 wives and
700 concubines. Plural marriage was part of Jewish tradition way into the first
millennium. Another Abrahamic religion, Islam, is notably polygynous even as
it is furiously anti-polyandrous. Marriages over the world have taken every
shape imaginable, sometimes formally, sometimes informally. The idea that
marriage is  permanent and unchanging is a canard belied by the immediate and
symmetrical family histories of our two candidates.
