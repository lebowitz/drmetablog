Title: A New Look at the Republican Anus
Date: November 24, 2012

What in the living heck did Republican elder Haley Barbour mean when, discussing
his party's recent electoral disasters, he announced that "we’ve got to give
our political organization a very serious proctology exam. We need to look
everywhere”?

I've got to guess that he "misspoke." Surely he didn't mean to claim that GOP
office-holders have their heads so far up their own asses that it's going to
take a  proctoscope to locate them?
