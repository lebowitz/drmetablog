Title: Guns in the Classroom?  Why Not Swords?
Date: December 05, 2012

The ancient Romans did not allow swords to be carried within the pomerium, the
sacred central precincts of their city.

They were able to maintain the prohibition because they did not have a National
Sword Associaion to argue that if swords are banned, only criminals with have
swords; or that swords don't kill, people kill; or that it's a violation of
personal liberty for free men to be forced to check their swords at the city
wall. Nor was there a fanatic Roman electorate ruthless enough to donate to the
campaigns of every soft-brained aedile, quaestor, praetor, or consul willing to
proclaim the sanctity of swordsmen's rights.

Is it the case that swords were also prohibited in the Roman classroom?  I
don't know -- but I suspect as much.

Here at the University of Colorado, in the infant millenium, guns may not be
carried into the sacred precincts of the football stadium. However, they're
sure-as-hell legal in classrooms, and have been ever since a State Supreme Court
ruling forced the U to allow students with Colorado concealed weapon permits to
carry their guns on campus -- even on days when exams and papers are returned to
students by an historically-unarmed faculty.

So what about swords? Why should guns be allowed in class and swords prohibited?
I don't mean the modern rapier, which is so long that their presence would
create, in every classroom, a noisy clatter and might even cause unwary students
to trip and fall. I'm thinking rather of the Roman short sword, the famous
gladius, which can easily be worn, in an unthreatening manner, under the toga or
ski jacket.

Rapier (noisy and prone to cause accidents):

Gladius (inoffensive):

In point of fact, why the pusillanimous resistance to gladii at football
games?  Fifty-thousand spectators, highly-partisan fans, gargantuan quantities
of illegal booze and dope, and short swords -- what could possibly go wrong?
