Title: Amnesia on Film:  The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes (1970)
Date: February 03, 2013

As far as I can remember, and I've read the stories many times, Conan Doyle's
Sherlock Holmes never had to deal with amnesia, which in those days of reading
and writing had not yet become the most routine of plot devices. The Holmes of
Billy Wilder's movie runs into amnesia straight off the bat, when Gabrielle
Valladon, a handsome though mighty bedraggled woman, appears at 221-B Baker
Street apparently suffering a loss of memory precipitated by both a bump on
the head and a near drowning in the Thames. But there's a gimmick within the
gimmick: Mme. Valladon's amnesia is totally fraudulent. The lady is in "fact" a
German spy pretending loss of memory in order to insinuate herself into Holmes'
sympathies.

The audience falls for it, which is not a surprise, because we watchers have
been indoctrinated to willingly and enthusiastically suspend our disbelief at
the slightest hint of film's most common malady. But that Holmes should succumb
-- well, that's a bit of a disappointment. Fictional Holmes would have been a
lot more discerning, amnesia-wise, than filmic Holmes.
