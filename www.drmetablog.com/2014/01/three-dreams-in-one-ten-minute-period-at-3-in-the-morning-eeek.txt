Title: Three Dreams in One Ten-Minute Period at 3 in the Morning, Eeek!
Date: January 29, 2014

The first (the most ordinary, the least wild):  I'm sitting in a basketball stadium watching a game  (it's close to the end of the first half) when a fire drill is announced. Everyone, including me and my "date," a mysterious unknown woman whom my dreamatorium has conveniently supplied, leaves their seats. I'm now outside but I'm cold and I remember that I've left behind my denim jacket. I return to my place in the now-deserted arena but no jacket. Then I'm outside again. I locate my date and tell her about the missing denim. She serenely rises from her squat to reveal that she's been sitting on the jacket.  I wonder:  did she try to steal it?  2) The scene shifts abruptly. I'm now back fifty years, in graduate school, and I've been informed that a new requirement for the degree has been instituted. Each semester, every student will have  to drink a 20 oz. paper cup of a pink liquid (looks like Pepto-Bismol but is decidedly more mucilaginous and nasty).  3) All of a sudden i'm being pursued by a huge scary rhinoceros with an ovesize horn. I run, of course, terrified. Fortunately, I come upon a cottage size stack of carrots (large, grated, carefully arranged). I'm able to climb the pile, rather gracefully I think, but the rhino can't get any traction and I easily outdistance him. I was scared for a while but the carrots saved my life. Then I woke up.

Are there any interpreters of dreams out there?  Clearly, Dr. M. needs your help. (Do not bother using words like "nutso" or "loco," please.  Serious interpretations only.)
