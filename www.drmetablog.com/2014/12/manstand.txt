Title: "Man" Is Now an Adjective and not a Good One.
Date: December 23, 2014

I believe that I first heard "man" used as an adjective in the phrase "man cave"
-- which is, I believe, a place where guys go to isolate themselves from their
wimmen and famly and where they watch boxing on the TV, drink a lot of beer, and
puke on the shag rug. But recently I learned about the "man stand." "To do the
man stand" is when the husband waits at the door of the dress shop clutching
a bundle of packages while the old ball and chain decides between the 10 and
the 12 and between the gray one and the green. Sometimes a manstander parks
his carcass in a designated "man chair." And now there's a new one: the "man
spread", which describes the way a crude young guy with below-the-waist pants
sits in the subway, legs akimbo, indifferent to the gentle ladies and to the
tired old geezers who need to relax far more than he does.

"Man boobs," which are nothing more than unsightly fat, are sometimes
abbreviated to "moobs."  "Manparts" requires no elucidation.

In each of these cases, "man" is not used affectionately or admiringly. "Man,"
as an adjective, is anything but "manly." "Man" is primitive and insensitive,
an adjective of derogation and denigration.

January 4:  My penpalessa, SF, writes that in England the phrase "man flu" has
now become popular. A "man flu" is merely a cold that men (such babies they
are!!) make a fuss about, but which a woman would ignore.
