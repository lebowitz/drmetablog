Title: The Return of the Prophet
Date: December 31, 2014

Vivian de St. Vrain, fully accredited prophet (Senior Fellow, American
Society of Prophecy), has retreated to the mountaintop and has
returned with predictions for 2015. Here they are:

1)   there will be unusual weather patterns in North America;

2)  a famous Hollywood actress will sue for divorce;  moreover, another (or
possibly the same) Hollywood star will become pregnant; another (or possibly the
same) actress will gain and lose a great deal of weight;

3)  a well-known American or possibly European athlete will be accused of
taking drugs;

4)  a politician will be accused of taking bribes;

5)  questions will be raised about the safety of America's food supply;

6)  there will be either a monsoon, an airplane crash, or a capsized ferry in
Asia;

7)  there will be fluctuations in the stock market;

8)  there will be turmoil in the Middle East.

9)  a religious leader will be involved in either a financial or a sex
scandal.  Or perhaps both.

You read it here first. Loyal readers: check back at the end of 2015.  Let's
see whether a senior but world-class professional prophet still has enough on
the ball (a crystal ball) to foretell the future one more time.
