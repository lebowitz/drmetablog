Title: Susanne Bier:  Love is All You Need (The Bald Hairdresser) 2013
Date: February 21, 2015

There is unfortunately very little of the often superb Danish director Susanne
Bier in this darkish Hollywoodish comedy.Â  She's so much better when she stays
closer to her native themes.

The plot is built on an antique and hallowed cliche: northern Europeans migrate
to southern Italy to find freedom and to re-awaken love. In this case it's
Philip, a workaholic widower and Ida, the relict of a boorish unfaithful
husband, who make the journey. They (Pierce Brosnan and Tryne Dyrholm) carry
it off rather well. But the film has an incapacitating defect: three of the
supporting characters (Ida's husband Leif, Leif's mistress Thilde, and Philip's
ex sister-in-law Benedikte, played by Bier's favorite actress Paprika Steen) are
so broadly drawn and so melodramatically horrid that they don't belong in any
comedy that asks to be taken seriously. There are a few good scenes that almost
recall the director at her best: a conversation in which Philip momentarily
drops his guard and reveals his unresolved grief; another in which he tries to
make contact with this son while the Mediterranean waves lap at their feet; a
third in which mother and daughter talk about marriage. Redeeming moments these.
But for the most part Susanne Bier appears to be strait-jacketed by a plot for
which she has little empathy. The psychological complexity that should have
arisen from Ida's cancer and her breast surgery evaporates: a great opportunity
squandered, in my view.
