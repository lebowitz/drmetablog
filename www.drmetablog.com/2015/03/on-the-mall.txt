Title: On the Mall
Date: March 23, 2015

On the mall, smoking, wheels (i.e. bicycles and skateboards), and pets are
prohibited. Between forty and fifty signs and icons state the case very clearly.
Nevertheless, the rules are often flouted.

Smokers are furtive: they can't help themselves even though they show, by their
demeanor, that they are well aware that they're doing wrong. The bicyclists
are apologetic. Skateboarders are oblivious, totally. The dog-owners are
defiant. "No bureaucrat is going to tell me where I can walk my dog." The
beggars are entitled. This morning, one disheveled youth carried a sign that
read "Why lie?  I need to get fucked up." (I used occasionally to donate to
our "homeless" until I was taught that meals are readily available and that the
begged money goes to support alcohol and drug habits. Also I was taken aback
when a man to whom I gave two quarters returned them to me, saying, "I don't
take coins".)  Some of the buskers are fine musicians and earn their one or
five dollar bill but I think that there is something rather sad about their
forced cheer.

On the other hand, the strolling young folks, holding hands and radiantly in
love, are wonderful to behold, especially when there's a toddler or two trailing
them. And I also enjoy watching the strolling old folks, fifty or more years
into marriage, sometimes holding hands, sometimes wheelchairing it. Dyads of all
ages and kinds cheer and encourage me.
