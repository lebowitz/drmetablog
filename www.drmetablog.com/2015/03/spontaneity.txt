Title: Spontaneity
Date: March 03, 2015

A close relative has accused me of lacking spontaneity. Specifically, "I doubt
he ever did a spontaneous thing in his entire life."

I've been mulling over this attack and I can think of at least three spontaneous
actions that I have performed.  A) Frequently, in the middle of the afternoon,
without forethought or planning, I take a nap.  B) And closely related,
but certainly different, sometimes, waking up in the morning, I decide,
spontaneously, to lie in bed for another hour or so. And C), just yesterday,
when I trundled over to the Public Library to borrow the book on ancient
dead languages that I had reserved, I spontaneously pulled a second book (on
Neanderthals) off the shelf.

Now if those aren't plain and distinct instances of spontaneity I don't know
what.

Moreover, I am making a long list of spontaneous actions to perform in the near
future.
