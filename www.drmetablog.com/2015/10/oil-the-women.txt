Title: "Oil the Women"
Date: October 21, 2015

A friend recalls seeing a film, many years ago (1950s or 60s), in which a
character speaks the wonderful line, "0il the women." My friend cannot remember
the name of the movie or much about it, except that it was a desert "sword
and sandal" job in which a sheik or pasha or emir or something else very
"Orientalist," preparing for a lubricious but acceptable-to-the-League-of-
Decency orgy, utters the fabulous phrase.

I can't identify the film and the words don't google. Does anyone out there
in blaguelandia know where such an inspired bit of dialogue occurred. Who
said it?  And more importantly, what genius wrote it?

In the absence of real information, I'm free to create my own scenario. It's
got to be a 1950s film in now-faded Technicolor, and really cheesy. It's not a
real desert but a sound stage with minimal sand and and a few plastic rocks. The
inferior lighting allows you to see shadows on the stained backcloth that passes
for a vista. The costumes are off the rack and every once in a while there's a
visible zipper. A microphone appears briefly and intermittently at the top of
the screen. The part of the sheik is played not by Steve Cochran but by one of
his less-accomplished imitators. The dialogue is in pseudo-archaic phony-middle-
Eastern-accented English.

News comes of a victory in battle and the bejeweled and beturbaned emir, whose
heavy eyebrows dance above his too-heavily-kohled eyes, turns to his muscular
bodyguards and shouts, "bring out the food, bring out the drink, oil the women."

Anyway, that's the way I imagine it. But it's also possible that the line comes
from a parody of such a film. Could it be tucked away somewhere in a Marx
brothers movie? Or somewhere in one of Mel Brooks' historical skits. It's Monte
Pythonish but alas before their time.

Please help, friends of Vivian de St. Vrain. Who oiled what women?
