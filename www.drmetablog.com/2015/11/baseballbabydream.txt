Title: Another Amusing Dream
Date: November 27, 2015

I hit a ball sharply to right field into the cosmos and made it safely to
second base. (By "cosmos" I do not mean that I hit the ball into the universal
void, but rather into a patch of cosmos i.e. cosmos bipinnatus, the common
herbaceous perennial that was growingly thickly against the stadium wall,
something like the ivy at Wrigley.) I was standing on second, enjoying the
applause of 80,000 spectators at the old Yankee Stadium, when my daughter-in-law
suddenly appeared with her two-year-old toddler in tow and handed him to me,
saying, "you're in charge." She disappeared, so there I was on second holding
the boy by the hand. I told him to stay put, but on the next pitch he broke for
third, running as fast as his little legs could carry him. I called out to the
shortstop, "Now you're in charge."  At which point I cannot recall anything
further, except that I tried to follow the boy to third but I could hardly run
and it felt as though I was running through mucilage.

A curious dream. Dream professionals and analysts will no doubt be attracted by
the claim to significance embodied in the word "cosmos" and by the dreamer's --
that is to say my -- transparent urge to shirk responsibility.
