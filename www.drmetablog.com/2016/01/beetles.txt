Title: Beetles
Date: January 12, 2016

Evolution was inordinately fond of beetles. According to the
coleopterists, there are some 400,000 species, with many more still to be
identified. Beetles are everywhere. Every time I introduce a new plant into my
garden, along comes a species of beetle new to me.

Nevertheless, I must admit, to my shame and embarrassment, that I can call
only a handful of beetles by name. Is it failure of curiosity, failure to pay
attention, failure of memory?  As Holmes might have said, I see but I do not
observe.

Here are the few I can identify. The pestiferous, omnivorous Japanese beetle, a
pest every year and occasionally a veritable plague. The Colorado potato beetle,
voracious on potatoes and annoying on eggplants. The extremely stupid box elder
but, which comes into the house every fall to die and desiccate. Ladybugs,
supposedly eaters of aphids. Lightning bugs, beautiful in the night, helpless by
day.The heavy bomber among beetles, the June bug. The rose chafer, early spring
consumer and disfigurer of anything white, especially the white flowers of
peonies. A variety of oil beetle that  hangs out a couple of inches below the
surface in good garden soil -- what does it do there?

That's about it;  all the rest are unidentified and unidentifiable shard-born
beetles. OK, off to the library I go to bring home some beetlebooks. This
ignorance cannot stand.
