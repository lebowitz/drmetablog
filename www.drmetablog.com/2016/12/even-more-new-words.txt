Title: Even More New Words
Date: December 08, 2016

Carinate, which sounds vaguely dental, actually describes the shape of a
particular kind of ceramic or metal vessel. An object which has a rounded base
and inward sloping sides is "carinated." Hypogea, which is drawn directly from
Greek under (hypo) and earth (gaia) means, obviously, underground, but in
the world of archaeology generally refers to an underground temple or tomb.
Catacombs and crypts, therefore, are both hypogea. A megaron was the great
hall of a Grecian palace but archaeologists use the word to describe the large
entrance room of any substantial structure. An exedra is a semicircular recess
set into a building's facade. It think of it, perhaps incorrectly, as a half
of a rotunda. A plinth is the base or platform on which a column or statue
rests. Ashlar is finely dressed stones, generally in the shape of a cube or
a rectangular solid. Ashlar construction is therefore different from rubble
masonry, in which walls are made of irregularly shaped or found stones. A
tophet is a burial place for children either sacrificed or dead of natural
causes; it's a word of Hebrew origin and recalls the valley near Jerusalem n
which ancient Canaanites sacrificed children to Moloch or Baal. I'm embarrassed
that I apparently never encountered the word annona, which characterizes the
grain supply of the city of Rome in ancient times.  Annona, the common noun,
is also personified or deified as "a theophany of the emperor's power to care
for his people through the provision of staples." Annona, the goddess, is
sometimes assimilated to her compatriot Ceres. Acephalous means headless, and
describes "clerics not under a bishop" or lines of verse missing a first foot.
In archaeology, it's a decapitated statue. A cist is simply a stone-lined
grave or shaft.

These splendid words are drawn from Shepherds, Sailors & Conquerors,
Archaeology and History in Sardinia from the Stone Age to the Middle Ages by
Stephen Dyson and Robert Rowland, 2007, which I read with great care,
enjoying especially the middle chapters on Sardinia's fascinating nuraghagic
civilizations.
