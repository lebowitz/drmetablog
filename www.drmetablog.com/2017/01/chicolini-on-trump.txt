Title: Chicolini on Trump
Date: January 23, 2017

Our new president has an extraordinary ability to believe what he wants to
believe, no matter the fact. He mocks a disabled reporter, we all see it with
our own eyes, and yet he denies that he did so. He claims that his inauguration
was the best attended in history, and then we look at the pictures, and see
with our own eyes, not so. It is hard to know exactly how to interpret such
effrontery, such a remarkable disregard of facts.

I fear that he is actually pulling the wool over his own eyes. He's certainly
not pulling it over ours.

He is marooned in an absurd farcical world. He is drowning in duck soup.

Mrs. Teasdale:  Your Excellency! I thought you'd left.

Cihicolini: Oh, no, I no leave.

Mrs. Teasdale:  But I saw you with my own eyes!

Chicolini:  Well, who you gonna believe? Me or your own eyes?

Unfortunately, what in fiction is farce becomes tragedy in real
life. Nonsense, assimilated as truth in the mind of a person in power, cannot
be anything but incendiary.
