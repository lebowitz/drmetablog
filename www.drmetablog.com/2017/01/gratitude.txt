Title: Sciascian Geography
Date: January 28, 2017

Years ago, I read, in translation of course, a few of Leonardo Sciascia's
Sicilian mysteries. Excellent books: The Day of the Owl (Il giorno della
civetta -- 1961)), Equal Danger (Uguale pericolo --1973), The Challenge (Il
contesto-- 1971). Last week I tried to read one of Sciascia's short stories
in its native Italian. A good idea, but quite a struggle. Too taxing for my
present fluency. Sciascia's vocabulary is enormous, mine is puny. Not to mention
Sicilian expressions that would be stumpers and require footnoting even for
mainland Italians.

The story I tackled is Il lungo viaggio, (The Long Voyage). Some impoverished
Sicilian peasants pay a man whom we would call a coyote to smuggle them into
America; he takes their entire savings, takes them on board his ship, and then
after ten excruciating days sets them right back down in Sicily. A sad tale of
exploitation, not, alas, irrelevant today.

Sciascian geography: the Sicilians think they are headed for the middle Atlantic
coast of North America, where they will find Nugioirsi, Nuovaiorche, and my very
favorite, Brucchilin.
