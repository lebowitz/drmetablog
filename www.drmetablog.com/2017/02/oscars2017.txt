Title: What I Wore to the Oscars (2017)
Date: February 27, 2017

My ensemble: plaid wool shirt by Woolrich; trousers by Lee (regular cut --
"smoky quartz" color); socks by Costco; shoes by New Balance (with orthopedic
inserts by Dr. Scholl); leather belt by Target; foundational undergarments by
Fruit of the Loom. Accessories: eyeglasses by Flexon; hearing aids by Phonak.
Hair by Joe.

I'd like to thank all the little people -- my fashion consultants, suppliers,
and supporters -- for their imagination and hard work. I couldn't have done it
without the entire team.
