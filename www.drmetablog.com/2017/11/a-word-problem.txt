Title: A "Word Problem"
Date: November 04, 2017

If one 4 1/2 year old grandson can launch five foot stream of urine from where
he stands to the base of a tree, how many 80-year-old grandfathers would it take
to equal the performance?

Some answers:  a) 20 (tag team line of grampas each contributing 4").  b) does
it count if I hurl my Depends?  c) I know the answer but I forgot.
