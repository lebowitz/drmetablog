Title: "Wyoming"
Date: January 17, 2018

I am totally in love with a bit of dialogue in Dog Day Afternoon (1975), the
great Sidney Lumet social drama/comedy/crime film.

Sonny's plan to finance his wife Leon 's sex change operation by robbing a bank
has run aground. In exchange for freeing his hostages, Sonny wants a plane
to take him to a foreign country. He asks his not-so-brilliant friend/co-
conspirator Sal to what country he would want to travel. Sal cogitates for a
while, then suggests, "Wyoming." Â After a pause, Sonny replies, "Sal, Wyoming's
not a country." The exchange (by John Cazale as Sal and Al Pacino as Sonny) is
delivered magnificently -- Cazale with blank-faced understated sincerity, Pacino
with tempered exasperation.

"Wyoming" was not in the script (nor in the essay from which the script was
drawn) but was improvised by Cazale. A moment of pure genius.

If you haven't seen the film, run -- not walk -- to your nearest TV.
