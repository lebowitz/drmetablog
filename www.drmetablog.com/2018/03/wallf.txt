Title: Corporations to Buy "Naming Rights" to Trump Wall
Date: March 16, 2018

The White House announced today that "naming rights" to stretches of the Trump
Wall across the southern U. S. border are up for sale.

Portions have been pre-sold. Among the corporations that will have their names
in neon on the wall are Chick-Fil-A and Hobby Lobby. The largest single stretch
has been claimed by Koch Industries, Inc. Together with its subsidiaries
Invista, Georgia-Pacific, Molex, Flint Hills Resources, Koch Pipeline, Koch
Fertilizer, Koch Minerals, Matador Cattle, and Guardian Industries, Koch will
place signs on almost six hundred miles of wall. It is rumored that the National
Rifle Association has contracted to name a large portion of the Texas barrier.

The White House did not say how much the corporations paid for the naming
rights.  Charles Koch, in a rare interview, asserted that the cost was "a good
buy.  But it's not about money," he added, "it's about patriotism."

Trump Industries has also claimed a few choices miles of the wall but has yet to
make a payment.
