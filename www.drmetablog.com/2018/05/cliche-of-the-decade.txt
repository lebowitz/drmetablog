Title: Cliche of the Decade
Date: May 02, 2018

There's this woman of a certain age, good looking, usually blonde. Generally,
she's a detective but she could be reporter or a spy -- some sort of
investigator. She has an instinct for her work, an unusual insight or gift.
There's a murderer or villain out there and she's determined to get him; it's
personal with her and often she has to violate procedures in order to bring
this character to justice. She regularly confronts her superior, an older man
who is a stickler for the rules and wants to shut down the investigation.
As a last resort, she'll ask for 24 hours, or more rarely 48 hours, to
bring the villain in. And guess what -- it turns out that her instinct was
right all along and after a brief struggle, in which her life is in danger
(often there's an attempted assassination, usually by speeding vehicle), the
criminal/mastermind/murderer is handcuffed (British version) or shot (American
version).
