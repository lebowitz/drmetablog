is 18 degrees. With men on base, he's hitting .285. With runners in scoring
position, .290; his launch angle to right field against right-handed split
finger fastballs in the lower left quadrant rises to 25 degrees, but only on
his first at bat in a game. Afterwards, it declines to 17 degrees. But that's
in April and May, on weekends. In August and September, under the lights, his
launch angle is 20 degrees against change-ups from right-handers who throw into
the upper right quadrant when there's a man on second or third and fewer than
two outs. There's ball four.

Here comes the manager out to the mound. That's all for this pitcher. We'll be
back in a moment.
