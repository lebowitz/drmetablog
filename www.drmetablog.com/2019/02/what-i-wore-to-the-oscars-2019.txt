Title: What I Wore to the Oscars (2019)
Date: February 26, 2019

Actually, I didn't go TO the awards ceremony. This is what I wore to watch the
Oscars on TV. Well, that's not entirely true either. I forgot to watch the
Oscars. But I did wear the outfit.

My ensemble: plaid wool shirt by Woolrich; trousers by Lee (regular cut --
"smoky quartz" color); white cotton "Gold Toe" socks by Costco; shoes by Hoka
(with orthopedic inserts by Dr. Scholl); genuine leather belt by SlideBelts;
foundational undergarments by Fruit of the Loom and Carhartt; denim jacket by
American Apparel. Accessories: eyeglasses by Kirkland Signature; hearing aids by
Phonak. Traditional baseball cap by Otto ("one size fits most").

Hair by Joe.

Once again, I'd like to thank all the little people -- my fashion consultants,
suppliers, and supporters -- for their imagination and hard work. I couldn't
have done it without the entire team.
