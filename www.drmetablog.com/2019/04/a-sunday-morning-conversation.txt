He:  "These allergies are getting me down.  Every morning I seem to wake up
with a liter of mucus in my nose. There's so much I should probably save it and
put in the garden. It would be good for the soil."

She:  "Yes, we could save it one of those nice plastic jars that the Talenti
ice cream comes in."

He:  "It might be a problem on the plane. 'What's that in the jar, sir.'
 "It's a pint of my snot. I'm taking it to Vermont to put in the garden.'  '
Er, do you want to step over here, sir.'

She:  "Perhaps we should re-think this."

He:  "It's a good thing that we know each other pretty well. If I had said to
you, five years ago when we first met, 'Hi, my name is...  I'm thinking of
saving my snot and taking it to Vermont,' it would have ended the relationship
right there."

She:  "Yes, you were very wise to have waited five years to mention it. Very
tactful."
