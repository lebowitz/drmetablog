"Little Jimmy hurt his arm.

He said to his mother, my arm hurts. His mother said, let us pray over it. So
they prayed.

But it still hurt.

So his mother took him to the wise women at the end of the street. She
prescribed CBD oil. Jimmy's mother rubbed CBD oil on his arm.

But it still hurt.

So his mother took him to a psychotherapist. He gave Jimmy some anti-anxiety
pills. Jimmy took them.

But his arm still hurt.

So his mother took him to a reflexologist, then to a Kirlian analyst, then to an
aromatherapist. Jimmy did what they advised.

But his arm still hurt.

Then Jimmy said, 'why don't we go to a doctor.'

So they went to a doctor. And the doctor said to Jimmy, "Your arm is broken."
 The doctor set the bone and put it in a cast.

Jimmy's arm stopped hurting.

And then the doctor said, "While you're here, why don't I give you a measles
shot?"  And he did.
