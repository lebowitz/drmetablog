Title: More on West Bradford in June, 1968
Date: October 02, 2019

The famished waif with the tousled hair is NGP; the naked one-year-old with the
swollen belly is Ben. There's a rain barrel -- why?  There's a gas-powered lawn
mower, so brand new that it still bears its sales tag.  There's some black
plastic pipe  and what might be a horseshoe on the floor. A couple of white
plastic containers. Miscellaneous wooden furniture. There are many cubic yards
of hay -- not baled, just loose.

The potter, oblivious to the chaos and hard at work, is Phyllis.

It's all happening just inside the big barn door -- an improvised pottery
studio.
