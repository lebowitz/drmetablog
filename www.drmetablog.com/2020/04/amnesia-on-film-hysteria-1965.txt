Title: Amnesia on Film:  Hysteria (1965)
Date: April 25, 2020

Another automobile accident and another hospitalized amnesiac. Once again, the poor guy might have committed a murder, but he's not sure. And once again, there's a loyal young woman (Gina McConnell, played by Jennifer Jayne) to help him reconstruct his past. As well as a beguiling dangerous femme fatale and a double-dealing psychiatrist. Knockout drops, hallucinations, an escape through a window, a clever detective, a disappearing corpse, multiple flashbacks. The usual stuff, another day at the noir office.

The gimmick this time: Chris Smith (Robert Webber) has recovered his memory but keeps up the pretense so he can solve the murder. Everyone is kept in the dark, including the befuddled audience. It's a tricky move and highly unpersuasive. The last line of the Wiki plot summary tells you all you need to know in the way of cliche: "Chris is reunited with Gina."
