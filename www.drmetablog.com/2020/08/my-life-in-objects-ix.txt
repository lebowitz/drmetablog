Title: My Life in Objects -- IX (Shovel)
Date: August 17, 2020

It's called a transplant shovel, and it's manufactured by Sneeboer, a company
located in Holland. If you want to buy a garden tool from Sneeboer, you get on
the virtual line, and then wait until your number comes up. Worth waiting.

I have a weakness for well-made garden tools. This one might be the best I own,
my favorite, although the Felco #2 hand pruner is also a work of art.

Note the construction. The V-shaped blade is one piece of solid steel. It's not
screwed or bolted to the ash shaft, but rivetted, twice. The "D-handle" itself
is carved out of a single solid piece of hardwood, so it can't fall apart.

I use the shovel to dig plants from crowded areas of the perennial garden
to transplant or to separate. It's also ideal for poaching ferns from the
forest. The shovel is the only tool that lets you easily divide a woody clump of
Siberian irises (or any other clumping perennial). With a standard spade, when
you try to get a little purchase, you fall to left or right or to the ground,
endangering your cranky old vertebrae. It's a superbly balanced tool, a pleasure
to use. It's going to be around for many more years.

We call it the "magic shovel."
