Title: My Life in Objects -- III (Rug)
Date: August 11, 2020

Althea bought this rug at an auction in Warren, New Hampshire in 1968 -- and it
is the first rug we ever owned -- the first of many. I was startled when she
bid on it because we were in the market for crockery and glasses and chairs,
not for decorative objects, but she saw and appreciated its beauty. It's a rug
for a wall because it's too old and fragile to be tread upon by the shod. Rug
expert MP says that it's from the Caucasus -- specifically it's a Konaghend
Kuba -- from the late nineteenth century. Of course we didn't have the faintest
idea of its provenance but we knew that it was very appealing. In fact, I
was so inattentive that I owned and admired the rug for forty years before I
noticed that it was a prayer rug -- the mihrab is not much pronounced. Nor did I
appreciate the abrash; the indigo blue ground disappears two thirds of the way
down. It's probable that the woman who wove it ran out of wool from a particular
dye lot, but it's also possible that the weaver was nomadic.

When Althea lived in Washington for a year in the 1990s, she took this rug with
her -- the only personal possession (aside from clothes, of course) that she
brought. And then many years later when she entered the Alzheimer's institution,
I hung it on the wall facing her bed. I thought it would be a comfort to her --
but alas she did not remember or recognize it. When she died IÂ  brought it back
home where it belongs.
