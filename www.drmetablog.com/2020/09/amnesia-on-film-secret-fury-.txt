Title: Amnesia on Film: The Secret Fury (1950)

There are amnesia movies and there are gaslighting movies. The Secret Fury is
both, and, I'm sorry to say, it fails to hit two separate marks.

A bad bad lawyer and cadre of hired subordinates contrive to gaslight rich Ellen
Ewing (Claudette Colbert) into believing that, while amnesiac, she killed a
man. In any recognizable universe it would be impossible or at least extremely
difficult to persuade a sensible, mature woman that she suffers from a loss of
memory. Not in NoirThrillerMysteryLand, where amnesia is just about as ordinary
as a case of summer sniffles. So Ellen takes the amnesia bait and gets herself
consigned to a mental hospital until her boyfriend David McLean (Robert Ryan),
who is not the swiftest, finally figures out what's going on, and after a
frantic fistfight, rescues and vindicates his lady.

I myself was thoroughly confused by the multitude of loose ends in the plot. Who
was it who strangled the hotel maid, played by Ethel Mertz aka Vivian Vance? And
why?

Bosley Crowther of The New York Times, who hardly liked anything at all, was
more-than-usually outraged by this film. He called it "wantonly unintelligible"
and "cheap and lurid trash." I rarely agree with BC, but in this case he he went
easy on The Secret Fury. I was equally infuriated -- The Secret Fury is a film
without a shred of integrity. But what's to be expected when a phony case of
false induced amnesia is at the heart of the matter?

I feel for Philip Ober, who put his heart into playing the villain and was
forced to mouth with a straight face some of the most ludicrous dialogue ever
composed. I feel also for Jane Cowl, a graduate of Erasmus Hall High School,
who played bland Aunt Clara. Jane Cowl had a long career and appeared in many
respectable films. This one is an embarrassment.

So is the crowded, unartistic poster.
