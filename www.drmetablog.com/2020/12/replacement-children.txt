Title: Replacement Children
Date: December 07, 2020

Friends, relatives, and stray internet pilgrims know that Dr. Metablog, aka Vivian de St. Vrain, etc. is a "replacement child" and has written about it in the blogpost Susan P. and also in brief remarks on Louis Aggasiz, Edward Gibbon, Thornton Wilder, and a guy from the old neighborhood.

Now, I'm happy to say, there's a new website devoted to the study of Replacement Children. You can access it here, and learn about Mark Twain, Frida Kahlo, Vincent van Gogh, Elvis Presley, and other famous and not-so-famous "replacements." It's worth a visit.
