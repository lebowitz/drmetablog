Title: State of My Mind -- End of 2020
Date: December 23, 2020

It's been a rough year what with the madman president and the covid pandemic. And also deaths and diseases among my close friends. I have at least ten male friends who've lost their wives after long marriages. Some have bounced back, some will never get over the grief. At the beginning of 2020, I made a joke:Â  "it's going to be the year of the ophthalmologist." It turned out to be the year of the thanatologist.

Nevertheless, I can honestly say that my dominant mood is one of gratitude.

Grateful that I've lived a long life, mostly healthily, and that my children and grandchildren are thriving. I'm not rich, but I've never missed a meal for want of cash.

When my father was my age, he was crippled with arthritis and he was widowed, living a sad solitary life. I take long walks in the mountains and have a new love in my life.

As of today, 1.1 million Americans have been vaccinated against the virus. There will be errors and disruptions and scandals, but in a few months we'll be mostly back to normal. And I believe and hope that our wonderful country will survive this accidental lunatic presidency.
