Title: HMT? (How Many Today?)
Date: January 07, 2021

For two days, I kept track of the initials that I needed to know to make sense
of the world. Here they are, all familiar, no doubt: HOA,, MRI, IED, CNN, EPA,
FDA, DNA, OMB, ED, NBA, COVID, GPS, AWOL, PTSD, TCM, WTF, BPL, TIA, ETA, MST.
Just two days. IK that there's a part of the brain that stores nouns; I wonder
if humans will evolve to develop an area to store acronyms.
