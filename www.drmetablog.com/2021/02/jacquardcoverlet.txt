Title: My Life in Objects XIX -- Jacquard Coverlets
Date: February 14, 2021

A coverlet is not a small cover. The "let" is not a diminutive -- it's let as in
copire lectum (L) or "cuivre lit" (Fr).Â  A bedcover. Neither a blanket nor a
bedspread, but both -- a decorative but warm item of bedclothes.

"Jacquard" refers to the Jacquard attachment, which was a series of punchcards
(the ancestor of the IBM cards) that controlled the weaving and allowed a
skilled workman to produce complicated patterns relatively inexpensively.
Jacquard coverlets were produced in large quantities (about 700 craftsmen are
known) in villages and small towns in the US between about 1820 and the coming
of the Civil War. Weavers were mostly immigrants from the old country whose
skills had already been rendered obsolete by factory-based manufacture. Weaving
was a cottage industry -- many weavers wove in the winter, farmed in the summer.

This coverlet was woven by Benjamin Hausman of Allentown, Pennsylvania, in 1842
-- it says so in the "corner block." It's in amazingly good shape for a weaving
that's 180 years old. The colors, especially the madder red and indigo blue
wool, are still vivid. The coverlet is impressive and beautiful and keeps us
mighty toasty at night.
