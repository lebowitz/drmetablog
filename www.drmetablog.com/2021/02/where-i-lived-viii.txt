Title: Where I Lived --VIII
Date: February 13, 2021



From August 1976 to summer 1977, we lived at this odd, modernistic house at 1 Leycroft Close in Canterbury, Kent. The small tree, something in the prunus line, wasn't there at the time so the house was more visible. The house wasn't suitable for a family of five, but we made it work, barely. Two blocks away was St. Stephen Protomartyr School, which the kids attended for a year. The boys learned to play soccer and the daughter learned how to speak with an English accent, which she forsook after two weeks back in the USA. The abandoned railroad embankment behind the house, loaded with blackberries and wild plums, afforded the kids much amusement.
