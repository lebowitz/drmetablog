Title: The Many Uses of "Pandiculation"
Date: March 20, 2021

I've just learned a new word that and I'm trying to figure out how to work it
into the conversation. Some sample usages:

"Have you pandiculated today? How often?"

"I'm not pleased when you pandiculate at the dinner table."

"There were a bunch of kids at the museum today, and half of them were
pandiculating."

"I thought that the way he pandiculated was ostentatious and rude."

"Pandiculation can be very pleasurable, especially early in the morning."

"I wasn't aware that many kinds of mammals pandiculate. You'd never see a
reptile or a bird do it."

"Not only did he pandiculate during the concert, but he did it noisily."

"I think that people should at least cover their mouths when they pandiculate."
