Title: Genuine, Unedited, Unimproved Excerpt from a Conversation with my Brother
Date: June 27, 2021

He:  Did you know that they are now playing seven-inning games?

Me:  Yeah, double-headers.  And that they're starting a runner on second base
in extra inning games?

He:  Good thing Dad didn't know about this. It would have killed him on the
spot.

Me: Yeah, sure would have. DH rule took a couple of years off his life.
