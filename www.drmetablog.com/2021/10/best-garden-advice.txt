Title: Best Garden Advice
Date: October 01, 2021

I read a story in an "art of gardening" book many years ago that I will repeat
here. A famous Japanese gardener, a "national treasure," was asked, "What's the
secret of making a garden as beautiful as yours?" He didn't answer in words but
lifted his arms and made a shearing or lopping motion.

Many years ago, I asked Roy Huse, who had a most wonderful vegetable garden at
the foot of South Road how he did it.Â  He said, and I quote verbatim, "you
really got to put the shit to it."

And from my father: "it's all about preparing the bed before you plant."

So, don't skimp on getting the bed ready, add plenty of manure, and be ruthless
about cutting things out.

And o yes, you'll need sun and water.
