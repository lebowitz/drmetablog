Title: What's On My Mind
Date: October 23, 2021

Disease, dying and death, I'm afraid. During the last month or so, the cohort of
friends with whom I've gone through life has been suffering major losses. BD, a
friend of more than forty years standing, has just breathed his last. AM, whom I
know from the PS 217 schoolyard, is suffering from cancer of the esophagus, now
described as terminal. M has ALS and can no longer move or speak. LW suffered
a bad stroke some while ago and is now in "assisted living." JP has gone from
robust to frail in a few months and has been moved to a "memory care" unit. And
others.

I've taken to reading the obits. Every week the name of a former colleague or a
friend of a friend shows up. Inevitable, you say. But distressing nevertheless.

I'm healthy, but I'm old, long past my expiration date. I know that one of these
days it will be my turn with the doctors and the hospitals. Too bad, because
after some difficult years, I'm enjoying life to the full once again.

My grandmother, then in her upper 80s, said to youthful me, "I don't like being
old. But what are my choices?"
