Title: Brooklyn Novel??

Re: Jenny Offill, Department of Speculation (2014). "Shimmering." "Breathtaking."  "Radiant, sparkling with sunlight and sorrow." "Powerful." "Glitters with different emotional colors."  "Each line a dazzling perfectly chiseled arrowhead aimed at your heart."

That's what they say. How about "undisciplined," "faux-poetic," "self-indulgent", "unreadable." Which is what I say.

Whatever happened to my gritty Brooklyn?  When did it become so absurdly soft?  During gentrification, when the corner candy store turned into chi-chi fern bar?

It appears that Offill is from North Carolina and lived in Brooklyn for "a while." Not long enough to make an impact.

The "chiseled arrowheads" may have been aimed for my heart, but they missed their target by at least a sewer and a half.
