Title: A Brooklyn Memoir
Date: April 23, 2022

I read Imagining Robert, My Brother, Madness, and Survival by Jay Neugeboren for
neighborhood and neighborly reasons. Its author is a 1955 graduate of fabled
Erasmus Hall High School (I was class of 1956). Much of the story takes place
in the area of Brooklyn now called Lefferts Gardens. Walkable, or at least
bicyclable, from East 9 Street.

It's a sad tale. Younger brother Robert went seriously off the psychological
rails in his late teen years. Older brother Jay relentlessly chronicles his
brother's lifetime of struggles. It becomes clear that modern medicine does not
offer any remedy or hope to people with Robert's illnesses. The system relies
onÂ  ineffective drugs and ineffective therapies and what amounts to involuntary
imprisonment. It's a painful, discouraging history.

And it's also a good and moving book. Very sincere and very emotional. I confess
to dropping an occasional tear.

And yet I don't know whether it's right to expose a loved one to such public
scrutiny. I myself wouldn't have made that choice. But I empathize with
Neugeboren's tale, inasmuch as I know from personal experience that therapies
for some forms of mental decay are no better now than they were during the
Darkest Ages.
