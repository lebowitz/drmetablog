Title: Books I Read, 2022
Date: December 30, 2022

This year's list is incomplete. During the Vermont summer, I neglected to keep
good records. My porous brain can't bring to mind all I read in June, July,
August, and September. In addition, it's a list of books only, so no periodicals
(New Yorker, New York Review of Books), Northern Forests) or newspapers.
