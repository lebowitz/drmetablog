Title: Awkward Question
Date: September 27, 2023

I was at the old-age home (sorry, "retirement community") last week -- a place
that gives me the creeps even though many of my friends and former colleagues
seem to live there happily. (I'm on the waiting list but I hope that I'll never
be constrained to move in.)  I was there to share lunch with a 90-year-old
friend. At the next table over (in the rather luxurious dining room) was a woman
whom I knew slightly fifty years ago -- as a neighbor and as the mother of a
Flatirons Elementary School tudent. She's 89, a widow, and still healthy, still
attractive.

She (let's call her Ms. GK) initiated the conversation with this question. "Is
your wife still alive?"

It wasn't the inquiry itself that took me aback. It was the casual way in which
it was asked, with no more emotional resonance than, say, "do you want raisins
in your cereal?" or, "is it raining outside?"

Which made me realize that Ms. GK --  and all her fellow denizens of the
facility -- live in a world of "sole-survivors" where the deaths of spouses
"were as plentie as Blackberries." Therefore, there is nothing noteworthy
or remarkable for her to inquire about the status of a long time companion,
especially when more than half of husbands and wives have already kicked the old
bucket.

Nevertheless, the lack of emotion, the cold bloodedness, the absence of
euphemism, of Ms. GK's question produced in me a "take stock" moment. Whether we
are in or out of the institution, we are in the same ninth-decade world.

But I do hope that I myself do not become quite so matter-of-fact about the
death of friends and family.
