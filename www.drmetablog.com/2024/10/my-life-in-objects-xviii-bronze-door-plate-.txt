Title: My Life in Objects XIX: Bronze Door Plate
Date: October 09, 2024

It's my newest acquisition, purchased on ebay just a couple of days ago, but
already a favorite. It's a bronze door plate, very beautiful and heavy in the
hand. It's inscribed PULL. It bears no manufacturers or identifying marks but
the style is mighty pure Victorian. I imagine it came from a demolished once-
elegant downtown department store. What the heck do I plan to do with it?Â  Why,
it will be attached, next summer, to the old iron gate that we mounted at the
entrance to the "waterfall garden." It's whimsical, of course, because while
the gate helps to define the space, it guards absolutely nothing and is easily
circumvented.

If PUSH had been available I would have purchased it too. But PULL is
sufficient. A plate saying NO SOLICITORS has also been proposed -- but that
addition might be just a little bit of overkill (and silliness).
