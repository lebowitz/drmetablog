Title: Words of My Life -- Outing
Date: October 09, 2024

During my lifetime, the word "outing" has mutated beyond recognition. It first
entered my youthful vocabulary (as did so many other words) through the medium
of baseball. An "outing" -- in the old days --meant to me only a stint on the
mound. "Podres has had a good "outing" today." The more general meaning of
"outing" as a short trip taken for pleasure, such as a picnic, or a jaunt in
the country, only came into my  life many years later. "They enjoyed a family
outing to Montauk." The fact of the matter is that my family of origin didn't go
on "outings," but at some point I must have heard I heard about such journeyings
from friends or read about them in novels.

These days, I rarely encounter the baseball or picknicky meanings of "outing."
"Outing" has transformed into the obnoxious word that describes the odious and
hostile practice of exposing the sexual identity of a person against his/her
will.  From picnic to nasty, alas.

Frankly, I prefer the traditional significations and activities.
