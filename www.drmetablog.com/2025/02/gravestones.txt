Title: Gravestones
Date: February 08, 2025

I've never visited my parents' graves. I don't even know where they are buried.
I've been told that my father is buried between my mother and his sister Mollie,
but I don't know where they lie. I have a paper that tells me where my sister
Susan, who died as an infant, is buried, but I've never been there. I don't know
where my brother Eugene lies.

I know exactly where Althea and Phyllis are buried -- just up the hill, under
the big maple. I visit once a year and bring a stone to place on their markers.
Phyllis's is a bronze plaque affixed to a stone; Althea's is just the capital
letter A and her dates (1939-2016). It's what she wanted.

Dan Goss is buried in Staten Island somewhere. I visited once, with Althea. A's
mother, Grandma Anne, wanted her ashes divided in half and spread, part with
Phyllis and part with Dan.Â  She has no gravestone, nor wanted one.

I have told my family that I want my tombstone to read, "No more insomnia,
forever." But that's a joke.

Nowadays it's the custom to scatter the ashes on a favorite place, which is
nice, but there's no place to visit. Especially no place for those buried at
sea.
