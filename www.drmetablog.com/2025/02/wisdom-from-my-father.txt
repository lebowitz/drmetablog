Title: Wisdom from my Father
Date: February 13, 2025

When dealing with a child, always make your appeal to the better side of his/her nature.

No one owns anything; the most you can say is that you have a lifetime lease on it.

As far as I can tell, I am just a long link in a chain going from nowhere to nowhere.

If you lose your man, go directly to the basket.

Never omit an opportunity to do a favor for a friend, and never be embarrassed to accept a favor from a friend.  People like to help one another.

Anyone can make money if he makes it the sole business of his life to do so.

When the stock market is going up, everyone is  a genius.

The czars and the rabbis kept our family in darkness for a thousand years. It took hundreds of years for us to fight our way out of the ghetto, and they (the orthodox and the Hasids) want to put themselves back in it.

Don't forget to wash behind your ears.
