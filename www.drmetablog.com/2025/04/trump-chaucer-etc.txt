Title: Trump, Chaucer, etc.

Chaucer's Pardoner, some will remember, has long blonde hair and speaks in a high treble voice. Chaucer calls him "a gelding or a mare." A gelding is obviously a eunuch; what Chaucer means by mare is less clear -- perhaps "female eunuch" -- whatever that entails -- or a gay male or possibly even a woman cross-dressed as a man. In any case, a person of ambiguous sexuality -- "gender fluid" in modern idiom.

Update: the Naval Academy Nimitz library at Annapolis has purged from its shelves a book by Robert S. Sturges calledÂ  "Chaucer's Pardoner: Gender Theory." Isn't it reassuring that our national security will no longer be endangered by a discussion of the Pardoner's identity.
