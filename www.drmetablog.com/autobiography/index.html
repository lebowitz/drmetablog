		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>After struggling through a run of mysterious and puzzling works, I&#39;m cheered to discover a book written by Cornell English faculty member that I could read with pleasure from beginning to end. And understand. And which alerted me to books and poems with which I was not familiar. No theory, no pretentious jargon; just honest scholarship and intelligent stylish analysis,&#0160;</p>
<p>It&#39;s <em>Facing the Abyss, American Literature and Culture in the 1940s</em>, by George Hutchinson, who is Cornell&#39;s Farr Professor of American Culture.</p>
<p>Unlike Professor Hutchinson, who is a considerably younger man, I myself was alive (although barely sentient) during the 1940s. I was too young for serious reading, so 1940s culture didn&#39;t come to my aluminum desk until the 1950s when I belatedly came to awareness. As a result, I read many of the books that Hutchinson discusses a decade past their relevance. Hutchinson also mentions many influential books that I didn&#39;t read at all and therefore came as a surprise -- and which underlined my ignorance. For example, during the 1950s, my high school and college years, I read many books of 1940s Jewish American writers to whom Hutchinson devotes a long chapter: Mailer, Bellow, Malamud, Rukeyser, Arthur Miller, etc. But my acquaintance was incomplete. I confess that I had never heard the names of Jo Sinclair or Isaac Rosenthal, both of whom Hutchinson scrutinizes at full. One name missing from Hutchinson&#39;s survey is J D Salinger, who started to publish in the 40s but only became famous with <em>Cather in the Rye</em> in 1951. Just as well -- I never caught Salinger fever although many of my friends were quite infected.&#0160;</p>
<p>Hutchinson has presented me with a reading list of books that I should have known but didn&#39;t and that will keep me engaged for months. I&#39;m grateful.</p>
<p>Hutchinson&#39;s chapter on WWII is most revelatory. Without being unduly partisan, it exposes and corrects the &quot;greatest generation&quot; mythology that I had half come to accept.&#0160;</p>
<p>After reading <em>Facing the Abyss</em>, I continued my investigation of Cornell English faculty publications by taking a couple of wild swings at Elizabeth S. Anker&#39;s mystifying<em> On Paradox</em>, <em>the</em> <em>Claims of Theory </em>(Duke UP, 2022). (Anker holds a joint appointment in Cornell&#39;s law school and its Department of Literature in English.) I can say just two things for certain about this difficult book: a) I didn&#39;t understand two consecutive sentences, and b) it&#39;s not about literature, not even tangentially. In fact, I&#39;m not sure what it&#39;s about -- as far as I can tell, it&#39;s not about the law. I have rarely attempted anything in English prose that I found quite so impenetrable. I never even grasped what Anker means by paradox.</p>
<p>I&#39;m sure it&#39;s <em>mea maxima culpa</em>, but so be it.&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>[April 4] PGB writes: &quot;Every time you post something, it becomes ever clearer that you&#39;re not the right person for this investigation. Give it up and stick to something within your abilities, like basketball. You write well on basketball. Do yourself a favor: stay away from the deeper issues that Anker discusses.&quot;</p>
<p>[April 4]&#0160; Vivian de St. Vrain responds: &quot;Perhaps you&#39;re right, PGB (whoever you are). The shoemaker should stick to his last. This Anker book is not intended for me, but I I wonder for whom it is intended. It&#39;s got to be an extremely small specialized audience. Six or eight people, worldwide. I doubt anyone on Cornell&#39;s English faculty then or now could make heads or tails of it.&quot;</p>
<p>[April 6]&#0160; Artie Greengroin writes: &quot;Thanks for hanging in there.&#0160; I hope you find other Cornell English Professors who know how to write English. I&#39;m not optimistic, though. BTW, I think PGB is harshing on you, but I agree that your basketball essays are pretty good.&quot;</p>
<p>[April 8] Vivian de St. Vrain responds: &quot;Thanks for the recommendation, Artie and PGB. If anyone is interested, my basketball essays are <a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/basketball/">here.</a></p>
<p>[April 9]&#0160; Charles Evans (Mercer College) writes: &quot;I agree. Vivian, your notes on basketball are quite good. But you&#39;re just not smart enough to understand philosophy.&quot;</p>
<p>[April 10] Joe J. Keen (Northwest Nazarene University, Nampa, Idaho) writes: &quot;I agree with Charles Evans. The basketball entries are amusing. But, Vivian, you&#39;re no philosopher.&quot;</p>
<p>[April 16] Vivian de St. Vrain writes: The &quot;Artie Greengroin&quot; who posted on April 6 does not exist. Artie Greengroin is not a real person; he&#39;s a character invented by the WWII novelist Harry Brown. Come on, Artie you can use your real name. Don&#39;t be afraid. Don&#39;t hide behind a pseudonym. We&#39;re all friends here.&quot;</p>
<p>[April 30]. Chester Bacon writes: &quot;Thanks for bringing the Hutchinson book to my attention.&#0160; I&#39;ve read and been enlightened by it. But following your recommendation I&#39;ll stay away from the Anker book. And I do like your basketball essays.&quot;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Every once in a while, I experience something that I call a &quot;cultural convergence&quot; -- perhaps an event reported in a daily newspaper that closely resembles something on the very page of the novel that I happen to be reading. A cross-genre overlap, let us say.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s in example of such a coincidence that amused me much.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Yesterday evening I watched the classic western <em>The Magnificent Seven (1960) </em>and this morning I read, once again, Shakespeare&#39;s <em>Twelfth Night</em>. It&#39;s hard to believe but yes, there is a very brief moment where two such very distinct works brush against one another.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Unlike <em>TN,</em> The<em> Magnificent Seven </em>is a violent spectacle that steers clear of humor, or subtle characterization or extensive dialogue. After the climactic concluding battle to preserve the Mexican village has been both lost and won, the two surviving gunmen share a moment before trotting off on their separate ways. Chris Adams (Yul Brynner) inquires of Vin Tanner (Steve McQueen) if he has a plan for what comes next. Laconic Vin, cowpoke and gunslinger, responds, &quot;driftin&#39;.&#0160;</p>
<p>In <em>Twelfth Night</em>, there&#39;s a similar question and a similar answer, but in a far different idiom. Antonio asks Sebastian, who has survived a shipwreck, about his plans. Sebastian&#39;s view of his future is essentially the same as Vin&#39;s, but there is none of that &quot;ah shucks&quot; minimalism in his reply. Instead, Sebastian responds, &quot;My determinate voyage is mere extravagancy.&quot; &#0160;</p>
<p>[While Vin&#39;s one-word answer is clear as clear can be, Sebastian&#39;s &quot;mere extravagancy&quot; requires a bit of a gloss. Nowadays, &quot;extravagancy&quot; (usually &quot;extravagance&quot;) signifies a &quot;lack of restrain in purchasing luxury goods.&quot; Not so in 1600, when &quot;extravagant&quot; remained much closer to its root etymological inheritance. The word descends from L. <em>vagare, &quot;</em>to wander.&quot; Extra-vagance therefore means something like &quot;wander beyond.&quot; Here&#39;s a more familiar example of the word at work: when Roderigo characterizes Othello as an &quot;extravagant and wheeling stranger,&quot; he does not criticize Othello for spending too many ducats on his fancy get-up. He means that he&#39;s a rootless and wandering non-native. (Wheeling? my dictionary glosses wheeling as &quot;roving, wandering, <strong>drifting&quot;).</strong> And also: &quot;mere&quot; did not then connote triviality; its meaning is closer to &quot;pure.&quot; &quot;Determinate&quot; meant and still means &quot;decided.&quot;)</p>
<p>Therefore Sebastian&#39;s sentence --&quot;My determinate voyage is mere extravagancy&quot; -- is directly equivalent to&#0160; Vin&#39;s &quot;driftin&#39;&#39;&quot;. Cultural convergence at its best.</p>
<p>It&#39;s just two ways of talkin&#39;.&#0160;</p>
<p>I sometimes wonder about Shakespeare&#39;s intent here. Why did he bother to put such a difficult sentence in Sebastian&#39;s mouth? For purposes of characterization, certainly. But at the expense of clarity. Wouldn&#39;t it have been more economical, more transparent, for Sebastian to say something plain, such as &quot;I don&#39;t have a plan, I&#39;ll just wander.&quot; It&#39;s certain that some percentage of Shakespeare&#39;s audience, perhaps most, will not grasp the meaning&#0160; of the sentence as written and will be left puzzled. Yet as he so often does, Shakespeare preferred eloquence to transparency.&#0160;</p>
<p>In my opinion, Shakespeare delighted in his own fluency.&#0160; And sometimes I think that Shakespeare wasn&#39;t just writing to be heard by his Globe or Blackfriars audience. He was writing to be read and studied --&#0160; although I doubt he could have imagined a future in which his sentences would be glossed with crowded inches of small-type footnotes.</p>
<p>It it possible that Shakespeare also had an inkling that, as Beethoven once put it, he was writing for &quot;a latter age?&quot;</p>

                                <p>Can it possibly be true that the universe as we know it is becoming larger and larger? The more we learn, the more it seems to expand. The scientists who know about such things now brag that the Milky Way numbers between 200 and 300 billion stars, nearly all of which are probably circled by planets. Moreover, these same experts now claim that there are something like one or two trillion such configurations -- some of them small but most larger than our own personal galaxy. And to top all that, there&#39;s a rumor circulating that our universe might be just one of an untold, possibly infinite number of other universes. Some of them Big Banging, some expanding, some collapsing.</p>
<p>These numbers are staggering and incomprehensible, at least to me. I can&#39;t even get a hold of a million of anything, even grains of sand, let alone a billion (a thousand million!) enormous stars.</p>
<p>Now they tell me that our universe began 13.8 billion years ago, more or less, and will go on for a hundred billion more. That&#39;s another very large number for me (or you) to assimilate.&#0160;</p>
<p>It&#39;s all mighty perplexing. And then let me add the toughest question of all: why is there something rather than nothing? Yes, why is that? How come?</p>
<p>There are some who find this sort of information dismaying because it confirms the triviality, the meaninglessness of our individual lives. How can I possibly worry about last night&#39;s insomnia or my latest nosebleed -- or indeed my very own life -- in a world of a gazillion planets, stars, ultramassive black holes, neutron stars, galaxies, and a universe which may have no discernible boundary or beginning or ending.</p>
<p>Yet I myself find all this information not dismaying but comforting - maybe even inspiring.</p>
<p>What are the odds that a planet might support life? Very small. And that the planet&#39;s precarious lifeforms would evolve for a couple of billions of years and then generate intelligent life?&#0160; And that a million years of mating and surviving by various evolving primitive and then recognizable humans might lead to my ancestors -- and that after thousands of lucky matings eventually resolve into my parents Manny and Lil who happened upon the precise instant to beget Me. And that I, in the second half of my 80s, way past my shelf life, would still be here to enjoy these extra innings.</p>
<p>All this work of creation and evolution and luck to culminate in Me.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>It&#39;s a miracle of cosmic proportions and should be hosannahed. Here I am, enjoying my still functioning brain. My stomach is mellow after a full meal and my skin is glowing from a stroll in the warm sun. At the end of the day, I will crawl under the covers with my bedmate and ladylove. Truly the stars have aligned to my benefit.</p>
<p>Nor let us not underestimate&#0160; the consummate joy of mattress and blanket.</p>
<p>My assemblage of molecules has had a great run -- much more than could be reasonably anticipated.&#0160; Soon my molecules will disassemble and then reassemble into someone else. I&#39;m very glad to contribute to this phenomenon.&#0160;</p>
<p>But if so -- if we are so fortunate, as I believe us to be, why don&#39;t we as a people celebrate our good fortune? Take pleasure in our lives. What&#39;s the need for this continuing strife and wars and enslavements and genocides? What&#39;s the point of it? We&#39;re all sitting here, billions of us, for a second or so in an infinitely boundless and timeless universe. Why must half of us make life miserable for the other half? Why can&#39;t all we just get along?</p>
<p>Truly we are a horrid species.</p>
<p>I wonder whether other planets that support intelligent life have done any better. I hope so.</p>

                                <p>I first encountered the word &quot;text&quot; -- as did everyone else of my cohort -- as the first component of &quot;textbook.&quot; At P S 217, textbooks were issued on the first day of school. Then, later in the day, we ritually scissored brown paper grocery bags and improvised protective book covers. It was not unusual for the covers to be in better shape than the retirement-eligible books. At college, I was surprised to find that I was required to purchase my own textbooks -- a discovery that busted a hole in my precarious budget.&#0160;</p>
<p>And then the word &quot;text&quot; sat still for a number of years until it emerged as a term of art in critical theory. &quot;Text&quot; became a generic word for anything written: novels, poems, plays, signs, advertising slogans, tattoos -- anything that could be analyzed and discussed. I think, in retrospect, that the idea was not to &quot;privilege&quot; one form of writing over another. &quot;Text&quot; is to poem as &quot;provider&quot; is to doctor.</p>
<p>Nowadays, &quot;text&quot; has emerged from the gloom of academic criticism and has become the most frequently used of words. Who could have predicted it? I myself, formerly a writer of letters and postcards and until recently of emails, and for many years at one point a user of the telephone, now send and receive multiple &quot;texts&quot; in a day.</p>
<p>The noun has also acquired a variety of verb forms: &quot;I&#39;ll text you&quot;; &quot;I texted you&quot;;&#0160; &#0160;&quot;Text me when you arrive&quot;; &quot;Talk to you later.&#0160; I&#39;m texting.&quot;</p>
<p>All derived, ultimately, from L. <em>texere</em> textus, to weave; or textor, a weaver.</p>
<p>The use of &quot;text&quot; in religious ceremony, as in a cleric&#39;s, &quot;today&#39;s text is...&quot; has never been a part of my life.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Elisha Cohn is an associate professor in Cornell&#39;s Department of Literatures in English. Her <em>Still Life, Suspended Development in the</em> <em>Victorian Novel&#0160;</em>(2016) strikes me as two books in one. The first is quite lovely and filled with a variety of splendid <em>apercus.&#0160;</em>Cohn explores &quot;lyric moments&quot; in the novels (confession: I read closely only the chapter on Thomas Hardy, the novelist with whom I&#39;m most familiar). She observes that Hardy (a poet as well as a novelist) occasionally stops the progress of the story and allows his characters to experience a moment of stasis or reflection or reverie that is more a characteristic of lyric poetry than prose. I was much impressed by her analyses of these moments -- and wondered why I had failed to notice such events -- or non-events -- myself. So criticism did what it&#39;s supposed to do -- widens our understanding and appreciation of works of literature. I returned to the Victorian novel armed with a new way of seeing. In fact, I&#39;m now reading <em>Little Dorrit&#0160;</em>again for the express purpose of ascertaining whether a non-poet like Dickens employs the same S<em>till Life </em>method. So far, not the case -- Dickens has his own particular (and very successful) methods of expanding the consciousness of his characters.</p>
<p>Ah, but then there&#39;s the other side of Cohn&#39;s book which attempts to develop her useful insights within the slough of &quot;theory.&quot; I half suspect that Cohn felt obliged to make herself relevant or contemporary or tenure-worthy with her tumble into this quicksand -- but perhaps I&#39;m wrong. Perhaps she devoutly believes in an apparatus that I find so incomprehensible and transient. In this second part of the book, many famous names are invoked and admired; some of these are very French and very revered; others&#0160; are merely professors at American universities. Pages of text and footnotes defend against the horrid possibility that <em>Still Life</em> might be &quot;insufficiently theorized.&quot; And in these speculative paragraphs Cohn discusses the deprivilegization of hierarchical thought in favor of forms of lateralization in which individuations are impersonal and singularities are pre-individual and which reterritorialize along the lines of preexisting structures of power which re-consolidate into static concepts, etc., etc. Which is when I either descend into a reverie (or nightmare) of my own or hurl he book across the room.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>[February 23&#0160; Audrey ap Howell writes:&#0160; &quot;Vivian de St. Vrain, you&#39;ve go it wrong. The notion that there are poetic moments in the novels is well established. The originality of this book lies in its theorizing of these moments. You would know this if you had read carefully and not skimmed.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>[February 24] J C Occhiogrosso writes: &quot;This is a well-written book. Complicated but not obscure.&quot;</p>
<p>[February 25]&#0160; Reuben Musgrave writes:&#0160; &quot;I bet that Cohn is a delightful teacher -- if she keeps to the events in the novels and stays away from bewildering &#39;theory.&#39;&quot;</p>
<p>[February 25] Savannah Courtermanche writes:&#0160; &quot;All novelists pause the plot for moments of reflection. Nothing new here.&quot;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>[March 5]&#0160; Joy Jourgenson writes:&#0160; &quot;This difficult monograph would have been more useful as a series of short, insightful essays.&#0160; Too bad it had to be expanded into a repetitive static book. Not the author&#39;s fault -- just the tune of the times.&quot;</p>
<p>[March 6]&#0160; Eli Munn writes:&#0160; &quot;Vivian, you&#39;re too old and out of it to have an opinion worth anything. Shut it down and go back to your knitting.&quot;</p>
<p>[March 15] Rogers Roggen writes:&#0160; &quot;I wonder, Vivian, how you can work yourself up into such a snit about Cornell when the USA is going to hell in a handbasket. Shouldn&#39;t you put your effort into more pressing matters.&quot;</p>
<p>[March 18] Homer vanNess writes:&#0160; &quot;Reuben Musgrave, are you possibly the &quot;Cousin Rube&quot; that I heard my parents mention? I know there&#39;s a Musgrave branch to my family. (I found your name doing a random googlesearch). If you are Cousin Rube, could you pm me at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="5b332d3a35353e28281b3c363a323775383436">[email&#160;protected]</a>. I&#39;d love to hear from you. I think you went to Cornell; so did I but much later.&quot;</p>

                                <p>I&#39;ve never visited my parents&#39; graves. I don&#39;t even know where they are buried. I&#39;ve been told that my father is buried between my mother and his sister Mollie, but I don&#39;t know where they lie. I have a paper that tells me where my sister Susan, who died as an infant, is buried, but I&#39;ve never been there. I don&#39;t know where my brother Eugene lies.</p>
<p>I know exactly where Althea and Phyllis are buried -- just up the hill, under the big maple. I visit once a year and bring a stone to place on their markers. Phyllis&#39;s is a bronze plaque affixed to a stone; Althea&#39;s is just the capital letter A and her dates (1939-2016). It&#39;s what she wanted.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Dan Goss is buried in Staten Island somewhere. I visited once, with Althea. A&#39;s mother, Grandma Anne, wanted her ashes divided in half and spread, part with Phyllis and part with Dan.&#0160; She has no gravestone, nor wanted one.</p>
<p>I have told my family that I want my tombstone to read, &quot;No more insomnia, forever.&quot; But that&#39;s a joke.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Nowadays it&#39;s the custom to scatter the ashes on a favorite place, which is nice, but there&#39;s no place to visit. Especially no place for those buried at sea.</p>

                                <p>After a severe cold snap, it&#39;s a welcome warm Friday afternoon. We&#39;re on the semi-famous mall enjoying a long-postponed promenade. A woman, in her seventies, stops us. &quot;Can you help me?&quot; I&#39;m embarrassed to confess that my first reaction to her plea was that she must be one of our many panhandlers. But not so. She continued: &quot;It&#39;s my husband, he has Parkinson&#39;s, can you help me get him to the car?&quot; He, Bill, was standing frozen, unable to speak, unable to move, his balance precarious. &quot;Two years ago,&quot; she said,&quot;he was robust. He&#39;s having a bad day.&quot; And indeed he was. I took Bill&#39;s left arm under the shoulder, his wife the other arm. Lynn grasped my left hand and carried Bill&#39;s useless stick, and together we shuffled him infinitely slowly and gently to the curb. &quot;I thought we could go out for coffee,&quot; she said, &quot;but I was wrong.&quot; While we stood quietly, Bill&#39;s wife went to fetch their car which was parked only fifty feet away. She backed it to where we stood (Lynn now supporting Bill on his right side). We helped Bill into passenger seat. His wife buckled him in.</p>
<p>I asked her, &quot;do you have help?&#39;&#0160; &quot;Yes, she said, &quot;friends.&quot; &quot;Do you have children?&quot; &quot;Yes, but they don&#39;t live nearby.&quot; She thanked us generously and drove off.</p>
<p>I was sad for both him and her. He, because his dreadful disease is going to kill him very soon. And she, because her life now consists of morning-to-night care taking -- in bed, out of bed; dressing and undressing; into a comfortable chair for a while and then and out of it; brief awkward walks; three times a day lifting the spoon to his lips. And what&#39;s known in the care taking trade as &quot;toileting.&quot;</p>
<p>I&#39;m convinced that she doesn&#39;t know how bad he is. Caretakers are always behind, always catching up. If she knew, she&#39;d have had a wheelchair at the ready. He needs constant care-- not just family or friends, but professional assistance. Can they afford a place in a memory care facility or nursing home? Not everyone can.</p>
<p>Afterward the incident, we went to a coffee shop -- a normalizing activity for us. But, sitting there, I was shaken. Certainly profound sadness for the ill husband and the encumbered wife, and in addition a touch of personal PTSD.&#0160;</p>
<p>And then the inevitable pondering. &quot;To this favor must we come.&quot; It&#39;s not just Bill. We&#39;re all doomed -- even that cute infant in the next booth, rapturously examining her fingertips. A host of diseases, some as bad as Parkinson&#39;s, waiting at the door, waiting.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I&#39;m still trying to come to terms with Laura Brown&#39;s book, <em>The Counterhuman Imaginary</em>. I&#39;ve wrestled the title to a draw, and now I&#39;m going to take a crack at the Introduction. Is this task a good use of my limited time?</p>
<p>Let me quote a sentence that I take to be the very heart of the book and the heart of the problem. It&#39;s a doozy.</p>
<p>&quot;Human story telling is found to provide a subtle scenario for affirming the other-than-human, based on an imputed commonality that replaces human priority with cross-species inclusivity that transcends the human.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>Laura Brown&#39;s prose reads as if it were first drafted in German and then rendered into English by Google Translate.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>It takes effort, but once you penetrate its peculiar idiom, it makes a kind of sense. For those of my readers who are still with me, let me try to parse this sentence. I suspect It may mean something like, &quot;human beings project thoughts and feelings onto animals and objects.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Human story telling&quot; [that is, literature]</p>
<p>&quot;is found to provide&quot; [the passive &quot;is found,&quot; should be deleted even though it functions as a compliment to the person (i.e. the author herself) to whom this insight has been revealed.]</p>
<p>&quot;a subtle scenario&quot; [I don&#39;t know exactly what the phrase &quot;subtle scenario&quot; means; nor do I think that anyone else does.]&#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;based on an imputed commonality &quot; [I understand &quot;commonality&quot; because I know that humans and animals share many features. I don&#39;t see the necessity for the word &#39;imputed&quot;; imputed by whom? who other than humans can &quot;impute.&quot;]&#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;that replaces human priority&quot; [i.e. there should be no preference for humans over animals and rocks, despite the paradox that humans and not animals can think about the equivalence.]&#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;with cross-species inclusivity&quot; [&quot;inclusivity&quot; is implicit in the previous rejection of &quot;human priority.&quot; Wow, these abstract nouns do pile up (commonality, priority, inclusivity). Suggested simplification: &quot;that includes other species&quot;]</p>
<p>&quot;that transcends the human.]. Transcends, in this final clause, smuggles into the argument a new idea, because &quot;to transcend&quot; means &quot;to surpass.&quot; The claim now, as this snake of a sentence winds its weary way to conclusion, is that the meaning that humans attach to things is greater than the humans who do the attaching. At least I think that is what it may mean.]</p>
<p>So after completing this investigation, I think that the claim is that literature projects ideas onto animals and also things. And sometimes these projections illuminate and enhance both things and animals.&#0160;</p>
<p>I&#39;m exhausted. I had planned to discuss the Introduction at greater length, but I&#39;ve had enough. Instead of proceeding with the introduction, I&#39;m going to try to understand the chapter on <em>Robinson Crusoe</em> (a novel that I first read as a boy and have read several times since, and which I feel that I understand). Stay tuned.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I am absolutely buffaloed by Laura Brown&#39;s book, <em>The Counterhuman Imaginary&#0160;</em>(Cornell UP, 2023).</p>
<p>The title is a puzzle. Why does the adjective come after the noun? And what does the word &quot;counterhuman&quot; mean?&#0160; (One hundred and forty-six pages to go and I&#39;m already off balance. I&#39;m worried that if I can&#39;t understand the title I&#39;m going to have a heck of a difficult time with the content.)</p>
<p>I took a guess that the coinage &quot;counterhuman&quot; would signify something monstrous or terrifying, like a vampire, troll or ogre. But I was not even in the ballpark. &quot;Counterhuman,&quot; I have now discovered, is a term of art in contemporary literary criticism that refers to everything that is not human: not only animals, natural phenomena such as storms and earthquakes, but also &quot;things&quot; or objects -- anything that is constructed or manufactured. Not &quot;inhuman&#39; -- just not human. (But why &quot;counter&quot; rather than &quot;non&quot; human?)</p>
<p>Moreover, the word &quot;imaginary,&quot; which I have for a lifetime understood to be an adjective signifying what is not material but rather a product of the human mind, as for example, art and literature and dreams, has also undergone metamorphosis. According to wiki, the adjective-turned-noun &quot;imaginary&quot; &quot;is the set of values, institutions, laws, and symbols common to a particular social group and the corresponding society through which people imagine their social whole.” That&#39;s a deal of territory, but I think I understand: &quot;imaginary&quot; is essentially a synonym for what I might, naively, have called &quot;culture.&quot; (Might an alternative to <em>The Counterhuman Imaginary</em> be <em>The Culture of Things</em>? It&#39;s a more inviting title and much less pretentious.)</p>
<p>But now I&#39;m stopped in my tracks. The &quot;imaginary, it appears, is &quot;the work of a particular social group.&quot; How in the world, then, do the &quot;counterhuman,&quot; who are incapable of thought, possibly generate &quot;a structure of ideas?&quot; Pots and pans and volcanoes and marmosets don&#39;t have brains that think or speak, except when we humans attribute such traits to them.&#0160;</p>
<p>In a whimsical moment, Duke Senior, in <em>As You Like It</em>, proposed that there are &quot;tongues in trees, books in the running brooks, sermons in stones.&quot; Am I to understand that this author takes seriously what Shakespeare regarded as an ironic jokey extravagance? Gosh, I hope not.</p>
<p>I think I now get the point: Laura Brown, the prestigious Class of 1916 Professor of English at Cornell University, intends to defend a paradox. She will explain to me how non-humans, things without an intelligence, can create a culture. I&#39;d better pay close attention. Or perhaps the author means to advance the trivial but more sensible and less sensational idea that humans can attribute culture to animals and things.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I must say what&#39;s on my mind -- what a deliberately off-putting title. It&#39;s clearly designed to repel the general reader, someone like myself, and to speak only to coterie fellow-travelers who might understand either or both of the words &quot;counterhuman&quot; and &quot;imaginary.&quot; Not a large potential audience.</p>
<p>Do I have a chip on my shoulder as I turn from the title to the Introduction. Yes, I believe I do.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>[January 25] Marianne Morrison, Ph.D. writes:&#0160; &quot;Vivian, you should not go on with this. Your so prejudiced against this writer that you cant give her a fair hearing.&quot;</p>
<p>[January 25] Vivian de St. Vrain responds: &quot;Marianne, I&#39;m trying my best to be fair and honest.&quot;</p>
<p>[January 26] Petal Rivera writes: &quot;Vivian, I think you&#39;re naive to suggest a less pretentious title. I hate to say it, but the point is not to avoid pretense, but to be pretentious. No modesty in this book.&quot;</p>
<p>[January 27] J C Occhiogrosso writes:&#0160; &quot;Vivian, you&#39;re being deliberately obtuse. C&#39;mon, it&#39;s not so difficult.&quot;</p>
<p>[February 4] Vivian de St. Vrain responds:&#0160; &quot;Ok, J C, if it&#39;s so easy, why don&#39;t you suggest a better title.&quot;</p>
<p>[February 12] Winifred A. Walker writes: &quot;Like it or not, this is typical academic jargon. If you want to read this book, you must master the idiom.&quot;]</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Here&#39;s a truth that blows my freakin&#39; mind: since I earned my B. A. in English from Cornell University in 1960, sixty-five years have come and gone. Glaciers have melted and rivers have changed their course since, way back when, in a prior millennium, I was first introduced to serious literature -- to Chaucer and Milton and George Eliot.</p>
<p>My professors in those far-away-and-long-ago days were exclusively male and for the most part veterans of WW2 or the Korean war. They wrote definitive scholarly articles for the <em>Philological Quarterly </em>or for <em>Modern Philology</em>; they published learned monographs on canonical poets and novelists; and they taught courses with such forthright titles as <em>The Seventeenth Centur</em>y and <em>Wordsworth and Coleridge. </em> Although I was an indifferent student before I arrived at Cornell, I found an intellectual home in the Department of English. Inasmuch as I did not have a brain for rigorous science or for the tough analytic philosophy that was then in fashion, I was fortunate that the work of English suited my limited abilities -- curiosity, patience, a good memory, and something of a feel for language.</p>
<p>Just yesterday (and what, pray tell, prompted me?), I took a peek at the current website of Cornell&#39;s English Department. (In the index-card 1950s, when the manual typewriter was the acme of technology, the word &quot;website&quot; would have signified a dark corner colonized by spiders.) Even at first glance, the 2025 Cornell website said to me &quot;very very different, very &#39;now&#39;.&quot; While an occasional word or phrase was recognizable, it was the novelty -- the modernity, I guess -- that flared from the electronic page and dazzled mine eyne. Time marches on, no doubt, but whether it marches boldly forward or plunges over a cliff remains to be established.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>First of all, it&#39;s no longer the Department of English. It&#39;s now, hurrah!, the &quot;Department of Literatures in English.&quot; What a welcome redefinition -- an assertion that English is a world language and that it houses a world literature. Nowadays, if I sit down with a work of fiction, I&#39;m just as likely to read a novel by a writer from Africa or India or Australia as one from the British isles or North America. There&#39;s not a reason in the world why Chinua Achebe or Abdulrazak Gurnah should not be studied in an English Department. I respect this shift in focus and I regret that my 1950s Beowulf-to-T. S. Eliot English department was so parochial, so provincial. I can only admire the fact that the Department of Literatures in English has annexed to itself whole continents of writing -- a case of academic imperialism that this time seems wholly right and just.</p>
<p>The website also reveals that, in a nation in which the study of the humanities in higher education is at risk, Cornell&#39;s English is a huge thriving enterprise. There are fifty-one people on permanent staff, almost all of professorial rank. Of this number, twenty-seven -- or slightly more than half -- are women. And among those pictured on the site, a significant number are &quot;of color.&quot; Undoubtedly, the present department is a far more representative collection of individuals than my 1950s faculty. Moreover, the chair, the associate chair, the director of undergraduate studies, the director of graduate students, and the director of writing are all women. It may once have been the case that the occasional female interloper was a token for display only, but not so now.</p>
<p>And what do these handsome and distinguished men and women study? Fortunately for me, members of the faculty list their areas of concentration. Most claim two or three specialties, some as many as five; a few recalcitrant individuals list none, leaving me to wonder whether they are polymaths or just ornery uncooperative academics. Among the fifty-one, the single expertise most commonly claimed is &quot;cultural studies.&quot; This preponderance set me back a bit, because &quot;cultural studies&quot; is not a term I recognize nor one that existed, as far as I know, in the 1950s, when the word &quot;culture&quot; was synonymous with &quot;civilization&quot; -- sometimes just Western Civilization -- and when &quot;cultured&quot; meant something equivalent to &quot;educated&quot; and possibly even &quot;socially established.&quot; But now, apparently, &quot;cultural studies&quot; is, and I quote a respected source, &quot;an academic field &#0160;that... investigates how cultural practices relate to wider systems of power. These include ideology, class structures, national formations, ethnicity, sexual orientation and gender.&quot; Am I correct, and is it possible, for me to infer from this litany of nouns that &quot;cultural practices&quot; comprehends just about everything that we as a society say or do? Clearly the Department of Literatures in English lays claim to a heck of a lot of intellectual territory -- and that it is a far more aggressive entity than is revealed by its mere absorption of Anglophone novels. I was initially suspicious of these extensive claims, but after reflecting a while I recognized that, if I set to one side the self-aggrandizing listing of ideology, ethnicity, class... etc,), cultural studies may in practice simply bring to the forefront such elements as imperialism and nationhood in <em>Robinson Crusoe</em> or race and gender in <em>Othello</em>. Wouldn&#39;t it be comforting if &quot;cultural studies&quot; is at least in part merely traditional wine in spiffy new bottles? I, for one, certainly hope so.</p>
<p>After cultural studies, it is &quot;literary theory&quot; that claims the largest group of adherents -- thirteen, or about a quarter of the faculty. This revelation surprised me because I would have guessed that &quot;theory&quot; had long since gone the way of the aurochs and the mouflon. &quot;Theory&quot; had its herd of enthusiasts in its obscurantist heyday in the last century, yet it seems to be alive and kicking at Cornell -- but only, I suspect, as a vestigial remnant of an earlier time and only among the more senior members of the Department.</p>
<p>Following &quot;theory&quot; in popularity among the professoriate are the seven members who stake their claim to &quot;gender studies.&quot; Six other say &quot;African-American.&quot; The nine who announce a specialty in creative writing may not know that they are the successors and the beneficiaries of the late revered Professor James McConkey. Not a single member of the faculty offers &quot;Shakespeare&quot; or &quot;Milton&quot; as an area of expertise. I do not doubt that the study of gender and African-American and Asian-American literatures is a good thing, but I would have wished that the authors of the finest works of art in all of Anglophonia be accorded equivalent attention and status.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>Would a reincarnated Youthful Me elect take a degree from such a faculty?&#0160; I&#39;m skeptical, but I can&#39;t say for sure because I don&#39;t know whether or not, in the classroom, the scrupulous examination of literature and ideas has been undermined by transitory and faddish ideologies. I must confess that the biases of the website make me feel old and wary and out of touch. And tired.</p>
<p>Well then, what does take place in the classroom?</p>
<p>Let&#39;s sample some evidence.</p>
<p>In days of yore, I enrolled in &quot;Elizabethan and Jacobean Drama,&quot; a course taught by the distinguished scholar and teacher David Novarr. The course was organized as a chronological march from Kyd and Marlowe in the 1580s right through to Ford and Massinger -- the last playwrights of significance before the theaters went dark in 1642. I remember savoring some delightful comedies by Ben Jonson and Francis Beaumont and also a couple of ferociously brilliant tragedies by Thomas Middleton -- writings, I suspect, that 2020s English majors are not destined to encounter -- even though an acquaintance with these plays is essential background for understanding the timeless works of Shakespeare.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>There&#39;s no equivalent course in the present curriculum, but there is an analogue, and it appears in the catalogue of offerings thusly:&#0160;</p>
<p>ENGL 3240. <strong>Blood Politics:&#0160; Comparative Renaissance Drama</strong></p>
<p><em>Blood is everywhere. From vampire shows to video games, our culture seems to be obsessed with it. The course examines the power of &quot;blood&quot; in the early modern period as a figure that continues to capture our imagination, not only as a marker of racial, religious, and sexual difference and desire, but also as a dramatic player in its own right. How does a politics of blood appear on stage when populations are being expelled and colonized for reasons (mis)understood in terms of blood?.... Topics include honor, revenge, purity, the body, sexuality, conversion, and death.</em></p>
<p>The course description itself is a mess -- both incomprehensible and meretricious. I&#39;m shocked by the catchpenny pandering. Do 2020s teachers need to lure students into their classrooms with &quot;vampires&quot; and &quot;videos?&quot; The assertion that &quot;blood is a dramatic player in its own right&quot; is nonsense. The description reads like advertising copy for a cheesy low-budget horror flick playing at some louche all-night grind house.</p>
<p>Moreover, &quot;blood&quot; isn&#39;t &quot;everywhere.&quot; Goodness gracious!</p>
<p>I&#39;m afraid that these entrancing plays are doomed to be put through the &quot;cultural studies&quot; homogenizer. Or &quot;theorized&quot; out of all compass.</p>
<p>Ah, well.</p>
<p>Back in 1960, I had a summer job in Ithaca and therefore happened to be loafing around the campus when the University hosted its returning alumni. Among the returnees were the old folks&#0160; -- some few of them members of the class of 1895 -- who had walkered and wheel-chaired to their Sixty-Fifth. Geezers, I thought. It&#39;s sobering to realize that those codgers were the same age -- 86 -- as I am now. Should I&#0160; return to Ithaca this coming spring, for my very own Sixty-Fifth, I will be perceived by the young &#39;uns exactly as I observed those Class of 1895 guys: as ancient and irrelevant.</p>
<p>It follows, therefore, that my reservations about the 2025 English curriculum have their exact parallel in the 1895ers perspective on my 1960 curriculum. It&#39;s not hard to imagine that they -- I mean the members of the class of 1895 -- who had been educated in elocution and Old Norse, would have been shocked and perhaps outraged by the 1950s &quot;modern&quot; curriculum that I found so enticing and illuminating.</p>
<p>And now, because I don&#39;t want to go full curmudgeon and become the kind of superannuated guy who shakes his ebony stick at the modern world and deplores the decline of civilization, I&#39;m going to make an effort to find out what&#39;s really going on in 2025. I have therefore set myself the task of reading a representative sample of the books written by members of the present-day English faculty.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll report on my studies right here.</p>
<p>Stay tuned.</p>
<p>[January 18] Bernhard Starr writes:&#0160; &quot;Vivian, you are right about the course description. It&#39;s a disgrace. It&#39;s badly written and ridiculous. Why didn&#39;t you include the name of the prof. who wrote it?&#0160; He/she needs to be exposed. What &quot;populations are being expelled and colonized&quot; by <em>Volpone</em> or <em>The Changeling?</em>&#0160; And did you look other course descriptions -- are they equally silly?&#0160; What&#39;s worst about the course description is that it doesn&#39;t respect the plays that the class is going to examine. They&#39;re not important interesting dramas to the teacher -- they&#39;re just fodder for an ideology.&#0160;</p>
<p>[January 19] Vivian de St. Vrain replies: &quot;Mr. Starr, I didn&#39;t identify the author of the course description because the website doesn&#39;t identify him/her. Just as well. Also, I didn&#39;t read other course descriptions though I might do so in the future. I think you&#39;re correct that the course description does not respect the dramas or their authors. Which is, as you suggest, mighty disappointing.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>[January 19] Bernhard Starr replies:&#0160; &quot;I think I&#39;d rather study Old Norse.&quot;</p>
<p>[February 4] Thurston Dale replies:&#0160; &quot;I guess I&#39;m a geezer, too (Cornell, &#39;65). I&#39;m glad I majored in English before criticism turned crazy. Great teachers -- Mizener, Abrams, Parrish, Novarr.&quot;</p>
<p>[March 17] Anatole Miles Webber writes: &quot;Vivian, you were naive back in the 1950s and you&#39;re still naive now. You assume that the Cornell English Department of your youth, 65 years ago, was normative and normal. You were then and still are oblivious to the fact that the Department&#39;s 1950 curriculum was the product of stress and change and compromise. Try to remember that there were at least three forces at work and that various faculty members had various degrees of commitment to them. The first group was the oldest -- the traditionalist who studied, as they had always done, literature as history and biography and philology. Get the text and the context right was their primary concern. Then there were the &#39;new critics&quot; -- heirs to Leavis and <em>Scrutiny</em> in England and the southern agrarians (Ransom, Tate, Warren) in the US. But the main intellectual current riling English Departments were the fierce critics out of New York (mostly Jewish) circles (Kazin, Trilling, Fiedler, Paul Goodman, Irving Howe, etc). In retrospect, even though Cornell brought both Lionel Trilling and Cleanth Brooks to Ithaca during your and my years there, the new winds made little impression on our education. Cornell was peaceful, isolated and non-ideological. It appears from your writing that you preferred it that way and still do. It was stable until the theory people brought in novelty and confusion and excitement.</p>
<p>[April 15] Parnell Pratt replies: &quot;And also monumental pretension. And eventual collapse and failure.&quot;</p>
<p>[May 3] Lance Birdseye (Lt., USAF) writes: &quot;What a funny website this is. Hey, folks, join the real world.&quot;</p>

                                <p>The year got off to an early start when Brad Gombas died on December 16. Brad was the brother of my late brother-in-law Allen Gombas. I knew him in the 1970s, when he was a young man; he lived most of his life in New Mexico where he established a career as a builder and craftsman. I wasn&#39;t in touch except through the extended family communication chain. On December 26, my friend since&#0160; 1965 Ray Pike died at age 90. Ray was an accomplished journalist. Nancy Pike and AGP were the young mothers in a playgroup that included the infants NGP and Nina Pike -- in an earlier life it now seems. We saw Ray and Nancy at least once a year for many decades. Then on the last day of the year Sue Palmer died (peacefully, I&#39;m told), after many many years of illness and pain. She was a superbly talented artist and a friend, though not a close one, since 1969. In February, we lost Nancy Levitt. Not a close friend (wife of a colleague) but a long time acquaintance&#0160; -- a regular at the Takacs, seated just in front of us these past 30 years. Sheldon &quot;Spike&quot; Cohen, later Alan Mills, a friend from the PS 217 schoolyard, died in March. Esophogeal cancer that had metastasized. A long drawn out death, with many months of hospice care. In May. Bill Wood died. He was a world-famous scientist and a friend. It must be 20 years now since his wife, Renate Wood, a poet, left us. Bill had been in a relationship with another old acquaintance, Marilyn Krysl, for these many years. Marilyn died a couple of months after Bill; she had been in &quot;memory care&quot; for several months. During the summer, we lost two former English colleagues. The first to go was congenial Chuck Squier, at the age of 91, who had moved to Boise, Idaho to be near his children; he was a friend and also a long time neighbor on the Hill; the second: nice guy Doug Burger. In August I discovered that Anatol Anton had died earlier in the year. I knew Anatol when he was a member of the CU Department of Philosophy in the 70s or 80s, but hadn&#39;t been in touch since he left Boulder to return to San Francisco. Anatol was a cheerful bear of a man, far to&#0160; the political left, who grew up in Greenwich Village with a semi-famous painter for a father. Fred Litto, classmate from P S 217 and Erasmus, died in Brazil, where he had lived for 50 years; we always planned to get together, but it never happened. Another PS 217 friend, Tony Sogluizzo, died in the spring but I didn&#39;t find out about it until much later. He was a genuinely decent and gentle man who had a good career as a librarian. Late in December, we attended the dignified funeral of Bill Belew, husband of Lynn&#39;s friend Sharon Belew.&#0160; And so the year came to an end.&#0160;&#0160;</p>

                                <p>I&#39;m aware that Oscar Wilde is reputed to have said that the most terrifying words in the English language are -- &quot;I would like to tell about you my dream.&quot;&#0160; But I&#39;m going to report on last night&#39;s dream anyway, because it&#39;s so bizarre and interesting (at least to me).</p>
<p>I&#39;m sitting at a table in a restaurant with my ladylove. Actually, it&#39;s not exactly a restaurant; it&#39;s more like a nightclub of the kind that&#39;s familiar to me only from 30s films, not from real life. Small tables in a very large room, patrons wearing fancy slick clothes -- men in dark evening wear, women in shimmering white. Low chatter. Everything normal except that wandering among the tables is a giant African lion, male, with an intimidating mane and a long swishing tail.&#0160;</p>
<p>I say to my lady, &quot;I don&#39;t like the looks of this. That lion could easily carry off a small child.&quot;&#0160; End of dream, or at least, end of what I remember.</p>
<p>Once again, it&#39;s clear that my nighttime self is far more imaginative than my pedestrian daytime self, who would never in a million years have thought to introduce a whopping big lion from the Serengeti into an ordinary restaurant. I&#39;m not nearly so visionary. Does the dream have any meaning? An obvious interpretation is that even places safe for recreation can be dangerous.&#0160; Or, conversely, that dangers can be domesticated and made safe. Take your pick.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>In the course of my long life, I&#39;ve visited hundreds of museums -- more than I can possibly count or remember. Nor just the famous and glorious ones: how many times, driving in unfamiliar locality, or wandering in a new city, have I been irresistibly lured into the local landmark?&#0160; Even in the most modest establishment, there&#39;s something new to learn and discover. Nevertheless, my focus, lifetime, has been on art museums, where even the most iconic, most reproduced painting or sculpture acquires new life when viewed in the flesh. Let&#39;s face it: copies can be useful and informative, but the real thing is the real thing -- always revelatory, and sometimes transcendent or sublime. In fact, let me confess, in the Rembrandt Gallery at the Metropolitan Museum in New York City, I experienced a transient version of the so-called Stendhal Syndrome. Once and once only, but never to be forgotten.</p>
<p>I&#39;m dazzled, in memory, by the vast holdings of the Borghese, the Louvre, the Rijksmuseum, the British Museum, and an early love, the under-appreciated Brooklyn Museum right there on Grand Army Plaza.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>I&#39;m grateful to the exhibitions and the hard-working curators that introduced me to major painters I wouldn&#39;t otherwise have appreciated: Aelbert Cuyp and Jan Steen at the National Gallery, Camille Pissarro at the Jewish Museum in New York; many more. And also the specialized museums, chief among them the Vasa Museum in Stockholm, which taught me more about life in the seventeenth century than could a fleet of books. And a special favorite, the Corning Museum of Glass in Corning, New York -- a most wonderful and comprehensive display of an ancient and modern craft. But also the many local museums that I visited during my thirty-eight cross-country migrations. Who could ever forget the Donna Reed Museum in Denison, Ohio, or the Jell-O Museum somewhere near Buffalo, New York?&#0160; Gosh, I&#39;m still hoping that someday I will make it to the National Museum of the American Coverlet in Bedford, Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>And then there are the troubling museums. I wonder if I will ever have the courage to enter the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, DC. It was disorienting enough to visit an open-air museum, somewhere in Lithuania, where a variety of preserved structures from that country&#39;s miserable past have been brought together to simulate a peasant village. It was a strange dispiriting visit. After all, my ancestors as far back as we can know lived and worked in such a sad little village. My visit was, I suppose, educational -- but also melancholy and depressing. The village seemed not so much preserved as embalmed.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I&#39;m a terrible, terrible sleeper. It&#39;s a lifelong plight and a serious disability. Truth to tell, I&#39;d have more success as a contestant in a tango contest, or as a <em>heldentenor</em> yodeling in front of thousands, or as a trapeze artist or as a sumo wrestler than I have as a sleeper.</p>
<p>Bad sleeping runs in my family. I suppose that I inherited the trait from my father. Growing up, we never knew where we&#39;d find the old guy in the morning, because during the night he&#39;d wander from room to room and from bed to chair and even onto that scratchy old green tufted sofa. For me, the hardest part of any day has always been the night -- and, believe it or not, the problem has become more severe as I grapple with old age.</p>
<p>My usual routine is to fall asleep prematurely (and unwisely) at 10:00 pm. Then I wake at 12:30 am, usually in a fright from a ghastly nightmare, my brain alert, but my body yearning for oblivion. Then I&#39;m up for a while, involuntarily reprising some atrocious embarrassment or shameful failure in some earlier part of my life. Unable to find the right situation for my ancient limbs, I twirl beneath the blankets like a rotisserie chicken. I don&#39;t want to disturb my peacefully-slumbering bedmate, so I wander the residence, finally to settle in an auxiliary bed. Then my wayward brain starts to ruminate on the state of the nation, especially on the prospect of a second term for the moronic demagogue. At this point, I reluctantly surrender to necessity and take a sleeping pill (the powerful hypnotic ambien). I read or watch a basketball game on the TV, but after about 45 minutes the drug takes hold and the muscles in my eyes slacken so much that I can no longer bring the separate images of right and left eye together. Eventually I fall into &quot;airplane sleep&quot; -- the kind of shallow surface sleep that we all experience when we fly &quot;economy&quot; or &quot;coach&quot; (better called &quot;steerage&quot;). At about 6 in the morning, I wake out a second horrid dream, relieve myself, and try to snatch a couple of peaceful hours --&#0160; a hope which I regularly fail to accomplish. Eventually, &quot;the darkness has passed/ And it&#39;s daylight at last.&quot;&#0160; I&#39;m foggy-headed for a while but at last I regain my equilibrium until it&#39;s time for another nighttime bout with Morpheus. And that&#39;s how I pass one third of my life.&#0160;</p>
<p>On the cheerful side, although I&#39;m a bad nighttime sleeper, I&#39;m a fairly proficient daytime napper. The most wonderful and memorable sleeps of my life have been afternoon naps. When I was in my teens, back there in the Eisenhower era, it was my weekend custom to trot to the schoolyard in the morning and play three-on-three half-court basketball for a couple of hours (in those days I enjoyed an endless &quot;second wind&quot;). Then I&#39;d come home for a mid-day dinner -- perhaps if the parents were feeling flush it would be a roast beef or roast pork along with a bounty of potatoes (the most soporific of vegetables). Then I&#39;d retreat to my room, tune the old wood-cased Philco to a Dodgers game, perhaps even to a double-header, and allow myself to be soothed by the rhythmic cadences of Red Barber and Connie Desmond. A deep, profound and most satisfying nap would then ensue -- the kind of sleep where you&#39;re so far gone that you don&#39;t know if it&#39;s day or night, summer or winter when, hours later, you crack an exploratory eyelid.</p>
<p>Where are the sleeps of yesteryear?</p>
<p>In my maturity, sleep has been, as I&#39;ve said, a combat zone. In these last years I&#39;ve achieved weekend afternoon depth just two times. Alas and alack, it was the drugs, the sedatives for my two surgeries that did the trick. When you&#39;re anesthetized, at least as I experienced it, there&#39;s nothing -- no sound, no dream, certainly no twirling -- between the moment the anesthetic kicks in and moment it leaves. You&#39;re just not there. You&#39;re nowhere.</p>
<p>The ancient formula was <em>somnus imago mortis</em>. That is to say, sleep is the simulacrum of death. Sleep is designed to prepare us for death. There was a time that I would scoff at such a pious formula -- but not any more. I think that if death is what I experienced during anesthetized sleep, why, then, there&#39;s nothing to fear. It will be peaceful and long and very boring, but not at all stressful.</p>
<p>I would like my tombstone to read, &quot;No More Insomnia, Forever.&quot;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>During my lifetime, the word &quot;outing&quot; has mutated beyond recognition. It first entered my youthful vocabulary (as did so many other words) through the medium of baseball. An &quot;outing&quot; -- in the old days --meant to me only a stint on the mound. &quot;Podres has had a good &quot;outing&quot; today.&quot; The more general meaning of &quot;outing&quot; as a short trip taken for pleasure, such as a picnic, or a jaunt in the country, only came into my&#0160; life many years later. &quot;They enjoyed a family outing to Montauk.&quot; The fact of the matter is that my family of origin didn&#39;t go on &quot;outings,&quot; but at some point I must have heard I heard about such journeyings from friends or read about them in novels.</p>
<p>These days, I rarely encounter the baseball or picknicky meanings of &quot;outing.&quot; &quot;Outing&quot; has transformed into the obnoxious word that describes the odious and hostile practice of exposing the sexual identity of a person against his/her will.&#0160; From picnic to nasty, alas.</p>
<p>Frankly, I prefer the traditional significations and activities.</p>

                                <p>It&#39;s my newest acquisition, purchased on ebay just a couple of days ago, but already a favorite. It&#39;s a bronze door plate, very beautiful and heavy in the hand. It&#39;s inscribed PULL. It bears no manufacturers or identifying marks but the style is mighty pure Victorian. I imagine it came from a demolished once-elegant downtown department store. What the heck do I plan to do with it?&#0160; Why, it will be attached, next summer, to the old iron gate that we mounted at the entrance to the &quot;waterfall garden.&quot; It&#39;s whimsical, of course, because while the gate helps to define the space, it guards absolutely nothing and is easily circumvented.&#0160;</p>
<p>If PUSH had been available I would have purchased it too. But PULL is sufficient. A plate saying NO SOLICITORS has also been proposed -- but that addition might be just a little bit of overkill (and silliness).</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>The (<a href="https://myshtetl.org/shtetl_en.html">website</a>) &quot;My Shtetl -- Jewish Towns of Ukraine&quot; gathers information about Starokonstantinov -- &quot;Old Constantine&quot; -- the town from which, in 1895, my courageous grandparents emigrated to America. The site is in Russian but it can be mechanical translated into awkward but intelligible English.</p>
<p>Some of my friends of European extraction have been able to return to the old country villages where their families originated, but that option is not available to me. Trust me, there&#39;s no pilgrimage to Starokonstantinov in my future -- even if the town happens to survive the Russian invasion and the rockets. My grandparents did not bring to Ellis Island happy memories and nostalgia or pique my curiosity with warm fuzzy memories of their earlier years. Nevertheless, Starokonstantinov provokes my curiosity. For how many decades did my ancestors live in this so-obscure-to-me town?&#0160; How did they manage to survive?</p>
<p>One of the compilers of the My Shtetl website, Yevgenii Schneider, has unearthed a report on Starokonstantinov written in 1884 by a certain N. I. Zuts, a lieutenant in the 45th Azov Infantry Regiment. Why or for whom these paragraphs were written I have no idea, but some of it largely duplicates information that I have <a href="45th Azov Infantry Regiment">previously </a>posted. According to Lieutenant Zuts, Starokonstantinov was founded in 1505 as the village of Kolyshchentsy in a grant from the king of Poland to one Ivan Labunsky. On January 5, 1561, Labunsky&#39;s descendants sold Kolyshchentsy to Prince Konstantin Ostrozhsky. Three months later, Ostrozhsky was permitted by the king to found a city first called Konstatinov, then Novokonstantinov, and finally in 1632 renamed Starokostiantyniv. A castle was constructed in 1571. In 1620, the city passed into the possession of the princes Zaslavsky, and in 1682, to the princes Lubomirsky. Starokonstinov became part of Russia in 1793.</p>
<p>(It seems to be the case that Ukraine was a largely unpopulated or underpopulated frontier until a few hundred years ago. When and why did my people decide to try their luck on this vast semi-empty plain?)&#0160;</p>
<div>Zuts expresses frustration that it hard to count Jews because of &quot;the special conditions of their life, which is generally distinguished by great mobility and inconstancy with respect to place of residence: in the city there are many Jews who live permanently or for a very long time due to their trade and other affairs and are not included in the city population. Jewish houses, not being the property of one person, and sometimes constituting the property of several families, cannot serve as data by which, even desirably, with a small error, it would be possible to determine the number of their inhabitants. When concluding marriages among themselves, many, even the majority of Jewish families, accepting a son-in-law for a year, two, three or even five years, depending on the marriage conditions and the son-in-law&#39;s property status, subsequently move to other localities.&quot;</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>The good lieutenant seems genuinely mystified by the communal customs of the Jewish population. Zuts admires one aspect of Jewish life: &quot;the charity of the Jewish residents is expressed primarily in the fact that poor Jews receive help from the wealthier ones. Independently of this, there is a Jewish Hospital in the city, located in a house built with public funds and maintained with money donated by two wealthy Jews, Israel Epstein and Abraham Krasnoselsky.&quot;</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>And Zuts adds this very interesting detail of Jewish life. &quot;All Jewish houses are built almost according to the same plan and the same model, having the character of a guest house, i.e. on both sides of the corridor there is a row of rooms; each room has a door into the common corridor and is also connected to the neighboring rooms by doors, mostly double-leaf. Consequently, each room has 3 doors and only the corner rooms have 2 doors.&quot; Zuts describes what is familiar to me as a &quot;shotgun house&quot; -- a style not at all rare in the new world but apparently exotic to the lieutenant.<br /><br />The website also contains a few pictures of houses typical of Jewish inhabitants. As far as I can tell, these are recent photographs of older homes in various states of repair.</div>

<p>The website does not make it clear who, if anyone, is living in these houses today.<br /><br />In addition, Evgeniy Schneider appends a brief history of the Jewish community of Starokonstantinov. I&#39;ve transcribed it.</p>
<div id="wb_staroconstantinovText3">&quot;Jews have lived in Starokostiantyniv since the end of the 16th century. In 1629, there were 130 Jewish families (about 25% of the total population), and the community was the second largest in Volyn. During the Khmelnytsky period, the Jews of the city and the surrounding area took refuge in the fortress. On the Ninth of Av, the Cossacks broke in and killed everyone. Starokostiantyniv was also destroyed several times by the Haidamaks in the early 18th century. But Jews continued to settle there, and in 1765, 1,801 Jews were registered in the city and its surrounding area. In 1802, the number of Jews was 2,053. In 1827, when Tsar Nicholas I issued an order to mobilize Jews into the Russian army, serious unrest broke out in Starokostiantyniv. In 1847, there were 6,611 Jews in the community, and in 1897, 9,212 (60.7% of the total population). Most of the local Jews were Hasidim, followers of the tzaddikim of the Chernobyl and Sadagora dynasties. In 1911, the city&#39;s population was about 20,000, including 11,800 Jews. With the establishment of Soviet power in Volyn in 1920, the Jewish community was disbanded. By 1926, there were 6,934 Jews in the city (41.3% of the population). There was a secondary school with instruction in Yiddish.<br />At the end of 1931, there were 4,837 Jews in the city (about 33% of the population), of whom more than a quarter were deprived of the right to vote (&quot;disenfranchised&quot;).&#0160; The Germans occupied Starokostiantyniv on July 8, 1941. In late August 1941, the Jews were confined to a ghetto. The Jewish population of Starokostiantyniv and its environs was exterminated in a series of actions from August 1941 to November 1942.&#0160; Today, the town has a small Jewish community, &quot;Shalom.&quot; In 2012, it had 80 members.&quot;&#0160; A tragic story.</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>The website posts another picture that intrigues me. It&#39;s an old photograph, probably from the the turn of the last century, of Jewish workers in what is called a &quot;cigarette factory.&quot; I know that when Isaiah came to America, in 1895, he made his living rolling cigars. I just wonder if he followed a trade that he had begun in Starokonstantinov. Would he, perhaps, have recognized any of these contemporary, doomed Jewish workers?</div>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>This post is written for my children, grandchildren, and any potential future descendants. Aunt Mollie was an important person to my in earlier years. She should be remembered.</p>
<p>Mollie was my father&#39;s older sister. She was born in 1900, the third of the four children of Isaiah and Eta. She was an extremely private person and never revealed the least personal information about herself. I know nothing of her childhood and I am not even certain that she attended high school. I know that she was for many years employed in the surgical instrument field, where she advanced to a responsible management position and earned a reasonable salary (for those days). She retired early, perhaps in her fifties. She never married nor introduced me or anyone else in our family to a boyfriend, lover, or suitor, though in later life I learned that it had been her constant habit to visit a &quot;Mr Isgin&quot; every Wednesday. Who was Henry Isgin? I believe that he was a fellow worker at her place of employment and I know that when he died he willed Mollie his Long Island City house. That&#39;s all I know; I hope that her relationship with him was satisfying.</p>
<p>Mollie&#39;s curly black hair never grayed. Her eyes were so dark that there was no visible distinction between iris and pupil. My daughter, who knew her only in her last years, remembers her as small, squarish, and big-bosomed.</p>
<p>Mollie never &quot;moved out&quot;; during my childhood, she lived with her parents and later with Eta only in a small ground-floor apartment at 334 Eastern Parkway in Crown Heights. When Eta died in 1963, she moved across the river to a her own place at last, a modest apartment in Greenwich Village, where she lived until her death in 1985. She enjoyed the concerts and the theater and her independence. She was a solid New Yorker; like my father, she never learned to drive an automobile. Unlike my father, who was uncomfortable outside his familiar sphere and was averse to travel, Aunt Mollie was an adventurous sort. She traveled the world, usually solo. She was constantly on the move. I heard tell, for example, that she was a passenger on one of the first commercial flights to China (in the 1930s).</p>
<p>In 1952, she offered to take me on a trip to Washington DC. I jumped at the chance. It was my first time out of Brooklyn and quite the revelation: gosh, there were other cities, other neighborhoods in the universe! We stayed at the Mayflower Hotel (gosh, there were hotels!), ate in &quot;restaurants&quot; -- another novelty -- visited the Lincoln and Jefferson Memorials, and even took a boat ride up the river to Mt. Vernon. We heard Harry Truman deliver a Fourth of July address from the base of the Washington Monument. It was exhilarating and inspiring -- a first toe-in-the-water alternative to my very marked provinciality and to the exaggerated caution of my parents. I am sure that I would never &quot;gone away&quot; to college, or relocated to the Rocky Mountain west, or traveled to other continents if it hadn&#39;t been that Aunt Mollie introduced me to the world outside the P S 217 schoolyard in my thirteenth year.</p>
<p>Mollie also helped me financially. She wasn&#39;t rich but as a single woman with a good income she accumulated enough cash to intervene, generously, at critical moments. In a sense, she was the family banker. She gave me a couple of thousand dollars for part of the down payment on the Hackett Hill property and later held, on favorable terms, the mortgage on my house on 10th Street. When she died, she bequeathed me the remainder of the principal.&#0160; Although these were not great sums, they were nevertheless very crucial to me and to my family&#39;s financial well-being.</p>
<p>Even more important: Mollie admired and, I believe, loved my wife -- which was a very good thing because my own mother was not so positive.</p>
<p>I can&#39;t say that I ever had a real conversation with Mollie. She asked little and told less. She was not curious, or thoughtful, nor well-educated -- not even a reader. She was always a little crude and could be critical and blunt (though not to me). To my brother, when he was going through a tough period in his financial life, she said, &quot;Why don&#39;t you just get a real job.&quot; To a niece, she offered, &quot;Why don&#39;t you just lose weight.&quot;&#0160; A true Victorian at heart, she regarded all illnesses as mental and moral weakness.</p>
<p>Mollie was proud of her extraordinary vigor and health. She once told me that she went 40 years without seeing a doctor. She was robust and middle-aged at 84, dead at 85 -- every one of her organs having failed. Loss of mental acuity was the first sign of decay. In 1984, she called my father on the telephone and said, out of the blue, &quot;Pop is here.&quot;&#0160; Dad said, &quot;What do you mean Pop is here. Pop died in 1946.&quot; Mollie answered, &quot;Yes, I know that. So why is he here.&quot;&#0160; After that shocking moment, the end came quickly.</p>
<p>I&#39; have never visited my parents&#39; graves, but I&#39;m told that Mollie is buried on my father&#39;s right and that my mother is buried on my father&#39;s left. So Dad lies forever between the two women to whom he was closest in life.&#0160;</p>

		<a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2024/09/bottom.html">Words of My Life:  Bottom</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>&quot;Bottom&quot; is another of the many words that came into my life through the medium of baseball. As soon as I was able to walk and talk, I learned that an inning has both a &quot;top&quot; and a &quot;bottom.&quot; &quot;Bottom of the ninth&quot; was an optimistic phrase because there was always the Ebbets Field hope that the Dodgers might come through with a game-winning rally. Later, when I discovered that there was more to human existence than baseball, the various and colorful meanings of &quot;bottom&quot; began to reveal themselves. For example, the posterior part of the human body, which I knew as the ass or the behind or the tuchas, was, I learned, called the &quot;bottom&quot; by people of sophistication. A euphemism?&#0160; A Britishism?&#0160;</p>
<p>Even later on, I discovered that bottom, signifying buttocks or butt was not the root meaning of the word but a metaphorical extension of its original sense. Old English <em>botm, </em>cognate with Latin f<em>undus</em>, meant land or farm or soil. This meaning of &quot;bottom&quot; is well-preserved in the phrase &quot;bottom land&quot; -- the level and fertile acres along the banks of a watercourse. Many English family names are consequently topographical surnames of ancient inhabitants of various river fronts -- such as Bottoms, Robottom, Higginbottom, Ramsbottom, Longbottom, Winterbottom, and Bottomley. Names that have nothing to do with either innings or asses.</p>
<p>The oddity that &quot;bottom&quot; can refer both to farmland and to the human butt can sometimes yield unconscious comedy. For example, in 1977, I was a guest at a wedding in the infelicitously named Kent village of Pett Bottom. I must hope that Pett is a variant of Pitt, a &quot;hollow,&quot; rather than commonplace &quot;pet&quot; with a supernumerary &quot;t&quot;.</p>
<p>These days, &quot;bottom&quot; is more likely to mean something like &quot;the essence&quot; -- as in such phrases &quot;to get to the bottom of the matter&quot;; or &quot;the bottom of one&#39;s heart.&quot;</p>
<p>And then there&#39;s egregious Bottom in A <em>Midsummer Night&#39;s Dream</em>, who does not disdain the mandatory pun: &quot;This is to make an ass of me.&quot;</p>
<div class="word--C9UPa">
<div class="">
<div id="etymonline_v_43248">Shakespeare likes the word &quot;bottom.&quot; Here&#39;s Malcolm&#39;s most memorable characterization of Macbeth.&#0160;&#0160;</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>&#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; I grant him bloody,<br />Luxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful,<br />Sudden, malicious, smacking of every sin<br />That has a name: but there&#39;s no&#0160;<strong><span class="keyword1">bottom</span>,</strong> none,<br />In my voluptuousness: your wives, your daughters,<br />Your matrons and your maids, could not fill up<br />The cistern of my lust, and my desire<br />All continent impediments would o&#39;erbear<br />That did oppose my will:</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>This &quot;bottom&quot; is not farmland or butt; it&#39;s the low point in a downward trajectory. This &quot;bottom&quot; is associated with &quot;cistern&quot; -- a receptacle for holding water.&#0160; Curiously, Shakespeare regularly uses the word in its relation to the water of oceans, most specifically the sea-bottom:&#0160;&#0160;</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>&#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; the slimy <strong><span class="keyword1">bottom</span></strong> of the deep.&#0160; &#0160; (<em>Richard III</em>)</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>O coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz, that thou didst know how many fathom deep I am in love! But it cannot be sounded; my affection hath an unknown&#0160;<strong><span class="keyword1">bottom</span></strong>, like the Bay of Portugal.&#0160; (<strong>As You Like It</strong>)</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>By heaven, methinks it were an easy leap,<br />To pluck bright honor from the pale-faced moon,<br />Or dive into the&#0160;<strong><span class="keyword1">bottom</span></strong>&#0160;of the deep,<br />Where fathom-line could never touch the ground,<br />And pluck up drowned honor by the locks.&#0160; (<em>I Henry IV</em>)</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>As is the ooze and&#0160;<strong><span class="keyword1">bottom</span></strong> of the sea. (<em>Henry V</em>)</div>
<div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>Who ever yet could sound thy&#0160;<strong><span class="keyword1">bottom</span></strong>? find<br />The ooze, to show what coast thy sluggish crare<br />Might easiliest harbour in?&#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160;(<em>Cymbeline)</em></div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>I suspect that Shakespeare would have savored the modern phrase, &quot;bottom feeder.&quot;&#0160; But I doubt he would have understood, any more than I do, the names of the fifth and sixth quarks, which are top and bottom (exactly like an inning).</div>

                                <p>Last night I woke from a dream with this peculiar phrase repeating itself in my half-conscious brain: &quot;it fills my onion heart with fear and trembling.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>I have a couple of questions to ask of my capricious dreamatorium, which although obviously capable of creating passable iambic pentameter is rarely self-explanatory.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>a) What is &quot;it?&quot;&#0160; What is the nameless dread that precipitated this piece of blank verse, and b) what in the living heck is an &quot;onion heart.&quot;&#0160; And why am I accused of having one?&#0160; Is an &quot;onion heart&quot; pungent and tasty, when eaten either raw or sauteed?&#0160; Or is it constructed of layers of scales and therefore mysterious and perhaps unknowable.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Frankly, I don&#39;t have a good theory, except to say that I don&#39;t feel that to be described as having an &quot;onion heart&quot; is complimentary. If my dreamatorium wanted to say something nice about my heart, it had such relevant and easily available alternatives as &quot;lionheart&quot; or &quot;braveheart.&quot; Or even &quot;sweetheart,&quot; for goodness sake.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>When we built the summer house/cabin/hovel in 1977, we needed to dig a well, and someone, probably the plumber, hired a dowser. I didn’t approve –-I would have hired a credentialed hydraulic engineer. For me, dowsers belong in the same ol&#39; crazy crate as astrologers, phrenologists, flat-earthers, Shakespeare-author conspiracists, along with the lunatics who report on visits to the earth by ancient astronauts. Nevertheless, a dowser arrived, an elderly gentleman. Curiously, he dowsed with an old pair of rusted pliers rather than the traditional forked willow stick. He was an enthusiast for his trade and, ignoring my skepticism, showed my how to cut a willow and exactly how to hold it. After he left, I tried it out. A most odd experience, one of the oddest in my life, then took place. As I walked about, brandishing the rod, from time to time the tip of the willow would turn suddenly down. Not in a subtle way, but forcefully and dramatically – strongly enough to redden and even slightly cut the palms of my hands.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Even more strange -- if I handed the willow to another person and he or she walked about, nothing happened. Nothing, that is, until I held that person&#39;s wrist. Then the dowsing rod went all crazy and twisted downward out of the holder&#39;s hands.&#0160;</p>
<p>It was a wondrous incredible experience and is vivid in my memory now these fifty years. But it was a one time only event.</p>
<p>Every once in a while, over the decades, just for fun, I would cut a piece of willow and walk about, but I’ve never been able to reproduce the phenomenon. The dowsing rod doesn’t dowse, doesn’t do anything at all;&#0160; just behaves like an ordinary piece of wood.&#0160;</p>
<p>I don&#39;t believe in dowsing. I don&#39;t believe that you can find underground water, or even underground electric wires as some think, by walking about with a piece of willow in your hands.&#0160; On the other hand, I know that something peculiar and very real happened to me that one time. Was there water underground. I don&#39;t know, but I know that I wouldn&#39;t dig a hole on the basis of that fleeting evidence. I am a man of reason, or at least I like to think so.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the place that the 1977 dowser picked out for us to dig was a great success. We&#39;ve enjoyed a bounteous&#0160; supply of water for all these many years.&#0160;</p>
<p>But now that I know more about wells than I did half a century ago, I can read the landscape well enough to recognize that the dowser picked an obvious place to dig a well -- with or without the help of his magical pliers.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>As a rule, I keep my distance from live performances of a Shakespeare play because I seldom enjoy the experience and regularly find it misleading. This has not always been the case. A few versions, notably the lucid Scofield <em>Coriolanus</em> at Stratford in 1962, are still vivid in my brain. What has happened?&#0160; Somewhere along the way, I&#39;ve lost patience and lost interest in playgoing. Am I alone?&#0160; I remember sitting in some theater or other in the way back when, when, glancing left and right in my row, I could not help noting that a significant cadre of my fellow spectators were not engrossed in the performance but were nodding off, and that others in my vicinity were clearly bored, drifting passively toward sweet sleep.</p>
<p>This is a phenomenon that I had never encountered at a baseball game where everyone is alert and engaged. Anything but silent and sometimes raucous?</p>
<p>So why were all these numb Shakespeare spectators sitting as still as stones?</p>
<p>And why was I among them, inasmuch as I too, let me confess, was bored by the performance. I was not, as I yearned to be, lost in the words or engaged by the action. While I resisted sleep, except possibly for a second or two here and there, I was treading mental water, so to speak. Not exactly hypnotized, but certainly not transfixed. And I was in this state of inattention even though I knew the words that the actors were saying as well or better than they knew them themselves. Eventually, in the course of time, I came to admit to myself that to attend a Shakespeare play was not for pleasure but rather to honor an eminence, to pay dues to a cultural icon, to participate in a ritual of cultural hegemony -- and that I had paid good money in order to worship at the shrine of Shakespeare and to lend my support to what has long been labelled &quot;Shakespeare idolatry.&quot;&#0160; This revelation, or <em>apercu</em>, or insight made me unhappy as I am not by nature given to reverence. To try to bend my will to admire on-stage oratory felt inauthentic, contrary to myself as I knew myself.&#0160;</p>
<p>Yet I am an unabashed, unapologetic lover of Shakespeare. Not of the theater, but of the book. When I sit myself down to read one of Shakespeare&#39;s most excellent plays, the experience can be and often is utterly transcendent.&#0160;</p>
<p>It is reading that unlocks the play; puts me in touch with true genius.There&#39;s something about the one-on-one concentration that you can give to a book in your very own hands in your very own chair that you can&#39;t give to a performance, where you&#39;re crammed into your space and have lost to your neighbor the battle for the arm rest. You&#39;re distracted by the inevitable snuffles and sneezes of your fellows and by the too-clever sets and costumes and lighting and artifice -- all of which interfere with your grasp of what is most important about poetic drama -- the words. But at home, I&#39;m dazzled by the poetry and I am transported with aesthetic bliss (however defined). I&#39;m moved to tears and laughter and also admiration.</p>
<p>He&#39;s endlessly fascinating, this Shakespeare guy, and intelligent, and a poet like none other.&#0160;</p>
<p>It&#39;s all I need; a comfortable posture for my ancient limbs, a bit of silence, a book --&#0160; and I&#39;m in awe.&#0160;</p>
<p>Performances, in my opinion, erect a barrier to understanding and obscure rather than illuminate the plays. It&#39;s necessarily so, because directors and actors interpret the play.&#0160; It&#39;s their job;&#0160; it&#39;s what they do. Interpret. And every interpretation, no matter how skillful, is an obstacle.</p>
<p>A reader is less constrained and can keep his mind open. No one, no thing, to mediate between the eyes and the page.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Performances are especially hazardous when directors deliberately attempt to make a play relevant or in accord, somehow, with the zeitgeist of the decade. Clever catchpenny novelties do nothing for me. Why must plays be set anywhere but where Shakespeare intended them?&#0160; Any effort to update a play, or make it &quot;contemporary&quot; or &quot;feminist&quot; or &quot;anti-fascist&quot; or &quot;anti-colonial&quot; or whatever, produces only distraction and distortion. Which is why the long history of Shakespeare on stage is a woeful history of addled misinterpretation. Nahum Tate&#39;s notorious King Lear of 1681, in which Edgar and Cordelia embrace at the end and Lear is pensioned off is ludicrous, but not more absurd than last year&#39;s Queen Lear.</p>
<p>Query: if I&#39;m so disdainful of live performances, how is it that I&#39;m so fond of Shakespeare on film.</p>
<p>But that&#39;s a subject for another day.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>And now for another installment in my long-running &quot;autobiography by topics.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>Today&#39;s topic is my life as a cook. I say cook, rather than chef, because my kitchen work has always been functional rather that artistic -- the very opposite of sophisticated or elegant. I am most definitely not a chef -- just a guy who can put a meal on the table. Confession: I prefer to my own food to what is presented to me at all but the most elite restaurants. I&#39;m basically a hamburger-and-ketchup plebeian; fancy foods with exotic ingredients do nothing for my pedestrian palate. Why leeks, chives, ramps or shallots when your everyday yellow onion will do the job. Especially if it&#39;s one of those amazingly sweet Vidalia onions.</p>
<p>My lack of gourmet-ism originated with my family of origin, back there in 1940s Flatbush where cooking was not imaginative. Its basics were Velveeta cheese and those slimy canned Harvard beets. No frills but a sufficiency where &quot;enough [was] as good as a feast.&quot; My mother, who presided over the kitchen, did it all, every bit of it (my father might just have starved if he had to extend himself to boil water). Mom was a functional cook and her limited repertoire of meals repeated weekly. I never knew her to try something new nor did I once see her consult a cookbook. Spices were limited to salt and pepper. Chicken was boiled, lamb chops were broiled, flounder was poached. There was too much malodorous liver and too much tongue and too many salmon croquettes. Almost all meals were accompanied with mashed potatoes. My favorite food, in those days, was noodles with a meat-and-tomato sauce (which would nowadays have been upgraded to &quot;Bolognese&quot;). (The word &quot;noodles&quot; was later promoted to &quot;spaghetti&quot; and has now been ennobled to &quot;pasta.&quot;) On an occasional flush Sunday there was roast beef. The family celebrated Thanksgiving with a grand turkey and countered Yom Kippur with a defiant roast pork.</p>
<p>What a tedious chore it was for my mom to set out twenty-one meals a week for the five of us, but she did so without complaint.</p>
<p>The only memorable meals of my childhood were supplied by my grandmother Sonia. Unsurpassed blintzes, potato latkes, jams and jellies. My favorite meal in those days: black radish, onion and pumpernickel complemented with gribbinis. I have written about my love affair with the black radish <a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2010/01/haute-cuisine-c-1945.html">here.</a></p>
<p>The first steps into cookery of my own arose out of my native frugality. When I was in college, most of my friends ate in the dorm cafeteria or in nearby restaurants but I soon discovered that with a little initiative I I could eat better and cheaper. It was a bit of a learning process, because, growing up, I regarded cooking as a kind of alchemy to which only married women were privy. In 1957, I abandoned the dormitory for a remarkably grotty off-campus apartment and discovered that I too could turn on a gas burner and transmogrify raw ingredients into food. For the next three years I lived on a hunk of meat and a boiled potato and warmed frozen peas -- at a quarter the cost of an equivalent restaurant meal! Not elegant food -- but what a revelation!&#0160; It was not only an improvement in standard of living, but a demonstration to myself that I need not imitate my father&#39;s example of dependent helplessness.&#0160;</p>
<p>My galley skills, such as they were, were also good for my social life. Dates with my girlfriend (later my wife of more than half a century) often began with me preparing a Saturday night dinner for her. Fortunately for the two of us, she was not put off by my want of culinary imagination.</p>
<p>Let me record a sad reminiscence about the way in which we were all hog-tied by Eisenhower-era conservatism: I did all the cooking until June of 1960, when AGP and I married. At that point, it seemed mandatory and inevitable&#0160; that kitchen responsibilities should be transferred from me to her. It was, we believed, an inviolable rule of the universe that wives cooked and husbands ate. That was the way things were in that reactionary pre-feminist period -- even though my bride had until that point never prepared a single meal in her entire life. How conventional, how thoughtless we both were. However, true to the stereotype, AGP rapidly became a much better cook than I could have imagined. But what socially-constrained idiocy! How blinkered were the two of us! It&#39;s embarrassing to confess it all even sixty-plus years after the fact.&#0160;</p>
<p>Once the three children joined us, cooking became less fun and more of an obligation -- but now a chore at last shared by the two of us. Inasmuch as we were both employed, food preparation became a weekend activity. Together we&#39;d cook up a cauldron of beef stew or a spaghetti sauce or something else that could get us through the week. Lunches were improvised, but I was always the breakfast cook. I wish I could properly estimate the number of eggs that I scrambled or pancakes that I flipped. They would stuff a moderately-sized warehouse, I&#39;m sure. For AGP, meals became a burden. If I remember correctly, it was not so much the labor of preparation as it was the organization that distressed her. Just gathering the ingredients and keeping the refrigerator stocked became dull boring work. Her point, and I know she was correct in this, was that even if I did I half the cooking, she had 100% of the responsibility. Things became even more complicated when the kids went through their vegetarian phases and when their complicated after school activities made orderly scheduling next to impossible.&#0160;</p>
<p>I remember that one summer, sometime in the 70s. I announced that I would do all the gathering and cooking for two months. AGP&#39;s only task was to lie in the hammock all day and to eat whatever I produced. AGP enjoyed the vacation, but she pointed out that it our society, men could get the credit for labor that was taken for granted for women. She was once again correct in her assessment, but nevertheless I felt that I had done a good deed. I think she enjoyed the kitchen respite.&#0160;</p>
<p>Eventually the kids left home and life became simpler. We were now &quot;recovering parents.&quot;&#0160; Food preparation became simpler and fun again. Joint fun.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it was only a few years later that AGP began her long decline. Of course I took over more and more of the kitchen responsibilities. I think for the last ten years that AGP was with me, I was the head and only cook. How else would we have survived?&#0160; As a result, I became more interested in the work. As I have said, I never became a chef, but I do take some pride in my general competence around the kitchen -- especially in my barbecued spare ribs, my beef stew, my stuffed cabbage (grandma Sonia&#39;s recipe) and my transcendent lasagnas.&#0160;</p>
<p>Nowadays, in my miraculous second relationship, cooking, like everything else, is shared equally.&#0160;</p>
<p>Gosh it&#39;s been a long haul.</p>

                                <p>For our annual winter stay in New Orleans, we rented a place in the old Bywater district. It&#39;s a feature of the neighborhood that one house is a perfect example of classic vernacular architecture while the next one over is a ramshackle mess, smelling of mold and nearly swallowed by yellow cat&#39;s paw creeper. And then one over after that is a vacant lot, the home having been demolished years ago.</p>
<p>Almost all Bywater houses touch or impinge on the sidewalk, European-style, and many of their owners decorate the public way with pots of common annuals, especially those lovely rocket pink snapdragons. Others set out repurposed bathtubs and various other containers filled with flowering perennial plants that I can&#39;t identify. It&#39;s a mighty colorful area -- when it isn&#39;t derelict.&#0160;</p>
<p>Somewhere on Royal Street (or was it Decatur?) between Desire and Independence, we admired the sidewalk garden of a renewed double-shotgun (a common kind of home) and fell into neighborly chat with the bright-eyed old lady sitting on its porch (or stoop, or veranda, or patio). We offered, &quot;good day for taking some sun,&quot; and she, perhaps lonely, launched into a monologue: &quot;my friend takes care of me. He&#39;s young. I broke my hip last year, so no more stairs.&quot; Etc. And then she asked, quite out of the blue, &quot;how old do you think I am?&quot; Clearly, she was proud to boast of her many years.</p>
<p>Now, I&#39;ve been around enough blocks to know that it&#39;s never a good idea to estimate someone&#39;s age. It&#39;s a difficult art -- you must guess about ten percent below what you think is accurate, because if you guess older you&#39;ve insulted the inquirer and if too much younger you&#39;re guilty of insincere flattery. So I hesitated, kept quiet. At last, to break the silence, I replied &quot;well, ma&#39;am, how old are you?&quot; I thought I had given a safe response because I could see that she wanted me to be curious. &quot;I&#39;m 84, can you believe it?&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>I was more surprised than she had imagined, because if I had ventured a guess, I would have said 92. Or at the lowest, way up in the 80s, because, well, the woman looked ancient and frail. She reminded me my two grandmothers, who died at 87 and 89 and who, in their last years, rarely if ever left their homes but if they did venture out, did nothing more adventurous than to sit on a bench for a few warm minutes.&#0160;</p>
<p>But I&#39;m 85, a year older than my new Bywater acquaintance. She&#39;s inactive, winding down her life, resting in a soft chair, and I&#39;m not only upright and walking, but happily exploring a distant city. For a moment I felt a bit of superiority, of triumph. I certainly did not say to my elderly friend, &quot;yeah, you&#39;re 84 but I&#39;m 85, look at me.&quot; I&#39;m not that crude. But I confess that those or similar words passed through my brain. Not a sentiment that I admire in myself and one I quickly banished. It was unhandsome, ungenerous even if it came and went in a millisecond.</p>
<p>I know that I&#39;m fortunate to be moderately vigorous, still strolling the avenues and enjoying good health. Yet I am very aware that my well being is not an achievement about which I can be vain or proud. It&#39;s simply the luck of the draw, luck of the genes. In addition, it&#39;s a fact that I have been fortunate enough to have had access to a lifetime of superior medical care. Without that surgery in 2010, and the later one a decade ago, I would not have been touring the Bywater. I&#39;d have been dead or at best, wheelchair-bound and in pain, gorging on advils and aspirins and narcotics. A moment&#39;s reflection served as a good antidote to any feeling of superiority that I might harbor.&#0160;</p>
<p>Still musing, I began to wonder about my Royal Street friend. Who is she, aside from an ancient person savoring the sun?&#0160; What memories does she hold? Who knows, perhaps she lived a wild and varied life. Was she a traveller, an adventurer?&#0160; Enjoying complicated and deep relationships with a series of devotees?&#0160; Perhaps she was a talented musician -- a soloist in the church choir -- or an artist?&#0160; I allowed myself to fantasize what she was like in her glamorous thirties -- crossing the equator on a cruise with her first husband, the one with the estate in Jamaica. And the children: one a famous surgeon, the other, the unlucky one who was a hero in Iraq but who took years to regain his footing. Or was she, perhaps, a writer?</p>
<p>Everybody has a story; what is hers?&#0160;&#0160;</p>

                                <p>This will be a very short entry, because gambling is not a part of my life. I&#39;m not averse, just uninterested. My brain lacks a gambling gene.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t bet on sports; I don&#39;t participate in office pools; I&#39;ve never once been to the track. I don&#39;t bet on cards because I don&#39;t play cards, not even solitaire. I&#39;ve never put so much as a nickel into a slot machine. I&#39;ve never bought a single lottery ticket.&#0160;</p>
<p>My idea of gambling is to put a dollar into a Coke machine -- sometimes you get the Coke, sometimes the machine fails. That&#39;s chance enough for me.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>The first:&#0160; I dreamt that I received a phone call from my deceased older brother&#39;s deceased first wife (who has, by the way, been dead for thirty or more years). She says, very clearly, &quot;______ is dead&quot; (I leave out the name of the person she mentioned because some people are squeamish or superstitious -- but a person very much alive. I&#39;m shocked. I say, &quot;what happened.&quot;&#0160; There&#39;s no answer at the other end although I hear the sounds of paper rustling. I ask again and once more there is&#0160; no response. Then I say, &quot;did he do himself in.&quot; There is quiet at the other end of the line. End of dream. I take the non-answer as agreement -- yes, it was suicide&#0160; After a while, I wake up, less troubled than puzzled. How peculiar -- how different from my usual &quot;lost-in-the big-city&quot; or &quot;can&#39;t-find-the-classroom&quot; fantasy.</p>
<p>Later in the night, I dream that it&#39;s time for me to write a novel (remarkable in itself because I am a most unimaginative, uncreative person and not a writer of fiction). In the dream, I compose the first paragraph of a novel. I can&#39;t remember my exact words, but basically I set the scene in an old, tired, tumble-down country tavern where a couple of nondescript folks are sitting and drinking. It&#39;s all very fuscous, grey, washed out. (In retrospect, it seems as though I&#39;ve plagiarized Thomas Hardy.)&#0160; But I complete the paragraph with this remarkable sentence: &quot;A brindle cat supplied the color.&quot; A wonderful detail, even if I do say so myself. But here&#39;s an oddity. Even though my well-informed dreamatorium found and deployed the word &quot;brindle,&quot; my conscious self is not familiar with the word. What a revelation!!</p>
<p>I wake out of the dream and, immensely curious, immediately google the word &quot;brindle&quot; which turns out to mean something like tortoiseshell -- a standard very familiar domestic cat color. My daytime self is therefore dazzled by the pertinent vocabulary of my nighttime self.</p>
<p>I am also impressed by the use of the word &quot;supply&quot; -- a brindle cat<em> supplied</em> the color&quot; --where my more pedestrian daytime self might have said, &quot;there was a brindle cat.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>Once again, I find that although I&#39;m a moderately dull kind of guy during the day, my unconscious or dream life is imaginative and daring. How can this happen?</p>
<p>Moreover, I wonder what would my life have been like if I had been granted easy access to the creative side of my brain? Is it possible that I would have written many a sentence as accomplished as &quot;a brindle cat supplied the color.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>[Addendum April 24&#0160;</p>
<p>Just a few minutes ago I woke out of the usual troubled sleep.&#0160; I must have been dreaming, but I can&#39;t recall a single detail except that the name &quot;Karlheinz Stockhausen&quot; came vividly to me. I even said the name out loud (there&#39;s a witness). But why in the living blazes would Karlheinz Stockhausen be in my mind, or unconscious mind, or dream life?&#0160; I am aware that KS was a composer of electronic music; that is to say, I&#39;ve heard his name. But I&#39;m not interested in electronic music and as far as I know I&#39;ve never heard a single note of any of his compositions. He&#39;s not a figure to whom I&#39;ve given a moment of conscious thought. And yet there he was in my mind and in my mouth. Without the slightest inkling of context.&#0160;</p>
<p>Minds (especially my very own) are mighty mysterious.]&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>If there can be a &quot;state of the union&quot; address, and in Colorado a &quot;state of the state,&quot; why should we not have a &quot;state of the person&quot; -- specifically, the state of this person, i.e. me. An annual report. Today seems like a good day for it -- inasmuch as I have just now passed a weighty milestone, my 85th birthday.&#0160;</p>
<p>On the whole, let me say, without bragging, that this particular person is in a surprisingly good state.</p>
<p>My Brain: it&#39;s still working. I believe that I am as competent as ever at analyzing problems and drawing conclusions and planning appropriate actions. Nor have I lost a significant amount of language. There is even an occasional moment in which I wow myself with a well chosen word or a smidgeon of wit. That&#39;s the good news. The downside is that my recall system has definitely lost ground. Noun loss, it&#39;s called. My memory for names has woefully declined, so much so that it&#39;s become a considerable annoyance. I can recognize an acquaintance on the street, or, say, actors in a film, or an athlete, but I cannot bring up a name. I test myself when I watch NBA basketball on the TV.&#0160; A familiar player appears on my screen: I know where he went to college and who he played for last season and the strengths and weaknesses of his game, but by golly I can&#39;t recall his name. I find this to be highly frustrating -- and perhaps a scary harbinger of future debility. Sometimes the moniker bobs to the surface a day later, making me aware that my storage system is still working. No question but that my celebrated, prize-winning instant recall is a thing of the past. Also starting to fail: short-term memory. Nowadays, when I read a long novel, by the time I come to the conclusion I&#39;ve forgotten details from the first chapters. A couple of times now, when I&#39;ve read a good new novel or a classic old one, I&#39;ve turned right around and gone through a second time. Trust me, this was not a habit of my younger brain. I also find it difficult to acquire and retain new knowledge. I spent four years studying Italian and made no more than a year&#39;s progress. I had to complete the same lessons over and over again just to make it stick -- only to have the expression or the conjugation or whatever evaporate in a month. I can&#39;t memorize poetry -- which I once did so effortlessly. So I&#39;ve mostly given up new areas of information -- although this last month I&#39;m taking a crack at learning Etruscan -- a challenge even though it&#39;s an extinct language with only about 250 known words. No struggles with pronunciation, thank goodness!&#0160;</p>
<p>My mood: generally positive and cheerful, except between 2 am and 4 am, when I lie awake filled with real and imaginary dread. I experience sadness, of course, but not depression. No need for anti-depressants or anti-psychotics, thank goodness.v I&#39;m optimistic, on the whole, still taking pleasure in small things,</p>
<p>My Body: still functioning although some routine tasks have become difficult. Putting on socks and shoes, for example. I&#39;m just not limber -- not even as limber as I was at 75. When things fall to the floor in the morning I tend to let them lie until later in the day when I&#39;m slightly more supple. When I work in the garden, I keep a long stick next to me so I have something to help me arise. Sometimes I feel myself starting to shuffle, the way my father did in his last years -- and then I make a determined effort to lift my feet. I have almost all of my own teeth (a couple of fakes) and with the help of specs and hearing aids my eyes and ears are valiantly continuing to do the job.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>Your older body has accumulated some deficits: a touch of cancer, four kinds of heart peculiarities, the threat of another TIA or UTI. But I do as I&#39;m told and take the pills that my various doctors recommend. I asked the fine serious woman who serves as my cardiologist, &quot;what is going to kill me?&quot; She replied that at my age, and given my state of health, the most likely causes were a) a fall, and b) an infection. Consequently I&#39;ve become mighty careful about where I set my feet. I don&#39;t know what to do about infections except to be vigilant. But it would be foolish not to recognize that at this age life is precarious and that anything can happen at any time. I could keel over before I finish the next sentence. One undeniable symptom of deterioration is that my stamina is much diminished. Much more resting between tasks, many more naps.</p>
<p>The hardest part of the day continues to be the nighttime. I&#39;ve aways been a bad sleeper and I&#39;m no better now. Lying awake can lead to alarmism: is that pain in my knee a bruise or is it a blood clot that will go to my heart, or is it a symptom of a metastatic cancer?&#0160; But alarmism is not as troubling now as it was in days of yore -- no matter what happens now, they can&#39;t take the first 85 years from me. Frankly, I&#39;m more worried about living too long than I am about dying.</p>
<p>I&#39;m always been troubled with nightmares and continue to be so. I envy those who turn out the light at 11 and wake up at 7. It would be blissful to be one of those elect. On most nights, instead of sleeping I roll and twirl like a rotisserie chicken. It&#39;s wonderful that the Widder Malkinson is able to ignore my tossing and turning.</p>
<p>Family: I&#39;m most pleased about my family and family relations. Although I was not a perfect father, I was a hard-working and serious one, and I think that my children would acknowledge such. I love all three of my children more than they can know -- or at least, more than they could know until they had children of their own. I like all my kids and grandkids and on the whole they like me. I believe that I grew closer to my kids during the years of A&#39;s long decline. I have good conversations, or at least polite ones, with the older grandchildren but the three younger ones treat me with no more interest or respect than if I were an orange cone -- which is probably appropriate for their age; I certainly did not engage with my grandparents or people of their generation when I was 9 or 11. I hope to live until the the young guys are in their twenties when they might find it consequential to talk with their aged GP.&#0160;</p>
<p>I&#39;ve made an effort to keep in touch with cousins -- especially cousins on my father&#39;s side. After all, I am by far the oldest member of my extended family -- the &quot;patriarch,&quot; I like to say.&#0160;</p>
<p>Love: here&#39;s a great success story. My relationship with the Widder has been near-miraculous -- a ten-year honeymoon, although it may seem soppy to says so. Of course in some ways it&#39;s easier to form a relationship at this age of little responsibility -- no conflict over children, no careers, no declining parents, no money worries, very few obligations. Both Lynn and I appreciate this much simpler life. Her and my offspring have been generous with us -- a boon that we do not take for granted. Moreover, it&#39;s common knowledge that people in a loving situation live longer than singletons -- so we&#39;re both, in theory, keeping each other alive.</p>
<p>Friends: very important to me at this stage of life. I work at keeping in touch. But every month, it seems, some 50-year friendship comes to an end. The death and diseases of my friends and family and former colleagues are the most painful feature of this octogenarian life.</p>
<p>Intellectual life: I read a lot and write a bit, but I no longer read books about books. I like writing this blog. At this point in my life, I read at least 9 non-fiction books for every novel. In addition, I&#39;ve become fascinated by the films of the 40s and 50s and watch as many as two or three a week. There&#39;s something reassuring about the black-and-white cinematography, the ubiquitous fedoras, the coast-to-coast trains, and even the ever-present curl of cigarette smoke.&#0160;</p>
<p>The world: quite a mess. A period of great reaction. There&#39;s a real danger of losing our democracy. And losing our planet. But I&#39;m cheered that there are so many people of good will in the world and in my life.</p>
<p>When I was a young fellow peering at the calendar, I thought &quot;the year 2000 is a long way off. If I should live to the new millennium, I&#39;ll be 61 years old and I&#39;ll have lived a long life.&quot;&#0160; Now I&#39;m a quarter century beyond that marker, still going strong. Who ever would have guessed?&#0160; My principal emotion at this point: gratitude. Gosh I&#39;ve been fortunate.</p>

                                <p>&quot;Joint&quot; is a word that in the course of my lifetime has engaged in some serious shape-shifting. When I first encountered the word, joint (derived from the Latin<em> jungere</em>, to join) was simply a place where two pieces of wood were glued together or where one&#39;s bones were articulated to produce a wrist, elbow, or knee. Mighty simple and uncomplicated, it would appear -- but even then &quot;joint&quot; had begun to accumulate variants. Rick Blaine&#39;s sentence in <em>Casablanca</em> was an early warning: &quot;of all the gin j<em>oints</em> in all the towns in the world, she has to come into mine.&quot; A &quot;joint&quot; was apparently a nightclub or bar. &quot;Gin joint&quot; suggests that&#0160; &quot;Rick&#39;s Cafe Americain&quot; was louche or sleazy, and perhaps it was, what with all the crooked gambling going on and with the mysterious &quot;letters of transit&quot; stuffed into Sam&#39;s piano. But why &quot;joint&quot;?&#0160; It seems fanciful to suppose that a joint was a place where various people &quot;joined&quot; together, but I can&#39;t think of a more persuasive etymology.&#0160; &#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Another use of joint came to my attention in the late 1960&#39;s when I became seriously interested in Jacobean oak furniture. Here&#39;s a handsome &quot;joint stool&quot;:&#0160; &#0160;</p>

<p>A joint stool was the most ordinary kind of chair during the period when Shakespeare was wielding his quill. Why &quot;joint&quot;?&#0160; Apparently because it was a <em>joined</em> stool, and therefore of higher quality than one that was merely glued. A joiner was a skilled craftsman before mass-produced nails and screws became inexpensive and commonplace.</p>
<p>Shakespeare knew joint stools very well: &quot;Cry you mercy, I took you for a <span class="keyword1">joint</span>-stool,&quot; says the Fool to a joint stool. Fool humors mad hallucinating Lear by pretending that the joint stool is the king&#39;s daughter Goneril. Shakespeare, by the by, played many a variation on &quot;joint,&quot; employing or inventing&#0160; such terms as &quot;joint-servant,&quot; &quot;joint-laborer,&quot; &quot;joint-ring,&quot; &quot;jointress,&quot; &quot;unjointed,&quot; &quot;injointed,&quot; &quot;short-jointed,&quot; &quot;conjointly,&quot; and &quot;disjoint.&quot;</p>
<p>But even Shakespeare would not have imagined the transfigurations of the word in these our latter days. Nowadays, a joint is a prison, though I don&#39;t know why one would call it so when such colorful appellations as &quot;hoosegow,&quot; &quot;clink,&quot; &quot;stir,&quot; &quot;slammer,&quot; and &quot;pokey&quot; are all on the tips of our collective tongues. Nor would he have imagined &quot;joint&quot; as a marijuana blunt or spliff. He wouldn&#39;t have known but might have appreciated &quot;joint&quot; as a term for the male sexual organ.</p>
<p>All of which makes it possible, theoretically, to say, &quot;I was in a joint, smoking a joint, figuring out how to exercise my joint.&quot;</p>
<p>As for me, I use the word &quot;joint&quot; everyday -- in the most useful phrase &quot;joint card.&quot;</p>
