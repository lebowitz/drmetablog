		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>My father, who was born in 1904, was a basketball enthusiast when the game was in its infancy. He played guard on Eastern District High School&#39;s team and later played as a freshman at CCNY under legendary coach Nat Holman. But Dad came from an impoverished family and left college after one year because, he told me once, &quot;I couldn&#39;t see how I could stay in school when my family needed so much.&quot; So while his formal education went by the wayside, he was able to make up the difference by a lifetime of reading. And although he was not a complaining sort, it was clear to me and I think to my brothers that he felt a bit grieved that his formal athletic career had been cut so short. He kept at it, though, on his own. Well into his forties, he was absent from family dinner one night a week. &quot;Wednesdays,&quot; my mother explained, long before I could understand what the words meant, &quot;your father goes to the gym.&quot; And Saturday mornings, in warm weather, were reserved for tennis. Dad very much wanted his three sons to carry on his athletic tradition, but I think, in retrospect, that in the long run we all disappointed him. Both my brothers were fine athletes although not big or fast enough for professional careers; I was, alack and alas, a disappointment. Dad, who had also been a semi-pro catcher in baseball, taught Gene and Jon how to throw an &quot;inshoot&quot; and an &quot;outshoot,&quot; but he could not bring himself to coach me because it was obvious that with my 55 mile an hour fastball and scattershot arm, I wasn&#39;t going anywhere, pitching-wise, and although he showed me a couple of basketball moves he was, I recognize, a bit embarrassed by my want of athletic skill. (In my defense I must report that although I was more academic than athletic, I was voted &quot;class athlete&quot; by my P. S. 217 (8-5) eighth grade class -- a group which must have been, now that I think of it, quite a collection of klutzes). My older brother was a good enough basketball player to play for his college team for a year, and my younger brother was an outstanding sandlot all-star in baseball who once struck out Joe Torre, who, it will be remembered, finished his major league career with a .300 lifetime average. (The second time he pitched to Torre, my brother says, the future MVP hit a ball that &quot;is still circling the earth.&quot;) I myself had the briefest career on the diamond. The pinnacle of my experience was that, once, playing second base, I turned a double play -- took the toss from the shortstop, stepped on the bag, gracefully wheeled, and pegged the ball perfectly to the first baseman. It happened once and once only, but it was glorious -- definitely a Hall of Fame moment. The peak of my basketball career occurred in the slippery court (which doubled as a dance floor) in the basement of the Flatbush Jewish Center on Coney Island Avenue and Avenue J. I was, I estimate, thirteen years old. Wearing number 3, in black and gold, I was steaming down the left side of the court on a fast break and was forced away from the basket, so instead of a layup I managed a sweeping running left-handed hook which caught nothing but net. There was modest applause. None of my teammates guessed that I had intended to bank the ball off the backboard and that it had slipped out of my hand and swished, entirely by accident. I only reveal this deep secret now, very now.&#0160; Another high point in my career: I once won a local foul shooting contest. I hit 23 of 25. One small caveat, though. The contest was conducted in the P.S. 217 schoolyard, where the baskets were, how shall I say this correctly, unsteady and soft. As a result, they were like sewers -- everything flushed. I doubt that I would have made 23 on a standard rigid rim. Nevertheless, I did win the medal and the other competitors all used the same ball and basket as I -- so, therefore, a modest triumph. And then playing basketball faded into the background, because I didn&#39;t get my growth until very late and for a while I was playing at 4&#39; 11&quot; or 5&#39; 1&quot; against hairy guys who had already reached their full mature height. But I continued to pursue my undistinguished career -- including the most competitive activity of my life -- three on three half court in the EHHS gym, one basket wins, and &quot;winners out.&quot; And then a little intramural in Ithaca; an occasional pickup game in Cambridge. Oh, and twenty years later on, I played a bit with my own offspring, all three of whom were more athletic than I. My last pathetic hurrah (almost a decade ago, now) was being obliterated at h-o-r-s-e by my granddaughter Ella.&#0160;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I retained my interest in the sport. No longer a participant, I became a serious spectator. I know enough about roundball to appreciate both player and play. For thirty years or so, I had a good seat at the home games of the CU Buffaloes -- it was high quality college basketball (although the Buffs rarely enjoyed a winning season). One source of interest and fun for me was to evaluate the talent and try to predict which of our guys (or the visitors&#39;) had the skill and size to move up to the next level. Over the years, I followed the early days of many a later NBA regular -- and even a couple of stars. I remember in particular Jay Humphries, who played four excellent seasons for CU and then averaged in double figures during an extended NBA career. Also local lad Chauncey Billups, &quot;Mr Big Shot&quot; himself. Andre Roberson, a terrific defender and rebounder who never lived up to his potential because he just couldn&#39;t master the corner three; Matt Bullard, a fine outside shooter; Scott Wedman; Alec Burks; Derrick White (still playing for Boston and getting better each year); and Spencer Dinwiddie, whom I didn&#39;t judge to be an NBA player but who has become a steady professional. The high point of my CU spectatorial career occurred in 2006 when the Texas Longhorns brought to our stadium a gangly teen-ager named Kevin Durant. One didn&#39;t have to be a sophisticated evaluator of talent to recognize that KD had a spectacular career ahead of him; it was grandly obvious. It took him only two years to lead the NBA in scoring. I stopped attending CU games when the athletic department, an independent entity with only a loose connection to the University, demanded that I make a donation of $400 for the privilege of purchasing season tickets. I resented the presumption, and I felt that there were many causes more worthy of my limited philanthropy than CU basketball. Although I stay away from our local Events Center, I&#39;m still an occasional arena visitor. In fact, just last season, LERM and I bought incredibly expensive tickets to watch the Cavaliers take on the Pelicans at the Smoothie King Arena in New Orleans. The venue was up-to-date but way too brightly lit, and crowded, and noisy. Moreover, I dislike the theory that attendees must be continually entertained and placated with garish novelties. I don&#39;t go to basketball games for the half-time acrobats or the animal acts or the costumed dancers or the &quot;kiss-cam&quot; or the ear-popping &quot;music&quot; nor to be commanded when to cheer or when to chant &quot;DE-FENSE.&quot; I go to watch and admire the players. Despite the distractions it was a good game, even though Zion Williamson was out with an ankle injury. These pros, even the unheralded ones, are fabulous athletes and they are especially impressive in person.&#0160;</p>
<p>So for most of my life it&#39;s been the electronic medium that has kept me abreast of the game. It all started with radio; I suspect that very few readers of this entry will be able to recall the fast-paced narration of Marty Glickman on WHN, but he was, let me tell you, a hoops artist who could bring the Knicks alive with voice alone. Then came television, sometime around the early 1950s. The thirteen inch black-and-white Dumont that my father acquired displayed an image that seemed miraculous at the time but paleolithically primitive compared to the 60&quot; HDTV that entrances me nowadays. It&#39;s all present -- right there before my astonished eyes. Incredible no-look passes and sensational blocks and three-pointers from downtown -- and also horrid tattoos -- in brilliant color. In my TV-basketball saturated brain is stored the entire history of the NBA from then until now. In the 50s, Max Zaslofsky, Harry Gallatin, Sweetwater Clifton, Carl Braun, the McGuire brothers Dick and Al, and Ernie Vandeweghe, who played only home games because he was a full-time medical student. A team that was good but always managed to lose to the Celtics -- who had Cousy and Sharman and later Bill Russell, the Jones boys (Sam and KC), Havlicek and Heinsohn. I was in those years a most loyal and enthusiastic fan of our own New York Knickerbockers -- the championship teams composed of Willis Reed, Dave DeBusschere, Bill Bradley, Earl Monroe, and Walt Frazier, names and faces as present in my memory as the more celebrated Dodger boys of summer. Then came the Magic-Bird era, LA &quot;showtime,&quot; Michael Jordan, Duncan-Ginobili-Parker-Popovich, and now LeBron James, who, although, he is certainly the most effective player in history, is less exciting to watch than his innovative contemporary, Steph Curry. During this last while, I&#39;ve become a devoted GSW fan; when they were at their best, a few years ago, they played an extraordinarily beautiful game. There were nights when they&#39;d score 30 baskets on 25 lovely assists. It&#39;s been a great ride that&#39;s now coming to an end, but there&#39;s another generation of players on the horizon and perhaps I&#39;ll be around long enough to enjoy them. After all, I&#39;ve been there for the entire history of the NBA. What developments I have seen! What was once a local, coterie sport has gone international, with many of the best players coming from overseas or south of the border. Where once all the players, save a few, were White and middle-class, now 75% to 80% are Black and inner-city, bringing with them a heck of a lot of skill and flash and dazzle. Lumbering awkward centers, with their slow roundhouse hook shots, have been superseded by astonishingly mobile 7-footers who can protect the rim but also drift outside to nail a three. Salaries, in the old days, were little more than nominal and now there are marginal players making millions off the bench. The athletes have become celebrities -- and their shoes have become almost as famous as they are, and more lucrative. Franchises, which once went for a song, are now worth billions.</p>
<p>When I&#39;m watching a game on a Sunday afternoon, I think about my father. I wish he could sit with me and discuss the progress of the sport. I&#39;d like to show him what has happened since he left us in 1985. He&#39;d like it that the players are bigger, faster, stronger, in better shape, and that the shooting is more accurate and the defenses more subtle and sophisticated. He&#39;d love the pick-and-roll and the pick-and-pop. He&#39;d appreciate the alley-oops and the accurate full court passes. I also know what he wouldn&#39;t like -- the overhasty three, the lenient interpretation of walking and palming, and the occasional showboating, Most of all, he&#39;d hate it that the NBA is now in cahoots with the gambling establishment. He would see it, as I do, as a major miscalculation -- as a scandal waiting to happen.&#0160;</p>
<p>Every once in a while, even at this advanced age, I dream that I&#39;m in the midst of a game, and I rise up and with an effortless flick of the right wrist launch a perfect 40-foot three that hardly even grazes the net. A childish fantasy, perhaps, but still very&#0160; satisfying.&#0160;&#0160;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Just about every NBA team now has a non-native 7-foot center on its roster. What&#39;s wrong with America -- can&#39;t we produce sequoia-size centers any more?&#0160; Except for Minneapolis-born Chet Holmgren, Oklahoma&#39;s incredible rookie, by jiminy they&#39;re all furriners. The last three MVPs, <em>mirabile dictu</em>, all big guys, originated elsewhere: Milwaukee&#39;s Giannis Antetokounmpo from Nigeria by way of Greece, Philadelphia&#39;s Joel Embiid from Yaounde, Cameroon, and Denver&#39;s <span lang="sr-Cyrl">Никола Јокић</span>, more familiar to us &#39;Mericans as Nikola Jokic, from Sombor, Serbia. In addition, there&#39;s also awkward but effective Jonas Valanciunas on the New Orleans Pelicans, from Lithuania; GSW&#39;s Dario Saric from Croatia; Rudy Gobert, now blocking shots for Minneapolis (sharing center duties with New Jersey&#39;s big Kat) from France; Kristaps Porzingis, playing for the Boston Celtics (an exceedling lanky guy who seems to think he&#39;s a 7&#39;3&quot; guard) from Latvia; Chicago&#39;s Nikola Vučević, from Montenegro; Jusuf Nurkić, of the Phoenix Suns, formerly one of the &quot;itch brothers&quot;, from Bosnia; Atlanta&#39;s Clint Capela, Swiss via Angola; Sacramento&#39;s Domantas Sabonis, who is a fine fine player but not as dominant as his father, Arvydas, from Lithuania&#0160; -- alongside his backup, Alex Len from Ukraine; the Clippers Ivaca Zubac, from Croatia; Houston&#39;s multi-talented Alperen Şengün, who leads the league in unusual diacritical marks, from Turkey; Portland&#39;s Deandre Ayton from the Bahamas; Pascal Siakam, playing for Toronto from Cameroon; Goga Bitadze from the other Georgia, playing for Orlando: and of course the latest teen sensation, France&#39;s Victor Wembanyama, from France. And I&#39;ve probably forgotten one or two others.</p>
<p>Seven foot tall American centers, where have you gone? Why and wherefore? Diet? Environmental deterioration? Genetics? Disinterest?</p>
<p>It&#39;s not just a passing moment. Veteran NBA fans will remember Rik Smidt, Yao Ming, Hakeem Olajuwon, Dikembe Mutombo, Dirk Nowitzki along with such off the beaten track performers as Romania&#39;s Georghe Muresan and Sudan&#39;s Manute Bol.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Now that&#0160;we&#39;ve at last come to the NBA playoffs and are heading toward another Warriors-Cavaliers showdown,&#0160;it&#39;s fitting that we reflect on basketball jargon, which is distinguished by its many colorful monosyllables: hoops, hops, bigs, stuff, slam, jam, slash, dish, board, glass, dunk, pick, screen, paint, lane, point, wing, trey, rim, post, trap, &quot;D&quot;, roll, box, press, tip, swish, bank, brick, feed, stroke, hole, &quot;J&quot;, rock, range.</p>
<p>But down-home slang is not basketball&#39;s only linguistic register.&#0160;</p>
<p>Curiously, roundball jargon exhibits&#0160;a contrary tendency toward polysyllabic words of Greek and Latin origin.&#0160;Some teams, for example, are said to be &quot;physical.&quot; &quot;Physical&quot; (from Gr. <em>physicos </em>= nature) means, in basketballese, simply &quot;rough&quot; and does not imply that the other team plays either an ethereal or spiritual game. It used to be that a guard played on the &quot;outside&quot; and a center on the &quot;inside&quot;; nowadays they&#39;ve become &quot;perimeter&quot; (Gr.) and &quot;interior&quot; (L.) players.&#0160;A fast break has become &quot;transition offense.&quot;&#0160;A player doesn&#39;t drive to the basket; he &quot;penetrates.&quot;&#0160;Players no longer jump; they &quot;elevate&quot;;&#0160;they don&#39;t block an opponent&#39;s shot, they &quot;reject&quot; it. In an odd linguistic development, a point guard no longer passes the ball;&#0160;he &quot;distributes&quot; (Latin<em>: distribuere</em>, to allot) it.&#0160;In its ordinary signification,&#0160;to &quot;distribute&quot; a basketball would be to cut it into pieces like a loaf of bread and give each teammate a slice, but not so in the language of basketball. Only a few years ago, it was still possible to &quot;switch&quot; from guarding one man in order to guard another; now players &quot;rotate.&quot; &quot;Rotate,&quot; derived from &quot;rota,&quot; the Latin word for wheel, properly means &quot;to turn on an axis, to spin.&quot; A defender who did not switch but rotated would pirouette, and pirouetting would not be an effective defensive strategy. (A better classical upgrade&#0160;for switch would be &quot;revolve.&quot;) Even sillier than rotate: &quot;rotate over&quot;&#0160;or &quot;rotate around&quot;-- a usage that evokes the grotesquerie of a big guy in a tutu pirouetting across the baseline -- a vision that is all the more picturesque now that traditional basketball shorts have been replaced by big ol&#39; floppy bloomers. Just last night I heard a TV announcer declare that a&#0160;seven-foot tall player had &quot;a lot of verticality.&quot; (I suppose that if he fell to the floor he would have lots of &quot;horizontality&quot;). Players&#0160;don&#39;t score; they &quot;convert,&quot; as in, &quot;they had a transition&#0160;opportunity&#0160; but failed to convert.&quot; They don&#39;t push an opponent out of the way;&#0160; no, no, no, -- they create space (Latin: <em>crea</em><em>nt spatium).&#0160;</em>Although I am not a&#0160;physicist, I suspect that space is something like matter, and can therefore neither be created nor destroyed. At least not created by power forwards, however potent&#0160;they may be.&#0160;How silly of me to object; neither the laws of physics nor the usual constraints of language are binding on <em>punditor basketballensis</em>. OK, game&#39;s on; let&#39;s see how well they play -- oops, sorry, how well they execute.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>

                                <p>If you listen to the announcers of the NBA games, basketball players defy the laws and logic of physics. They &quot;create space.&quot;</p>
<p>One of the greatest space-creators was Shaquille O. Others merely imitate his technique.&#0160;His most characteristic play was to&#0160;drive his massive left shoulder into the chest of the defender, knocking him backwards a couple of feet.&#0160;When he had gained a sufficient advantage and had room to maneuver, he would flip the ball (awkwardly) toward the basket.&#0160;HIs defender would as likely as not be charged with a foul while the&#0160;pre-Newtonian announcers would celebrate him for &#39;creating space.&#39;&#0160;And a beautiful game would be transformed into a brutal game.&#0160;</p>
<p>And why is LeBron James allowed to create space on his every drive to the basket?&#0160; He&#39;s gifted enough that he doesn&#39;t need the advantage; but nevertheless, he routinely pushes off with his off hand, often lodging his off-elbow in the chest of the hapless defender.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>I often watch LeBron create space on hdtv where I&#39;ve precorded the game.&#0160;I can therefore watch the same play again and again.&#0160;In doing so I stop time, or run time backwards.&#0160;He creates space, I stop time.</p>
<p>So two can play at defying Einstein.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>This blague&#39;s enthusiastic readers are well aware that <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2007/05/my_new_career.html">each year</a>&#0160;for the <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2008/06/my-new-career-.html">last two</a>, Dr. M. has made himself available for the NBA draft, but that not a single team has selected him, even the lowly, strife-ridden Knicks. It&#39;s incomprehensible, but true. Why are these GMs so unadventurous?&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>As a consequence of being overlooked, I&#39;m developing an entirely new marketing strategy this year. I&#39;m no longer going to sit at home waiting for the telephone to ring. Heck, no!&#0160; I&#39;m going to advertise my skills by competing in the dunking contest.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>I&#39;ve developed three imaginative new&#0160;dunks, any one of which could carry the day and get me the attention I require.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>The first is a variation of &quot;making change.&quot; I drive to the basket, leap into the air with a basketball in my left hand. With the right hand,&#0160;&#0160;I leave a quarter on the top of the backboard and take down the dime that&#39;s been previously placed there.With the left hand, I gracefully drop the ball through the net.&#0160;</p>
<p>My second dunk. I have a ball in each hand and put another one under my shirt. I spring, dunk both basketballs authoritatively and successively, then grab the third one and throw it high into the air. I land right under the backboard, and then, without pause, immediately spring into the air again and power that third one through just as it comes down into the cylinder.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>I&#39;ve perfected these two moves, which, I can say without bragging, are far more interesting than anything I saw in the contest last year. To be absolutely honest, so far I&#39;ve only done them with six-foot rim and with those mini-basketballs that they sometime distribute free during the second half timeouts. Not to worry -- I&#39;m working on it every day and in a couple of weeks I&#39;ll be ready for the standard rim and full-sized basketball. There&#39;s still plenty of time before All-Star Weekend.</p>
<p>My third dunk is even more extraordinary. I start at the far basket and do a series of back handsprings and back flips across the floor. Then, as I approach the target basket, I pick up a basketball between my ankles, and with one final back flip -- in which my feet are actually above the level of the rim -- I slam that sucker home. It&#39;s going to be something spectacular to watch, I guarantee, just a soon as I work out a few kinks in the execution.</p>

I can endure only so much garbage time at a single sitting. The high point, for me, was a comment by one of our home team announcers (I&#39;ll not reveal his name). Toronto has a reserve point guard named Willie Solomon, who acquired the nickname &quot;King Solomon&quot; when he played for Maccabi Tel Aviv in 2005. &quot;Must be a reference to the movie,&quot; suggested our announcer.&#0160;</p>
<p>I&#39;m guessing that he means <em>King Solomon&#39;s Mines.</em></p>
<p>Well, no one ever suggested that we consult TV announcers for knowledge of scripture.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>My friend Otis Jefferson Brown reminds me of the crushing sports-and-morals tragedy of our joint childhoods. It all took place in 1950/51, when I was a creeping like snail to sixth grade in P. S. 217 and Otis, a child of Bay Ridge, was trudging his shining morning face to P.S. 102. Our guys, our local heroes, the CCNY basketball team, won both of the major basketball tournaments, the NIT as well as the NCAA. The city -- New York City, especially Brooklyn&#0160; -- was electric with excitement. Headlines, victory parades, and demonstrations in all the neighborhoods.&#0160;</p>
<p>The twin wins -- it never had happened before and will never happen again -- were great events in the public sphere but of even greater moment in our 9th Street home.&#0160; Back in the 1920s, my father had attended CCNY for a year, but like so many of the sons of impoverished immigrants, had to drop out to help put potatoes and black radishes on the family table. While at City, he had played on the freshman basketball team. Would he have made the varsity? Who can tell? He was a strong man, a fine natural athlete, very graceful in his movements even into his 70s, and very serious about basketball.</p>
<p>His coach had been Nat Holman (one of the earliest stars of professional basketball), and Nat was still the City College coach twenty-five years later. So whenever CCNY played, everything in our family came to a halt, and we all gathered around the wooden Philco to listen as my father&#39;s team went down to the wire against Bradley or Kentucky or Toledo. My father, generally a restrained man, was as partisan and as jubilant as I ever knew him to be. Not only were the victories a fulfillment of his own hopes, but they were all achieved by a bunch of local players -- Jews and &quot;Negroes&quot; from the Bronx and Brooklyn who, in those days, would not have been welcome at most of the big basketball powers. Ed Roman and Ed Warner and Irvin Dambrot and Normie Mager and Floyd Lane were household names as familiar and as admired as those of Koufax and Campanella.&#0160;</p>
<p>It was the very next year that it all blew up in our faces. The CCNY players, or many of them, confessed to taking bribes from the gamblers and bookies and to shaving points and managing the spread. There were indictments, &quot;perp walks,&quot; headlines, indignant editorials. O the shame!</p>
<p>My father was devastated. Although in size he was just a scrappy guard, in person he was a tower of rectitude, and it was beyond his ken that our guys, even poor guys who desperately needed cash, would compromise their integrity and their futures for a few bucks.</p>
<p>My father turned the disgrace into a morality play. Every day, for years it seems in retrospect, I listened to still another passionate sermon about keeping to the straight and narrow. (Not that there was anyone in the world who would pay me to miss a shot; I could miss shots on my own. But I knew what he meant.)&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>I&#39;ve now read Charles Rosen&#39;s <em>Scandals of &#39;51, how the gamblers almost killed college basketball </em>[New York, 1971]). It&#39;s a shoddy, melodramatic, disheartening book, but it does help to put things in perspective. Rosen makes it clear that there was more than a little American nativist glee about taking CCNY and its upstart culture down a peg. It was sad to read that players from many other colleges were also indicted (I hadn&#39;t remembered), but discouraging to learn that their defenders were happy to extol heartland values and to scapegoat the corruption onto big city immigrant depravity. It was also sad to be reminded that the only basketball player who served hard time was Sherman White, the biggest, the best, and the blackest of all the athletes. Nor was it pleasant to discover that although there were apparently point-shavers at St. Johns, a Catholic college, DA Frank Hogan brought no indictments because the evidence against the Red Men was &quot;inadvertently&quot; destroyed.</p>
<p>The events were a blight on my basketball-loving childhood. And still a great sadness after all these years. But I must say that we, as a family, engineered a strong comeback. It was only a few years after the scandals that one of those 13&quot; black and white TVs with the rabbit ears made its first appearance in our home. And along with the Zenith came the NBA. I think that my father was on perpetual alert for signs of malfeasance, but our faith in the game and in humanity was restored by a new set of New York heroes: Harry Gallatin, Connie Simmons, Carl Braun, Dick McGuire, Bud Palmer, Vince Boryla, Sweetwater Clifton, Max Zaslofsky.&#0160; &#0160;</p>

                                <p>I never, ever, thought that the Denver Nuggets&#39; acquisition of Allen Iverson was a good idea. He has skill, he has speed, and he&#39;s the most resilient guy in the world. He can do everything on a basketball court except win games. These last four losses against San Antonio prove the point. It&#39;s not just that last night he was 6 for 22;&#0160; it&#39;s that when the Nuggets come down the floor, whether Iverson eventually shoots or not, he clings to the ball and dribbles around while the rest of the team stands and watches. Iverson turns his teammates into spectators. Last night, Carmelo had three points in the fourth quarter; he barely touched the ball.&#0160; Nene, who can score off almost everyone down in the post, might as well have sat for the last twelve minutes.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>Of course it&#39;s clear that the Nuggets can&#39;t advance in the playoffs until they find themselves a reliable three-point shooter.</p>
<p>It&#39;s just as obvious that Iverson isn&#39;t going to become a team player; he&#39;s 31 years old and he&#39;s averaged 23 shots a game with a .422 percentage for an entire career. He&#39;s not going to alter his game, but he&#39;s definitely going to deteriorate. I&#39;m afraid that we&#39;re stuck with him. Meanwhile, Philadelphia has done better with Andre Miller than with The Answer. In addition, we gave Philly two first-round draft picks to help them fill in their gaps. I like Philadelphia&#39;s chances;&#0160; I don&#39;t like ours.&#0160; &#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Our local basketball team is in the Big 12. We&#39;re far from the best team in the league, but the Big 12 is a major conference and as a consequence we have the opportunity to see some well-played, exciting games and also a goodly number of excellent young players. Great athletes appear regularly, mostly, I must confess, on opposing teams, but we&#39;ve sent a number of guys on to the NBA, including Scott Wedman, Jay Humphries and Chauncey Billups. Last week the U of Texas brought in a freshman named Kevin Durant. Remember the name -- he&#39;s going to cut quite a swathe in the NBA. I&#39;m a fan; I&#39;ve gone to almost every home game for twenty-five years or more. At its best, basketball is the most beautiful of team sports. But I have some serious bones to pick about the way the colleges play the game nowadays. Here are two of these many bones.&#0160;</p>
<p>a) Time outs.&#0160; Every four minutes there&#39;s a &quot;media timeout,&quot; so that the TV stations, if there are any, can intrude their commercials. Media timeouts have everything to do with money and nothing at all to do with the sport. Media timeouts interrupt the flow. Team A is on a roll; the coach of Team B doesn&#39;t have to use one of this allotted legal timeouts to change the dynamics of the situation -- he just waits for the scheduled pause. Four extra timeouts in a half, at a minimum of a minute and a half each, add twelve minutes to the length of the game. And because each coach can hoard his legal timeouts, he has them all available at crunch time, which means that the climax of the game is far too frequently interrupted and the final moments become more the coaches&#39; responsibility than the players&#39;.&#0160;</p>
<p>b)&#0160; Fouls.&#0160; Too many ticky-tack fouls are called. The result -- teams are regularly &quot;in the bonus&quot; nine or ten minutes into the half. And into the &quot;double bonus&quot; four or five minutes later. All fouls -- offensive fouls, fouls away from the ball, incidental contact -- become shooting fouls. The first ten minutes of each half often have a pleasing rhythm, a bit of pace, but the second ten minutes are always stop-and-go; rarely is there a full minute of uninterrupted action. Boring?&#0160; You bet. Contests routinely turn into prolonged exhibitions of foul-shooting. A gazelle of a game now hobbled and shackled.</p>
<p>Our own basketball stadium is at altitude -- a mile high, in fact. Our opponents are almost always flatlanders. We should have an advantage because we&#39;re better conditioned to play at 5280 feet. But because the games are so long and punctuated by so many timeouts and fouls, our advantage is lost. No twenty-year-old is going to run out of breath when a forty minute game takes two and a half hours to complete.</p>
<p>Solution: a) no more &quot;media timeouts.&quot; Oh yeah, I know, the teams need the money. Well, maybe there would be some revenue from increased attendance if the games were quicker and shorter and more exciting. b) better-trained and better-instructed referees. No bonus shots. No free throws except for fouls in the act of shooting. And teams should always be able to &quot;decline the penalty,&quot; as they do in football, and take the ball out of bounds. Then there would be no incentive to foul in order to stop the clock. Take back the game from the coaches and from the referees. Let the young men play.</p>
<p>Common sense changes, in my carefully considered view, which, if adopted, would make life richer and more satisfying and more aesthetic.&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Now that &quot;March madness&quot; is nearly upon us, it&#39;s appropriate to reflect on basketball jargon, which is distinguished by its many colorful monosyllables: hoops, hops, bigs, stuff, slam, jam, slash, dish, board, glass, dunk, pick, screen, paint, lane, point, wing, trey, rim, post, trap, &quot;D&quot;, roll, box, press, tip, swish, bank, brick, feed, stroke, hole, &quot;J&quot;, rock, range.&#0160;</p>
<p>But down-home slang is not basketball&#39;s only linguistic register. Curiously, there&#39;s a contrary tendency toward polysyllabic words of Greek and Latin origin. Some teams, for example, are said to be &quot;physical.&quot; &quot;Physical&quot; (from Gr. <em>physicos </em>= nature) means, in basketballese, &quot;rough&quot; and does not imply that the other team plays either an ethereal or spiritual game. Until recently, a guard played on the &quot;outside&quot; and the center on the &quot;inside&quot;; nowadays they&#39;ve become &quot;perimeter&quot; (Gr.) and &quot;interior&quot; (L.) players.&#0160; A fast break has become &quot;transition offense.&quot; A player doesn&#39;t drive to the basket; he &quot;penetrates.&quot;&#0160; Players no longer jump; they &quot;elevate&quot;; they don&#39;t block a shot, they &quot;reject&quot; it.</p>
<p>In an odd linguistic development, a point guard no longer passes the ball; he &quot;distributes&quot; (Latin<em>: distribuere</em>, to allot) it. In its ordinary meaning, to &quot;distribute&quot; a basketball would be to cut it into pieces like a loaf of bread and give each teammate a slice. Only a few years ago, it was still possible to &quot;switch&quot; from guarding one man in order to guard another; now players &quot;rotate.&quot;&#0160; &quot;Rotate,&quot; derived from the Latin word for wheel, means &quot;to turn on an axis, to spin.&quot;&#0160; A defender who did not switch but rotated would pirouette, and pirouetting is not an effective defensive strategy. (A better classical equivalent for switch would be &quot;revolve.&quot;)&#0160; Even sillier than rotate: &quot;rotate over&quot; or &quot;rotate around&quot;-- a usage that evokes the grotesquerie of a big guy in a tutu pirouetting across the baseline -- a vision that is all the more picturesque now that traditional basketball shorts have been replaced by big ol&#39; bloomers.</p>
<p><em>March 5</em>:&#0160; Last night I heard a TV announcer say that a seven-foot tall player had &quot;a lot of verticality.&quot; &#0160;If he fell to the floor, I suppose that he would have &quot;horizonality.&quot; <em>March 27:</em>&#0160;Also, &quot;convert&quot; for score, as in, &quot;they had a transition opportunity&#0160; but failed to convert.&quot;</p>
