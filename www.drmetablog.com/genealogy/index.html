		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I have just read Mary Antin&#39;s autobiography, <em>The Promised Lan</em><em>d, </em>first published in 1911. It is a book that I should have known much earlier in my life but only discovered a week or so ago. The larger part T<em>he Promised Land</em> is the familiar story of immigrant life in a new country -- the author&#39;s struggles to adapt to an unfamiliar culture, her achievements and triumphs, and her unabashed flag-waving patriotism. More strange and more informative, is the picture of life &quot;old country,&quot; as viewed through the eyes of a young woman.&#0160; Antin grew up in provincial, impoverished Polotzk, a small city now in Belarus, but which at various times has been administered and exploited by the ungentle hands of Varangians, Poles, Lithuanians, and Germans. During Antin&#39;s youth (she was born in 1881), Polotsk was a part of Russia. It was not a good time to be a Jew in Polotsk or indeed anywhere within the Pale of Settlement. (Her story is especially pertinent because I myself have a hunk of Belarusian-Jewish genes -- as do, therefore, my children and grandchildren.)&#0160;</p>
<p>Antin&#39;s life in that bleak part of the world was, I think, triply suppressed. In political freedom and standard of living, by the Russians; in domestic and personal relations, by oppressive Hasidism and the rabbis who enforced its demanding rules; and thirdly, because Antin had the misfortune to be born female. She had every reason to leave Polotsk behind.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>Antin recognized early that she was a &quot;prisoner&quot; because &quot;the Czar&quot; commanded Jews to stay within the Pale. She &quot;accepted ill usage from the Gentiles as one accepts the weather. The world was made in a certain way and I had to live in it.&quot; Polotsk was a place of constant ethnic strife fueled by dangerous superstitions. &quot;The Gentiles said that we had killed their god and that we used the blood of murdered Christian children in the Passover.&quot; The Jewish community of Polotsk was always under threat of violence -- &quot;the peasants would fill themselves with vodka, and set out to kill Jews. They attacked with knives and clubs and scythes and axes, killed them or tortured them, and burned their houses. This was called a pogrom.&quot; There was also the threat of the draft, where recruits served until the age of 41. (My maternal grandfather, Joseph (Usilewski) Green told me that he had been drafted into the Russian army for a twenty-year term; I now understand that he must have entered the army at age 21. In 1904 Grandpa, age 26, deserted and came to America. Good move.) Some men escaped the draft by paying crippling bribes to conscription officers. Taxation was onerous. &quot;Peace cost so much a year in Polotsk.&quot;</p>
<p>Antin also explains that as stifling as was the Czar, the rules of religion were harsher. &quot;Within the wall raised by the vigilance of the police, another wall, higher, thicker, more impenetrable was the religion of&#0160; the Jews.&quot; The rabbis favored piety (as they conceived it) to independence or freedom or prosperity and they enforced the most minute regulations and prohibitions of all actions day and night. Antin tells of a wife who found a blemish on the chicken she was preparing to cook. She consulted the rabbi who pronounced the chicken traif. That night, the family went hungry.</p>
<p>Polotsk seems to have had no dissenters or freethinkers, or at least none that Antin notes. I imagine that those who challenged orthodoxy either left of their own accord or were shunned.</p>
<p>Girls were offered little outside the family kitchen or nursery.&#0160; They were expected to marry young and produce many children, especially sons who could distinguish the family with their Torah studies. Schooling was discouraged for girls, who were taught to pronounce but not understand Hebrew.&#0160;</p>
<p>At its prime, Polotsk had 60,000 inhabitants, perhaps 60 per cent of whom were Jewish. There were twenty-three synagogues. Today there are no synagogues and no Jews.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef02b68533db17200d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Screen Shot 2023-04-18 at 8.54.24 AM" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef02b68533db17200d image-full img-responsive" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef02b68533db17200d-800wi" title="Screen Shot 2023-04-18 at 8.54.24 AM" /></a></p>
<p>This is a picture of my maternal grandparents, my mother&#39;s parents, Sonia and Joseph Green. I imagine that it was the work of a professional photographer. I guess that the image dates from when he was about thirty years old and she twenty-five -- so 1910 or thereabouts. I have no idea why the photograph has faded to blue-purple; it used to be ordinary black-and-white. I believe that the costumes that the formal young couple wear were hired for the occasion, as was the habit in those days; I doubt that their wallets would have permitted such fashionable dress.</p>
<p>They&#39;re a handsome young couple, are they not?&#0160; She very feminine, even delicate, prominently displaying her wedding ring; he sporting a slightly rakish mustache and a full head of youthful hair. When I knew him, forty years later, his hair was white and very sparse.</p>
<p>Sonia Chafetz and Joseph Usilewski arrived at Ellis Island in August of 1904, traveling steerage from Rotterdam. I&#39;ve written about my grandmother Sonia <a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2006/01/sonia_green.html" ping="/url?sa=i&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=0CDcQw7AJahcKEwigkaGR2rP-AhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQAw&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.drmetablog.com%2F2006%2F01%2Fsonia_green.html&amp;psig=AOvVaw3w6Cq0W74eRbbi5xok6_4j&amp;ust=1681916530074621" rel="noopener" tabindex="0" target="_blank">here.</a>&#0160;</p>
<p>I know very little about my grandfather, Joseph Usilewski, later Green. I was thirteen when he died, in 1952, from the last of his five heart attacks. Although my grandparents lived just around the corner on Coney Island Avenue, and I found myself in their presence very often, we had little to say to each other -- mostly because I spoke only English and his English was halting at best. We sometimes played 500 rummy and fan-tan, and I can remember him saying, &quot;Now I&#39;m in a predicament&quot; before discarding, but that&#39;s about the most intimate we became. He was aloof and unsmiling --not in any sense &quot;fun.&quot; But why should he be? His life had not been easy. He was from Minsk in present-day Belarus and was trained to be a pharmacist, but he had been drafted into the Russian army for the usual twenty-year term. His pay, he told me, was &quot;a ruble every other month, when we got it.&quot; So he did the sensible thing -- deserted and ran off to America with Sonia. The family story, which I heard from my mother, was that both Joseph and Sonia were engaged to other people when they met and eloped. My mother also said that when they arrived New York they had just one pair of shoes between them and that Sonia would wait at home until Joseph came home from work before she could leave the house. My mother also told me that when she herself was born (June 14, 1905), her father was not allowed to visit Sonia in the hospital because he could not prove that he was her husband (no ring, no papers). Whether my grandparents were ever legally married, I do not know; nor does it matter.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>My grandfather was a strict father; my mother said that he raised his children &quot;with the belt.&quot; There was a two-year period when he wouldn&#39;t speak to my then young-adult mother because he disapproved of her male friendships.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think his was a happy marriage; he was frequently absent and it has been supposed that there were &quot;other women&quot; in his life. Nor was he a great success in the new continent; he never found a home in the world of business although as far as I know he was always employed and never in debt. In his last years he worked as a messenger carrying papers and money from one downtown business to another. When I knew him, he and Sonia lived in a very modest two-room apartment (in a third-floor &quot;walkup&quot;).&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>I suppose I should mention that although born Jewish, neither Joseph nor Sonia practiced their religion. Neither of them ever attended a synagogue or even honored Rosh Hashanah or Pesach at home. Joseph was a socialist and an active member of the Workmen&#39;s Circle, in his day a mutual aid society for recent immigrants. I know nothing of his political commitments except that he had a deep loathing for the communist government of Russia. &quot;Worse than the czars.&quot;</p>
<p>Joseph had a brother, Nahum, and a sister whose name I have forgotten. Neither of his siblings had children.</p>
<p>If I had been more enterprising, I might have learned from Joseph and his family what life was like in White Russia in the nineteenth century. But I was too young, too self-centered. Too bad.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Ukraine has been invaded and whole cities have been obliterated by the Putin dictatorship. It&#39;s tragic. Once again, I&#39;m overwhelmingly grateful that my grandparents chose to pack up and leave the blighted Ukraine. It&#39;s a decision that has looked better and better with each passing year.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>My father&#39;s family came from a Ukrainian &quot;shtetl&quot; called Starokonstantinov, or Alt Konstantin (&quot;old Constantine&quot;). As a youth, I overheard but did not understand conversations in Yiddish about a place that my grandparents called (phonetically) Xusantine-gebernia, where the X stands for a non-English deep guttural fricative. Seventy years ago I paid little attention to my eastern European ancestry. Now I&#39;m fascinated.</p>
<p>Where is Starokonstantinov?&#0160; What is a &quot;shtetl?&quot;</p>
<p>I&#39;ve just read Yohanan Petrovsky-Shtern&#39;s new (2014) and highly pertinent history, <em>The Golden Age Shtetl (</em>an oxymoronic title if there ever was one). Y P-S defines a shtetl as &quot;an East European market town in private possession of a Polish magnate, inhabited mostly but not exclusively by Jews, and subject to Russian bureaucracy.&quot; Starokonstantinov, he claims, was a &quot;quintessential shtetl.&quot; &quot;My&quot; ancestral shtetl lies in the western part of Ukraine, about 50 miles south of a line drawn between Lviv and Kyiv. Nowadays, it has a population of about 30,000 souls.</p>
<p>I know that my grandfather&#39;s people lived in Starokonstantinov from the middle of the nineteenth century, but I have no idea when they first arrived -- it might have been years or centuries before. The town itself is not an ancient foundation. It enters history only in the late 16th century when a Polish noble named Konstanty Ostrogski built himself a castle (which still survives) and took ownership of the surrounding area. Starokonstantinov was a &quot;private town&quot; -- meaning that it was owned by the Ostrogski family for several hundred years. In its first years, Starokonstantinov was included in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In 1569 it became part of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. In 1793, and for many years, even after my ancestors had struck out for the new world, it was a possession of the Russian Empire. Now it&#39;s in the independent Ukraine, and hoping to remain so.</p>
<p>The history of Starokonstantinov is marked by a series of tragedies prior to the one now in progress. An early disaster was the Battle of Starokonstantinov in 1648, which was a key event in the Chmielnicki Massacres of 1648-49. Eastern rite Cossacks broke into the fortified town and killed all of its 130 Jewish families and as many Polish Roman Catholics as they could find. During the early part of the 18th century, the Haidamack massacre of Uman by Cossacks spilled over into other Ukrainian shtetls, including &quot;mine.&quot; And then beginning in 1881 came the series of pogroms -- anti-Jewish peasant riots provoked and tacitly supported by the Russian officialdom. In Starokonstantinov, there were 6611 Jews in 1847 and 9212 (61% of the total population) in 1897. (There would have been two more if my grandparents hadn&#39;t seen the light in 1895). During the Nazi occupation in 1942, virtually all the remaining Jewish population (6731 in 1939) was murdered. It&#39;s a troubled, tragic history.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not sure what it means to say that a town was wholly owned by Polish nobility. Did the Ostrogskis own all the land, or the land and some of the buildings? Did they administer the public works? The churches? Did they possess the surrounding farms?&#0160; Did they own, until they were freed in 1861, the serfs?&#0160; Most likely, each shtetl had its own particular form of ownership (the late medieval world was anything but standardized). Y P-S does not explain; perhaps he assumes it&#39;s common knowledge.</p>
<p>Starokonstantinov occasionally makes an appearance in <em>The Golden Age Shtetl</em>.</p>
<p>I had not realized how active my ancestors might have been in the vodka trade. &quot;In Starokonstantinov, the possession of Countess Rzewuska, about fifty [Jewish-owned] inns and taverns yielded 67 percent of the town revenues.&quot; (Query: how and when did the shtetl pass from the Ostrogskis to the Rzewuskis, who were a very prominent and wealthy Polish family)? As far as I can tell, the &quot;town revenues&quot; went directly into the hands of the Polish overlords. In 1827, &quot;Starokonstantinov Jews realized the that their efforts to prevent the draft of men for twenty to twenty five year terms in the Russian army [had failed], and the Jewish populace turned against their own kahal elders and attacked their houses.&quot; &quot;Local police had to summon an additional army unit to suppress the outburst.&quot; (The &quot;kahal&quot; was a committee of prominent Jewish citizens who were the nominal governors [under Polish supervision] of the Jewish population.) In the first half of the nineteenth century, the divorce rate among Jewish couples in Starokonstantinov, was 16 percent. In larger cities, it was even higher (in Letichev it was 47 percent). Y P-S attributes the surprisingly high rate of failed marriages to the relative freedom of Jewish women and to the breakdown of traditional constraints as the Jewish population became increasingly urbanized. A major fire in Starokonstantinov in 1835 hastened the shtetl&#39;s decline. Russian travelers found Starokonstantinov and especially its roads deplorable. &quot;A Russian army officer observed that Starokonstantinov is dirty beyond any measure: but &#39;if we bother ourselves to learn the reasons for this situation, we would perhaps find out that even the Jews, whom are usually blamed, have nothing to do with it.... To drive through the streets of the town is a real challenge, as there is no pavement. Stones once paving the road have long sunk into the soils. When it is raining, they do nothing but prevent movement.&#39;&quot; Mud season in Starokonstantinov must have been an annual challenge. Nevertheless, Starokonstantinovites were readers: a merchant estimated that in the shtetl there were &quot;about 20,000 books, mostly prayer books, bible and bible commentaries, tractates on the Talmud and the Kabbalah.&quot; Y P-S thinks that this number must be a great exaggeration. But it&#39;s on the record that a merchant named Pinhas Yosef Bromberg from Starokonstantinov brought twenty Hebrew books with him while traveling on business to St Petersburg.&#0160;</p>
<p>My great-grandfather was a participant in the commerce of Starokonstantinov. According to my father, he was a &quot;factor.&quot;&#0160; A &quot;faktor&quot; (Yiddish from German) was essentially a middleman. My ancestor had a horse and a wagon (perhaps, I allow myself to fantasize in a moment of self-aggrandizement, two horses and two wagons). According to tradition, he mostly dealt in grain, but factors such as he bought and sold whatever was available: wood, coal, ribbons, calico, mirrors, bolts and screws, vodka and wine. They did much of their business at fairs and Starokonstantinov was famous for its very prominent fair.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>When I was a boy in the 1940s and &#39;50s, I was -- yearly or semi-yearly -- hauled off to gatherings of the E &amp; L Chafetz Family Circle. &quot;Chafetz&quot; was the maiden name of my maternal grandmother, Sonia Green. &quot;E&quot; and &quot;L&quot; were Sonia&#39;s parents, but the names that the initials abbreviated are gone for good. At the Family Circle, twenty or thirty or sometimes even forty Chafetz siblings, cousins, and spouses would share snacks, schnapps, and gossip. No question but that, selfish and un-empathetic lad that I was, I very much resented being scrubbed and fancied up to attend these meetings -- especially on a summer Sunday afternoon when the Brooklyn Dodgers might be playing a double-header. Why would a young scamp want to miss out on Red Barber and Connie Desmond in order to hang from a subway strap for an hour and a half while the stifling IRT rattled to some obscure corner of the Bronx -- just to while away the afternoon with a bunch of old folks?</p>
<p>The Chafetz relatives were all immigrants from Belarus and thereabouts, born, like my grandparents, in the 1870s or 1880s. They were small people -- tiny really -- the men topping out at or 5&#39;3&quot; or&#0160; 5&#39;4&quot;, the women at 5&#39;0&quot; or somewhat less -- their stature a consequence of their impoverished &quot;old country&quot; childhoods. They spoke Yiddish or Russian to each other and very rudimentary English to me. They smelled peculiarly -- of chicken soup overlaid with moth balls, their &quot;good clothes&quot; having been retrieved from the storage closet for this annual adventure. They assembled, if I remember correctly, at the second-floor apartment over someone&#39;s store. (It seemed as though they were all keepers of small shops -- newspaper kiosks or vegetable markets or candy stores or perhaps a delicatessen or an &quot;appetizer.&quot; One enterprising Chafetz cousin was a glazier.) They seemed to be mostly childless -- or, at least I can&#39;t remember encountering any other youths at these events.</p>
<p>Who were these people? Why were they so asymmetrical? Bent and twisted, most of them, their faces marred by blackheads and lumps and swellings. Their mouths were dental nightmares. Must I admit that my ten-year-old self was repelled and disgusted, unconscious that their distorted bodies were a testament to their arduous troubled lives?</p>
<p>Who was Uncle Joe Pessin? How was he related to me? What was his livelihood? I remember only a small dark bald man with a grating voice. Did he have a family?&#0160; And who were indistinguishable Lifscha and Leah? Were they twins or sisters or sisters-in-law? Why did Uncle Usher smell so pungently? Was he in the pickle or sauerkraut business? I know only that he had a great expanse of face and outsized shoulders and that he longed to visit his brothers and sisters in Winnipeg.&#0160;</p>
<p>At these gatherings, I was put on display. My mother (my father refused to attend) would take me around the room and introduce me to the various cousins and uncles and aunts. It was a torment, frankly. &quot;This is your uncle Nahum.&quot; Uncle Nahum would shake my hand. I had nothing to say to him, but Uncle Nahum asked the question that was every uncle&#39;s question. &quot;How are you doing? You doing well in school?&quot;&#0160; &quot;Yes, I&#39;m doing well in school.&quot; And so this uncle would smile beneficently upon me. And then on to the next one.&#0160;</p>
<p>Because of what I perceived as their limited communication skills (though English might have been Uncle Nahum&#39;s fourth or fifth language), I definitely felt superior and condescending -- an acute embarrassment to me now. In my heart, I silently patronized these strange people.</p>
<p>What I didn&#39;t know, and is so obvious now, was that I was much more important to them than they were to me. That I was &quot;doing well in school&quot; were words that they dearly wanted to hear. It was for my generation and for me that they had braved the Cossacks, sold the farm, deserted from the Russian army, left backward Belarus or Ukraine behind, endured the miseries of steerage, slept four to a bed for years and half-acclimated themselves to a new world utterly foreign to them. For me. They had sacrificed themselves to invest in me. So that I could &quot;do well in school,&quot; go to college, live a better life. I was their emissary to America, to the future.</p>
<p>What could a ten-year-old have possibly known?&#0160; It&#39;s too late to regret that I didn&#39;t learn their language and learn their stories. That world of theirs, that universe represented by E and L Chafetz --- it&#39;s all gone now, vanished, present no where else but in my failing memory.&#0160;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>My father had many admirable traits. He was absolutely honest -- &quot;honest to a fault&quot; even. He had a fine sense of humor. He was compassionate and though he affected stoicism, he was deeply romantic and emotional -- tears came easy to him. He was a self-effacing but diligent worker. He was a fine, graceful athlete -- basketball, tennis, baseball (a catcher!) His social views were progressive. I never detected a jot or tittle of bigotry in his conversation (in fact, words that denigrated racial or religious groups were unknown in our home. When I heard words like &quot;goy&quot; on the street, I had to do some research to find out what was meant.) He was a thoughtful man, a wise man, a realist and not an ideologue. He was an affectionate father and husband. He never provoked a soul and had no enemies. He enjoyed his life.</p>
<p>I profited immensely from observing these excellent traits in action.</p>
<p>But perhaps because of his impoverished first-generation beginnings, he was never at ease in the world. Yes, he was comfortable at home and in his backyard garden and among his circle of friends, many of whom he had known from childhood. He was comfortable walking to the BMT at Newkirk Plaza, taking the subway to Court Street in downtown Brooklyn, and practicing his profession, where he was much respected. But he did not like to step out of his milieu. He couldn&#39;t fend for himself. Here&#39;s an extreme but telling example: one day, when I was ten or so years old, as we were walking home, probably from the schoolyard, he stopped in front of the local A &amp; P and said to me, &quot;Your mother wants a quart of milk; you go in and buy the milk. I&#39;ll wait outside.&quot; Which I did, of course; I was used to running such errands. My father couldn&#39;t go into a market without stress. He could buy a newspaper at a candy store or kiosk, and he could bring home a loaf of rye bread from Ebinger&#39;s bakery, but I never once saw him in a vegetable market or a fish store or a butcher shop. When my mother died in 1978, he had to hire people to shop for him. And someone to cook, because, as the saying goes, he couldn&#39;t boil water. Because of his discomfort when out of his routine, he was a classic stick-in-the-mud. He couldn&#39;t travel. He never learned to drive a car. In his relations with others, he was totally passive. He allowed my mother to organize his social life and after she died, he became completely isolated. He hated change. Once when I visited him late in his life, when he was in serious arthritic pain, he complained about the station to which his radio was tuned. It was one of those &quot;twenty-four hours of news&quot; stations that repeated itself every few minutes. I said, &quot;Why not change the station?&quot; He said, &quot;Aw, it&#39;s already set there.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>I tried very hard not to imitate these less-than-admirable habits.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>My mother, your great-grandmother, Lillian Green, was born in New York City, probably in Harlem, on June 9, 1905.</p>
<p>Her parents, Sonia Chafetz and Joseph Usilewski, were part of the great migration to America of Eastern European Jews. According to my mother, Sonia and Joseph were both engaged to other people when they eloped, he deserting from the Russian army. They arrived at Ellis Island mid-August of 1904 without a kopeck in their pockets and only one pair of shoes between them. I used to think that my mother had been conceived aboard the ship from Rotterdam, but the dates don&#39;t bear it out. Moreover, It&#39;s a melancholy fact that passengers in steerage were segregated by sex and kept apart.&#0160;</p>
<p>My mother was born Lilly Usilewski but when she entered public school, which is where she acquired English, she was enrolled as Lily Solawisky. When her younger brother was enrolled as Daniel Oslofsky, my grandfather Joseph realized that it was time to Americanize his name. The judge before whom he appeared was named Green, so Green he became. Lilly became Lillian when she married, my father insisting that &quot;Lilly&#39;s not a name.&quot; He and everyone called her &quot;Lil&quot; but she was always &quot;Lilly&quot; to her mother Sonia.</p>
<p>Lil&#39;s upbringing, I am afraid, was impoverished and harsh. I was told that her father raised her and her younger brothers Dan and Ellis (Bub) &quot;with the belt.&quot; Her mother Sonia was chronically ill from goiter and from the consequences of her five home-made abortions, so against her wishes Lil was taken out of school six weeks into high school to run the house and to raise her brothers, a sacrifice for which she received no appreciation either from them or from her father. For her, it was a disaster and a source of bitterness.. Her life from age thirteen to age twenty-six, when she married my father, Emanuel, is almost entirely blank to me. I know that she worked in the printing industry and was a skilled proofreader. She was not at all athletic or artistic but she was musical -- she played the piano and sang. At some point in early adulthood she started to take vacations at one of those camps for young Jewish adults in the Catskills. She sang in camp musicals and it was there that she met my father, a law clerk studying for the bar. My grandfather Joseph Green disapproved of her independence and refused to speak to her for two years -- a wound from which she was still suffering when I came to know her. Lil and Manny were married on June 19, 1930 and had four children:&#0160; Eugene (1935- 2006), Susan (1937-1938), Elihu (1939 -&#0160; &#0160; ), and Jonathan (1942 -&#0160; &#0160; ).</p>
<p>Her hard early life and the death of her daughter at the age of nine months, along with a chronic, agonizing stomach ulcer left her a troubled woman. She was what used to be called &quot;difficult&quot; -- acerbic, rude, insensitive, thoughtless. She once said to me, &quot;I was a good mother until you boys were six years old; after that, I couldn&#39;t cope.&quot; I think it was honest and insightful of her to say so. Yet my very earliest memories are pleasurable. She kept us warm and fed and loved; otherwise I don&#39;t know how my brothers and I would have been able to have lived satisfying lives. But I also know that I have no memories of touching her or being touched by her, although sometimes she would demand a quick peck on the cheek. She was not at all &quot;supportive&quot; -- &quot;assaultive&quot; would be a better term. There was no praise, only incomprehension or disdain.</p>
<p>I can&#39;t remember any particular words that she said to me, but here&#39;s a sample of her language. I remember that when my two or three month old firstborn suffered noisily from colic, she proposed to my wife, &quot;Maybe your milk is poisoning him&quot; &#0160;-- which not a sentiment likely to endear her to a struggling new mother.</p>
<p>It took me into adulthood to recognize that my mother&#39;s peculiarities were not villainy but the product of her emotionally impoverished early years and of her almost constant pain.&#0160;</p>
<p>After her children were grown, she resumed her piano playing and turned herself into a stalwart of the League of Women Voters. In 1960, during JFK&#39;s presidential campaign, she gathered fifty or sixty women and welcomed Eleanor Roosevelt herself to our home on East 9 Street. A most memorable and important contribution.</p>
<p>She did not mellow with age. Yet I would have to say, that all things considered, she did well.</p>
<p>Lil died at age 74 from the consequences of her then-incurable ulcer. In the hospital, dying, &quot;intubated&quot; and incapable of speech, she scribbled on a scrap of paper, &quot;I love you all,&quot;&#0160; and I know that she meant sincerely what had always been so difficult for her to express. I retain that piece of paper as a relic.&#0160;</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a picture of Lil at her best. Me and my mom, c. 1940.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a picture of your great grandmother, Anne Krull Goss (1912-2009) with her siblings.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef022ad3ad65eb200d-pi"><img alt="Akgsibs1" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef022ad3ad65eb200d img-responsive" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef022ad3ad65eb200d-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Akgsibs1" /></a><br />Anne is the pretty young blonde woman, second from the left. She&#39;s the oldest.</p>
<p>The picture was taken during the World War II years, &#39;42 or &#39;43. On great grandma&#39;s right is her brother Jack, whose tank was hit by cannon fire. He was the only survivor of his crew and spent many months recuperating in an army hospital. On her left is Hy, who was exempted from service, if I remember correctly, because his business was declared an essential industry. On Hy&#39;s left is your great-great aunt Frieda. Frieda&#39;s fiance (a soldier who was named Aubrey, but I don&#39;t know anything else about him) was killed in Europe. On Frieda&#39;s left is Mendy, the youngest, who was a bombardier on a B-24.</p>
<p>The war disrupted many lives, not only those who served but those who stayed at home. &#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been lucky -- too young for Korea and too old for Vietnam. I hope you are similarly lucky. &#0160;Better than that -- &#0160;I hope these endless wars in which we&#39;re engaged (in Afghanistan and Syria right now) come to an end.</p>
<p>Grandma Anne contributed 1/8 of your genetic inheritance. The people depicted here might seem to come from the remote past, but be aware that they&#39;re in you, part of you.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Dear T, O, E, L, L, C, A: &#0160;This is about your great-grandmother, Anne Goss. She was born Hannah Sarah Krull in 1912 in New Jersey, but I&#39;ve forgotten which city, although I know that as a young person she lived in Bayonne, Hackensack and Paterson. Her parents, David and Katherine Meltzer Krull, were recent immigrants from eastern Europe. She was the oldest of five siblings: Anne, Jacob (Jack), Hyman, Freda, and Max (Mendy). Her father installed metal ceilings, her mother was what was then called a &quot;practical&quot; (i.e. unlicensed) nurse. The family was not wealthy. The five children shared two beds, boys in one, girls in the other, sleeping crosswise. Anne had a bout of polio at sixteen months which left her with a permanent limp and weakness in the left side of her body. Because of the effects of the illness, she endured an unusually difficult childhood -- marked by a series of surgeries on her leg which may or may not have helped. But she was quick-witted and talented, learning to play violin and viola and graduating as high school valedictorian. About the Jewish religion, important to her parents, she told me, &quot;I gave up that stuff when I was thirteen.&quot; She was intent on a college education which her parents opposed because the few dollars that she made as a dental assistant were crucial to the family economy. She won a full scholarship to Barnard College but it&#39;s sad to report that when she arrived on the first day of classes she discovered that she had to pay for room and board, which her family could not afford. She returned home but was admitted to Montclair State Teacher&#39;s College where she majored in chemistry. In a world with more advantages he would have gone on to medical school and become a distinguished physician, but such a career was not in the cards. At Montclair she played string quartets and met your great grandfather, Daniel Goss. There wasn&#39;t enough money to allow them to marry and no one lived together before marriage in those days. Anne once told me that the greatest mistake of her life was that she didn&#39;t go to bed with Dan until after they married, which didn&#39;t happen until he was 26 and she was 24. I think those premarital depression years must &#0160;have been hard and unsatisfying. And even after they married, still not so good because Dan and Anne couldn&#39;t afford a place of their own but shared an apartment with his parents (actually shared a bedroom, with a curtain between the parents&#39; &#0160;bed and theirs). Dan&#39;s parents disapproved of Anne: &quot;Why would you want to marry a cripple?&quot; Eventually Dan was hired as a teacher of mathematics at Paterson High School and then in 1946 moved to Utica College in Utica, New York. Although Ann had been told that the polio made it impossible for her to carry a child, she gave birth to three daughters (Althea -- your grandmother --in 1939; Phyllis in 1942, and Paula in 1951). She taught mathematics until she retired at the then-mandatory age of 65 but continued with her tutoring business through her seventies. Meanwhile, she had mastered the domestic arts: cooking, baking, sewing (she made all her daughters&#39; &#0160;clothes through their childhoods) and knitting. She was a hard-working woman, often to be found knitting, reading a book, and watching TV at the same time. Dan died in 1966 and so she spent many more years as widow than as a wife. Her life was filled with pain (two dozen major surgeries) but she never complained. She was independent, frugal, and adventurous. She was also strict, cool, not at all affectionate, and humorless. Not exactly humorless -- she never laughed, that I can remember, but sometimes she would respond to a joke by saying, &quot;That&#39;s funny.&quot; &#0160;She played bridge to win and not for fun and she liked a rough game of Scrabble with her grandsons. She was easy to respect but difficult to love.</p>
<p>She moved to Boulder at age 87 and lived to be 97, though much impaired. At her 90th birthday party, in 2002, &#0160;she was still functioning well but &quot;looping.&quot; &#0160;If she had died at 90 she would not have missed much. She was demented and bedridden for the last few years of her life. The last coherent statement she made to me, in her last month, was &quot;I&#39;m not afraid of this dying business.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>A good memory: Anne spent most of her early life wearing a heavy metal brace on her bad leg. But when she was in her early 90s, she acquired a brace made of a light space-age material. I took her walking in the mountains. First time. She was thrilled.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s another: she liked to help grade Althea&#39;s math exams and she liked to talk calculus with her grandsons. I remember saying to them, &quot;You have to understand something. This is unusual. Your standard run-of-the-mill grandmother does not understand calculus.&quot;</p>

<p>Dear Asher, Caleb, Luke, Lola, Ella, Oliver, Talia:</p>
<p>These are pictures of your great-great-great-grandparents, Leib or Louis Hessel and Tsina Voloshen Hessel. They are the parents of Eta or Yetta Hessel, who married Isaiah Pearlman, your great-great grandfather, in StaryConstantine, Ukraine, sometime around 1895. I knew Eta, who died in 1962 when I was in my early &#39;twenties, although our conversations were limited because we did not share a common language. &#0160;According to my father, these pictures are copies of drawings executed by an itinerant Ukrainian artist. Drawn when? Perhaps 1870 or thereabouts.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know much about these people. I have no idea what they did for a living or how long they lived. I see some family resemblance in Leib&#39;s small black eyes and abbreviated eyebrows, but otherwise, not much. What sort of hat is he wearing? Is Tsina wearing the wig of the orthodox or is that her real hair?&#0160;</p>
<p>He looks mild. &#0160;She looks determined.</p>
<p>I know that my grandmother Eta had a number of siblings. In my father&#39;s handwriting, I have a document that hints of two of them: a brother, Morris Hessel, who married Mary Greenberg and had a son, Paul and a grandson Merel; &#0160;and then a sister Malka, who married one Joseph Cohen and had a son, Saris, who was a high school principal in New York, and had a son Peter Cohen, a physician based in Denver. I wonder why my father kept so aloof from his aunts and uncles and cousins? Was there a story? They were not at all a part of our life. No visits, no family celebrations, nothing.</p>
<p>I once met my father&#39;s &quot;Aunt Mary,&quot; who sold tickets at the Kent Theater on Coney Island Avenue. it must have been the only time I went to a movie with my father; he said, &quot;This is my Aunt Mary.&quot; &#0160;I was perhaps 8 years old, and uncurious. That&#39;s the end of the story. I wish I had more to tell you.&#0160;</p>

                                <p>Dear grandchildren:</p>
<p>I once asked my father, your great-grandfather Emanuel Pearlman, where in the Ukraine we originated. He said that he was told that it was a village called (and here he used a very deep guttural initial consonant) Xhosantin-gebernya &#0160;-- an answer that left me not much enlightened. If he knew more -- and I don&#39;t think he did -- he didn&#39;t say. Our family did not cultivate nostalgia for the old country. Nor much curiosity either. We had no reason to yearn.</p>
<p>But new information about our past has recently come to me. According to a correspondence between my late cousin Marion and a distant Israeli relative, it is now clear that our family hails from the the town of StaryConstantine -- also called Starokostiantiyniv in Ukrainian and Alt Konstantine in Yiddish. It was a small city of perhaps 30,000 people at its height, founded, as far as wikipedia and I can figure, in the sixteenth century by a noble or wealthy person named Konstanty Ostrogski who built himself a castle sometime during the 1560s. Castles are built for protection in lawless places, but then, most places were lawless in late medieval Europe. Old Constantine is in northern Ukraine at the junction of the Ikopot and Sluch rivers.

<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>But when, you ask, did your and my ancestors settle in Old Constantine? &#0160;I remember it mentioned when I was a child that our family came to the Ukraine from &quot;the west&quot;, which I assumed to be Germany because my grandmother Eta&#39;s maiden name was Hessel (though in fact Hessel is more commonly Danish rather than German). The Jewish community in Old Constantine dates to the sixteenth century, it is reported. &quot;The town’s Jews suffered Cossack onslaughts during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. At the end of the nineteenth century, more than half of the town’s population was Jewish.&quot; That&#39;s all we know.</p>
<p>However, in the nineteenth century, there lived in Old Constantine a husband and wife named Yaakov and Menucha Sheindl Perelman. They dwelt in a house on the corner of Ragnedinshkaya and Bolshaya Vasikovshaya streets (a house which was destroyed during the second world war). Yaakov Mikolshtein Perelman was born about 1830, lived a long life, and died in about 1920. According to the story, he resided in the one house his entire life. His wife, Menucha Sheindl came from Radomyshyl, a village not far from Old Constantine that was historically a center of Jewish settlement. (In 1797 a total of 1,424 people or 80% of the total population were Jewish). Menucha Sheindl Perelman was the daughter of a sugar and wool merchant named Solomon Rabinovich, who was so rich that &quot;they changed houses for Passover&quot; -- which is a custom heretofore unknown to me. Menucha died in 1908 at age 75 or thereabouts. The family, once wealthy, lost everything in the 1917 revolution and the disorder and purges that followed. &#0160;</p>
<p>And how are Yaakov and Menucha related to you, my grandchildren? &#0160;Well, they&#39;re your great-great-great grandparents. According to the newly discovered information, they had eighteen children &quot;mostly twins,&quot; of whom only nine survived to adulthood. Seven daughters were born before your great-great grandfather Isaiah (also called Buzya or Buzzy) saw the light. Isaiah it is reported, was born &quot;the year the serfs were freed,&quot; which is 1861, but I know that he was 83 when he died in 1946, so I calculate that he was born in 1863. But perhaps Isaiah didn&#39;t know his own age which wouldn&#39;t have been unusual in an era of bad record keeping. When he was thirty-five, Isaiah emigrated to America, arriving in 1896 or thereabouts.</p>
<p>Why did he set out for the New World? &#0160;Certainly the troubled conditions in Old Constantine were reason enough. But there&#39;s also something of a story. Isaiah married (I don&#39;t know whom) but after one night of marriage he asked for a divorce. I don&#39;t know if the divorce was granted, but I do know that very soon afterward he left town with Eta (or Yetta) Hessel, also from Old Constantine. She was 23 or 24, a decade or a dozen years younger than he.&#0160;</p>
<p>Why the one-day marriage? &#0160;No one knows what happened that night, but it couldn&#39;t have been good. A sexual impediment? &#0160;An arranged marriage gone bad? &#0160;Prior misdeeds come to light?&#0160; The discovery of pregnancy?&#0160; We&#39;re free to speculate, but never to know.&#0160;</p>
<p>However, we do know that Isaiah and his father did not see the world with the same eyes. Yaakov was religious; his son Isaiah was an atheist. We don&#39;t know Yaakov&#39;s politics, but we know that Isaiah was some sort of leftist or communist. Something of a free-thinker, after the style of Moses Mendelssohn. And perhaps Karl Marx. And we can also guess that it might have been impossible to remain in Old Constantine after the marriage contretemps.&#0160;</p>
<p>In New York City, Isaiah and Yetta had four children: Max, born around 1896, Solomon, born about 1898; Mollie, born in 1900; and my father Emanuel, the youngest, born on December 22, 1904.</p>
<p>My grandfather Isaiah also had two younger brothers. There was Chaim, who followed him to America some years later and from whose daughter Rose spring the Goldberg and Chodosh lines. And also Isaiah&#39;s youngest brother, who was named Meshulam Zusi Perelman. He did not follow his older brothers, and I don&#39;t know his history, but his family left the Ukraine and it&#39;s his Israeli granddaughter Nechama Sheindl Brukman (born Perlman) through whom these facts were recovered. Nechama Brukman died in 2008 at age 86.</p>
<p>It is most melancholy to read that in 1939 there were 6,743 Jews living in Old Constantine, accounting for 31 percent of the total population, and that the entire Jewish community, some no doubt our cousins, were murdered during the first years of the war.</p>

                                <p>What was it like in the 1940s when I was your age? &#0160;Very different. Milk was delivered daily in bottles: a milk-wagon, drawn by a tired, plodding old horse, appeared on East 9th Street three times a week before we sat down to breakfast. There were also daily visits from a horse-drawn vegetable truck. An itinerant knife-sharpener came once every couple of months. And also a very old man with a large sack thrown over his back, singing out in the loudest voice I&#39;ve ever heard, &#39;I cash clothes.&quot; There were squarish automobiles (Packards, DeSotos, Studebakers), but far fewer than today -- so few that kids would play punchball and stickball right in the middle of the street, just stepping to the side to let that occasional car whizz by. Kids also skated in the street, using clunky metal skates that attached to the shoe by turning a &quot;skate key.&quot; There was no television, but everyone listened to the radio. &quot;Portable&quot; radios were as big as bread boxes. Some people had refrigerators (much smaller than modern ones), but most had &quot;iceboxes.&quot; Every week, an ice delivery man would haul a block of ice (about a foot-and-a-half square if I remember correctly) with large tongs and set it in the icebox. Coal was delivered in barrels: men with heavy gloves would roll the barrels from the truck to the ground-level coal chute. All telephones were attached to the wall with wires. Long distance phone calls were expensive and only for emergencies. People did not communicate by e-mail or by texting, but by means of postcards and letters. A &quot;letter&quot; was a piece of paper on which whole paragraphs were written; it was inserted into an &quot;envelope&quot; and put in a &quot;mail box&quot; for delivery. Hard to believe, I know. There were no word processors. I learned to write using a &quot;straight pen.&quot; There were no dvd&#39;s or cd&#39;s or streaming. Instead, we had &quot;records,&quot; vinyl discs 12-inches in diameter which were placed on a rotating &quot;turntable&quot; on which rested a hand with a stylus, at first steel and then later diamond. It was primitive, I know, but it worked rather well. There were no credit cards. Some people had checking accounts, but 99% of commercial transactions were completed with &quot;money.&quot; When I started at P. S. 217, in 1944, I wore &quot;knickers&quot; (pants that went to just below the knee and were held in place with elastic) and long socks. You can sometimes see knickers in old illustrated books or in clothes museums. Men always wore hats: fedoras or derbies or panamas or bowlers or pork-pies, usually made of felt. Women wore hats too, some with veils, most of them godawful ugly. Young folks &quot;courted.&quot; In those days, before people became intimate, they would go through a period in which they would &quot;date&quot; and talk and get to know each other. This period could last for weeks or even months. Astonishing, I know, but trust me, it happened that way in the old days. &quot;The past is another country; they do things differently there.&quot;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p class="ecxMsoNormal">Althea Goss Pearlman, 76,&#0160;of Boulder, died February&#0160;10, 2016&#0160;at AltaVita&#0160;Memory Care Centre in&#0160;Longmont where she had resided for the last two and a half years.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal">&#0160;<br />Althea was born in Paterson, New Jersey in 1939 to Daniel Goss and Anne Krull Goss, both teachers of mathematics. She was raised in Utica, New York and graduated as valedictorian from Utica Free Academy in 1956. She held degrees in mathematics from Cornell University (where she was elected to Phi Beta Kappa) and Harvard University. She married Elihu Hessel Pearlman, whom she had met in a first-semester chemistry class, in June, 1960.</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal">&#0160;&#0160;<br />Althea had many interests but her life revolved around her two passions: teaching and family. Althea taught mathematics at Ithaca High School in Ithaca, New York, at Warren Junior High School and Newton South High School in Newton, Massachusetts, at the City College, CUNY, in New York City, at Platt Junior High School in Boulder and, for twenty years, at Boulder High School. In 1991-92, she was an Einstein Congressional Fellow in Washington, D.C, serving as an advisor to the House of Representatives on mathematics teaching. She also spent four years as a Clinical Professor in the School of Education at the University of Colorado, Boulder, where she acted as a mentor and coach to prospective teachers. For Althea, teaching was not a job or a profession, but a calling. She was an artist whose medium was chalk and blackboard. She accumulated a wall full of teaching awards, including, most notably, the Presidential Award for the Teaching of Science and Mathematics (1987), but was most gratified not by certificates but by appreciative letters from students whose lives she had influenced.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal"><br />Althea was an excellent and loving wife, mother, and grandmother. She is survived by her husband, with whom she enjoyed a deep, spirited, and ever-evolving love for more than half a century, by her children Nathaniel, Benjamin and Eve, by their spouses Connie Chang, Kyla Holcomb Pearlman, and Jonathan Soglin, by her seven grandchildren: Talia and Oliver Soglin of Alameda, California, Ella and Lola Pearlman-Chang of Washington DC, Luke, Caleb and Asher Pearlman of Boulder; and by her sister Paula Goss Gombas and husband Allen Gombas of Lyman, New Hampshire. Althea&#39;s sister Phyllis Goss Murray died in 1998.</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal">&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;<br />Althea&#39;s ashes will be buried in the family cemetery in West Bradford, Vermont.&#0160; A memorial event in her honor will take place in the auditorium of Casey Middle School, 1401 High Street, on Saturday, March 5, at 3:00 P. M.</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal">The family would&#0160;like to thank&#0160;the&#0160;skilled&#0160;and sympathetic caregivers at&#0160;AltaVita and at New Century Hospice who made Althea&#39;s last years as&#0160;comfortable&#0160;as possible.</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal">Should anyone wish&#0160;to make a gift&#0160;in Althea&#39;s honor, the family recommends the Althea Pearlman Memorial Fund at Boulder High School.&#0160;Checks should be made out to Treasurer, Boulder High School (at 1604 Arapahoe Avenue, Boulder, Colorado 80302) and designated &quot;Pearlman Memorial.&quot;&#0160;A scholarship will be awarded annually to an outstanding student of mathematics.&#0160;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I published this reminiscence some years ago:</p>
<p>My daughter continues to urge me to write something autobiographical. To which I reply, it’s all autobiographical. But since she wants hard news, not indirect revelation, I offer this account of my grandmother, born Sonia Chafetz, later, by marriage, Sonia Usilewski and finally, after a legal name change, Sonia Green. She was born in 1884 somewhere in darkest White Russia (now called Belarus). I have no idea exactly where, but I know that she was a distinctly rural girl -- she loved to fish, to pick berries, to grow plants. Of her life in the old country, I know almost nothing -– only that she was raised in a cottage with a dirt floor and that the family brought the cow inside in the winter to keep the place warm. I know that she didn’t have a proper bed, and that at least for part of her childhood she slept on the mantle over the fireplace, which sounds mighty precarious to me. She couldn’t have had much in the way of formal education, but she did read and write Yiddish and still understood Russian in her old age. I know this because in the late 1940s or early 50s I would occasionally sit with her and listen to the broadcast of debates at the United Nations (in those days there were subsequent rather than simultaneous translations) and she would render the Russian to me, as best she could in her halting English. She never did become fluent in the only language I knew so our conversations were stilted and confined to utilitarian topics. When she was young--I’ve seen the pictures—she was dark, attractive, and voluptuous. By the time I came to know her, when she was close to sixty, her looks were long gone and she was disfigured by goiter and other diseases and no doubt by the consequences of her many self-induced abortions.&#0160; The family story was that both she and Joseph were engaged to other people when they eloped to America (my grandfather deserting from the Russian army, where he had been drafted for the usual twenty-year term, and where his salary was a ruble every other month). They arrived in New York in August of 1904 from Rotterdam. How they found their way from Minsk to Rotterdam I was never told, but the Ellis Island records report that they came through London. My mother was born in June of the following year, or just about ten months after her parents arrived in this country. My mother’s story was that at first her parents had only one pair of shoes between them, so that Sonia had to stay at home until Joseph returned from work. The family settled in Harlem; my grandfather, who was urban and more sophisticated than Sonia, had been trained as a pharmacist, but never found work in his field in the new world. I don’t know what they did for a living (was he some sort of salesman?) except that for a short time my grandparents owned a delicatessen at the corner of 4<sup>th</sup> and 10<sup>th</sup> streets in Greenwich Village. I’ve gone to that corner many times and tried imagine such a restaurant, but of course not a clue remains. As far as I can guess, their marriage was uneasy. My grandfather was frequently absent (my father once darkly hinted, “I don’t know whether it was other women, or what”) and my grandmother frequently ill. My father also told me that when he and mom married, he laid down a prohibition—it was in the days when men made prohibitions-- that she wasn’t to act as intermediary between Sonia and Joseph any longer. I know that my mother had to leave school six weeks into the ninth grade to care for her mother and two younger brothers. But that’s about all I was told and there are no documents. I have a few memories:&#0160;Sonia trying to teach me to play fan-tan and five hundred rummy -– I was as bad then as I am now at card games; Sonia planting in wooden Philadelphia cream-cheese boxes every orange or grapefruit seed that came into her house, so that her tiny apartment had the pleasant aroma of a hot-house; Sonia growing avocados in the winter but setting them in my father’s garden (just around the corner from her third-floor walk up) in the summer. And I also remember her attempt to cure my father’s sterile apple tree with an old-country remedy—rubbing the cut half of an apple on the trunk in midwinter. I remember also stuffed cabbage, the world&#39;s finest blintzes, and jars of apricot jam sealed with paraffin. In her last years, Sonia lived with my parents; she had her own kitchen, a room that had been remodeled from my former bedroom. She was weary of life and I suspect that she died at least in part of malnutrition. I remember also that she owned a pressed-glass ruby bowl that was always filled with hard candies. I was allowed one candy per visit. When Sonia died in 1971, she had no money and precious few possessions, but I inherited the bowl. It was pretty, and I’m sorry to say that after a few years I accidentally broke it. But it was easily replaced (it was in a popular pattern and every second-hand&#0160; store had the item for sale) and I bought one for about $25.00. Some years afterward I broke the second one and bought another, but by that time the price had gone up to $50.00. So, although my inheritance in cold cash was a negative $75, I was left with grateful appreciation and many warm memories.</p>
<p>Now&#0160;I want to complete the story of the sterile apple tree.</p>
<p>My father had three fruit trees in his backyard garden on East 9 Street.&#0160; A pear tree, which produced abundant fruit but not every year (it was a Seckel, if I remember correctly, very sweet);&#0160; a peach tree, which was only occasionally fruitful, probably because it was just a bit north of its proper range;&#0160; and an apple (variety unknown) which was large and healthy, disease-free, but which for some unknown reason never produced even a single blossom, let alone an actual apple.&#0160; My grandmother Sonia Green explained to my father that when they had a sterile apple in the old country, they would take a ripe apple, cut it in half, and rub it on the trunk of the tree in mid-winter.&#0160; It always worked, claimed grandma.&#0160; My father would have none of it.&#0160; &quot;None of your superstition here,&quot; proclaimed.&#0160;But one January he caught grandma apple in hand applying the folk remedy.&#0160; He didn&#39;t say anything, but the next summer, he bought some apples and tied them to the branches of the tree and took grandma to view them.&#0160;She was an intelligent old lady who immediately saw through the plot --but we all had a good laugh and a good story to tell.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>In 1904, at the age of 20, my grandmother Sonia Chafetz Uzilewski (later Green) disembarked at Ellis Island. Because of her age, and because she lived within an immigrant community, she never acquired much English, and as a result my conversations with her were strictly utilitarian. I was curious about the old country (White Russia, now Belarus) but she spoke little about it and what she did say was difficult for me to construe. Two pieces of information about her childhood have stayed with me: first, that in the old country, they brought the cow into the house in the winter &quot;to keep warm&quot; and secondly, that, as a girl, she &quot;slept over the fireplace.&quot;</p>
<p>I was puzzled. All I could imagine was a house like my own pleasant childhood home, but with a cow on the carpet and a young lady perched precariously on the narrow mantle over the fireplace (if we had had a fireplace, which we didn&#39;t). Frankly, I couldn&#39;t make much sense out of her story.&#0160;</p>
<p>It wasn&#39;t until I happened to find myself in benighted Lithuania in 2003 that I figured out the cow-in-the-living-room puzzle. I visited one of those large open-air museums which are not uncommon in eastern Europe, in which traditional peasant dwellings, along with churches, mills, foundries, etc. have been&#0160; rescued and sprinkled around a landscape. At such sites, a very common form of low-end dwelling consists of a barn or animal shelter on the dirt ground floor, with a wooden second floor for human habitation erected just above. I believe that when grandma said that they brought the cow into the house, she meant that they stabled the cow down below, and that some of the heat from the animal disseminated into the living quarters -- as would, incidentally, some of its pungent effluvia.</p>
<p>So one problem was solved, but the mantle-sleeping remained a mystery. However, just this past week the <em>New Yorker </em>featured an essay on traditional Russian cooking in which there was a paragraph on a long-ago-and-far-away kind of stove. Here&#39;s the pertinent section.</p>
<p>&quot;A traditional Russian kitchen starts with a <em>pech</em>, a huge brick oven with many winding vents designed to retain the heat from a wood fire. A <em>pech</em> was once the centerpiece of&#0160;traditional peasant homes; it took up about a quarter of the available living space. It heated and ventilated the house, it dried food; children and the elderly slept on ledges built into it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Children and the elderly slept on ledges built into it.&quot;</em> Mystery solved!</p>
<p>Sonia told me that she slept over the fire, which I interpreted as a fireplace. But I was wrong. She slept over the stove. For all I know, she might even have used the world<em> pech</em>, which I couldn&#39;t possibly have translated or understood.</p>
<p>Now I know, that like other children at the very bottom of the nineteenth-century Russian social ladder, she slept on a ledge built into a <em>pech</em>, with the cow lowing just a few feet below her.&#0160;</p>
<p>Need I mention once again how glad I am that she decided to pull up stakes and head for new world.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Who knows what crimes or dark deeds my black-sheep Uncle Max had committed that made made him such a pariah in our o-so-respectable family, but they must have been something awful. Although he was my father&#39;s older brother, his name was never mentioned except with embarrassment or distaste.</p>
<p>Inasmuch as I&#39;m now the &quot;patriarch,&quot; it&#39;s time to get the family stuff on the record for the benefit of the kids, the grandkids, and the extended mishpucha. So here&#39;s all I know about my mysterious uncle. Spoiler alert: it doesn&#39;t add up to villainy.</p>
<p>Max was the oldest of the four (Sol, Mollie, and Mannie succeeded him). He would have been born about 1895, just about the time the family escaped the Ukraine for the Lower East Side. He studied at Albany State Teachers College for a while, but I don&#39;t think he earned a degree. He lived in Paris during the 1920s and perhaps 1930s. He was invited to but did not attend my parents&#39; wedding. He was divorced (a source of immeasurable shame in those years). My mother said, &quot;Uncle Max is very selfish.&quot; There was something shady about the way he made his living, but I don&#39;t know the details, except that, for a while, he ghost-wrote doctoral dissertations. He lived with a woman to whom he wasn&#39;t married. He died of a heart attack during the 1950s.&#0160;</p>
<p>I met him three times. Once, he came to a family gathering, My father wouldn&#39;t speak to him. Another time he paid a weekday afternoon call to our East 9 Street home. I found him in the kitchen talking with my mother: &quot;This is your Uncle Max.&quot; And then, when I was thirteen, he called and asked if he could take me to the finals of the NCAA basketball tournament at Madison Square Garden. After a lot of discussion and negotiation, I was allowed to meet him at the arena. Max was a small man, hard of hearing, and very ordinary.&#0160; He tried hard to be congenial. He told me that he had taken &quot;Robert&quot; as a middle name. Frankly, he seemed no more menacing or odd than any other of my uncle-ry or than other men of his generation. What else do I remember of that evening?&#0160; During the game, an errant pass hit off a player&#39;s head and bounced into the basket.</p>
<p>I never saw Max again.</p>
<p>And yet my father once confessed to me that he told Max that &quot;if he ever did that again, I&#39;d kill him.&quot; My father, mildest of men, threatened someone with violent death?&#0160; Because he did what?&#0160; Dad wouldn&#39;t say.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a spooky story, and I&#39;m going to tell it exactly the way it happened, no embroidery or exaggeration. On the night of my father&#39;s funeral, my brothers and I and our wives gathered around the formica kitchen table in the old house. Uncle Max&#39;s name came up. I said, &quot;I know the name of the woman who he lived with.&quot; &quot;What is it?&quot;&#0160; &quot;It&#39;s Sarah Clyne, spelled with a C and a Y.&quot; There was a Manhattan telephone book (five inches thick and at least two thousand pages). I picked up the book and it fell open. I put my finger on a name. The name was Sarah Clyne. &quot;I said, did you see what happened?&#0160; I just opened the book at random and my finger fell on the name Sarah Clyne, Max&#39;s lady. It seems like a sign that I should call her.&quot;</p>
<p>But I didn&#39;t.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the only picture of Max of which I have knowledge. He&#39;s with &quot;little grandma.&quot; The picture is taken in front of 334 Eastern Parkway in Brooklyn.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Yesterday, in a long-buried collection of file folders, I found some papers of my father&#39;s that were written during those last painful years when he was a widower. Some of the pages comprise a &quot;commonplace&quot; book, the theme of which is, &#39;why am I still alive when my wife is dead?&#39;&#0160; In addition to the lamentations, there are two anomalous paragraphs of reminiscence&#0160; -- constituting the sum of my father&#39;s known autobiographical writings. For the benefit and edification of my own children and grandchildren and family, I now put these writings on the record.</p>
<p>My father writes:&#0160; &quot;My maternal grandmother was a thin, almost gaunt&#0160; woman about 5 ft 5 inches tall. Although I am sure she loved all her children &amp; grandchildren, I cannot remember her ever showing any overt sign of affection. We children always knew when grandma was to visit us. My mother would go into a frenzy of housecleaning. All the curtains would be washed and re-hung; the kitchen floors scrubbed and the silverware washed and polished. Her [i.e. my father&#39;s grandmother&#39;s] face was unwrinkled, the skin drawn tightly. Her most dominant feature was her eyes, piercing, direct, demanding. There would be Grandma, wearing a little hat, glancing around the room while she slowly took off her gloves. If she was satisfied with what she saw, she would give a little nod as if to say, &#39;well done.&#39; We would all relax.&quot;</p>
<p>A historical footnote:&#0160; my grandparents came to this continent in about 1895 and the events that my father remembers are all turn-of-the-century and pre-WWI.</p>
<p>Until I uncovered this paragraph, I thought my grandparents came to North America on their own.&#0160; I did not know that they were accompanied by this formidable great-grandmother. Although she herself was long gone when I came on the stage, I certainly encountered those piercing black eyes in other faces, my father&#39;s in particular.&#0160; I wonder why my father (who was born in 1904) never mentioned his grandmother to me -- she certainly made an impression that lasted to the end of his life. Come to think of it, why the heck was my family so entirely tight-lipped about their ancestry?</p>
<p>But wait.&#0160; There&#39;s more.</p>
<p>&quot;My grandparents (that would be the ferocious grandmother and her equally unknown-to-me husband), had 5 children, 4 daughters and one son. There were born to their children in a space of 10 years, 18 grandchildren.&#0160; Each one of these children were delivered at home. My grandmother attended every one of these births.&#0160; About 2 weeks before the expected date of birth, my grandmother would appear wearing her little hat and gloves &amp; carrying a small satchel; she immediately took charge of the household. The expectant mother would be freed of all household obligations.&quot;</p>
<p>From this evidence it would appear that in addition to his three siblings (Max, Sol, and Molly), my father had fourteen cousins on his mother&#39;s side of the family.&#0160; Why didn&#39;t I know about them?&#0160; Why did I never meet a single one? Or even hear their names?&#0160; Or the names of their progeny, if there were any?</p>
<p>Also in my father&#39;s hand, scribbled in a corner of the paper, is a calculation:&#0160; Mom - 4, Manya - 6, Nadya - 3, Mary - 2, Maris (or Saris, or Norris) -3.&#0160; And then the sum:&#0160; 18.</p>
<p>So, children and children&#39;s children and collateral descendants, you now understand a piece of the family history.</p>
<p>And readers:&#0160; if there&#39;s anyone out there in internetland who had a strong, perhaps dictatorial great or great-great or great-great-great grandmother who came to assist at births armed with a satchel, a little hat and memorable black eyes (first name unknown but surnamed Hessel), and who knows that his or her ancestry includes a woman whose maiden name was Mary Hessel or Manya Hessel or Nadya Hessel, or if there&#39;s someone who&#39;s descended from Noris or Moris or Saris Hessel, hey, cuz, take a moment and add a comment to this entry and I&#39;ll get right back to you.&#0160; &#0160;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p class="EC_MsoNormal">In 1895, my grandparents wisely left the abysmal, backward Ukraine and struck out for the new world. Nine years later, my father was born in a cold-water flat in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn. The date of his birth: December 22, 1904, exactly at the winter solstice. &quot;And they called his name, Emanuel, God with us.&quot; If he had been born in the old country, before the Russian authorities imposed legal cognomina upon us, he would have been named Emanuel ben Isaiah--his father&#39;s name appended to his own as a patronymic.</p>
<p class="EC_MsoNormal">Despite his traditional moniker and his commitment to the essence of Judaism, my father was fiercely hostile to the irrationalities of religion. His view -- and my grandfather Isaiah&#39;s even more strongly--was that for a thousand years our lineage had been kept in poverty and darkness not just by the czars but also by the rabbis. In politics, my father and grandfather began as socialists and became New Dealers; in philosophy, they rejected theological doctrine and were among the children of the enlightenment whom Moses Mendelssohn had led to the promised land of evidence and reason. I doubt that any of my ancestors knew Karl Marx&#39;s sentence that &quot;the criticism of religion is the beginning of all criticism,&quot; but they acted as if they had absorbed it from the cradle. My brothers and I were taught to resist religious exclusivity, superstition, and ceremony.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p class="EC_MsoNormal">We now have a religious controversy in our peaceful, progressive, and largely secular western town. A group of orthodox Jews have petitioned the city council for permission to construct an <em>eruv</em>. What is an <em>eruv</em>?&#0160; It’s a “symbolic boundary that allows orthodox Jews to carry things, including their own children, outside their home during the Sabbath.&quot; (Carrying is considered work, and orthodoxy&#39;s strict interpretation of religious law prohibits any sort of sabbatical labor.) A latter-day <em>eruv </em>is constructed out of fishing line that is strung on utility poles; curiously, it may incorporate functioning electric and telephone wires.</p>
<p class="EC_MsoNormal">I know that my forbears detested <em>eruvim </em>and similar expressions of irrational piety. I myself am not enraged by these useless but harmless superstitions.&#0160; Constructing an <em>eruv </em>does not endanger our species; it&#39;s not like opposing contraception or prohibiting stem-cell research. An <em>eruv </em>consoles the believers and doesn&#39;t much bother the rest of us. Yet if there is a spirit in the sky, which I very much doubt, I would hope that he would not be so small-minded as to issue ukases about carrying infants on Saturdays; infants should be carried as much as they want, which is just about everywhere and always. And if any god were so narrow as to promulgate an inside/outside-the-home rule, I would hope that he would be intelligent enough not to be flummoxed by such transparent trickery as hanging mylar filament on poles.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p class="EC_MsoNormal">I have no intuitive conception of god, but I think that the orthodox trivialize our shared longing for transcendence when they sanctify such petty practices. It would be far more pious for the orthodox to take every nickel spent to appease the Ancient of Days and bestow it on a poor Jewish family from Tashkent.&#0160; If these folks can&#39;t locate eligible Jews, there are Hondurans and Sudanese a-plenty who deserve their attention. When the orthodox re-direct their enthusiasm and their resources toward truly charitable enterprises, they will honor the universal immigrant experience and they will also practice the very worthy Jewish virtue of compassion. Constructing an eruv is a foolish waste of time and fishing line.</p>
<p class="EC_MsoNormal">Here&#39;s my father&#39;s view:&#0160; &quot;It took us hundreds of years to fight our way out of the ghetto and they want to put themselves back in jail. If the rabbis had their way,&quot; he would say, &quot;Mahler and Bernstein and Gershwin would play accordion in a klezmer band in Bialystok, Einstein would balance the books for a caftan maker in Kiev, and a hundred and fifty Jewish Nobel Prize winners would spend their days davening in some dirty dim synagogue in Vilna.&quot;</p>
<p class="EC_MsoNormal">I think it’s in a Wallace Markfield novel that an old Jewish guy confronts a group of twenty-something Jewish hippies/slackers in Miami Beach. After a heated discussion, he admonishes them:&#0160; &quot;And don&#39;t ever be ashamed that you’re Jewish. It’s enough that I’m ashamed that you’re Jewish.&quot;</p>
<p class="EC_MsoNormal">Which is pretty much how I feel about the <em>eruvistas</em>. Well, not exactly ashamed. Embarrassed, perhaps, by their superstitious infatuation with the &quot;dark backward and abysm of time.&quot;&#0160;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>We&#39;ve had two major snowfalls in the last week and the road crews haven&#39;t yet found their way to our street. It&#39;s a knee-deep icy mess out there. Yesterday one of my neighbors spun himself into quite a hole. He needed a push, so I went outside to help. Even with my professional-grade ice-chopper, I had to bang around for a while and the task took a lot longer than I had expected.&#0160; Eventually, I had to resort to the old towel trick to gain enough traction to release the vehicle. My neighbor said, &quot;I&#39;m embarrassed. You shouldn&#39;t be doing this.&quot;&#0160; Which took me aback, of course. I replied, quite spontaneously, &quot;It&#39;s exactly what I should be doing.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>And then I recalled one of my father&#39;s maxims: &quot;Never omit an opportunity to do a favor for a friend, and never be embarrassed to accept a favor.&quot;</p>
<p>The old guy did lots of favors. When someone on East 9 Street had a problem or got into a little trouble, my father acted as <em>consigliere</em>; as far as I know, he never took a nickel for his trouble--though occasionally someone would drop off a compensatory lasagna. In his last years, when he lived alone and his arthritis was very bad, someone mowed his lawn and someone took in his garbage cans and someone raked his leaves.</p>
<p>My father was the least materialistic person that I&#39;ve encountered in an entire lifetime. He didn&#39;t seem to need possessions. No car, no clothes beyond the absolute minimum, no items of personal adornment. He didn&#39;t &quot;shop.&quot; I was with him once when bought a new hat: &quot;See this. I want another one just like it.&quot; We were in and out of the store in two minutes.&#0160;</p>
<p>Although he lived in a world of weasels (he was a real-estate lawyer), he was uncontaminated by what went on around him. He&#39;d often tell me stories about the various chicaneries by which people cheated each other--and every time he would express the same astonishment at the fallibility of human nature. He knew of public officials who were on the take, but he preferred to talk about the state legislator who had a large sign on his desk that said, &quot;NO GIFTS.&quot;</p>
<p>In one of our very last conversations, I asked him if he himself had ever done anything illegal. He thought for a long time. &quot;I don&#39;t know if you&#39;d call this exactly illegal. Do you remember the B-----s?&#0160; Rose was a widow and she was dying of cancer, but she didn&#39;t know it. She was a teacher with two young children and she had a benefit coming to her from the city. She made a very bad decision--a lump sum instead of an annuity for her children. I went to her school and substituted a new form for the one that she had filed. It was technically a violation and I could have gotten into a lot of trouble.&quot; And then he surprised me by quoting some Wordsworth--the lines from <em>Tintern Abbey </em>about the &quot;best portion of a good man&#39;s life,/ His little, nameless, unremembered acts/ Of kindness and of love.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#39;s hard to believe that he&#39;s been dead for twenty years now. But I remember him when we come around to the winter solstice (he was born on December 22, 1904)--and he&#39;s especially real to me when a neighbor lets me help him extricate his car from a snowbank.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">My daughter continues to urge me to write something autobiographical. To which I reply, it’s all autobiographical. But since she wants hard news, not indirect revelation, I offer this account of my grandmother, born Sonia Chafetz, later, by marriage, Sonia Usilewski and finally, after a legal name change, Sonia Green. She was born in 1884 somewhere in darkest White Russia (now called Belarus). I have no idea exactly where, but I know that she was a distinctly rural girl -- she loved to fish, to pick berries, to grow plants. Of her life in the old country, I know almost nothing -– only that she was raised in a cottage with a dirt floor and that the family brought the cow inside in the winter to keep the place warm. I know that she didn’t have a proper bed, and that at least for part of her childhood she slept on the mantle over the fireplace, which sounds mighty precarious to me. She couldn’t have had much in the way of formal education, but she did read and write Yiddish and still understood Russian in her old age. I know this because in the late 1940s or early 50s I would occasionally sit with her and listen to the broadcast of debates at the United Nations (in those days there were subsequent rather than simultaneous translations) and she would render the Russian to me, as best she could in her halting English. She never did become fluent in the only language I knew so our conversations were stilted and confined to utilitarian topics.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&#0160;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">When she was young -- I’ve seen the pictures—she was dark, attractive, and voluptuous. By the time I came to know her, when she was close to sixty, her looks were long gone and she was disfigured by goitre and other diseases and no doubt by the consequences of her many self-induced abortions. The family story was that both she and Joseph were engaged to other people when they eloped to America (my grandfather deserting from the Russian army, where he had been drafted for the usual twenty-year term, and where his salary was a ruble every other month). They arrived in New York in August of 1904 from Rotterdam. How they found their way from Minsk to Rotterdam I was never told, but the Ellis Island records report that they came through London.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&#0160;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">My mother was born in June of the following year, or just about ten months after her parents arrived in this country. My mother’s story was that at first her parents had only one pair of shoes between them, so that Sonia had to stay at home until Joseph returned from work. The family settled in Harlem; my grandfather, who was urban and more sophisticated than Sonia, had been trained as a pharmacist, but never found work in his field in the new world. I don’t know what they did for a living (was he some sort of salesman?) except that for a short time my grandparents owned a delicatessen at the corner of 4<sup>th</sup> and 10<sup>th</sup> streets in Greenwich Village. I’ve gone to that corner many times and tried imagine such a restaurant, but of course not a clue remains.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&#0160;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">As far as I can guess, their marriage was uneasy. My grandfather was frequently absent (my father once darkly hinted, “I don’t know whether it was other women, or what”) and my grandmother frequently ill. My father also told me that when he and mom married, he laid down a prohibition — it was in the days when men made prohibitions -- that she wasn’t to act as intermediary between Sonia and Joseph any longer.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&#0160;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">I know that my mother had to leave school six weeks into the ninth grade to care for her mother and two younger brothers. But that’s about all I was told and there are no documents. I have a few memories: Sonia trying to teach me to play fan-tan and five hundred rummy -– I was as bad then as I am now at card games; Sonia planting in wooden Philadelphia cream-cheese boxes every orange or grapefruit seed that came into her house, so that her tiny apartment had the pleasant aroma of a hot-house; Sonia growing avocados in the winter but setting them in my father’s garden (just around the corner from her third-floor walk-up) in the summer. And I also remember her attempt to cure my father’s sterile apple tree with an old-country remedy — rubbing the cut half of an apple on the tree trunk in midwinter. I remember also stuffed cabbage, the world&#39;s finest blintzes, and jars of apricot jam sealed with paraffin. In her last years, Sonia lived with my parents; she had her own kitchen, a room that had been remodeled from my former bedroom. She was weary of life and I suspect that she died at least in part of malnutrition. I remember also that she owned a pressed-glass ruby bowl that was always filled with hard candies. I was allowed one candy per visit.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&#0160;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">When Sonia died in 1971, she had no money and precious few possessions, but I inherited the bowl. It was pretty, and I’m sorry to say that after a few years I accidentally broke it. But it was easily replaced (it was in a popular pattern and every second-hand store had the item for sale) and I bought one for about $25.00. Some years afterward I broke the second one and bought another, but by that time the price had gone up to $50.00. So, although my inheritance in cold cash was a negative $75, I was left with grateful appreciation and many warm memories.</p>
