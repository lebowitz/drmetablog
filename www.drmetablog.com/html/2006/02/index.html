		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>When <em>The Naked and the Dead</em> was published in 1948, the word &quot;naked&quot; still had shock value. Mailer&#39;s novel was followed by books with such titles as <em>The Naked Society, </em><em>The Naked Ape </em>and the moderately oxymoronic <em>Naked Lunch.</em></p>
<p>It wasn&#39;t long before shock devolved into cliche. The publishing world has now transformed itself, at least as far as book titles are concerned, into an enormous, sprawling colony of nudists. Amazon lists over a thousand books in English with &quot;naked&quot; in the title.</p>
<p>A reader interested in religion may choose from <em>The Naked Christian, Naked Buddha, Naked Buddhism, The Naked Soul, The Naked God, The Naked Church, Naked Angels, Naked in the Promised Land </em>and <em>Praying Naked. The Naked Parish Priest </em>may imply more than is strictly proper and <em>Buck-Naked Faith </em>suggests that ordinary nakedness is insufficient.</p>
<p>For the button-down corporate world, there&#39;s <em>The Naked Corporation, The Naked Consumer, The Naked Employee, The Naked Investor, Naked Imperialism, The Naked Entrepreneur, Naked Marketing, Naked Imperialism, Naked Economics, The Naked Capitalist, Naked in the Boardroom, The Naked Manager, The Naked Trader, Naked at the Interview, The Naked Factory, </em>and <em>Work Naked.</em></p>
<p>There&#39;s hardly an area of interest that hasn&#39;t been touched by the advent of naked titling. Politics?: <em>The Naked Empire, Naked Liberty, Naked Justice, The Naked Communist. </em>Geographical?:&#0160; <em>The Naked Tropics, Naked Sun, The Naked Island, Naked Heartland, The Naked Mountain, The Naked Tree, Naked Savages, The Naked Airport, Naked in Baghdad, Naked in Da Nang, Naked City, The Naked Tourist, Naked Wanderlust, The Naked Jungle, Naked Germany,</em> even<em>&#0160; Naked in Cyberspace, </em>wherever that is. Social?:&#0160;<em>Naked Conversations, Naked Bitch, The Naked Leader, The Naked Duke, The Naked Marquis, The Naked Warrior, Naked Ambition, The Naked Roommate, Naked Conversations, The Naked Crowd.&#0160; </em>Gastronomical?: <em>The Naked Chef, Naked Chocolate, Naked Fruit, Eat Papayas Naked, The Naked Martini.&#0160;</em>Anatomical<em>: The Naked Face, The Naked Neuron, The Naked Chiropractor, The Naked Quack. </em>Domestic: <em>Naked Rooms, The Naked Wall.&#0160;</em>Artistic?:&#0160; <em>Naked Clay, Naked Vinyl, Writing Naked, The Naked Cartoonist, Naked Poetry. </em>Athletic?:&#0160; <em>Naked Skydiving, The Naked Rower, Swimming Naked, The Naked Runner, The Naked Hunter, The Naked Pilot, Naked Weightlifting.</em></p>
<p>It&#39;s disappointing to find nothing in the arena of naked basketball, despite Dennis Rodman&#39;s expressed desire to play his last professional game naked-- to which the NBA commissioner is supposed to have responded, &quot;it would definitely be his last.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>Other professions: <em>The Naked Therapist, The Naked Detective, The Naked Bird Watcher, The Naked Spy, The Naked Civil Servant, The Naked Counselor, The Naked Anthropologist.</em></p>
<p>The field of dance has produced a series of related titles:&#0160; <em>Dancing Naked Under Palm Trees,&#0160; ...in the Mindfield, ..at the Edge of Dawn, ...in Front of the Fridge, ...in the Material World, ...on the Floor, ...in the Sun. </em>There&#39;s a whole genre of books for people whose tastes are more specialized than mine. A sample:&#0160; <em>Naked Hairy Jocks</em>.</p>
<p><em>Nearly Naked </em>is refreshingly modest.</p>
<p>As might be expected, naked has its parodists. The faux-romance <em>Naked Came the Stranger </em>was followed by <em>Naked Came the Manatee </em>and <em>Naked Came the Sasquatch. Naked and the Undead </em>is bloody good, and <em>Naked Brunch </em>is, I think, delicious. The most exquisite parody: Rita Rudner&#39;s <em>Naked Beneath My Clothes. </em>I&#39;m staking my claim to <em>Naked Came the Nudist.</em></p>
<p>I was entirely wrong to jump to the conclusion that <em>The Naked Mole Rat </em>was a parody; it&#39;s a serious study <em>of Heterocephalus glaber </em>by an academic zoologist.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>J. D. Salinger&#39;s <em>The Catcher in the Rye </em>is an anti-<em>bildungsroman -- </em>a &quot;novel of education&quot; without the least shred of moral, intellectual, or spiritual growth. Holden Caulfield, the novel&#39;s naive yet jaded narrator, learns absolutely nothing either about himself or about life. Unable to profit from his various encounters, he dismisses almost everyone he meets as &quot;phony.&quot; The incessant drumming on that one particular adjective leads a reader to hope that Holden will find authenticity somewhere in his horizon, but <em>The Catcher in the Rye </em>is not a novel that rewards optimism. It concludes with a vision of Holden&#39;s pre-pubescent sister Phoebe going &quot;round and round&quot; on a symbolic carousel -- going nowhere, it would seem -- and in a brief coda Holden himself has been institutionalized and placed under the care of an unsympathetic psychoanalyst. Nor does the whiff of Humbertism in the relation between Holden and young Phoebe contribute any last-second learning or cheer.</p>
<p>Even in the 1950s, <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em> enjoyed a cadre of fiercely loyal partisans who powerfully identified with Holden Caulfield. I didn&#39;t believe then, and certainly don&#39;t believe now, that Holden Caulfield mirrored the anguish of my own particular soul. I was not a true believer, and I was not entranced by Holden. For me, the novel was nothing more than a better-than-average coming-of-age story -- although a dispiriting one because Holden does not mature but instead remains stranded in perpetual, painful adolescence.</p>
<p>A novel without hope, <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em> has become an inspiration for the hopeless. In Los Angeles, in 1989, twenty-one-year-old Robert Bando shot and killed a young actress whom he had been pestering with trinkets and messages. In a nearby alley, police found a .357-caliber handgun, a bloody shirt, and a copy of <em>The Catcher in the Rye.&#0160;</em>Two years later, John Hinckley shot and crippled James Brady and almost succeeded in assassinating Ronald Reagan. Hinckley had fantasized that killing the president would impress the actress Jodie Foster, whom he imagined that he was wooing. In his pocket he carried a well-read, tattered paperback of -- you guessed it --<em>The Catcher in the Rye. </em>In 1980, on Manhattan&#39;s West Side, Mark David Chapman, concealing his pistol under a copy of <em>The Catcher in the Rye,</em> shot John Lennon five times at point blank. He had inscribed his copy of the novel with the words &quot;To Holden Caulfield from Holden Caulfield&quot; -- Chapman had tried to legally change his name to that of Salinger&#39;s troubled narrator. From jail, the proud murderer issued an endorsement: &quot;My wish is for all of you to someday read <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em>.&quot; At his trial Chapman asserted that he had killed Lennon because the singer had become &quot;phony,&quot; and at his sentencing he read to the judge the section of the book in which Holden tells his sister Phoebe that he imagined himself in a field of rye with &quot;thousands of little kids&quot; whom he must prevent from falling off &quot;the edge of some crazy cliff.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p><em>The Catcher in the Rye</em> still sells well (15,000,000 copies in print by 1996) and has become a fixture in the high school and college classroom, where successive generations of adolescents can calibrate their degree of <em>angst</em> against Holden&#39;s. But increasingly, and paradoxically, attention has turned from the novel to Salinger himself, who has not published anything since 1965 and, secluded in his Cornish, New Hampshire retreat, has become the world&#39;s most notorious hermit since St. Simeon Stylites mounted his pillar in sixth-century Antioch.</p>
<p>Although he is a hermit, Salinger is anything but a saint. In 1987, in a bizarre echo of Holden<em>-</em>obsessed stalkers, Salinger, then sixty-eight years old, flew to California and barged onto the set of the TV show <em>Dynasty</em> in search of one of the series&#39;s starlets, Catherine Oxenberg, with whom he had apparently fallen into long-distance electronic infatuation. He was &quot;escorted&quot; off the set.</p>
<p>Did Catherine Oxenberg have a precursor?&#0160; She did, indeed she did. Several, in fact, including Joyce Maynard, described as &quot;the Lolita of all Lolitas,&quot; who was eighteen and a freshman at Yale in 1972 when Salinger, at the age of fifty-three, initiated a romance by sending her a fan letter.</p>
<p>These and other even less savory details about Caulfield-Salinger&#39;s life can be found in Paul Alexander&#39;s thin, amateurish biography <em>Salinger </em>(Los Angeles:&#0160; Renaissance Books, 1999), which does not propose, although it might, that J. D. has learned as little about life as his most famous character.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Reduplicatives, sometimes called &quot;echo words,&quot; or &quot;echo phrases&quot; are formulations such as hobnob, pell-mell, herky-jerky, hoity-toity, itsy-bitsy, niminy-piminy.</p>
<p>In English, there are two principal classes of reduplicatives. Category one consists of rhymes such as hodge-podge, willy-nilly, helter-skelter, kowtow, harum-scarum, jeepers-creepers, okey-dokey, heebie-jeebie, gang-bang, hocus-pocus (reputed to derive from the words of the Latin mass:&#0160; <em>hoc est corpus meum);&#0160; </em>the second category contains words that are formed by ablaut or vowel shift, such as ping-pong, shilly-shally, zig-zag, bibble-babble, pitter-patter, splish-splash, flim-flam.</p>
<p>There are also some lovely oddities that resist classification: dipsy-doodle, topsy-turvey, hunky-dory, tilly-valley, and, at the outer limit, hullabaloo.</p>
<p>Of the hundreds (perhaps thousands) of reduplicatives, almost all are comprised of one or two syllables, but there are occasional threes: higgledy-piggledy, jiggery-pokery. To the best of my knowledge, there are no four-syllable reduplicatives.&#0160;</p>
<p>Many are diminutives or are dismissive: hanky-panky, namby-pamby, claptrap, mumbo-jumbo.</p>
<p>The language continues to generate reduplicatives. Some now common reduplicatives were unknown to my youth: Maui-wowie, boob-tube, creature-feature (a horror movie), fender-bender, gender-bender, chick-flick, AC-DC, fag-hag, chop-shop (a place where stolen cars are cut into parts), brain-drain, artsy-fartsy.</p>
<p>But reduplicatives are as old as the language. Shakespeare, who was fond of reduplicatives, used them not just for comic effect, but at critical dramatic moments. Some well-known examples: the weird sisters in <em>Macbeth</em> will meet again &quot;<span style="color: #3333ff;">When the hurly-burly&#39;s done,/ When the battle&#39;s lost and won.&quot; </span>&quot;Hurly-burly&quot; signals the sisters&#39; contempt for human effort. In <em>Hamlet, </em>Claudius admits that it was a mistake to bury Polonius in secret haste: <span style="color: #3333ff;">&quot;we have done but greenly/ In hugger-mugger to inter him.&quot;&#0160; </span>The Catholic Hotspur (in <em>The First Part of King Henry the Fourth) </em>complains that the great pagan magician Glendower speaks &quot;<span style="color: #6666ff;">such a deal of skimble-skamble stuff/ As puts me from my faith.&quot;&#0160; </span>A less famous but still wonderful reduplicative appears in <em>All&#39;s Well That Ends Well</em>, where the braggart soldier Parolles argues in purple pentameters that his young master Bertram should abandon his bride and go the wars:&#0160; <span style="color: #3333ff;">&quot;He wears his honor in a box unseen,/ That hugs his kicky-wicky here at home,/Spending his manly marrow in her arms,/ Which should sustain the bound and high curvet/ Of Mar&#39;s fiery steed.&quot;&#0160; </span><span style="color: #000000;">The rare &quot;kicky-wicky,&quot; which some derive from French <em>quelque chose</em>, is brutally insulting.&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;</span></p>
<p>Three men come into a restaurant: one is from Walla-Walla, one from Pago-Pago, and one from Ryukyu. They order cous-cous, mahi-mahi, and a kiwi salad. They ask the mu-mu clad waitress (who suffers from beri-beri) about the quality of the food. In some versions of this edifying story, she replies, &quot;So-so.&quot;&#0160; What else might she have said?</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>In <em>Abducted:&#0160; How People Come to Believe They Were Abducted by Aliens (</em>Harvard, 2005), Susan Clancy recounts interviews with fifty or so &quot;abductees.&quot; Each person&#39;s experience is unique, but the various stories can be melded into a composite narrative.&#0160;<span style="color: #3333cc;">&quot;I was having problems with anxiety and depression. I was at Fenway Park with my buddies watching a game. The next thing I remember, I was on Mission Hill and it was five in the morning. I was always interested in science fiction. I read <em>Communion; </em>I saw <em>E. T</em> and <em>Close Encounters.</em> I went to a hypnotist, and memories started flooding back. I started sobbing uncontrollably. They were long and tall, with huge black eyes that went around their heads. I remembered them fastening a device like a suction cup to my genitals to suck out the sperm painfully. They inserted a foot-long tube into my nostril. I know it happened because I get nosebleeds. My dad thinks it&#39;s a transmitter they put in there.&#0160; They&#39;ve programmed other memories to disappear. Until I experienced the aliens, life was empty, meaningless. Now that I have my memories, I understand everything. What happened to me was overwhelming. It was real. I can&#39;t explain-- I felt it. I was changed from the person that I was.&#0160; It was the most positive event of my life. It helped me to see life as beautiful, as a gift.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Alien abductees may hold to false beliefs, but they have powerful faith. Clancy reports that once, at a convention of abductees, she tried to talk about the unreliability of anecdotal evidence, the fragility of memory, the nature of the sleep-paralysis syndrome, the creation of false memories under hypnosis, Occam&#39;s Razor (the employment of the most economical hypothesis to explain a phenomenon), etc. According to Clancy, there was a long silence, and then one of the participants said, </span>&quot;tell her about the metallic tube that came out of Jim&#39;s nose, the one that went down the sink before you both could catch it.&quot;</p>
<p>Eventually Clancy brings herself to discuss the obvious parallel of abduction to religion, which, she says, she is reluctant to do because she has &quot;about a thousand Irish Catholic relatives [she] doesn&#39;t want to offend.&quot; Nevertheless, she concludes that &quot;alien-abduction beliefs can be considered a type of religious creed, based on faith, not facts.&quot; Kind to her extended family, Clancy does pursue the argument to the next logical step: that ordinary, accepted beliefs of supernatural intervention in human affairs are exactly as credible -- no more, no less -- as belief in macrocephalic waifs with black wraparound eyes who stick needles into your navel to produce hybrid children.</p>
<p>She also reports that one of her informants, when challenged, responded, &quot;I trust my gut and my gut says aliens.&quot; Is there a better argument for listening not to our guts but to our brains?</p>

Creating a DTD will not give us the versatility we want, so we have moved to a schema instead.&quot;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>We were in California tending the grandchildren (a girl, 6, and a boy, 4) while &quot;the daughter&quot; and her husband were on a sun-and-sand vacation down in Baja. The children are in the habit of coming into their parents&#39; &#0160;bed when they have trouble going to sleep. We&#39;re in the habit of reading aloud before putting out the lights. At present, I&#39;m reading <em>Swann&#39;s Way.</em> One night, the children, as is their custom, came in to snuggle. After they settled down, I resumed reading: &quot;I was not quite Bergotte&#39;s only admirer; he was also the favorite writer of a friend of my mother&#39;s, a very well read woman, while Dr. du Boulbon would keep his patients waiting as he read Bergotte&#39;s most recent book; and it was from his consulting room, and from a park near Combray, that some of the first seeds of that predilection for Bergotte took flight....&quot; The children fell almost immediately to sleep; Proust&#39;s undiagrammable sentences were too much for them.</p>
<p>The next night, same scenario. We&#39;re in bed. The children came in to snuggle; they thrashed about for a few moments, giggled, eventually settled down. I picked up Monsieur Proust. &quot;To Mme. Verdurin&#39;s great surprise, Swann never abandoned them. He went to meet them wherever they were, sometimes in restaurants in the outlying districts where no went went much yet, because it was not the season, more often to the theater, which Mme. Verdurin liked very much;&#0160; and because one day, at her house, she said in his presence that on evenings when there were premieres, or galas, a pass would have been useful to them, that it had inconvenienced them very much not to have one the day of Gambetta&#39;s funeral....&quot;&#0160; And then, the young lady looked at the young man, and he looked at her, and without a word, the two of them rose from our bed and padded back to their own room.</p>
<p>Literary criticism in its most elemental manifestation.&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;</p>

		<a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2006/02/in_the_latest_n.html">Beethoven Manuscript;  Missing Shakespeare Play</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p class="descender">The latest <em>New Yorker</em> reports the discovery of a long-lost manuscript by Beethoven. It&#39;s not a new piece, but an arrangement for piano, four hands, of the composer’s “Grosse Fuge,” or “Great Fugue,” -- which is one of the most exciting and challenging pieces of music in the known universe. The manuscript was sold at Sotheby&#39;s in December to an unnamed buyer for $1.95 million. I know the Grosse Fuge very well in the form of a string quartet; I would love to hear the four-hand piano version sometime soon.</p>
<p class="descender">The Beethoven discovery renews my hope that some day another long-lost item will re-emerge -- the Shakespeare play that&#39;s been missing for just about four hundred years.</p>
<p class="descender">In 1598, Francis Meres compiled a list of the plays of Shakespeare that were known to him: he mentioned, among a dozen others, Shakespeare&#39;s &quot;<em>Loue Labors lost,</em> [and] his <em>Loues labours wonne.&quot;&#0160;</em>No one gave much credence to Meres, who was thought to have hallucinated the second play, until 1953, when a book by Thomas Gataker called <em>Certaine Sermons (</em>1637<em>) </em>was rebound and two sheets of paper covered with Elizabethan handwriting were discovered in the backing. The papers were part of the ledger of an otherwise unknown stationer in Exeter and listed the books that were in his stock in August, 1603. Among them: &quot;marchant of vennis,&quot; &quot;taming of a shrew,&quot; &quot;loves labor lost&quot; and &quot;loves labor won.&quot;&#0160; So Meres was right all along; Shakespeare had in truth written a play called <em>Love&#39;s Labor&#39;s Won.</em> And it had been published. But the play must have soon disappeared because the diligent compilers of the great 1623 Folio either didn&#39;t know of it or couldn&#39;t locate a copy.</p>
<p class="descender">It&#39;s possible that the play has vanished into oblivion, but it&#39;s also possible that a copy lies in a closet, drawer or vault. The Beethoven fugue was found by a librarian who was cleaning a cabinet at the Palmer Theological Seminary in Wynnewood, Pennsylvania&#0160; -- how the manuscript found its way to that location is anyone&#39;s guess. The Thomas Malory manuscript -- one of the most important literary discoveries of the last century -- was lying unidentified in plain sight on top of a safe in Winchester Cathedral. So it&#39;s not at all impossible that a quarto of <em>Love&#39;s Labor&#39;s Won</em> still lurks somewhere, waiting.&#0160;</p>
<p class="descender">There are some other Shakespeare items of interest (and no doubt of monetary value) that might also resurface. There&#39;s the missing quarto zero (Q0) of <em>The First Part of King Henry the Fourth</em> (only a few pages of which are known, and then only because they were accidentally bound into a copy of a later quarto); there&#39;s <em>Cardenio </em>(co-authored with John Fletcher), which was probably Shakespeare&#39;s last effort; there might also be a fuller manuscript version of <em>Macbeth</em> (the Folio play seems to have been deliberately shortened for provincial performance).&#0160; Also of interest: the anonymous <em>Hamlet </em>that was written a decade or so before Shakespeare&#39;s, and which the playwright used as the basis of his revision. Only a single line of the earlier play has survived: the ghost is known to have cried, as shrilly as a street-seller of oysters, &quot;Hamlet, revenge.&quot;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>In my daughter&#39;s basement I found a dried-up, stained, pages-hanging-out 1959 paperback edition of William Golding&#39;s <em>Lord of the Flies.&#0160;</em>On the cover: &quot;Copyright 1954.&quot; &quot;Over 4,450,000 copies in print.&quot; &quot;Sixty-second impression.&quot; &quot;Now Available For Students And Teachers: the Casebook Edition&#0160; containing the full text of the novel, critical essays, notes, and bibliography.&quot; <em>Lord of the Flies </em>leaped into public prominence in the mid-1950s and quickly became a classroom staple. A quick googling found half a dozen websites designed to help high school students generate reports on the novel&#39;s &quot;symbolism,&quot; etc.</p>
<p>I didn&#39;t like <em>Lord of the Flies </em>when I read it back then and it&#39;s become less likable-- and less worthy of respect-- over the last half-century. It&#39;s a variation on <em>Robinson Crusoe</em>, except that this time a score of boys land (how? and not a one of them injured!!) on an uninhabited island in the Pacific. They very quickly degenerate into savages, murder two of their own number, and are hunting down the last boy who possesses a modicum of civility when a naval officer (<em>nauta ex machina?</em>) arrives to take command. <em>Lord of the Flies </em>is a dyspeptic, dystopian novel; it&#39;s also, according to the websites, a story of the contest between civilization and barbarism and,-- guess what?-- it&#39;s barbarism by a country mile.&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Robinson Crusoe himself was no perfect model of psychological health, but Defoe&#39;s story has been admired for centuries (it&#39;s the most reprinted novel in history) at least in part because it asserts that a resourceful human being can triumph over a bad situation. Crusoe reads his Bible, keeps a calendar and a diary, domesticates goats, develops a working agricultural system, learns pottery, carpentry and other crafts, and builds himself both a summer and a winter domicile. <em>Lord of the Flies,</em> on the contrary, is entirely pessimistic about human capabilities: its flat, book-less, unskilled characters devolve rapidly into war-painted, violent tribesmen. <em>Robinson Crusoe </em>embodied Age of Reason optimism; <em>Lord of the Flies </em>is a post-Nazi novel in which there is no culture, government is nothing more than incipient dictatorship, and religion deteriorates into cruel scapegoating.&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>Why was it imagined that <em>Lord of the Flies </em>had something of value to say about about human nature? It&#39;s a sure thing that if Golding had written a novel in which an isolated group of people behave like reborn Crusoes and work cooperatively to tame the forest and create a communal utopia, he would have been derided as a simpleton. No room in the Cold War inn or on the best-seller lists or in high school curricula for optimism!&#0160;</p>
<p>Golding arranges it so that the descent into barbarism appears to be not circumstantial but inevitable. He banishes from his island women and therefore any need for reciprocity in social institutions. (Violence without heterosexual sex--just what&#39;s needed in the high school classroom!) Moreover, the boys who land on the island are not a representative set of human beings: they are English public school children who&#39;ve already internalized poisonous notions of hierarchy, hazing, power and class. When, at the outset, they choose a chief, they&#39;re really selecting a head boy for whom lesser creatures will &quot;fag.&quot; Of the island&#39;s inhabitants, the only one with more brain than earwax is the physically repulsive Piggy, while the only boy whose instincts are democratic is slow, tongue-tied, and indecisive. Meanwhile, Jack, to whom Golding grants leadership abilities, is a slick soulless demagogue. The author may appear to be impartial, but in fact he&#39;s stacked the deck so that the emergence of a proto-fascism appears &quot;natural.&quot; Golding, both a student and a teacher in English public schools, seems to think that adolescents of his own circle somehow represent common humanity. His analysis of culture is therefore as shallow as a parking-lot puddle. And because it&#39;s so shallow, the novel is a treasure-trove for the kind of teaching where the identification of &quot;symbols&quot; substitutes for genuine thought, or emotion, or aesthetic revelation. It&#39;s a convenient opportunity -- a casebook -- for the kind of bad reading that has damaged generations of students.&#0160;</p>
<p>Golding&#39;s island abounds not in intelligence but in absurdities. Is it credible that three or four pre-adolescent boys armed only with sharpened sticks could a) confront a wild boar and b) actually bring down a mature sow, and that the sow would lie still, or allow herself to be held to the ground while one of the boys repeatedly stabs and eventually kills the animal with a penknife, and c) that the same boys, using no other tools than the single penknife, could quickly skin, butcher and behead the sow, and then d) cut and drive into the ground a post stout enough on which to mount that head?&#0160; Or e) that a few boys could dislodge and push a rock that is &quot;as big as a tank.&quot; Or that f) there could exist an uninhabited Pacific atoll so small that a group of boys could systematically search every inch of it like beaters on a hunt, but yet so large that, without experiencing much in the way of rain, it could have streams and pools of fresh water and, in addition, g) an inexhaustible supply of wild pigs (indigenous? feral?).</p>
<p>If <em>Lord of the Flies</em> is an allegory, then perhaps such howlers don&#39;t matter. Yet even an allegory should not cause a reader to guffaw at inappropriate moments.&#0160;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I was at Peet&#39;s Coffee in Alameda, California this morning, drinking hot chocolate and reading <em>Lord of the Flies</em>. There were three retired guys a couple of tables away, chatting. I overheard the following story:</p>
<p>&quot;He was a lawyer for an intellectual property firm--a big-time litigator. He met this woman and fell in love with her. She wasn&#39;t at all interested. She owned a window-washing company. He quit his job and went to work as a window washer so that he could be close to her.&quot;</p>
<p>That&#39;s as much as I heard, but I would have liked to know what happened next. It&#39;s possible that the lawyer&#39;s perseverance was rewarded. The window-washer lady came to understand that he loved her so much that he was willing to give up his career to follow her. Eventually, she relented, married him, and together they developed the biggest window-washing company in San Francisco. But then again, perhaps she realized that he wasn&#39;t really in love -- in fact, he was one of those obsessive stalkers that regularly appear in horror movies. So she was forced to escape by selling her company, taking a new name, and moving to Pocatello. He continued to wash windows, and started to specialize in eighty-story buildings. One day, he failed to hook his belt properly and fell. No one ever knew if it was an accident or suicide. Meanwhile she was happy in Idaho, where she married a mild-mannered lawyer.</p>
<p>Or --another thought -- he forgot all about her but found that he liked washing windows more than corporate law. But one day, he was hooked outside a skyscraper window, and looked inside and there she was at a meeting. And he fell in love all over again.&#0160;</p>
<p><em>February 13:</em>&#0160; I now think it most likely that he forgot all about the lady, moved to rural Connecticut, changed his name to Seymour Glass, and became a recluse who lived a house with very clean windows.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
