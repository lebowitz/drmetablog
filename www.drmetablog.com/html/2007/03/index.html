		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Just when it appears that our corporately-owned pseudo-local newspaper (the <em>Daily Camera</em>) has hit rock-bottom-nadirhood, it plummets to still another new low. It&#39;s a bottomless cistern.&#0160;</p>
<p>We&#39;re suffering through a horrid local murder. The <em>Camera </em>is covering the story with rare enthusiasm -- trying to elevate it to JonBenet Ramsey celebrity status.&#0160; (It&#39;s the Linda Damm murder. You can look it up <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2007/03/an_imperfect_mu.html">here.</a>)</p>
<p>Some days there&#39;s no news.&#0160; But that doesn&#39;t stop <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2006/10/our_local_newsp.html">Al Manzi</a> and his troops. Let&#39;s try to guess at the four-column headline on the front page of the edition of March 28. Hint: It wasn&#39;t the Iranian capture of British sailors, which might lead to a wider war in the Levant;&#0160; it wasn&#39;t AG Gonzalez kayaking the disinformation rapids;&#0160; it wasn&#39;t the Senate repudiating the Smirker by setting a deadline on Iraq. Nope. Here it is, folks. It&#39;s (drums and trumpets):&#0160;<strong>FINDING A NEW HOME:&#0160; LINDA DAMM&#39;S DOG ADOPTED BY LONG-LOST FRIEND.&#0160;</strong>Linda Damm&#39;s dog!&#0160; Excuse me, but this &quot;news&quot; is not the truth that is going to set us free. This is poverty-stricken intellectually vacant journalism.&#0160;</p>
<p>The story itself is heart-rending. One human life has been lost and several others are ruined. And our newspaper can do no better than run a report on Linda Damm&#39;s dog!&#0160; Have the publisher and his reporters no dignity, no sense of proportion, no shame? &#0160;No ethics. I&#39;m embarrassed to be a reader of this newspaper;&#0160; I&#39;m embarrassed to be a fellow-citizen of its publisher.</p>
<p>Is it true that crude, yellow, lachrymose sensationalism still sells newspapers?&#0160; I guess so.&#0160;</p>
<p><em>March 31</em>.&#0160; I received the following from Spike Schapiro, a friend of my youth.&#0160; As usual, Spike is unhappy with what I&#39;ve written.&#0160; <span style="color: #006633;">&quot;</span><span style="color: #3333cc;">Viv, you&#39;ve lost your bearings.&#0160; You&#39;ve been living in wussy Boulder so long that your brain has turned to tofu. I&#39;d heard that everyone out there was a fey vegan, but I didn&#39;t believe it until I read the Damm dog story in your local rag. Let&#39;s get this straight. Dogs are not placed in &quot;foster homes&quot; -- they&#39;re sent to kennels; they&#39;re not &quot;adopted&quot;, they&#39;re bought and sold; and they don&#39;t have &quot;guardians&quot; -- they have owners.&#0160; Have you people lost the ability to make distinctions? Do you treat all animals as if they were human infants?&#0160; The <em>Camera </em>reporter can&#39;t tell the difference, that&#39;s for sure. I have ten bucks that says that she&#39;s twenty-two years old, graduated with a degree in communication from some off-brand college (probably Bible U.), and prides herself on her &quot;spiritualism&quot; -- by which she means &quot;spirituality.&quot;&#0160; Plus she volunteers with Squirrel Rescue.&#0160; </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #3333cc;">Viv, my friend, get back to your roots! The Camera&#39;s story isn&#39;t just egregious journalism -- it&#39;s immoral trash. Try to recall the intersection of Newkirk and Coney Island, where there wasn&#39;t the luxury for such foolish, fatuous sentimentality.&quot;&#0160; </span></p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Leonardo Sciascia&#39;s laconic and precise &quot;metaphysical mystery&quot; <em>The Day of the Owl (Il Giorno della Civetta, </em>1961) is set in unwholesome, Mafia-dominated Sicily.&#0160; Captain Bellodi and Sgt. Major Ferlisi, dedicated and intelligent police officers, investigate a series of horrific crimes. Their trail leads to the local boss, Don Mariano Arena, but further searching opens the possibility that an &quot;honorable deputy&quot; and a cabinet minister also may be implicated. We&#39;ll never know the whole story -- Bellodi is recalled to Bologna and Ferlisi transferred to Ancona, and the investigation languishes.</p>
<p>In Bush&#39;s America, Congressman Duke Cunningham is convicted of accepting bribes; further investigation appears to implicate &quot;Dusty&quot; Foggo, third in the hierarchy at the CIA. It&#39;s also possible that senior White House officials might be involved&#0160; -- but Carol Lam, the efficient U. S. attorney in charge of the case, is suddenly relieved of her position. The investigation languishes.&#0160;</p>
<p>And also: Jack Abramoff is sent to jail for perjury. The trail of corruption once again appears to lead to the White House -- but the prosecutor, Noel Hillman, is offered a federal judgeship and the investigation grinds to a halt.</p>
<p>At the end of <em>The Day of the Owl</em>, Captain Bellodi, though exhausted and disillusioned, resolves to return to Sicily. He will, it seems, try again. Sciascia&#39;s unhappy novel offers a small ray of hope. It seems to say that it is wrong to succumb to hopelessness and despair in the face of political abuse. A useful moral, I think.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Last October, I decided that one of my herbaceous peonies -- a Prairie Moon, to be precise -- needed to be separated and re-planted. I did the deed, but a few days ago, while cleaning the garden, I found a small, overlooked fragment of a tuber -- six inches in length and no more than half the diameter of a finger -- lying on the ground entirely exposed to the elements. I missed it last autumn, I guess.&#0160; But the good news: while there was no sign of rooting, there was a bud -- and the bud was swelling with new life.&#0160; (It had been a wicked winter, with temperatures down to 10F.)&#0160;</p>
<p>Peony-growers know that it&#39;s important not to plant the roots too deep in the soil. The experts say two inches at the most. My experience is that in our Colorado clay, two inches can be too much, and that peonies so planted may come up spindly and flowerless. But now I know that it&#39;s safe to err on the shallow side.&#0160; Herbaceous peonies are tougher than I imagined -- pretty much impervious to cold.&#0160; Or at least such is the case with this particular variety.</p>
<p>Friends, I can&#39;t tell you how much I admire that tenacious little cylinder of life.&#0160; It&#39;s toughness is inspiring.&#0160; I&#39;ve prepared a burrow for it -- the best in the way of soil and situation that I can offer. Let&#39;s see what it makes of its new opportunity. It&#39;s spring;&#0160; I&#39;m optimistic.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&#0160;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&quot;Just last week, the <em>Washington Post</em> published a pair of articles on &quot;who wrote Shakespeare&#39;s plays.&quot; The one claimed that Shakespeare&#39;s plays were written by Edward de Vere, the seventeenth Earl of Oxford; the other re-asserted the traditional view that William Shakespeare wrote William Shakespeare&#39;s plays. By juxtaposing the two articles -- one for, one against -- the <em>Post </em>is guilty of outrageous anti-intellectualism.The authorship of the Shakespeare plays is not an open question. It&#39;s as if the <em>Post </em>were to offer its readers two articles, one in support of evolution and the other in favor of new-earth creationism. Just as the matter of evolution is a settled question, so the authorship of the plays is not -- and never has been -- in any sort of doubt. The true believers who keep stirring the pot are faith-based cranks, fanatics, and conspiracy theorists who ignore the usual rules of evidence and reason.&#0160; Shame on the <em>Post </em>for giving them a voice!</p>
<p>The nay-sayers discard the historical record and ask this question: is it likely that Shakespeare, with his small-town background and (it&#39;s claimed) limited education, could have written plays that demonstrate a sophisticated knowledge of the law, the court, geography, seamanship, etc?&#0160; As to the matter of likelihood, who could possibly disagree?&#0160; Of course it isn&#39;t likely that these extraordinary plays would have been written by anyone -- but it happened nevertheless. It&#39;s also unlikely that the theory of relativity would have been developed by a civil servant in a Swiss Patent Office; it&#39;s extremely unlikely that the most transcendent music ever written would have been composed by a man who was totally deaf; it&#39;s beyond belief that an autodidact living in intellectual isolation in Madras could single-handedly recreate a big hunk of modern mathematics; it&#39;s more than incredible that a hermit-like lens-grinder living in self-imposed intellectual exile would be one of the western world&#39;s most innovative and progressive philosophers. What is &quot;likely&quot; and what actually happens are two entirely different kettles of fish -- especially when genius is concerned. Despite the unlikeliness, Shakespeare existed and he wrote plays and poems.&#0160; His name is on thirty-six of the plays and his friends and colleagues and contemporary admirers testify not only to his existence but to his accomplishments. Among the thousands of books and the corridors of unpublished manuscripts and records that survive from his time, there&#39;s not a scrap of information to hint that the plays weren&#39;t his. Not a scrap, not a jot, not an inkling, not a tittle.&#0160; Nothing.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>The fallacious claims of the Oxfordians, Baconians, Elizabethians, Rutlandians, et. al. have been refuted time and time again. Here&#39;s a representative sample of the quality of the argument&#0160; -- it&#39;s from the recent <em>Washington Post </em>article. &quot;[It&#39;s unlikely that Shakespeare wrote the plays because he] never left England -- but sixteen of the plays are set in Italy or the Mediterranean.&quot; Persuasive? In what universe must authors travel the world in order to set their plays outside of England?&#0160; Certainly not in the world of Shakespeare and his fellow playwrights. Did Christopher Marlowe travel to Malta in order to compose <em>The Jew of Malta</em> or to the Asian steppe to astonish the world with the Scythian shepherd or to Wittenberg to trouble the orthodox with <em>Doctor Faustus?&#0160; </em>Thomas Kyd never left England, but managed to startle theater-goers with <em>The Spanish Tragedy</em>.&#0160; Ben Jonson never made his way to Italy, but he had no trouble putting <em>Volpone </em>in Venice. John Ford, no traveler, set <em>&#39;Tis Pity She&#39;s a Whore</em> in Parma. John Webster&#39;s two great plays <em>The Duchess of Malfi</em> and <em>The White Devil</em> are set in Italy, a country on which Webster never set eyes. Thomas Middleton&#39;s masterpiece, <em>The Changeling</em> takes place Alicante, in Spain -- but Middleton was a Londoner who never went abroad.&#0160; And so on and on, endlessly. Like his friends and competitors, Shakespeare wrote out of books. He, and they, pillaged the literature for promising stories. If the story happened to have originated in Italy, that&#39;s exactly where it remained. The playwrights were not geographers or social historians and they created not real but literary places.&#0160; Marlowe&#39;s Germany and Middleton&#39;s Spain and Webster&#39;s Italy are no more German or Spanish or Italian than Shakespeare&#39;s Belmont is Belmontian or for that matter, W. S. Gilbert&#39;s <em>Mikado</em> is Japanese.&#0160; Did Shakespeare need to travel to Denmark to write <em>Hamlet</em> or to Vienna to write <em>Measure for Measure?&#0160; </em>It&#39;s nonsensical to think so.&#0160; It&#39;s an argument without a scrap of merit. It&#39;s not honest.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">But is it even a fact that that sixteen of Shakespeare&#39;s plays are set in &quot;Italy or the Mediterranean.&quot; Only by a stretch. Do the sixteen plays include <em>Othello, the Moor of Venice</em> -- four acts of which occur in Cyprus?&#0160; And is the argument that Shakespeare or some other author had to travel to off-the-beaten-Elizabethan-track Cyprus in order to write it?&#0160; Do the sixteen include <em>A Midsummer Night&#39;s Dream, </em>nominally set in Athens but in fact stuffed with English tradesman and English fairies?&#0160; Or <em>The Comedy of Errors</em>, which takes place, in part, in ancient Ephesus in Asia Minor. Or <em>Pericles </em>in Antioch?&#0160;<em>The Tempest </em>occurs on an enchanted island which is called Bermuda but seems to be somewhere between Naples and Libya. Would a playwright need to traverse the Mediterranean in order to bring Ariel and Caliban to life?&#0160; Is it any sort of argument that plays set in the great age of Rome (<em>Julius Caesar, </em><em>Antony and Cleopatra, Titus Andronicus, Coriolanus) </em>required a playwright to abandon his careful reading of North&#39;s Plutarch for a time-travel&#0160;trip to ancient Italy?&#0160; Shakespeare no more had to cross the Alps to write his sixteen plays than he had to board a time machine to dark age Scotland to write <em>Macbeth </em>or teleport himself to ancient Britain in order to write <em>King Lear </em>or <em>Cymbeline.</em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><em>&#0160;</em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">The author of the <em>Post </em>article knows these facts. He knows that the travel argument, and the other tissue-thin assertions that he advances, have been refuted over and over again.&#0160; But like all faith-based controversialists, he does not withdraw or concede or counter. He merely repeats and repeats and repeats, because his personal conviction is prior to and more important than either evidence or reason.&#0160; He&#39;s not conducting a legitimate search for truth; instead, he is in thrall to an irrational and deeply-held conviction. Facts will be bent to support his extra-logical hypothesis. His intellectual processes mimic the creationists, the holocaust-deniers, the flat-earthers. Such minds are not reachable -- but there&#39;s not the slightest reason for a respectable newspaper to give them space.&quot;</p>
<p><span style="color: #3399ff;">Thanks, Pauline. I couldn&#39;t have said it any better myself.&#0160; V.</span></p>

                                <p>The most glorious fictions that I&#39;ve read in many years are late writings by two nineteenth-century masters. The first is Leo Tolstoy&#39;s <em>Hadji Murad; </em>the second, Gustave Flaubert&#39;s <em>A Simple Heart. Hadji Murad </em>(published posthumously in 1912) is a novella on the subject of war and its follies<em>. A Simple Heart </em>(1877) is a short story about an exploited servant woman who finds a bit of beauty in an ugly world. They&#39;re both absolutely transcendent stories -- &quot;beyond beyond,&quot; as Shakespeare says.&#0160;</p>
<p><em>April 2.&#0160; </em>Additional recommendations. I&#39;ve now read three &quot;detective&quot; novels by Leonardo Sciascia. They are all superior creations, although their open-endedness might be disappointing to people who expect that mysteries must be resolved and that criminals should be brought to justice. They&#39;re not genre fiction; they&#39;re writings that cleverly expand and question the crime genre. The novels:&#0160; <em>he Day of the Owl&#0160; (1961), To Each His Own </em>(1966)<em>, Equal Danger </em>(1971)<em>, -- </em>all reprinted in attractive, reader-friendly editions by New York Review Books. I&#39;ll be looking for more Sciascia on the library shelves. Also, <em>You Know Me All, </em>by Ring Lardner, an excellent baseball novel first published in 1916. It holds up well, although the humor leans heavily on &quot;country bumpkin&quot; stereotypes.&#0160;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>From the get-go, our internationally-renowned neighborhood scandal, the JonBenet Ramsey murder, had TV movie written all over it.&nbsp; It had upper-class sheen, infant-beauty-pageant perversity, and tantalizing whodunnitness.&nbsp; Our latest local murder lacks all such glamor.&nbsp; The characters are sad, dumb, and pathetic and, to make matters worse, everyone already knows whodidit.&nbsp; Fodder for what sort of film?&nbsp; The answer should be screamingly obvious to movie aficionados. </p>

<p>Here are the facts as they have been extensively reported locally.&nbsp; Tess Damm (note transparent symbolism of name), an in-and-out-of-trouble somewhat trashy 15-year-old, persuades her boyfriend, Bryan Grove, to kill her alcoholic and abusive mother Linda.&nbsp; Bryan obediently does the deed by stabbing Mom Damm in the &quot;throat and mouth.&quot;&nbsp; The kids, however, don't have a clue how to dispose of the body, so they stow it in the back seat of the Subaru.&nbsp; While it festers, the young 'uns cavort.&nbsp; Neighbors tell reporters that that &quot;the teens were seen coming and going at all hours of the night, 'car-surfing' through the neighborhood and blaring loud music.&quot;&nbsp; After a raucous month of celebration in which they spend the $4000 in Mom's bank account, the murderers come to the realization that it might be good idea to dispose of the evidence.&nbsp; They solicit the aid of third young malefactor.&nbsp; (Possible dialog:&nbsp; <em>Bryan:&nbsp; </em>&quot;Hey dude, want to, like, help us get rid of a, like, corpse.&quot; <em>Jared:&nbsp; </em>&quot;Cool.&quot;) They head out to the Erie landfill, but the car gets stuck in the mud and so they return home.&nbsp; The next night, they try again: they drive to a local cemetery (a stroke of pure cinematic genius!) but because the ground is frozen, they can dig only one or two feet into the ground.&nbsp; The bury the body, but, panicked that the shallow grave will be noticed, they return the next night, exhume Mom and return her to the Subaru.&nbsp; At this point, just as the story is becoming weirder than weird, an &quot;anonymous tipster&quot; notifies the police and thereby cries &quot;cut&quot; to the youthful criminals.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p>It's probably too morbid and half-baked for a broadcast TV movie, but can anyone deny that the story is made to order for Joel and Ethan Coen?&nbsp; Some typical Coen Brothers elements:&nbsp; truly sleazy characters; rampant brainlessness;&nbsp; the inability of the participants to look even a few moments into the future;  gruesome details;&nbsp; gratuitous blood and gore;&nbsp; very, very, black humor;&nbsp; and, finally, the opportunity to satirize American <em>mores</em>.&nbsp; What could be more perfect?&nbsp; &nbsp;It's a Coen Brothers world after all.&nbsp; Can the argument be taken a step further?&nbsp; The adventures of Tess and Bryan and Linda couldn't possibly have occurred until Joel and Ethan had made and exhibited <em>Blood Simple</em> and <em>Fargo.&nbsp; </em>The murder -- and the macabre and superbly noir series of actions that follow -- would not have been possible without a literary precedent.&nbsp; Once gain, Life can do no better than slavishly tread in the Footsteps of Art.&nbsp; </p>

		<a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2007/03/more_on_ninetee.html">More on Nineteenth-Century Horsedrawn Conveyances</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>A year or so ago, I <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2006/01/new_words.html">confessed</a> that when I read novels that take place in pre-internal combustion days, I don&#39;t clearly distinguish among various horsedrawn conveyances -- they&#39;re all coaches to me. I have no mental image of &quot;fly,&quot; &quot;trap,&quot; &quot;landau,&quot; &quot;chaise,&quot; &quot;phaeton,&quot; &quot;cabriolet,&quot; &quot;sulky,&quot; &quot;surrey,&quot; &quot;curricle,&quot; &quot;gig,&quot; &quot;hansom,&quot; &quot;buggy,&quot; &quot;four-wheeler,&quot; or &quot;spring-van.&quot;&#0160; The pictorial or social resonance of these colorful names is something to which I&#39;m pretty much tone-deaf.&#0160;</p>
<p>I was therefore amused when just yesterday I happened upon the following passage in Flaubert&#39;s <em>Sentimental Education (</em>completed in 1869 but set in the 1840s).&#0160; Frederic and Rosanette attend the horse races in a &quot;berlin.&quot;&#0160; Stuck in traffic, they find themselves surrounded by a crestomathy of carriages: <span style="color: #0066cc;">&quot;barouches, britchkas, wurts, tandems, tilburies, dog-carts, covered wagonnettes with leather curtains full of singing workmen out on the spree, and go-carts carefully driven by fathers of families.&#0160; There were crowded victorias in which some young man would be sitting on the feet of other passengers, with his legs dangling over the side. Big broughams with cloth-covered seats carried dozing dowagers; and occasionally a magnificent high-stepper went by, drawing a post-chaise as simple and smart as a dandy&#39;s tail-coat.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I&#39;m positive that Flaubert chose his words carefully and I&#39;m equally sure that he had no premonition that his vocabulary would be obsolescent in just fifty years and incomprehensible in a hundred. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Every contemporary novelist knows that it matters whether his hero arrives in a Jeep or a Jaguar or a jalopy. If his book will be read in a later century, extinct and quaint words such as &quot;pickup,&quot; &quot;step-van,&quot; &quot;SUV,&quot; &quot;Buick,&quot; &quot;station wagon,&quot; &quot;jeep,&quot; &quot;hummer,&quot; &quot;flat-bed,&quot; and &quot;Subaru&quot; will be annotated with copious scholarly footnotes. And the words to songs as well. How much scholarship and how many sentences will it take to fully explicate &quot;We&#39;ll have fun, fun, fun/ Until Daddy takes the T-bird away?&quot;&#0160; &#0160; </span></p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>My first writing instrument was the &quot;straight pen,&quot; which was more durable but not different in conception from the goose quill -- simply a metal nib set into a wooden dowel. It was quite a trick for a six-year-old to carry a small drop of ink from the inkwell and draw a line or circle without blotting -- especially since there was a wartime shortage of quality paper and the the stuff that was substituted was coarse and maximally absorbent. At P. S. 217, in the 1940s, each classroom had an &quot;ink monitor,&quot; whose job was to mix a dry powder with water in a tall jug and fill all the inkwells. Every desk had an inch-in-diameter hole in the upper right corner -- southpaws were expected to conform -- with a brass fitting into which a small glass removable &quot;well&quot; was inserted. I got myself into serious trouble for dunking the end of one of Josephine Casalino&#39;s long black braids into my inkwell-- though I believe that I was neither the first nor only boy who succumbed to so obvious a temptation. From the perspective of 2007, it&#39;s hard to believe that dexterity with the straight pen was still part of the curriculum -- it was as though we were being prepared to clerk in some gloomy Dickensian counting-house.</p>
<p>I think that ballpoint pens arrived in the early 50s, but they were flighty at first and regularly leaked onto the page or in the pocket. I remember that my right thigh was dyed a perpetual blue. In 1956, setting off for college, I invested $20 in a second-hand self-styled &quot;portable&quot; but nevertheless very heavy Smith-Corona. I would not have plunked down so much cash if I hadn&#39;t thought that I was making the purchase of a lifetime. After all, the typewriter had represented the state of the writing art for eighty years -- ever since Remington had taken Christopher Latham Scholes&#39; invention into the mass market -- and I had no suspicion that it would ever be superseded. Nevertheless, the mechanical typewriter was obsolete by the 1960s, when I composed a document of several hundred pages on a borrowed IBM Selectric. Not only did the electric typewriter produce a more handsome page, but it made acceptable carbon copies. (Carbon paper is unknown to younger generations and is now only found in archaeological digs; it&#39;s shocking that internet-era folks have no clue that &quot;cc&quot; abbreviated &quot;carbon copy&quot;.) The heyday of the electric typewriter was brief --twenty years or so. Sometime in the early 1980s, I was introduced to word processing -- at first on an Apple 2+. Its dot-matrix printer was nasty (no true extenders) and the hazardous program took perverse pleasure in displaying ominous messages, such as &quot;Fatal Error # 45.&quot;&#0160; After a while, I moved to Wordstar, then to WordPerfect, and now, to whatever Typepad provides for this essaylet. Could my straight-pen self have possibly imagined that I would someday amuse myself with a self-published, self-edited internet blogazine?&#0160; Meanwhile, my once-magnificent writer&#39;s bump has atrophied. It&#39;s gone the way of carbon paper and white-out.&#0160; </p>
<p>Information-gathering has been equally transformed. In the 1950s, data had to be painfully copied by hand onto index cards, which were easy to misplace, misfile, and misread. Sometime in the late 1960s I first started to make copies of book and journal pages -- at first using a very smelly, expensive process, the name of which I can&#39;t recall, which could only make crude and blurry negatives, but was still far more efficient than copying by hand. It wasn&#39;t long before Xerox rendered all previous copy systems obsolete.&#0160; Then came the internet which made things easier still -- although for any depth of knowledge --let&#39;s not fool ourselves -- books are still the only way.&#0160; &#0160; </p>
<p>At a library that I patronize, someone has taken fifty or so old wooden card files and assembled them into a sculpture of sorts. It&#39;s titled Top Drawer Society. For a donation -- I haven&#39;t inquired how large -- you can have your name inscribed on a drawer&#39;s brass plate. I couldn&#39;t begin to estimate how much time I spent searching through card catalogs in my lifetime: thousands of hours, I&#39;d guess. I never anticipated that so useful an item as a tray of cards would be transformed into mere ornament and into a gesture to an antiquated technology.</p>
<p>There&#39;s no question that innovations in writing and researching in my lifetime are greater than anything that&#39;s happened since Gutenberg. I now know that change will continue, but I have no more insight into the future than I did when I plied my straight pen in first grade. What could possibly be out there beyond the wordprocessing horizon?&#0160; </p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>During my Erasmus Hall High School years, the hottest of all &quot;hot&quot; books was Irving Shulman&#39;s <em>The Amboy Dukes.</em> It was official doctrine that a single oblique glance at the inflammatory cover of this paperback could transform a well-behaved kid into a murderous, reefer-crazed, oversexed hooligan. Simply to read about the &quot;juvenile delinquents&quot; who populate <em>The Amboy Dukes</em> was to wander into a criminal twilight. A guy definitely did not want his mommy to know that he had heard of this book, let alone possessed a sticky contraband copy.</p>
<p>What was all the fuss about?&#0160; Why was the book condemned all over America and even banned (for a while) in Canada?&#0160; &#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a paragraph that was much brooded upon in the local schoolyard. (I&#39;ve since learned that some 1950s moralists condemned it as pornographic -- and perhaps they were right.)</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">They </span><span style="color: #3333ff;">pushed onto the bus, and Frank watched Black Kenny and Mike get a nice-looking broad between them and give her a rub. Mike and Kenny hemmed the girl between them, skillfully pocketing her to prevent her escape. In her eyes there was loathing and fear of the two hoodlums, who did not look at her but nevertheless pressed against her lasciviously, pinioning her against their rigid hot bodies. Mike pushed against the girl&#39;s buttocks, thighs, and legs, while Kenny pressed against her stomach and breasts. The girl wanted to scream, to cry out, but she was afraid....</span></p>
<p>Ugly to be sure, abusive, sexist, nasty, but still rather tame by later standards. It&#39;s an effort of will to remember that during the Eisenhower years, words such as &quot;breasts&quot; and &quot;buttocks&quot; were not uttered casually and that their appearance on the printed page was rare and incendiary. But I don&#39;t think it was the language alone, or even the stark portrayal of adolescents in heat that rattled polite society. It was the intrusion of viciousness in the tame 1950s father-knows-best twin-bed universe that provoked the reaction. That &quot;nice-looking broad&quot; whom Mike and Black Kenny molest was, or was imagined to be, some respectable family&#39;s sister or daughter. Just as the two hoods thrust themselves against the young woman, so <em>The Amboy Dukes</em> flaunted itself in the face of respectability. The proper middle class went to great lengths not to acknowledge that brutes such as Black Kenny and Mike were their next-door neighbors. The Eisenhower era lived in denial; there were some things that everyone knew but of which no one spoke. In <em>The Amboy Dukes, </em>Shulman spilled the beans.&#0160;</p>
<p>That&#39;s why <em>The Amboy Dukes </em>fascinated the guys who hung around the P. S. 217 schoolyard. Unlike our parents, we couldn&#39;t choose to deny the existence of psychopaths such as Black Kenny and Crazy Shak (the novel&#39;s rapist and murderer). Guys like that smoked and spit on every street corner and disrupted many of our classrooms. We had to negotiate with violence or with the threat of violence every day. To read <em>The Amboy Dukes </em>was oddly refreshing; it validated the daily reality of teen-agers who weren&#39;t gang members.</p>
<p>Moreover, the novel had a strong vicarious appeal. While my friends were trying to manage their hormones, keep up with their schoolwork and occasionally get in a good game of basketball or stickball, the Dukes were cutting class, punching out their teachers, smoking dope, and getting laid. Reading the novel let us share in some of that other-side-of-the-track forbidden fruit. But it allowed us to participate safely. <em>The Amboy Dukes</em>, like so many such scandalous publications, is at heart a cautionary novel. Frank Abbot, the central character, is a bad guy but he&#39;s appealing and not irredeemable; he goes too far, gets in over his head, and winds up dead -- a warning to all of us. <em>The Amboy Dukes </em>allowed &quot;normal&quot; kids to enjoy the novel&#39;s transgressive moments and still return safely to the nest.</p>
<p>Although <em>The Amboy Dukes </em><span style="color: #000000;">sold millions of copies, I couldn&#39;t find it in any of the libraries that I use. Through the miracle of the internet, I was able to buy a tattered, yellowed-pages-unglued 35-cent 1949 Avon paperback. The object itself is a piece of history. On the cover, a woman with flaming red hair resists the embraces of a dark and handsome young man. Their facial expressions (he: lustful; she: fearful) are highly melodramatic, but the pair are dressed conservatively, as though they&#39;ve just returned from a day of yachting. Also on the cover are a couple of claims to literary merit: &quot;The one book that tells the inside story of juvenile delinquency no other novel has told before.&quot; And an appeal to the moralists: &quot;This book is emphatically a reading &#39;must&#39;&quot; --Edwin J. Lukas, Executive Director, Society for the Prevention of Crime.&quot; Finally, in almost unreadable tiny print, &quot;This book is specially revised and edited for Avon Books&quot; -- an admission that leads me to guess that the paperback mass edition expurgated some words or events that were deemed too strong for the kids who bought the cheap edition and concealed it inside their official three-ring binders.&#0160;</span></p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>It appears to be the case that martyrs of a certain persuasion will be rewarded in the afterlife with the ministrations of seventy-two virgins. It would take a theologian of extraordinary skill to explain why acts of violence should be rewarded with sexual indulgence. I raise a far less knotty question: if the aim is bliss, then why virgins?&#0160; Why not women of experience and expertise? Benjamin Franklin, the most practical of our Founding Fathers, was dogmatic on this nice point: shun the callow in favor of women who&#39;ve been around the block, because &quot;every Knack... by Practice [is] capable of improvement.&quot;&#0160; I think that B-Frank would agree that there is something about the virgins-for-martyrs deal that&#39;s kind of, how shall I say, impractical or counter-intuitive or even, dare I say, kinky.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a second theological conundrum. What is the reward when the martyr is herself female? I must presume that she will be blessed with seventy-two male virgins -- if not, there&#39;s a very serious afterlife asymmetry. Not to reward females who give themselves to the cause would be a statement that the culture of religious martyrdom does not support sexual equality, which I can hardly bring myself to believe. But in the case of female martyrs, the matter of sexual expertise is further exacerbated. Specifically, of what conceivable value are seventy-two knackless male virgins? If we postulate that each male virgin is good for between ten and fifteen seconds of actual intercourse, it follows that they will be consumed at the rate of four to six every minute, which means that on average a martyress, however patient, would enjoy a sum of only twelve or so minutes of pleasure (setting aside time for re-mounting and repositioning), which is surely insufficient exercise to produce a meaningful let alone heavenly experience.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>Nor will it be all that great for the male virgin at the end of the queue who has to settle for sloppy seventy-seconds.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
