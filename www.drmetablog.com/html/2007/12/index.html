		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Diligent readers of this blague will recall that last January, I made a series of daring forecasts about the year 2007.&nbsp; It's now time to review my projections and evaluate my record.&nbsp; I'm proud to say that a panel of independent experts has confirmed that I hit the jackpot.&nbsp; I scored an 8 out of 8, 100%, A+.&nbsp; I'm now a fully accredited prophet.</p>

<p>These were my 2007 predictions:&nbsp; </p>

<p>&quot;1)&nbsp; there will be unusual weather patterns in North America;</p>

<p>2)&nbsp; a famous Hollywood actress will sue for divorce;&nbsp; moreover, another (or possibly the same) Hollywood star will become pregnant; another (or possibly the same) actress will gain and lose a great deal of weight;&nbsp; </p>

<p>3)&nbsp; a well-known athlete will be accused of taking drugs;</p>

<p>4)&nbsp; a politician will be involved in a sex scandal;</p>

<p>5)&nbsp; questions will be raised about America's food supply;</p>

<p>6)&nbsp; there will be either a monsoon, an airplane crash, or a capsized ferry in Asia--perhaps all three;</p>

<p>7)&nbsp; there will be fluctuations in the stock market, and, finally, </p>

<p>8)&nbsp; there will be turmoil in the Middle East.&quot;</p>

<p>Did I score big-time,or what?&nbsp; Note especially #4.&nbsp; How did I know that &quot;wide-stance&quot; would become a household phrase?&nbsp; &nbsp;Boggles the imagination.&nbsp; Moreover, stock market fluctuations have been greater than even I could have hoped for (same with Mideast turmoil).&nbsp; Concerning athletes and drugs, just think &quot;Barry Bonds&quot; and &quot;Mitchell Report.&quot;&nbsp; I knocked that one out of the park. </p>

<p>Is everyone ready for my 2008 predictions?&nbsp; </p>

<p>I'm staying with 1-8.&nbsp; But I'm going out on a limb with #9:&nbsp; &quot;A religious leader will be involved in either a financial or a sexual scandal (perhaps both).&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;And #10:&nbsp; &quot;Questions will be raised about the accuracy of the vote count.&quot;</p>

<p>You read it here first.&nbsp; Loyal readers: check back at the end of 2008.&nbsp; Let's see if Dr. M. can top his scintillating successes of 2007.&nbsp; </p>

                                <p>We were in the car heading toward Palo Alto when I brought up the old bromide that in the English language, a person drives on a parkway and parks on a driveway.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Immediately, my fellow-passengers began to list other roadways that contained the element ”way.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; &nbsp;Hi</span>ghway, superhighway, freeway (and its opposite, tollway) came immediately to mind.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then came throughway, expressway (called in England ‘dual carriageway’), broadway, runway,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>pathway, footway, byway, subway, tramway, and skyway.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After a while, some less common words arrived:&nbsp; gangway, passageway, arborway (Boston only, as far as I know;&nbsp; Boston has also given us fenway), fairway, alleyway and causeway.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To what cause does a causeway subscribe?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>None; the word ultimately derives from Latin <em>calx</em>, limestone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; As we came closer to home: </span>doorway, hallway, archway, entranceway, stairway, breezeway.</p>

<p>Ah, wellaway, there must be many others.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p>Well, why do we<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>drive on a parkway and park on a driveway?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Hey, why does your nose run and your feet smell?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span>Why is catnapping pleasurable but kidnapping reprehensible?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span>It’s the way of language; it’s wordway.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p class="EC_MsoNormal">In 1895, my grandparents wisely left the abysmal, backward Ukraine and struck out for the new world. Nine years later, my father was born in a cold-water flat in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn. The date of his birth: December 22, 1904, exactly at the winter solstice. &quot;And they called his name, Emanuel, God with us.&quot; If he had been born in the old country, before the Russian authorities imposed legal cognomina upon us, he would have been named Emanuel ben Isaiah--his father&#39;s name appended to his own as a patronymic.</p>
<p class="EC_MsoNormal">Despite his traditional moniker and his commitment to the essence of Judaism, my father was fiercely hostile to the irrationalities of religion. His view -- and my grandfather Isaiah&#39;s even more strongly--was that for a thousand years our lineage had been kept in poverty and darkness not just by the czars but also by the rabbis. In politics, my father and grandfather began as socialists and became New Dealers; in philosophy, they rejected theological doctrine and were among the children of the enlightenment whom Moses Mendelssohn had led to the promised land of evidence and reason. I doubt that any of my ancestors knew Karl Marx&#39;s sentence that &quot;the criticism of religion is the beginning of all criticism,&quot; but they acted as if they had absorbed it from the cradle. My brothers and I were taught to resist religious exclusivity, superstition, and ceremony.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p class="EC_MsoNormal">We now have a religious controversy in our peaceful, progressive, and largely secular western town. A group of orthodox Jews have petitioned the city council for permission to construct an <em>eruv</em>. What is an <em>eruv</em>?&#0160; It’s a “symbolic boundary that allows orthodox Jews to carry things, including their own children, outside their home during the Sabbath.&quot; (Carrying is considered work, and orthodoxy&#39;s strict interpretation of religious law prohibits any sort of sabbatical labor.) A latter-day <em>eruv </em>is constructed out of fishing line that is strung on utility poles; curiously, it may incorporate functioning electric and telephone wires.</p>
<p class="EC_MsoNormal">I know that my forbears detested <em>eruvim </em>and similar expressions of irrational piety. I myself am not enraged by these useless but harmless superstitions.&#0160; Constructing an <em>eruv </em>does not endanger our species; it&#39;s not like opposing contraception or prohibiting stem-cell research. An <em>eruv </em>consoles the believers and doesn&#39;t much bother the rest of us. Yet if there is a spirit in the sky, which I very much doubt, I would hope that he would not be so small-minded as to issue ukases about carrying infants on Saturdays; infants should be carried as much as they want, which is just about everywhere and always. And if any god were so narrow as to promulgate an inside/outside-the-home rule, I would hope that he would be intelligent enough not to be flummoxed by such transparent trickery as hanging mylar filament on poles.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p class="EC_MsoNormal">I have no intuitive conception of god, but I think that the orthodox trivialize our shared longing for transcendence when they sanctify such petty practices. It would be far more pious for the orthodox to take every nickel spent to appease the Ancient of Days and bestow it on a poor Jewish family from Tashkent.&#0160; If these folks can&#39;t locate eligible Jews, there are Hondurans and Sudanese a-plenty who deserve their attention. When the orthodox re-direct their enthusiasm and their resources toward truly charitable enterprises, they will honor the universal immigrant experience and they will also practice the very worthy Jewish virtue of compassion. Constructing an eruv is a foolish waste of time and fishing line.</p>
<p class="EC_MsoNormal">Here&#39;s my father&#39;s view:&#0160; &quot;It took us hundreds of years to fight our way out of the ghetto and they want to put themselves back in jail. If the rabbis had their way,&quot; he would say, &quot;Mahler and Bernstein and Gershwin would play accordion in a klezmer band in Bialystok, Einstein would balance the books for a caftan maker in Kiev, and a hundred and fifty Jewish Nobel Prize winners would spend their days davening in some dirty dim synagogue in Vilna.&quot;</p>
<p class="EC_MsoNormal">I think it’s in a Wallace Markfield novel that an old Jewish guy confronts a group of twenty-something Jewish hippies/slackers in Miami Beach. After a heated discussion, he admonishes them:&#0160; &quot;And don&#39;t ever be ashamed that you’re Jewish. It’s enough that I’m ashamed that you’re Jewish.&quot;</p>
<p class="EC_MsoNormal">Which is pretty much how I feel about the <em>eruvistas</em>. Well, not exactly ashamed. Embarrassed, perhaps, by their superstitious infatuation with the &quot;dark backward and abysm of time.&quot;&#0160;</p>

                                <p>Our own dreams are fascinating to ourselves but not particularly interesting to others (exceptions to the general rule are the dreams recounted and expounded in Freud's <em>Interpretation)</em>.&nbsp; I know that I presume upon my readers to record the following nightmare.&nbsp; I do so only because it's such a shocking fantasia. </p>

<p>I was in a jewelry store with my wife somewhere on the Continent and we were about to purchase a small gold medallion.&nbsp; It was tarnished;&nbsp; I called the hint of greenness to the attention of the middle-aged, bald salesman.&nbsp; At his instruction, I rubbed the medallion with my thumb until it began to shine.&nbsp; Just as I did so, I noticed that the salesman's flaccid pecker was hanging out of the fly of his pants;&nbsp; I said, &quot;OK, that's too weird, we're out of here.&quot;&nbsp; We hurried to leave but the door to the shop was locked.&nbsp; The salesman, who now looked menacing (the dream began to take on the ambience of a horror movie), reached into his pocket and pulled out a key --strangely enough, a large, castle-size key.&nbsp; He flourished it and opened the door for us to leave, but there was another locked door behind the first.&nbsp; He took another key, equally large, out of his pocket and opened the second door.&nbsp; There was still another door and I began to think that we'd never get out of the shop.&nbsp; Then the salesman reached deep into his pocket, pulled out a large hunting knife and cut off his own dingus right at the root.&nbsp; At this point I decided that I'd had enough and woke up. </p>

<p>Hey, don't tell me that I suffer from castration anxiety.&nbsp; I don't, despite what the dream seems to say.&nbsp; I hate to give such fodder to Freudians, but I don't invent these dreams, I just report them.&nbsp; And yes, I'm well aware that a key is reputed to be a phallic symbol.&nbsp; </p>

<p>I'd welcome interpretations that don't make the dreamer out to be infantile, maniacal, or excessively StephenKIngish.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Yesterday I considered the near-incest situations of Philip Roth and Woody Allen.&nbsp; In Roth's <em>My Life as a Man, </em>Roth's shadow Nathan Zuckerman marries Lydia Kettering and when she commits suicide he takes up with Monica, who is Lydia's sixteen-year-old daughter by a previous marriage.&nbsp; When Lydia turns twenty-one, Zucerkman proposes marriage but she, wiser than her step-father, declines.&nbsp; I do not know whether Zuckerman's borderline incest had a precedent in Roth's real life.&nbsp; I do know that Roth's doppelganger Woody Allen eventually married Soon-yi Farrow Previn and that he has adopted two children with her.&nbsp; (The woodman now has five offspring in his complex family, including two adopted and one created in the downright way with Mia Farrow.&nbsp; Child-averse Roth seems to have avoided paternity.) </p>

<p>While reading <em>My Life as a Man </em>I've also been watching movies by Nicholas Ray.&nbsp; Last night I saw <em>In a Lonely Place </em>(1950) with Humphrey Bogart and Gloria Grahame.&nbsp; I recommend it to all who love film.&nbsp; It's tough and intelligent, filled with great dialog, brilliant lighting, excellent music and stylish direction.&nbsp; Trust me, It will hold your interest and give you something to admire.&nbsp; Gloria Grahame steals the show;&nbsp; she's just as good and much more subtle than Humph.</p>

<p>I didn't know anything about Grahame's career and life, so I looked her up on the standard databases.&nbsp; Her life was so unusual that I might even try to track down a biography.</p>

<p>With the Roth/Allen/incest theme on my mind, I discovered these facts about Gloria Grahame.&nbsp; In 1948, Grahame married director Nicholas Ray and gave birth to a son who was named Timothy.&nbsp; She and Ray were divorced;&nbsp; in 1960, Gloria married Anthony Ray, Nicholas Ray's son, and subsequently gave birth to two more boys, Anthony Jr. and James.&nbsp; &nbsp;She had biological children by both father and son and has therefore left incest-flirters Roth and Allen in her dust.&nbsp; What an achievement!</p>

<p>Query:&nbsp; Tim, Anthony Jr, and James are half-brothers -- but are they also uncle and nephew?&nbsp; &nbsp;Half-cousins?&nbsp; Cousins?&nbsp; &nbsp; I never fully grasped the theory of relativity.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>A few days ago, noting that their careers and obsessions converge in ways that seem uncanny, I <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2007/11/roths-portnoys.html">suggested</a> that Philip Roth and Woody Allen were not just doppelgangers, but might in fact be one and the same person.&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="color: black; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;;">I&#39;ve just now read Roth&#39;s 1970 novel <em>My Life as a Man, </em>which must be the most self-consciously narcissistic &quot;fiction&quot; ever written<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>-- at least since Ben Jonson’s <em>Fountain of Self-Love </em>four hundred and seven years ago.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>The novel is a large helping of Philip Roth, followed by more Philip Roth and with a dollop of Philip Roth to the side.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> <em>My Life as a Man </em></span>purports to be drawn from the writings of Peter Tarnopol, who is one of the Roth’s many alter egos. The first part of the novel comprises two short stories by Tarnopol, so-called, about a character named Nathan Zuckerman (the very Zuckerman destined to evolve into the most highly developed of Roth’s self-projections -- Roth’s very own alter-ego-issimus). So here&#39;s the design of <em>My Life as a Man: </em>Roth, writing as Tarnopol, writes about Zuckerman, who is Roth himself. It’s a closed loop, a totalizing tautology, a pleonasm brought to perfection -- a literary eruv with nothing inside but Roth hisself.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: black; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;;">In the latter part of the novel, the psychoanalyst Abraham Spielvogel amusingly diagnoses Tarnopol as &quot;one of the top young narcissists in the arts.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>But gosh, just because R/T/Z can poke fun at his self-love (sometimes called autoeroticism) doesn’t mean that the novel becomes less oppressively claustrophobic.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: black; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;;">While reading <em>My Life as a Man, </em>I couldn&#39;t help thinking, “does Roth do anything other than act like Belmondo looking at himself in the mirror?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>does he have interests other than Roth?”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: black; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;;">Like Roth, Woody Allen appears in his own works as a familiar continuing persona –- he&#39;s always more or less the same guy: bespectacled, nervous, death and sex obsessed, self-mocking, a deliverer of one-liners -- who may not be Allen but is certainly constructed of woodyallenian raw materials. Allen’s collected works, like Roth’s, approximate an autobiography.&#0160; </span></p>
<p><span style="color: black; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;;">It&#39;s clear that one element of their doppelgangerism is their almost equivalent obssession with self.&#0160; But there are also more precise parallels.&#0160; &#0160; <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: black; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;;">In &quot;Useful Fictions,&quot; which is one of the short stories that comprise the first part of <em>My Life as a Man, </em>Peter Tarnopol tells the story of Nathan Zuckerman&#39;s disastrous marriage to a woman named Lydia Kettering. (It&#39;s a most puzzling liaison, because Zuckerman dislikes -- actually hates -- Lydia right from the start. Roth/Tarnopol claims that<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; exogamous </span>Zuckerman is enthralled or perhaps even hypnotized by Lydia&#39;s difference -– by her distinctly unJewish, unbourgeois, uneducated, undisciplined personality.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span>But Zuckerman’s attraction to her is inadequately explicated; it makes him seem not enigmatic but dull, dense, pathetic and ultimately incomprehensible. It&#39;s not the character who&#39;s flawed; it&#39;s the artistry of the writer. </span><span style="color: black; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;;">After some lunatic adventures, the Zuckerman/Kettering marriage begins to collapse. And then Zuckerman takes a shine to Lydia&#39;s daughter Monica, whom he met when she was just ten years old. (Cf. V. Nabokov, <em>Lolita, 1</em>959).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>After Lydia’s suicide, Zuckerman takes sixteen-year-old Monica to his bed and to Italy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>When she turns twenty-one and is technically no longer his ward, he proposes marriage. She refuses him. Smart girl.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: black; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;;">Here’s the question, class.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>Can anyone recall the name of a prominent film writer and director who formed a relationship with the daughter of his longtime companion?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; Let me give you a hint: </span>Roth grew up just west of Manhattan in Newark; the director in question hails from just east of Manhattan in Brooklyn.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>No hands?&#0160; No takers? Let me offer another hint:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>the young lady in question is named Soon-yi Farrow Previn.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>Anyone want to take a guess?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span>Yes, that’s right, it’s Woody Allen, whose romance with Mia Farrow’s daughter scandalized the nation in 1992.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: black; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;;">Omigod!&#0160; Woody did in the &#39;90s what Phil fictionalized in the &#39;70s:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> he married his </span>wife’s daughter.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: black; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;;">Did Woody read and study <em>My Life as a Man</em>?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span>Did both men imagine that <em>Lolita </em>was designed as a how-to guide to sexual manners? Or was there something in the seltzer that provoked both of these guys to dabble with the incest taboo?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>What, in other words, gives?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> Are Roth and Allen joined at the hip or at the area adjacent to the hip or are they in fact the same person?&#0160; Stay tuned as we explore this continuing mystery.</span></span></p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Shakespeare's audiences were notoriously raucous.&nbsp; Folks entered and left during performances, commented loudly on the action and the actors, and ate oranges and hazelnuts during performances.&nbsp; (When the Rose Theater was excavated in 1994, its floor was found to be paved with crushed hazelnut litter.)&nbsp; The Rose, the Globe, and the Fortune were noisy, busy, vital places, far different from today's excessively reverent theaters.&nbsp; I wish it were otherwise.&nbsp; I would be much more interested in live theater if I didn't feel that I was stepping into a museum or mausoleum.&nbsp; Why shouldn't we voice our approval or disapproval?&nbsp; A vigorous environment did not inhibit gentle Will.&nbsp; Nowadays we have more Awe but less Art.&nbsp; </p>

<p>I feel the same about visits to the symphony (but I'm more tolerant, especially on a Brahms or Beethoven evening).&nbsp; The ritual of concert-going amuses me: the various instrumentalists wandering to their places, then the concertmaster, then at last the maestro, the polite applause, the bowing, etc.&nbsp; There's an old story about &quot;the man from Borneo&quot;&nbsp; -- when Borneo was synonymous with the end of the earth -- who was taken to the Boston Philharmonic.&nbsp; After the concert, the M from B was asked, &quot;Which part of the concert did you like best.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;Before the man with the stick came on.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Yesterday I went to see our local university basketball team. It wasn't a very good game and my mind wandered to the elements of the ritual:&nbsp; first the warming up, then the teams leave the court, then the Star-Spangled Banner, then the overexcited introduction of the starters, (&quot;at six five from San Bernadino California&quot;) and of course the blond perky cheerleaders with their theatrical enthusiasm and familiar tumbling routines.&nbsp; And the band, playing their hearts out during the TV timeouts.&nbsp; It's all so very schematized and overdetermined.&nbsp; But exciting nevertheless.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

<p>Both the symphony and the basketball game are highly ritualized, but I have to admit that on the whole, I'm more comfortable at the arena than at the concert hall.&nbsp; Especially when I have to cough; nothing more awkward than trying to suppress a cough during a pianissimo passage -- especially for those of us who are inordinately sensitive to social censure.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>I wish the symphonies could incorporate some of the vitality of basketball.&nbsp; At the arena, the members of the band swing their trombones to left and right.&nbsp; Why couldn't the violins and violas give us a little of that?&nbsp; And then we have the tuba cheer, where the tubists come on court and whirl in rapid circles.&nbsp; What an opportunity for cellos and double-basses to show off their skill and add some visual excitement to the performance.&nbsp; The cheerleaders regularly climb each others' shoulders.&nbsp; Why not the woodwinds?&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p>And the audiences?&nbsp; They can participate by eating oranges and hazelnuts.&nbsp; And shouting approval.&nbsp; &quot;Go woodwinds!&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

                                <p>At&nbsp; first I found <em>Vernon God Little </em>to be rough going.&nbsp; The narrative voice -- a popcultch-saturated south Texas adolescent idiom -- took some getting used to. The novel is a post-mass-murder burlesque, hilarious in spots, but not even remotely credible.&nbsp; <em>Vernon God Little </em>won the Man Booker Prize in 2003, but I wonder whether the novel would be so highly regarded by English <em>literati</em> if it had portrayed England the way it portrays the U.S -- as a country where everyone, <em>every single person, </em>is either a pederast, an idiot, a con-man, a traitor, an opportunist, an incompetent, or just fat, lovelorn, vicious and vacant. The pseudonymous DBC Pierre, an Australian, seems to have acquired all his information about the United States from watching trash TV.&nbsp; He's written a funny book, because caricature can be very amusing, but I hope that unwary Europeans and Asians who read <em>Vernon God Little </em>don't think that they've entered the heart of America, because they sure as hell haven't. <em>Caveant lectores. </em>I wonder also about the novel's thick impasto of Christian symbolism.&nbsp; Vernon lives on Beulah Lane in a town called Martirio; he calls himself a &quot;skategoat.&quot;&nbsp; Will he die for America's vulgarities?&nbsp; And are we supposed to take seriously Vernon's last-minute conversion to faith?&nbsp; I couldn't -- in fact, the last-chapter Hollywood ending seemed to me mighty meretricious.&nbsp; &nbsp; <em></em></p>

But in thanks to one of those fascinating moments of cultural convergence, I&#39;ve just re-read, after almost fifty years, Philip Roth&#39;s <em>Goodbye, Columbus, </em>which also turns on a discovered contraceptive -- in the latter case, a diaphragm. Readers of the novella will remember that Roth&#39;s Newark alter ago, Neil Klugman, enjoys a summer romance with rich &#39;Cliffie Brenda Patimkin and pressures her to obtain a pessary. In due time the incriminating object is discovered by Brenda&#39;s protective, overbearing mother. Shock and outrage ensues, and the romance founders.&#0160; </p>
<p>When I read about the Empson-Cambridge contraceptive scandal, I felt as though I was entering an alien, distant and incomprehensible past. But <em>Goodbye Columbus </em>appeared in 1959, when I was an undergraduate at Cornell -- and is therefore very much a part of my conscious lifetime. Nor is Roth inaccurate about 50s sexual prudery. Contraceptives were difficult to obtain (even for married folk) and pre-marital sex was still taboo -- though, I must say, a taboo honored more in the breach than the observance. The old ways were slowly changing. In 1958, I participated in my first political demonstration -- or riot -- when Cornell authorities tried to prohibit women from visiting men&#39;s off-campus apartments. We staged a late-night moderately out-of-control protest march to the president&#39;s office. It was an all-male event because after 11 pm, women were confined to their all-female dormitories.(The action is recorded in Richard Farina&#39;s <em>Been Down So Long It Seems Like Up to Me </em>[1966]). It all seems so positively quaint now -- the university trying to police our sexual life and all that. Parents nowadays, at least the parents that I know, would be delighted to learn that their college-age daughters are using contraceptives.</p>
<p>In <em>Goodbye, Columbus</em>, Neil Klugman accuses Brenda of allowing her diaphragm to be discovered so that she can end the uneasy romance. Neil&#39;s argument seemed rational in 1959, but it no longer does so. From the vantage of 2007, it&#39;s clear that the many Roth alter egos have consistently been able to find justifications and excuses to end both their affairs and their marriages. Klugman, and Kepesh, and Zuckerman are never, ever, going to be more than momentarily and intermittently loyal or satisfied, but on the whole it&#39;s going to be circumstances, not their own volition, which causes them to flee. We didn&#39;t know that then. In 1959, <em>Goodbye, Columbus </em>seemed like a disinterested clearing of the Victorian air; now it has been transformed into a overture&#0160; to Roth&#39;s long and tormented psychosexual opera. </p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I&#39;ve now penetrated halfway into the Philip Roth corpus, reading not chronologically but as the novels become available in our local public library. At this moment I’ve interrupted my progress to enjoy DBC Pierre’s Booker Prize novel <em>Vernon God Little, </em>a virgin copy of which I uncovered in a basement storage box.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s my interim report on the works of Philip Milton Roth. No doubt but that Roth has created a stunningly original and accomplished body of work: it&#39;s witty, inventive, imaginative and unpredictable. So far <em>The Human Stain, </em>which I read a couple of years ago and plan to re-read soon, is my choice for masterpiece, but among the Rothgroup are a number of real dazzlers. Not a single book has been uninteresting (well, of the very early works, <em>Letting Go </em>was ordinary and <em>Portnoy&#39;s Complaint, </em>though notorious, was not serious). But everything has been engaging, even if only for the coruscating surface. I&#39;m genuinely impressed. The Roth guy is good.</p>
<p>But, you ask, Is Roth a writer for all time, or is he a writer for this present moment?&#0160; No one can make a fair estimate until the requisite hundred years have elapsed. Nevertheless, my great pleasure and admiration for his achievement notwithstanding, I very much doubt the permanent value of Roth&#39;s work. My provisional opinion is that Roth confines himself to too small a slice of human experience to sit at the table of the greats. The more I read, the more conscious I become that his engagement with the world is incomplete and deficient.</p>
<p>At bottom, Roth&#39;s subject is domesticity. His major characters, on the whole, do not track whales or go to war or cure diseases or wrestle with new ideas or sojourn in the wilderness; instead, they manage relationships with their parents and with their colleagues and with their mistresses and ladyfriends. It&#39;s no vice for a writer to choose the domestic arena: it&#39;s the domain of Jane Austen and Henry James, among many others. Roth, however, presents us with a severely circumscribed domesticity -- a partial and skewed view even of his own area of interest.&#0160;</p>
<p>Human social life begins with the family from which we derive, but it culminates in the family that we create. It&#39;s a cycle; we’re born, we mature, we marry, we bring forth children who themselves mature, and then we shuffle off the stage. Roth understands and engages the first part of life -- the growing out of childhood into adulthood. In traditional literature, it&#39;s the part of life that, recorded in the novels of a writer less satiric and more comic than Roth, might end with a wedding feast and the promise of future fertility. But Roth does not write traditional comedy, and he&#39;s inordinately hostile to marriage and especially to children. He&#39;s an acute observer of both the nuclear and extended families of his west-of-Manhattan Newark-Jewish roots. But when it comes to the progenitive phase of life, he has little to offer: incomprehension, or less than incomprehension -- merely vacancy, a hole, a void. There&#39;s no sign that Roth appreciates that to nurture a family of one&#39;s own is for most people a profound part of the human voyage. His characters don&#39;t willingly marry, and if they do, they don&#39;t stay married and they certainly don&#39;t reproduce. There are no babies, no boys or girls, no teen-agers in the homes and streets and schools of New Rothville.&#0160;</p>
<p>When we (that is, the plurality of human beings) grapple with parenthood, we inevitably come to some sort of detente with the generation that begot us. Not only do we learn about life from our sons and daughters, but we find it immensely satisfying to do so. But in the fifteen or so of Roth’s novels that I&#39;ve so far read, I&#39;ve yet to find the father who loves his own children. It&#39;s as though Roth were deaf and blind to the profounder half of human existence. Children are not a fulfillment; they are only a burden and an annoyance -- clogs to Zuckerman&#39;s or Kepesh&#39;s or Tarnopol&#39;s or Roth&#39;s freedom. (Readers of Claire Bloom&#39;s memoir of her life with Philip -- <em>Leaving a Doll&#39;s House --</em>will clearly remember Roth&#39;s implacable and inexplicable antagonism to Bloom&#39;s daughter.) For many novelists, the non-existence of paternal affection would not be a handicap to artistic achievement. But Roth writes entirely out of his own experience; he’s anything but empathic. Roth cannot conceive of the full adulthood that comes with mature parenthood. So he doesn&#39;t know what he can&#39;t know -- that his various alter egos, even as they age, linger in perpetual frozen adolescence.&#0160;</p>
<p>Unable to imagine the love of children, Roth also lacks the ability to appreciate or describe a functioning marriage. For Roth and his multiple avatars, marriages are similar to children in that they are restrictions on individual freedom.&#0160; And therefore Roth&#39;s hostility to husbands is corrosive and aggressive. Husbands are unmanly, emasculated. Real men have lots of women; those who pretend to enjoy a permanent partnership with one person are either slaves or eunuchs.</p>
<p>Roth writes obsessively about Jews and Jewishness and Jewish culture but there&#39;s a core Jewish value that he never acknowledges. It&#39;s &quot;being a mensch.&quot; A mensch is a mature man who does right by his friends, his associates, and especially by his family. He meets, and more than meets, his obligations, especially when it&#39;s rough going. He can be relied upon. He enjoys his life, but he would never put his own satisfactions ahead of his obligations to either his closest kin or humankind in general. Of such a traditional virtue, Roth&#39;s characters know nothing. In his novels, Roth&#39;s various alter egos not only shirk responsibility and run from trouble, but they judge it virtuous to do so.&#0160; In the world according to Roth, only a schmuck would be a mensch. But perhaps the satirist is always doomed to be the malcontent outsider. A happy Rothmensch would be no Roth at all.&#0160;</p>
<p>Philip Roth is by all odds the greatest novelist of arrested development ever produced by the state of New Jersey.</p>
