                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Dr. Metablog, like all bloggers, is his own editor. With the new freedom comes a downside: lapses of coherence and flaws of grammar, along with the occasional typos and printos that an editor&#39;s eye would catch, now go uncaught. But independence is also beneficial. In my former incarnation, I was regularly disciplined by stern editors who called me on the carpet for undermining academic prose by smuggling in a smile.</p>
<p>Once upon a time I composed an encyclopedia entry on the earthy and entertaining seventeenth-century English diarist Samuel Pepys. Pepys was an extremely diligent writer who kept his voluminous diary for nine years, rarely missing a day. To appreciate Pepys&#39;s art, it&#39;s wrong to rely on snippets; a reader has to swallow whole large hunks of the diary.&#0160; &#0160;recommended, therefore, that nouveau-Pepysists engage in &quot;deep and promiscuous reading&quot; of the volumes. My joke, weak though it may have been, played on the fact that most people read Pepys not for illumination so much as for the frank revelations about his vigorous sexual life. I was not sent page proofs of my contribution to the encyclopedia, and so I was surprised when I cracked open the spruce new book to discover that, for the words &quot;deep and promiscuous,&quot; a vigilant but unsmiling editor had substituted &quot;wide.&quot; What can I say? The editor batted last and had more clout.</p>
<p>It was perpetually curious to me that the editors would give a pass to incomprehensible jargon but would go to the mat against playfulness.</p>
<p>A few months ago, on this blague, I parodied the curious language of literary criticism in an entry on the imperialist romance <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2007/01/more_on_king_so.html">King Solomon&#39;s Mines</a>. I did not invent the ridiculous vocabulary that I poked fun at, not even &quot;multichronotopic&quot; or &quot;hybridity.&quot;&#0160; Now that I have no glum editor peering over my shoulder, I&#39;m free to play my own game of word-coining. I&#39;m not alone;&#0160; Is it my imagination, or is English vocabulary going through an internet-fueled growth spurt?&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&#0160;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">Reviewing my own posts for the past few months, I see a number of words that I can claim to have invented.&#0160; I&#39;m proud of &quot;precursoress,&quot; &quot;soulwise,&quot; &quot;brainal,&quot; &quot;neojargonianism,&quot; &quot;flimflammery,&quot; &quot;mosquette,&quot; &quot;skinflintism,&quot; &quot;bepigeoned,&quot; &quot;scandalmongery,&quot; &quot;baubleolatry,&quot; &quot;alzheimered,&quot; &quot;cinderelloid,&quot; &quot;prefamiliar,&quot; and &quot;barfitudinous.&quot;&#0160; Can I guarantee that I&#39;m the first user of these contributions to linguistic variety? Of course not -- I&#39;ve no doubt been anticipated in most of them. But I attest that each one of these novelties came to me in a thrilling burst of clarity and light.&#0160; I&#39;m especially fond of my jekyllian word &quot;menschdom&quot; and its hydish antonym &quot;schmuckhood,&quot; of &quot;swiftboatery,&quot; &quot;dysgeographicoid,&quot; &quot;wallstreetway,&quot; and &quot;gigantico.&quot;&#0160; My favorite, and here I&#39;m 99% sure that there can be no other claimant, is <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2007/12/nine-years-afte.html">&quot;antimonofilamentarianism&quot;</a>, defined as opposition to certain recent manifestations of orthodoxy in religion. I also claim &quot;eruvista,&quot; (a person who adheres to these particular beliefs). Only time will tell if one of these novelties turns out to be a nonce word (or as the classicists say, a <em>hapax legomenon)</em>, or a word that sneaks into our working vocabulary, its origin as well as its proud originator obscured by the mists of time.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>We&#39;re still cleaning out and throwing away (as I reported a couple of days ago).&#0160;Today I discovered, in amongst a small cache of books that I inherited from my father, a volume of poems called <em>Earthbound. </em>I&#39;d never heard of the poet, Helene Mullins, but I traced her via a 2001 <em>The New York Times </em>obituary. &quot;Helene Mullins Johnson, a poet, died on Oct. 26 at her home in Manhattan. She was 92 years old. She died of congestive heart failure. Mrs. Johnson first had her poems published in <em>The Pagan</em>, a Greenwich Village magazine, in the 1920s. After Thornton Wilder introduced her to his publisher, Harper&#39;s published her first novel, <em>Convent Girl,</em> and her first volume of poems, <em>Earthbound,</em> in 1929. Her final collection of poems, <em>Mirrored Walls,</em> was published in 1970.&#0160;There are no survivors.&quot;&#0160;Google provided me with another couple of facts.&#0160;Helene Mullins was born in 1899 in New Rochelle, New York, and educated in &quot;convent boarding schools.&quot; In 1935, she was so severely injured in an automobile accident that she lay unconscious for three weeks.&#0160;</p>
<p>And also: the library nearest to me that owns a copy of <em>Earthbound </em>is the Dakota State University, in Madison, South Dakota, which is precisely 502 miles from where I sit.&#0160;</p>
<p>The poems are, in my view, brimming with pre-Raphaelite fervor. The precursoress whom Mullins most resembles is Christina Rossetti, though there&#39;s an occasional dash of Ernest Dowson, and every once in a while, a gesture borrowed from the early Yeats. The poems are as intense and agonized and spiritual as Rossetti&#39;s, and were, even in their own time, composed in an extremely old-fashioned style.&#0160;</p>
<p>What does the world offer a hard-working but not brilliant poet who was clearly ambitious and tense, and who poured all her strength and feeling into her writing? There she was, a young woman fleeing the convent and shocking her family by taking up residence in Greenwich Village, where she lived near Thornton Wilder and other 1920s gentlemen of literature and where she frequented the irreligious offices of <em>The Pagan</em>. I mourn for the struggle and yearning and effort that went into those long-forgotten poems.&#0160; And which, all said and done, earned her little beyond a&#0160; perfunctory obituary in the <em>Times</em>.</p>
<p>But what in the ever-living universe was this volume doing in my staid father&#39;s library?&#0160; It&#39;s implausible that he could have found anything empathetic in such poems as &quot;St. Theresa&quot; and &quot;The Boy Christ.&quot;&#0160; Especially since <em>Earthbound </em>was the only volume of &quot;contemporary&quot; poetry that he seems to have possessed. In 1929, when <em>Earthbound</em> hit the streets, my father would have been a buoyant, studious young fellow of twenty-five<em> -- </em>a diligent bachelor law clerk with still a year or so to go before he would find Lilly.&#0160;Helen Mullins herself was just thirty years old.&#0160;Is there a story here?&#0160;Am I missing something?</p>
<p>There are no clues; not even a single pencil mark. Nothing from one end of the book to the other. Something doesn&#39;t compute.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I&#39;m not a person who cares terribly about material objects. Some of the evidence: I&#39;ve now written two hundred and fifty essaylets on this blague, and nary a one of them took as its subject a purchase or a possession.</p>
<p>What I&#39;ve read, what I&#39;ve thought, where I&#39;ve traveled, people I&#39;ve known, yes; what I own, or bought, or didn&#39;t buy, no.</p>
<p>But in these last weeks, we&#39;re in the process of discarding and giving away while we prepare to move to much smaller quarters. The things we own, and there are too many of them, have been front and center. The general rule here is, &quot;when in doubt, throw it out.&quot;&#0160; But yesterday, I didn&#39;t throw away, I packed and preserved.&#0160;</p>
<p>We have two sets of crockery. The first was part of the 1960 wedding loot. It&#39;s a perfectly fine set of dishes, and we&#39;ve used it on formal occasions for half a century. It&#39;s Franciscan china, very 1950s abstract-modernist in design. Entirely sufficient. Why, then, is there a second and redundant set?</p>
<p>Because when I was a boy, my folks owned a handful of pieces of flowery Charles Field Haviland china that came out of storage once a year, at Thanksgiving, to eke out the festive board.&#0160; I thought, and still think, that these plates were simply beautiful. In addition, because they were so seldom used, they had very specific and warm Thanksgiving-y associations -- food and drink and laughter and conviviality&#0160; -- that were once-a-year events in our not-particularly-sociable household. When the folks died, I inherited the Haviland remnants:&#0160; a few hand-painted plates, some of them chipped; a number of saucers and a few very delicate coffee cups. A decade ago, at age sixty, feeling nostalgic, I decided to make it my business to fill in the set. It wasn&#39;t easy. I located a couple of cups at an antique show and by mail-order acquired some plates from a &quot;replacement warehouse&quot; in Georgia. But one day, browsing Ebay, I discovered on auction a complete -- serving pieces and all -- set of dishes in what I had come to think of as &quot;my pattern.&quot; I bid, I was nervous, I won. The design exceeded my hopes. It&#39;s a handsome bunch of crockery and it&#39;s now standard for our occasional parties and our annual Thanksgiving. We&#39;ll carry the Haviland with us to the new home.</p>
<p>What to do with the old? The next generation expresses utter and uniform indifference; the generation that follows is far too young to care. Nor can we sell or discard -- there are just too many fond memories. But here&#39;s what I&#39;m thinking. Suppose one of the offspring comes to feel, as I did at sixty, an odd longing for objects that carry familial resonance. That set of Franciscan china might become valuable to them. I don&#39;t mean monetarily valuable, but genuinely valuable, in the ways that matter.&#0160;</p>
<p>So I&#39;ve carefully packed the crockery. It&#39;s multi-newspapered and double-boxed. If not preserved for all eternity, it&#39;s certainly packed in a way that will outlive every member of my age cohort.&#0160; It&#39;s labeled. It will go into the &quot;storage unit&quot; in the basement of the new condo. It will sit there for an unpredictable but not infinite length of years.</p>
<p>We&#39;ll let someone else decide whether to retain or discard.&#0160; &#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I had never heard of the novelist Jon Hassler, who died last month. The obituaries took me by surprise: Minnesota&#39;s best artist, more significant than the Coen brothers, or Bob Dylan, or Garrison Keillor. Or Sinclair Lewis. How could I be so ignorant?</p>
<p>Off I trotted to the library, where there was a nearly pristine shelf of Hassler novels. They were clearly virgin and untouched&#0160; -- so I&#39;m not the only diligent reader who is ignorant of Hassler.&#0160; From the shelf I plucked <em>The Dean&#39;s List </em>(1997) and attacked it with great expectations.</p>
<p>I&#39;m very sorry to report that this particular novel is a lot less exciting than the ecstatic obituaries would have led me to believe. <em>The Dean&#39;s List </em>is an academic story with a familiar cast: a&#0160; harried dean, a celebrity poet, an overbearing mom, an elusive girlfriend -- nothing that David Lodge or Malcolm Bradbury hasn&#39;t done with more wit and verve. Or Robertson Davies, for that matter. Too many quirky characters; too many satirical targets. Perhaps I made a mistake and chose the wrong Hassler novel. I&#39;ll borrow another one and report back.&#0160; &#0160;&#0160;</p>

		<a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2008/04/an-irish-airman.html">W. B. Yeats, "An Irish Airman Foresees his Death" (1919)</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I know that I shall meet my fate<br />Somewhere among the clouds above;<br />Those that I fight I do not hate,<br />Those that I guard I do not love;<br />My country is Kiltartan Cross,<br />My countrymen Kiltartan&#39;s poor,<br />No likely end could bring them loss<br />Or leave them happier than before.<br />Nor law, nor duty bade me fight,<br />Nor public men, nor cheering crowds,<br />A lonely impulse of delight<br />Drove to this tumult in the clouds;<br />I balanced all, brought all to mind,<br />The years to come seemed waste of breath,<br />A waste of breath the years behind<br />In balance with this life, this death.</p>
<p>Whether the Germans or the British win the war is a matter of utter indifference to Yeats&#39;s Irish airman. Even his own death is of no particular concern. The pilot&#39;s detachment is Olympian. Why then does he participate in the war? The motive, he says in the poem&#39;s most challenging phrase, is &quot;a lonely impulse of delight.&quot;</p>
<p>There is more than one historical resonance to the word &quot;lonely.&quot; Primarily, in this poem, it&#39;s the individual who feels himself to be separated from the mass of mankind, which in late Romantic thought transforms him into some sort of nascent artist. But &quot;lonely&quot; arises out of a second context: the solitude experienced by the self-sufficient warrior. In this second sense, &quot;lonely&quot; expresses a nostalgia for the days of chivalry or single combat that survived into the early twentieth century only in the skies when one skilled pilot faced another (on the ground, it was all inglorious machine guns, barbed wire, poison gas, trench warfare, and death by dysentery). &quot;Impulse&quot; is also a word with Romantic roots. Readers will recall Wordsworth&#39;s famous and extraordinarily irrational assertion that an &quot;impulse from a vernal wood&quot; could be a source of moral learning, where an &quot;impulse&quot; stands superior to clarity of thought or to consistency of logic. An &quot;impulse&quot; is a feeling or sentiment, not an argument, and so functions in this poem also, where the motives traditionally advanced for going to war (loyalty, patriotism, evidence that one&#39;s country is endangered, profit, law, duty, politics) are specifically disclaimed. For the Irish airman, a Wordsworthian &quot;impulse&quot; is sufficient -- especially if it&#39;s an impulse of &quot;delight.&quot; &quot;Delight&quot; signifies the thrill of the game as opposed to the dreariness of ordinary life, which is twice dismissed as merely &quot;a waste of breath.&quot; &quot;Delight&quot; is a word that harks back to the art-for-art&#39;s-sake movement of Yeats&#39;s youth, though even the most prescient would not have foreseen that it would come to describe the death-defying or, in this case, suicidal artistry of the fighter pilot. In &quot;An Irish Airman Foresees his Death,&quot; a &quot;lonely impulse of delight&quot; counterbalances other and more conventional experiences and patterns of thinking. Some will find the airman&#39;s reasoning immensely sad, others will judge it to be invigorating. Yeats himself does not tip his hand.&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;</p>

		<a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2008/04/two-separate-ti.html">Williamsburg Bridge/ Naked City</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>On two occasions this year the Williamsburg Bridge (from Manhattan to Brooklyn) has made a guest appearance in the plot of my life.</p>
<p>In January, as faithful readers know, we set up shop in <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2008/02/upper-west-side.html">Manhattan</a>. One day we strolled over the bridge from the Lower East Side to the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn. The bridge is a splendid monument of nineteenth-century technology and the view from above is spacious and commanding. It&#39;s a restless, busy path from one side to another; all around you, automobiles, subway trains, bicyclists, runners, baby carriages -- the works. NYC in a Victorian nutshell.&#0160;</p>
<p>Then, a few days ago, came the news of the death of Jules Dassin. Dassin is famous for <em>Never on Sunday </em>and <em>Topkapi, </em>but as movie-lovers know, he was a polished director of films noirs during the 1940s -- before Nixon, McCarthy, and the blacklisting boys drove him into exile. We decided to embark on a Jules Dassin festival and tribute right here on our very own giant TV. Our first choice was <em>Naked City </em>(1949), a highly un-subversive <em>policier, </em>markedly patriotic but disturbing because all the bad guys are vaguely &quot;ethnic.&quot; The climactic scenes of <em>Naked City </em>were shot in the Lower East Side (just where the Williamsburg Bridge hits Delancey). The murderer/wrestler/harmonicat Willie Garzah attempts to flee. A voice shouts, &quot;he&#39;s on Norfolk near Rivington.&quot; Right where we had just a few months ago wandered! It&#39;s right off the bridge! And then Garzah panics and tries to escape by running across the Williamsburg into Brooklyn. Police in pursuit, squad cars, pistols, shouting, shots. Garzah climbs the girders--the very same girders, which, just a few months before, I had decided to honor my acrophobia by not climbing. And then he&#39;s wounded, and, as always in the movies, falls theatrically to his death.</p>
<p>It&#39;s peculiar, isn&#39;t it, when a store or a street-corner that you know in real life appears in the movies. Does it mean that film tells the truth, is real, or does the celluloid appearance provide us with some evidence that our own life is genuine? Why should the movies sometimes seem more substantial than the reports of our own five senses? How can art validate life? And at the same time, don&#39;t we feel a little cheated--in the sense that our privacy--our uniqueness--has been violated and the things and stuff that are personal to us have been delivered over to an unappreciative anonymous world? It&#39;s odd and disorienting when a familiar non-fiction bridge plays a supporting role in a fictional film.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p><em>Naked City </em>is a good, solid, intriguing piece of work, well-paced and well-written. I&#39;m not entirely happy with the way it treats women or the working-classes, but then, many such films are far more culpable. I liked best the authentic, unstaged street shots of Manhattan as it was sixty years ago. Delancey Street was nostalgic and poetic (although the shop signs, then lettered in Hebrew, are now mostly Chinese).</p>
<p>The Williamsburg Bridge, solid and substantial, has weathered the years extremely well. It&#39;s well positioned to star in many another film.&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;</p>

		<a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2008/04/advice-for-writ.html">Advice for Writers</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>One of this blague&#39;s more inquisitive readers is a talented young journalist who knows that before Vivian de St. Vrain morphed into Dr. Metablog, he had spent a lifetime either bent unproductively over the ball point or wearily pounding on the word-processor.&#0160;The young reader has asked this question:&#0160; what have decades of practice taught you, Dr. M., about the craft of writing?&#0160; And in response, Dr. M. has peered soulwise and discovered -- not a heck of a lot.</p>
<p>Yet in all fairness, the curious reader&#39;s question is flattering and deserves a response. And therefore Dr. M. has pondered and pondered and has now refined the drossy deposits that clog his brainal synapses into as much wisdom as he feels qualified to dispense. (Let us be clear -- the advice that follows is not meant to be argumentative or prescriptive or know-it-all.&#0160;Different writers do things in different ways. The precepts that are offered here may not apply to all writing;&#0160;they describe only the Way of the Metablog.)&#0160;</p>
<p>Let us assume that the seeker of advice brings to the table intelligence and information and a point of view -- but needs a little coaching on tactics. Point one:&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>Just as I respect the first tenet of real estate -- location, location, location -- so I subscribe to the most important (but often neglected) rule of writing, which is</p>
<p>A)&#0160; plot, plot, plot, plot, plot.&#0160;The writer must tell a story.&#0160;People relish stories, respond to narrative, and are most engaged when they pursue a plot&#39;s twists and turns. Just because it&#39;s non-fiction, doesn&#39;t mean that the story-teller&#39;s bag of tricks cannot be accessed. Fortunately, every piece of prose from the briefest anecdote to the most convoluted intellectual argument can and should be structured as a narrative. In non-fiction, the first rule of plotting is to &quot;establish the enigma.&quot;&#0160;The enigma need not be a formal question, but it&#39;s indisputable that every essay answers either an explicit or an unspoken question.&#0160;Is not every writer free to shape that implicit inquiry to his own purposes?&#0160;And in the process of delivering an answer, is he not also free to sprinkle clues (some of them red herrings) along the path? And also at liberty to let his readers dangle until the moment comes to gratify their curiosity--and while they dangle, to let them endure suspense; suspense that can be intensified by teasing the reader about what&#39;s going to happen next?&#0160;And every once in a while, to spring a surprise by veering off on an unanticipated or even misleading tangent?&#0160;Nor is there anything wrong with the judicious flashback, the flash forward, or the deceptive digression -- tricks of the trade that have won the laurel since the bronze age, centuries&#0160;before the time when &quot;establish the enigma&quot; became the watchword. Remember: <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2007/11/words-of-wisdom.html">&quot;all writing is fiction, especially non-fiction.&quot;</a>&#0160;</p>
<p>Connoisseurs of storytelling know that the most indispensable element in any narrative is climax. Because climax is so essential, it must be exploited to the full, not just on the universal level but also on the particular, and therefore&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>B)&#0160; every sentence should achieve climax. As a general rule, the climax should come in the sentence&#39;s last phrase, or better still, in its final climactic word. The crucial, contributing part of every sentence, the idea which it strives to convey, the very target of its forward motion, should, whenever artistically feasible, come dead last. When this precept is honored, each sentence becomes an arrow aimed at its own natural target. And it follows as night the day, that every paragraph should also come to climax--and that the climax of the paragraph should be its own last sentence. So designed, sentences and paragraphs carry within them both the exciting pressure of forward motion and also coherence of argument. There&#39;s an ancillary benefit: when a sentence terminates in a climax, transitions become less awkward, because the intellectual content (or logic) of sentence B begins just where sentence A left off, and the logic of sentence C starts where B concludes. Sentences and logic coalesce and become as one. This maxim, true for sentences, is even more true for paragraphs. And therefore it follows that a practiced writer, making deft use of climax, can easily&#0160;</p>
<p>C)&#0160; avoid ungainly mechanical transitions, such as &quot;nevertheless,&quot; &quot;moreover, &quot;on the other hand,&quot; and even that offensive bit of pop neojargonianism, &quot;having said that&quot; -- for these fillers are words that constrict the thoroughfare of thought. Of course there will be times when such connectives usefully signal a switch in direction, but for the most part, transitions between sentences and paragraphs should not be mechanical, i.e. by the use of conjunctive phrases and adverbs, but logical. Logical transitions need not rely on distracting howevers, however easy and tempting it might be to employ them. The best transitions are transparent or, even better, invisible. If a writer studies his sentences and is compelled to admit that they are only linked by banausic connectives, then he must judge whether the argument he offers is truly coherent or whether its logical weaknesses have been plastered over with rhetorical flimflammery. Any writer who wants his prose to be persuasive will profit by examining his connectives. And while the writer is engaged in such scrutiny, he should also check to see that he has</p>
<p>D)&#0160; transferred important concepts from nouns and adjectives into verbs.&#0160;And by verbs, I mean verbs of vigor--not copulatives, passives, or colorless neutral words like seem, appear, make, or do. I mean verbs with punch, or better still, verbs that punch.&#0160;In revising a sentence, it&#39;s a good idea to determine whether it&#39;s the nouns and their modifiers that bear the brunt of the argument.&#0160;If they are doing more than their fair share of the labor, then it is mandatory to reconfigure the sentence so that the verbs strain and lift and carry.&#0160;A paragraph rich in colorful verbs is active and infectious and engaging;&#0160;a paragraph loaded with nouns and modifiers can be clotted and static.&#0160;Strong verbs keep things moving. They keep the plot in gear. They add grit and heft.&#0160;And so does the related process whereby</p>
<p>E)&#0160; generalizations and abstractions are replaced by instances and examples. Let me provide an example. A friend, a large man who has always savored his sauce Bearnaise, wrote this sentence to me: &quot;My doctor--an Asian woman who weighs about fifteen pounds--has been hectoring me about my reluctance to subsist on twigs and grasses.&quot; What an excellent sentence -- not just because of the colorful verbs (&quot;hector,&quot; &quot;subsist&quot;), the ironic faux-hyperbole (&quot;about fifteen pounds&quot;) or the fact that the sentence rises to a splendid climax, but because of the specificity of &quot;twigs and grasses.&quot; A lesser writer might have, instead of &quot;subsist on twigs and grasses,&quot; employed a bland formula such as &quot;go on a diet&quot; or &quot;become a vegetarian.&quot; But by using the concrete &quot;twigs and grasses&quot; for the abstract &quot;diet&quot; or &quot;vegetarian,&quot; my correspondent has not only caught our attention and amused us, but he has created a metaphor. &quot;Twigs and grasses&quot; is specific and visual and memorable. While these nouns stand for &quot;diet&quot; and &quot;vegetarian,&quot; they also stand for whatever penumbra of meaning my friend&#39;s readers bring to the interpretation of these words. In my own case, it&#39;s a irresistible vision of a big guy metamorphosed into a large twitchy-nostrilled rabbit nibbling the bark of willows. Such is the paradox of the metaphor: the more specific the word, the more spacious the liberty of interpretation. Poets know this instinctively; that&#39;s why they&#39;re poets. But remember, writers: metaphor is only one of a bucketload of figures of speech. The astute writer does not limit himself to metaphor alone, but remembers to&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; <br /><br />F)&#0160; use figures of speech of all kinds: pun, simile, alliteration, oxymoron, parataxis, hyperbole, understatement or litotes, irony, metonymy (where an individual stands for a class), synecdoche (where a part signifies the whole), aposiopesis -- I could go on and on!&#0160; It&#39;s the figure of speech that keeps things lively, that makes prose sparkle and that make readers, already enthralled with plot and dazzled by recurrent exciting climaxes, fully engage with the written word.&#0160; After all, writing has no value unless it attracts and holds the reader. And so it follows that a writer must, finally,&#0160;</p>
<p>G)&#0160; know and respect his readership.&#0160;He&#0160;must provide all the information that a reader needs to follow the argument.&#0160;Yet at the same time, he must resist the temptation to be&#0160;over-explicit.&#0160;Let readers do some of the work.&#0160;Let them complete&#0160;the connections that the writer&#0160;only suggests.&#0160;It will keep them on their toes, make them feel intelligent, and retain their interest.&#0160;And while they&#39;re so engaged, the writer&#0160;might remind himself&#0160;of another precept, which is to try to</p>
<p>H)&#0160; make syntax and logic work together. Get them on the same track. Put the main idea in the main clause, put subordinate ideas in subordinate clauses. Put the parenthetical idea in a parenthetical clause. Put parallel ideas in parallel clauses, but when ideas are not parallel, emphasize their incompatibility by using contrasting syntactic structure. Syntax is a tool. Sentences in which logic is chugging onward and syntax is all over the map can be confusing and even impenetrable. Alexander Pope said about poetry, &quot;The sound should be an echo to the sense.&quot;&#0160; In prose, the syntax should be an echo to the sense; or rather, the sense should be an echo to the syntax; or even better, the syntax and the sense should take each other&#39;s hand and dance the same dance. And finally (and this time the &quot;finally&quot; is not meant to be misleading),</p>
<p>I)&#0160; scrutinize every word and see if it is necessary or whether it can either be omitted or made more precise. When in doubt, throw it out. Or amend it. It should be a maxim that in good writing, no one ever &quot;walks down the street.&quot; And by &quot;walks down the street,&quot; I certainly do not mean &quot;walk down the street.&quot; &quot;Walks down the street&quot; is a metaphor for a colorless expression. Why should someone walk down the street, when he can totter, or saunter, or sashay, or hurtle, or trot, or swagger, or stagger, or promenade down an avenue, boulevard, lane, causeway, footpath, or promenade?&#0160; English overflows with words that are specific, evocative, and suggestive. Let&#39;s have fewer street-walkers and more sidewalk-promenaders. Keats said the the poet should &quot;load every rift with ore,&quot; and so should the writer of non-fiction. But be careful not to overload; don&#39;t allow prose to slide toward the baroque. And at last</p>
<p>J)&#0160; &#0160;feel perfectly free to ignore the canard that you were taught in grade school&#0160; --that every piece of writing needs a conclusion.&#0160; It doesn&#39;t.&#0160; As a general rule, avoid formal conclusions.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Over there on the west side of Alameda, at the intersection of 9th and Santa Clara, plunked down right in the midst of an otherwise residential neighborhood, is a most intriguing commercial island. Once upon a time, I&#39;m sure, it would have consisted of (let me guess) a hardware store, a mom-and-pop grocery, a haberdashery or a shoe store, and a gas station. Now it&#39;s a fully&#0160; contemporary American mish-mash.</p>
<p>The gas station has been converted into the Islamic Center of Alameda. Where there would once have been a sign advertising Esso, there&#39;s now the harder-to-parse motto &quot;there is no God but Allah, the self-sustaining, eternal.&quot; Directly across the street from the mosquette is a second store-front worship-opportunity, the Love Fellowship Church of God in Christ. Here pride of place goes not to Allah but to &quot;Pastor Elder Samuel Butler,&quot; or &quot;Pastor Elder Samuel Bulter,&quot; depending on which hand-painted sign you put your faith. Kitty-corner to Love Fellowship is Dance 10, no longer a shoe store, but now a venue where budding toe-tappers are instructed in &quot;Hop. Lyrical. Modern. Musical. Theater. Jazz. Tap. Ballet. Acrobatics. Hip-hop.&quot;&#0160; On the fourth corner, there&#39;s a &quot;convenience&quot; store, where outsized neon signs advertise &quot;Budweiser&quot; and &quot;Tecate.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#39;s a comprehensive assemblage: feed your soul (for them as believe they have one), feed your feet, feed your gullet.&#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Some months ago, I reported on Hosseini&#39;s very popular <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2006/10/every_american_.html">novel of Afghanistan</a>, <em>The Kite Runner. </em>I thought it was a must-read-bad-book, that is, a book that is so informative and interesting that we should overlook its inferior construction and prose. I&#39;ve now read another Afghan-American story and I have come to much the same opinion. Tamin Ansary&#39;s <em>West of Kabul, East of New York (</em>FSG, 2002) is swift and likable and necessary, but oh so very disappointing. Ansary is an author of children&#39;s books, and, perhaps out of habit his prose is so guileless that it seems aimed not at adults but at a junior high school audience.</p>
<p>Ansary&#39;s is the familiar story of an immigrant (this time half Afghani, half Finnish-American) stranded between two cultures. His transformation may be a little harder than most because Islam can be an inflexible integument. It&#39;s sad to read that Ansary&#39;s brother has become a fanatical fundamentalist who has embraced some contrary-to-reason, contrary-to-the facts-of-history dogmas. It&#39;s even more discouraging to read of Ansary&#39;s encounter with an Egyptian cab-driver in New York City, who says, &quot;Thank God for the Taliban. I hate America. The sluts.The booze. The filth. In Egypt, I am a lawyer. I can&#39;t earn enough to support my family, so I come here for six months a year. But I never bring my wife. I don&#39;t want her to get polluted. One of my friends brought his wife here, and you know what she said to him. &#39;Don&#39;t touch me anymore.&#39; You know what I would do to my wife if she ever said that to me. I would take her to the country, I would dig a hole, I would put her in that hole....&quot;&#0160; &#0160;Ansary is a responsible and rational being and of course he&#39;s appalled and I think embarrassed by the hatred and misogyny that he encounters in that cab. Let us hope that it&#39;s not the angry cabbies but the Ansarys who will prevail&#0160; -- in Islam as well as in closer-to-home religions.&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;</p>
