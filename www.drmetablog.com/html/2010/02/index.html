                                <p>The grand-daughter, age 10, visited here last December.&#0160; She showed me her new cellphone. She was &quot;texting&quot; with a friend.&#0160; I asked her how she does it, and she gave me a lesson, even though she was startled and horrified, I imagine, to realize that, although an adult, I didn&#39;t know that it&#39;s one click for a d, two for an e, and three for an f. Her thumbs flew, mine limped, but I got the idea -- and then forgot about it until, a couple of days ago, when&#0160; was waiting in the doctor&#39;s office without a book and wasn&#39;t in the mood for Golf Magazine. I started to play with my two-month-old entry-level cellphone and discovered that if you press Menu, and then Messaging and then Send Message and then Enter Number that you can &quot;text&quot; -- of which I had no idea, my cellphone skills being usually limited to &quot;what is that noise coming from my pocket I&#39;d better check.&quot;&#0160; So I laboriously scribed (or thumbed) my first message to the grand-daughter: &quot;Thank you for teaching me to send text messages.&quot;&#0160; And then, miracle of miracles, a few hours afterward (after fifth grade had been dismissed for the day, I suspect), I received an answer, which I now reproduce verbatim: &quot;when ur txting u dont have 2 use full sentences.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>Live and learn.&#0160;</p>

                                <p>The hype and hoopla at sports arenas&#0160;are truly deplorable, especially to aged eyes and ears. At a Washington Wizards game in DC a couple of weeks ago, members of the starting team&#0160;were introduced not only with spotlights, screeching,&#0160;and &quot;music&quot; but&#0160;also with bursts&#0160;from a high-powered flame thrower. Even fifty yards away, I could feel the toasty heat.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Wild over-the-top absurdity and irrelevance, in my opinion. I go to a basketball game to see a&#0160;basketball game, not to be danced at, kiss-cammed at, or showered with gift certificates,&#0160;free pizza,&#0160;and t-shirts.</p>
<p>I&#39;m back home in Boulder again, and last night I heard performances of Prokofiev, Beethoven, and Brahms by the ever-so-formal Escher Quartet. Lord-a-mercy, did they ever make me long for a little sporty glitz. The Eschers (three men and a woman, all of whom appeared to be in their 20s) conducted themselves as if they just woken up from a long day of sleeping in their coffins. They were utterly joyless. They resolutely avoided looking at each other or at the audience or betraying the least emotion. The expressions on their faces did not say, &quot;magnificent music&quot;; they said, &quot;is that curdled milk, or what?&quot; They plucked and sawed at their instruments with as much enthusiasm as if they were cleaning out the septic system. Their playing was exact but uninspiring--but what can you expect from three mortgage brokers and a dental hygienist?&#0160; The Eschers acknowledged the generous applause of the audience as if they were feudal overlords hearing the petitions of dung beetles.&#0160;</p>
<p>Whenever I go to chamber music concerts, I feel young. Actually, I am young, because in the chamber-music crowd, anyone without a walker or&#0160;an oxygen bottle is a kid.</p>
<p>The Escher should&#0160;loosen up&#0160;a bit -- and perhaps attract a younger and livelier audience.&#0160;</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the fantasy. Cue spotlight. Cue big-voiced announcer. &quot;And now, on cello, from Thousand Oaks, California, in his fifth year, out of the Manhattan School of Music, Andy Janss.&quot; Janss runs on to the stage, carrying his cello overhead, his rhinestones glittering in the lights. He high-fives the other members of the group, shakes the confetti off his shoulder-length hair, tosses some talcum powder into the air....etc. etc.&#0160; Crowd roars. He plays with enthusiasm. So do his comrades.</p>
<p>But&#0160;let us not sacrifice the dignity of&#0160;classical-music. No flame throwers.&#0160;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>In <em>The Second Part of King Henry the Fourth, </em>the Hostess (also known as Nell or Mistress Quickly) regularly makes fritters of the English language. At one point in the play, she is beside herself -- apoplectic, in fact -- because she believes that she has been abused by Falstaff. Reaching for words to equal her anger, she tries for &quot;homicidal&quot; three consecutive times. First she calls Falstaff a &quot;honeysuckle villain,&quot; then a &quot;honeyseed rogue&quot; and finally she settles on &quot;hempseed.&quot; Although &quot;honeysuckle&quot; and &quot;honeyseed&quot; are amusing guesses, we feel --or perhaps I should speak only for myself-- I feel just a bit guilty that I&#39;ve let Shakespeare amuse me at the expense of an illiterate woman&#39;s linguistic lapses.</p>
<p>I have the same reservations about Charles Dickens&#39;s jokes on the unlettered; the word &quot;apoplexy,&quot; for example, appears as &quot;happyplexy.&quot;&#0160; It makes a second appearance in <em>Great Expectations, </em>when Jo Gargery, of whom much is made that he has never learned to read or write, explains that his father died of a &quot;purple leptic fit.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>I think that pillorying linguistic errors is more fun when the perpetrators are not illiterate but pretentious. Such is the case in Sheridan&#39;s <em>The Rivals </em>(1775), where Mrs. Malaprop, striving for &quot;pinnacle,&quot; refers to a character as &quot;the very pineapple of perfection.&quot; The most famous sentence in <em>The Rivals: &quot;</em>Sure, if I reprehend any thing in this world it is the use of my oracular tongue, and a nice derangement of epitaphs&quot; (apprehend, vernacular, arrangement, epithets).&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>In the last couple of years, there&#39;s been an attempt to distinguish a subset of such malapropisms as &quot;eggcorns.&quot; The neologism derives from the unlearned collapse of &quot;acorn&quot; into &quot;eggcorn&quot; (a substitution which is more intelligible when the word egg is pronounced as in rural &quot;aig&quot;). An eggcorn is supposed to be a special variety of malapropism in that &quot;the new phrase makes sense on some level (&#39;old-timer&#39;s disease&#39; for &#39;Alzheimer&#39;s disease&#39;). But what sort of sense?&#0160; Why is &quot;baited breath&quot; for &quot;bated breath&quot; anything more than a simple spelling error?&#0160; For that matter, &quot;honeysuckle villain&quot; and &quot;honeyseed rogue&quot; also make a kind of sense -- a Shakespearean and psychological sense. The Hostess unconsciously reveals that she&#39;s sweet on Falstaff.</p>
<p>In any case, there&#39;s now an eggcorn <a href="http://eggcorns.lascribe.net/">database</a> on the internet.&#0160; A goodly number of the eggcorns are errors that have appeared time without number on student essays. I can&#39;t guess how often I used to encounter &quot;peak (or peek) one&#39;s curiosity,&quot; &quot;leech&quot; for &quot;leach,&quot; &quot;peon&quot; for &quot;paean,&quot; or &quot;pier&quot; for &quot;peer&quot;;&#0160; or how many times students would &quot;pour&quot; over their work. I remember being stunned the first time that I encountered &quot;morays&quot; for &quot;mores,&quot; but I eventually acclimated to that formidable shock. What can it possibly mean to &quot;reek&quot; havoc?&#0160; Others common student errors: &quot;spade&quot; for &quot;spayed&quot; (sometimes pluperfectized to &quot;spaded&quot;; &quot;verses&quot; for &quot;versus&quot;; &quot;phase&quot; for &quot;faze&quot;; along with the exceedingly respectful &quot;sirname.&quot; I believe that the amount of space I enclosed by circling these common errors as they appeared on coffee-stained student submissions would roughly equal the surface area of Weld County.</p>
<p>The eggcorn database contains some &quot;learned&quot; malapropisms that are new to me. &quot;Hare&#39;s breath&quot; and its funhouse mirror twin &quot;hair-brained&quot;; &quot;beyond approach&quot;; &quot;Cadillac converter&quot;; &quot;garbage shoot&quot;; &quot;wet one&#39;s appetite.&quot; I can&#39;t picture &quot;well-quaffed hair,&quot; but I can certainly visualize a &quot;wind-powered turban.&quot; &quot;It finally donged on me&quot; makes some sense, but &quot;crutch of the matter&quot; is utterly nonsensical. How laid back is a &quot;mellow drama?&quot; To &quot;give up the goat&quot; may have meaning in pastoral societies. My absolute favorite: &quot;pus jewel,&quot; as in, &quot;his adolescent face was covered with pus jewels.&quot; The avian reference in &quot;one fowl swoop&quot; (for one fell -- i.e. fatal-- swoop) was well anticipated by Macduff:&#0160; &quot;What, all my pretty chickens and their dam/ In one fell swoop....&#0160; O hell-kite.&quot;</p>
<p>And speaking of chickens (and eggs), there&#39;s also chocolate &quot;eggclair&quot; and &quot;eggtopic&quot; pregnancy, both of which are weirdly inventive, but&#0160;neither worth (drumroll, maestro!), a pullet surprise.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Although youngsters sometimes try to piss off their parents by inserting into their nose a modest jewel or a gold circlet, we (as a nation or as a civilization) aren&#39;t terribly enthusiastic about decorating the old schnozzola. While the English language has words for many kinds of jewelry (ring, earring, brooch, bracelet, necklace, tiara, pectoral), it is vacant of vocabulary for objects that are affixed to or hang from the nose. Consequently, this magnificent piece of gold jewelry, crafted in Peru two thousand years ago, which certainly bore a name in proto-Quecha or whatever was spoken at the time, is now simply called a &quot;nose ornament.&quot;</p>
<p><img border="0" class="mainObjImage showEnlargeArea " jquery1265854892578="43" rel="1979.206.1172" src="http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/images/h2/h2_1979.206.1172.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 289px;" /></p>
<p>It&#39;s spectacular, isn&#39;t it? The four jolly, fat spiders in their intricate communal web of mesh are truly lovely. We moderns can&#39;t compete.&#0160; We have nothing to offer.&#0160;</p>
<p>Here&#39;s another beauty, this one from the area that is now Columbia.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/images/h2/h2_66.196.23.jpg" /></p>
<p>This nose ornament is five inches long from top to bottom, which means that it would cover the mouth and hang well below the chin. The small gold discs and the long flattened cylinders are loosely attached, so the ornament was designed both to catch and reflect the light and to jingle. This one, like the spider ornament, is glittery, ostentatious, and unapologetic.</p>
<p>I imagine that like most such jewelry, these nose ornaments were designed to say, &quot;I&#39;&#39;m rich, I&#39;m powerful, and I&#39;m sexy. Come mate with me.&quot; To me, they also say, very loudly, &quot;I can endure massive rhinal discomfort.&quot; It appears that these nose ornaments were inserted between the nostrils and attached to the septum. To wear such an ornament would be painful even if the wearer never sneezed or blew his nose, but to insert and remove it would be sheer nasal agony. Those sharp points would dig into the tender flesh. And the object must have been frequently removed,&#0160; because with the ornament in place, drinking or eating would be impossibly messy. While the nose ornament might get a guy a date, it would certainly inhibit chat or flirtation, and would also become a major impediment if he got lucky.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not impressed by the pitifully small nose ornaments worn by modern teenagers, but I would definitely respect the child who was willing to brandish something equivalent to these wonders. Especially the&#0160;one with the spiders.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>When, In a Canterbury bar many years ago, I ordered a cider, the East Kent cockney bartender responded with a question that I interpreted as &quot;strong Boer what knees?&quot; Why would he ask me about the joints of a South African farmer? I was absolutely befuddled even when he repeated the question several times. Finally, in frustration, he held up two bottles of cider: the first was labeled &quot;Strongbow&quot; and the second &quot;Watney&#39;s.&quot; He was simply asking me if I preferred Strongbow or Watney&#39;s -- but how was I to know?&#0160; Some years afterward I mentioned this incident to an English friend who countered with a story of her own. On her first visit to New York City, she said, she ordered a sandwich and the counterman asked her &quot;fur rear oughta go?&quot;</p>
<p>I recalled these events while musing on two moments of childhood linguistic extremity. The first was when I asked one of my P. S. 217 friends what they did during Religious Instruction (in the 1950s, Roman Catholic kids were released from class for two hours a week to study at the local parish church, which in my neighborhood was St. Rose of Lima -- popularly known as &quot;Roe Salima.&quot;&#0160; Our teachers took the opportunity to catch up on the local newspapers while students twiddled the collective thumb). My friend&#39;s answer, &quot;Cat kiss &#39;em.&quot; It was many years before I understood that the word I had no hope of understanding was &quot;catechism.&quot; I was even more puzzled when a Jewish student, who could not know that I came from a family that regularly celebrated Yom Kippur with a roast pork dinner, asked me, &quot;do you put on to fill in?&quot; I construed the question to be some sort of insult, but after a decade or so I realized that I had been asked something rather serious: &quot;Do you put on <em>tefillin? -- </em>tefillin being small leather boxes containing biblical verses donned by observant Jews during morning prayers.</p>
<p>In my neighborhood, it was common for people to shout &quot;doozie pots&quot; at each other.&#0160; I had no idea what that expression meant, except for a strong feeling that it wasn&#39;t praise. It was not until I studied a little Italian that I understood that what I heard as &quot;doozie pots&quot; was a Sicilian variant of<em>&#0160;tu sei pazzo</em>, &quot;you&#39;re crazy.&quot;</p>
<p>None of these misunderstandings, strictly speaking, meet the mondegreen threshold;&#0160; let&#39;s call them near-mondegreens. (The best-known mondegreen is &quot;I led the pigeons to the flag&quot; -- a mishearing of &quot;I pledge allegiance to the flag.&quot; The word mondegreen derives from one of the Child ballads: &quot;They hae slain the Earl of Murray/ And laid him on the green,&quot; the second of these lines misheard as &quot;And Lady Mondegreen&quot;). In my long list of personal mondegreens, the two that are most vivid in my memory are connected to my incomprehension of religion.&#0160; They are a) the luscious &quot;round young virgin&quot; of <em>Silent Night</em>, and b) the theologically implausible &quot;The Lord is ice, the Lord is made of ice&quot; in one of the choruses of <em>The Messiah</em> (&quot;even so in Christ, shall we be made alive&quot;). Here&#39;s another mondegreen from my childhood:&#0160; &quot;Who knows what evil lurks in the hot cement?&quot; <em>March 12:&#0160; </em>Last night at dinner, I remarked&#0160; that one of my favorite innovations of the second half of the twentieth century was &quot;fitted sheets.&quot;&#0160; A guest said, &quot;You&#39;re right;&#0160; we didn&#39;t used to have feta cheese.&quot;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>In the course of their long evolution our insect friends solved the problem of adolescence.While we humans grow ever so awkwardly from childhood to sexual maturity, your efficient, clever insect larva merely sequesters himself for a few weeks or months and then emerges as a completely fledged adult. No whining, no rebellion, no pimples, no door-slamming -- one day a child, and then, presto, a full member of society. There&#39;s not a beetle on what Antigonus called &quot;the whole dungy earth&quot; who ever had to &quot;find himself.&quot;</p>
<p>I wish that my own pupa-hood had been so quick and painless, but in fact, it was a commonplace mix of anxious folly and meaningless alienation. My most successful strategy for coping with the mess was to escape into the imagination. Not my own imagination, of course, for I had little or none, but into other people&#39;s. In my pupal stage, I was an indiscriminate reader of the genre known as fantasy and science fiction. Inhabiting, as I did, the wrong body, and having been birthed in the wrong time and place, I preferred fantastic alternative universes to so-called &quot;real life.&quot; I subscribed to a bunch of pulp mags and I also gobbled the extensive collections of sci-fi in the local public library. Not everyone will recognize the writers who were then my literary heroes, but for me they were names as familiar as Koufax and Drysdale or, for that matter, Truman and Eisenhower. Does anyone out there remember these folks: Robert Heinlein, James Blish, L. Sprague de Camp, Richard Matheson, Isaac Asimov, Robert Sheckley, Arthur C. Clarke, William Tenn, Poul Anderson, Fredric Brown, Fritz Leiber, Theodore Sturgeon, Clifford D. Simak, Fletcher Pratt, Ray Bradbury?&#0160; Names to conjure with, so to speak.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a paradox. While I vividly recall the names of these authors, I can remember almost nothing of what they wrote. I was fully immersed in the genre and yet it&#39;s evaporated from my memory -- leaving less of a mark than does the grub that becomes a butterfly. I seem to recall a novel or story about a planet in which the trees were murderous -- they would send their roots through ventilating ducts and strangle people in their beds. I have a hazy recollection of a story about a society in which overconsumption was the norm and in which to take a sofa and a set of chairs off the hands of newlyweds was an act of love. I recall some precocious evil children endowed with supernatural powers. Do I remember, or do I just imagine that I much admired a story about human beings shrunk to infinitesimal size who had to go mano-a-flagellum with paramecia. I&#39;m certain that I encountered a superfluity of post-apocalyptic stories: after the A-bomb, after the plague, after the invasion from another planet -- all such fictions obvious symptoms of cold-war paranoia. Why in the world should an adolescent earthling have consoled himself with stories of extragalactic invaders spaceshipping&#0160;to our green earth to exploit, or colonize, or enslave, or, occasionally, to butcher and stew us? In the 1950s, aliens were always hostile. None of my authors, as far as I can remember, could envision them greeting us with the outstretched tentacle of peace.</p>
<p>Although I think that some of the stories were imaginative, most of them were no more than starwarslike space operas-- Westerns but with death rays instead of six-shooters.</p>
<p>It&#39;s been many a year since I could abide fantasy. The genre is now repugnant to me.&#0160; I can&#39;t read Tolkien or Harry Potter, I can&#39;t watch movies about ghosts, or satanic possession, or space travel, or time travel, or about people stuck in other peoples&#39; bodies. All such nonsense bores the living heck out of me. Nor is it merely the lowbrow stuff. I can no longer read Spenser or Ariosto and&#0160;my least favorite character in Shakespeare is the magician Prospero. Is it a failure of imagination on my part?&#0160; Perhaps. But I don&#39;t feel it as a loss. There&#39;s more than enough of the non-fantastic to keep me joyfully occupied. I&#39;m grateful that sci-fi served my pupal needs, but it&#39;s gone forever.</p>
<p>Nowadays I tend to think back to my adolescent reading only when I&#39;m at the drugstore filling a prescription. The names of the new concoctions devised by Big Pharma all sound extraterrestrial to me. For example: Cyclessa is the queen of the distant planet Pulmicort which circles around the star Ativan in the galaxy called Levaquin. Cyclessa’s evil brother Coumadin, along with his henchmen the evil twins Zantac and Zocor, have attacked the queen, using their secret weapons Restoril and Ritalin. They&#39;re accompanied by the enchantress Ambien, aka Zolpidem, who causes her enemies to fall into profound sleep. But deep in the forest, young Prozac awakens from a spell, mounts the great horse Oxycontin, and with the aid of his sidekick, the amusing but randy Cialis, who has escaped from the clutches of the evil witch Prevacid....&#0160; Etc., etc.</p>
