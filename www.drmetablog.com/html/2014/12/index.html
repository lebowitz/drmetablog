                                <p>Vivian de St. Vrain, fully accredited prophet&#0160;(Senior Fellow, American Society of Prophecy), has retreated to the mountaintop and has returned&#0160;with&#0160;predictions for 2015. Here they are:&#0160;</p>
<p>1)&#0160;&#0160; there will be unusual weather patterns in North America;</p>
<p>2)&#0160; a famous Hollywood actress will sue for divorce;&#0160; moreover, another (or possibly the same) Hollywood star will become pregnant; another (or possibly the same) actress will gain and lose a great deal of weight;&#0160;</p>
<p>3)&#0160; a well-known American or possibly European athlete will be accused of taking drugs;</p>
<p>4)&#0160; a politician will be accused of taking bribes;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>5)&#0160; questions will be raised about the safety of America&#39;s food supply;</p>
<p>6)&#0160; there will be either a monsoon, an airplane crash, or a capsized ferry in Asia;</p>
<p>7)&#0160; there will be fluctuations in the stock market;</p>
<p>8)&#0160; there will be turmoil in the Middle East.</p>
<p>9)&#0160; a religious leader will be involved in either a financial or a sex scandal.&#0160; Or perhaps both.</p>
<p>You read it here first.&#0160;Loyal readers: check back at the end of 2015.&#0160; Let&#39;s see whether a senior but world-class professional prophet still has enough on the ball (a crystal ball) to foretell the future one more time.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I believe that I first heard &quot;man&quot; used as an adjective in the phrase &quot;man cave&quot; -- which is, I believe, a place where guys go to isolate themselves from their wimmen and famly and where they watch boxing on the TV, drink a lot of beer, and puke on the shag rug. But recently I learned about the &quot;man stand.&quot; &quot;To do the man stand&quot; is when the husband waits at the door of the dress shop clutching a bundle of packages while the old ball and chain decides between the 10 and the 12 and between the gray one and the green. Sometimes a manstander parks his carcass in a designated &quot;man chair.&quot; And now there&#39;s a new one: the &quot;man spread&quot;, which describes the way a crude young guy with below-the-waist pants sits in the subway, legs akimbo, indifferent to the gentle ladies and to the tired old geezers who need to relax far more than he does.</p>
<p>&quot;Man boobs,&quot; which are nothing more than unsightly fat, are sometimes abbreviated to&#0160;&quot;moobs.&quot;&#0160; &quot;Manparts&quot; requires no elucidation.</p>
<p>In each of these cases, &quot;man&quot; is not used affectionately or admiringly. &quot;Man,&quot; as an adjective, is anything but &quot;manly.&quot;&#0160;&quot;Man&quot; is primitive and insensitive, an adjective of derogation and denigration.&#0160;</p>
<p>January 4:&#0160; My penpalessa, SF, writes that in England the phrase &quot;man flu&quot; has now become popular. A &quot;man flu&quot; is merely a cold that men (such babies they are!!) make a fuss about, but which a woman would ignore.&#0160;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I bought a February airline ticket to The Big Easy. I bought it online, as we all do nowadays (whatever happened to travel agents?) I figured that they would try to squeeze a few dollars in extra charges out of me, but I&#0160; was surprised that the airline had the balls to demand $25.00 for my one piece of carry-on luggage (not checked -- carry on!). And then I was completely floored to discover that Frontier now adds an extra charge for a seat. Yes, a seat! A seat is an additional charge, even though an airplane is not like a subway, where you can strap-hang. Nor can you sit outside, on the wing. A seat is not a an option or, goodness gracious! a luxury. And yet Frontier now exacts a few bucks for the privilege of sitting down.</p>
<p>Frontier, I can tell you, lacks any sense of irony.</p>
<p>&quot;Would you like air with your seat. There will be a small extra charge for breathing.&quot;</p>
<p>I know we&#39;re supposed to feel sorry for the struggling airlines, but that&#39;s a myth, a canard. The airlines are not starving. thank you very much. The International Air Transport Association, the airlines&#39; trade group,&#0160;estimates that the industry&#39;s profits were $11 billion in 2013, will be $19.9 billion this year and will rise&#0160;to $25 billion next year.&#0160;(Billion!, not million.)&#0160; Why so much?&#0160;Because fuel costs continue to drop.&#0160;And also because we passengers have become accustomed to being crammed into smaller and smaller spaces and have been taught to pay extra for every glass of orange juice.&#0160;And to enjoy the luxury of a chair.</p>
<p>Hey, fellow passengers!&#0160; Remember when oil prices spiked a few years ago and the airlines added &quot;fuel surcharges&quot;? Well, fuel is down.&#0160;Raise your hand if you think you&#39;re going to get a &quot;fuel rebate.&quot;&#0160;Let me count the hands.&#0160;Hmm.&#0160;Not so many.</p>
<p>Where do you think the $25 billion in profits will go.&#0160;I&#39;ll give you three guesses.&#0160;A) Increase the salaries of stewards, baggage handlers and other airport workers?&#0160; B. Lower the cost of airline travel for passengers in the economy (i.e. steerage) classes?&#0160; C.&#0160;Improve amenities for first-class travelers?</p>
<p>Shock!!&#0160; The correct answer is C. According to <em>The New York Times,</em> improvements in service &quot;have been directed at the airlines’ most lucrative passengers, who are flying in business class or paying for full-fare coach seats. Delta Air Lines, for instance, announced on Monday that it <a>renamed its business section Delta One, instead of BusinessFirst, and said it would glorify the seats with brand-new quilted covers. </a>American Airlines announced this week that it would spend $2 billion to improve customer experience at the airport and inside its planes. Part of that investment includes adding more lie-flat seats for business class passengers.</p>
<p>For the rich: &quot;lie-flat seats,&quot; and &quot;quilted seat covers.&quot; And what is American Airlines doing for the rest of us, the not-rich. &quot;In the back of the plane, it introduced a class of fares called Basic Economy, the cheapest fares. Passengers with those tickets, though, will not be able to book their seats in advance and will not be able to refund or change those tickets.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#39;s&#0160;still another example of the way the good ol&#39; USA is becoming more and more a class-ridden society.&#0160;Billions for the few,&#0160;sub-minimum wage for the many. I wonder why the airlines don&#39;t go whole hog&#0160;and separate passengers not by front and back of the plane, but by plane itself. Class I planes -- all sleek and shiny with free champagne supper and lie-flat quilted seats, and Class II planes -- no seats at all, just a few square feet&#0160;on the corrugated metal floor.&#0160;For only a few extra dollars, you will be able to reserve your very own couple of square feet.&#0160;Do you think I&#39;m imagining some sort of wild dystopian future? I don&#39;t think so.&#0160;The way things are going, it&#39;s an inevitability.&#0160;</p>

                                <p>A surprising number of current NBA players take the&#0160;floor with their names reversed:&#0160;first name for surname, surname for first.&#0160;The king of this confusion is LeBron James, who in any sensible universe would be named James LeBron.&#0160;And then there&#39;s the budding star Nerlens Noel.&#0160;Who can possibly doubt that&#0160;Nerlens Noel is a copy editor&#39;s error for Nerlens, Noel -- the lost comma&#0160;precipitating the embarrassing inversion? The very same error seems to have produced&#0160;Leonard Kawhi, Jack Jarrett, Howard Dwight,&#0160;Irving Kyrie,&#0160;Arthur Darrell, Leonard Meyers and Anthony Carmelo.&#0160;Then there&#39;s Cory Joseph, the Spurs&#39; talented backup point guard, about whom Edward Arlington Robinson wrote the poem -- o wait no, that was Richard Cory -- or&#0160;Cory Richard, as he would have been known if he had preferred b-ball&#0160;to banking.&#0160;</p>
<p>And there are also two closely&#0160;related&#0160;onomastic anomalies:&#0160;the &quot;two first name syndrome&quot; featuring Chis Paul and&#0160;Paul George (with help from Joel Anthony), and the &quot;two surname&#0160;syndrome,&quot;&#0160;where the&#0160;Dallas Mavericks teammates Tyson Chandler and Chandler Parsons have completely confounded&#0160;prae with&#0160;cog.&#0160;Or&#0160;should their team now be updated&#0160;to&#0160;Mavericks Dallas?</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>My daughter&#39;s nephew-in-law, Zach Appelman, is a talented actor setting out on what might very well turn out to be&#0160;a terrific&#0160;career. (His ascent&#0160;would be more rapid&#0160;if he would take his aunt-in-law&#39;s father&#39;s&#0160;advice and change his stage name to Zach Barrymore or Zach Zellweger, but the young man has too much integrity to comply with aged opportunistic wisdom).</p>
<p>Zach recently played Hamlet at the Hartford Stage in Connecticut (Hartford Courant:&#0160;&quot;a career-propelling performance that at times takes your breath away&quot;).&#0160;I spoke&#0160;with Zach at the recent&#0160;family Thanksgiving and he told me that the director of this <em>Hamlet</em>,&#0160;Darko Tresnjak, made an effort to emphasize the play&#39;s comic passages.&#0160;It was a good idea, I think, because <em>Hamlet</em> is both&#0160;in reading and performance an intermittently hilarious&#0160;piece of dramatic art.&#0160;But, added&#0160;Zach, sometimes the audience laughed at moments that he did not anticipate.&#0160;He cited an example in the&#0160;so-called &quot;bedroom scene,&quot; where&#0160;Hamlet assails Gertrude&#0160;for marrying Claudius.&#0160;Hamlet&#39;s rebuke of his mother&#0160;is harsh&#0160;and dislocating. About her marriage to Claudius, he says&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>You cannot call it love;&#0160; for at your age</p>
<p>The hectic in the blood is tame, it&#39;s humble</p>
<p>It waits upon the judgment.</p>
<p>These lines&#0160;apparently caused quite a commotion among the seniors in the audience.&#0160;It is not hard to imagine why.&#0160;Hamlet, for all his sparkling intelligence, is callow.&#0160;He has&#0160;youth&#39;s&#0160;ignorance about middle-age sexuality -- as&#0160;the silver-threads-among-the-gold demographic must certainly have recognized.&#0160;How could Hamlet (or perhaps even young Shakespeare, a mere thirty-five when he wrote the play), know that desire and passion increase in middle-age as&#0160;impetuous adolescent oestrus and fumblings are superseded by mature appreciation and achievement.</p>
<p>I doubt that&#0160;Shakespeare meant Hamlet&#39;s lines to be funny -- there&#39;s no room for humor in the rhapsody of words that the prince&#0160;directs at his mommy.&#0160;Nevertheless, a modern sophisticated and wrinkle-deep-in-time audience cannot help but titter at Hamlet&#39;s grotesque misjudgment.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>These observations on sex in youth and age were still percolating in my waiting-for-wisdom brain while&#0160;I&#0160;re-read, for, what? &#0160;the fourth or fifth or sixth&#0160;time, Anthony Trollope&#39;s excellent 1857 novel, <em>Barchester Towers</em>.&#0160;My attention was caught, this time through,&#0160;by one of Trollope&#39;s digressions, very pertinent to the topic of autumnal&#0160;love, and which I now transcribe&#0160;in a slightly reduced&#0160;version and which I think is well worthy intense study, especially by my readers of certain late-hectic ages.</p>
<p>&quot;It is, we believe, [says Trollope] common with young men of five and twenty to look on their seniors -- on men of, say, double their own age -- as so&#0160;many stocks and stones -- stocks and stones, that is, in regard to feminine beauty.&quot;</p>
<p>(Let me interject that for &quot;young men of five and twenty&quot;, think &quot;Hamlet.&quot;&#0160;And when Trollope talks of &quot;feminine beauty,&quot; let us recognize that the phrase is a&#0160; euphemistic Victorian surrogate&#0160;for issues of human desire and sexuality that conventional taboos made it impossible for Trollope to address forthrightly.)</p>
<p>&quot;There never was a greater mistake [continues Trollope].&#0160;Men of fifty don&#39;t dance mazurkas, being generally too fat and wheezy;&#0160;nor do they sit for hours together on river banks at their mistresses&#39; feet, being somewhat afraid of rheumatism.&#0160;But for real true love, love at first sight, love to devotion, love that robs a man of his sleep, love [and here Trollope begins to quote from the famous passage in <em>Love&#39;s Labor&#39;s Lost]</em> &#39;that will gaze an eagle blind, love that will hear the lowest sound when the suspicious head of theft is stopped, love that is like a Hercules still climbing trees in the Hesperides, we believe that this best age is from forty-five to seventy.&quot;</p>
<p>Forty-five to seventy, ladies and gentleman.&#0160;Just the age of the men and women in the Hartford playhouse who snickered&#0160;at&#0160;Hamlet junior&#39;s&#0160;incomprehension&#0160;of his mother&#39;s passions.&#0160;</p>
<p>And then Trollope brings his excursus to conclusion with a great sentence in which he both&#0160;disses and dismisses&#0160;immature youthful ardor:</p>
<p>&quot;Up to that age [i.e. forty-five] men are generally given to mere flirting.&quot;</p>
<p>&#0160;As perhaps Hamlet flirts with Ophelia.</p>
<p>It&#39;s intriguing that Trollope recognizes that men of seventy summers may still be ardent lovers and appreciators of the flesh. If he had been a little older and more experienced, he would have increased his estimate to seventy-five, perhaps even eighty. After all, eighty is the new seventy, is it not?&#0160;&#0160;Or he might even have acknowledged that it ain&#39;t over until it&#39;s over.</p>
<p>Trollope was only forty-two when he wrote&#0160;<em>Barchester Towers, </em>so perhaps he knew that he was only capable of mere flirtation with Rose Heseltine.&#0160;But he was 67 when he proposed, in the nasty dystopia <em>The Fixed Period, </em>that 68 was the age at which all men should be required to give up the ghost.&#0160;<em>The Fixed Period</em> is a novel which, at least to this septuagenarian, provokes not titters but guffaws.&#0160;Poor Anthony T. had become so terribly sour, so unlike the Trollope of Barchester.</p>

                                <p>What indeed?&#0160; In Trollope&#39;s <em>Barchester Towers, </em>when&#0160;Mrs Quiverful discovers that her husband, rector of Puddingdale, is not to become warden of&#0160;Hiram&#39;s Hospital, she sets out to Barchester to confront the bishop. Not a walker, and not the owner of a horse or carriage of her own, she &quot;begged that Farmer Subsoil would take her thither in his tax-cart.&quot;&#0160; A tax-cart, as far as the dictionary is concerned, is a &quot;small spring-cart on which a tax is paid.&quot;&#0160;So it is properly a &quot;taxed-cart.&quot;&#0160; A &quot;spring-cart&quot; is a &quot;springed-cart&quot; -- i.e a cart with springs.&#0160;But were taxes paid on&#0160;all vehicles?&#0160;If so, why should this one kind of vehicle be called a &quot;tax-cart?&quot;&#0160;But if not, why should this particular kind of vehicle be singled out of taxation.&#0160;Trollope does not illuminate.&#0160;</p>
<p>And so to the other nineteenth-century horsedrawn vehicles (barouche, basket carriage, berlin, <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2006/01/new_words.html">britchka</a>, brougham, buckboard, buggy, cabriolet, caleche, cariole, carryall, chaise, chariot, clarence, concord wagon, coupe, croydon, curricle, cutter, daumont, dearborn, dennet, diligence, dog-cart, fiacre, fly, fourgon, four-wheeler, gig, go-cart, governess cart, hansom, herdic, jaunty car, jersey-wagon, kibitka, landau, <a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2010/04/horsedrawn-vehicle.html.html " target="_self">patache</a>, phaeton, pill-box, post-chaise, rockaway, shandrydan, shay, sociable, spider-phaeton, spring-van, stanhope, sulky, surrey, T-cart, telyezhka, tilbury, <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2008/01/the-tarantass.html">tarantass</a>, trap, troika, victoria, vis-a-vis, wagonette,&#0160;whitechapel, and&#0160;wurt) now add &quot;tax-cart.&quot;</p>
