		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I don&#39;t know why, but It&#39;s surprisingly common, in movieworld, that if a man stumbles away from an automobile accident, he must cotract amnesia and he must suspect that he&#39;s murdered someone. On top of that, it&#39;s required that he will take full ninety minutes to prove that he is innocent of killing anyone. <em>The Third Day</em> hits these notes right down the middle. But <em>The Third Day</em> is not just an amnesia/murder mystery/police procedural. It&#39;s also a soap opera/marriage-on-the-rocks movie; it&#39;s a save-the-small-town-factory from corporate raiders story. And it&#39;s a maniac-on-the-loose horror film. T<em>he Third Day</em> is a crowded conflation of genres which doesn&#39;t quite succeed in finding a concord to its redundant discord.</p>
<p>The first ten minutes are the best. Steve Mallory, played by George Peppard, returns to pre-amnesia life only to discover, and be dismayed, that he&#39;s a lout, barroom brawler, a drunk, and a womanizer. Peppard is perfectly cast because &quot;baffled&quot; is his default expression. It&#39;s his gift.</p>
<p>Sally Kellerman, later Hot Lips Houlihan, is the vamp. Arte Johnson, later Laugh-In&#39;s Wolfgang is the maniac. Herbert Marshall has the worst role of his career, but if there were a lifetime achievement award for finger-acting, he would win it. Robert Webber is the detective hot to prove that Steve Mallory is guilty, but he should have been more empathetic because earlier that same year he had himself suffered a full ninety minutes of amnesia in<em> Hysteria (</em>1965).</p>
<p>I could almost bring myself to admire this picture. It&#39;s well-paced, well-directed, beautifully photographed, mysterious in parts; a couple of luminous supporting roles. It flagged somewhere half way through. So did I.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>There are so many overlaps between <em>Richard III</em> (1593) and <em>Macbeth</em> (1606) that it sometimes seems as though Shakespeare pillaged and reformed the earlier play when he composed the later. Both plays feature cynical upward strivers (&quot;hellhounds,&quot; the playwright calls them both) who risk damnation to murder their way to the throne, and then lose their kingdoms in battle and are succeeded by spotless young heirs. Both Richard of Gloucester and Macbeth kill innocent children and both are haunted by the ghosts of those they have murdered.</p>
<p>Yet the two plays are very different. <em>Macbeth</em> is a tidy economical play (Shakespeare&#39;s second shortest), while R<em>ichard III</em> (his second longest) is sprawling and repetitious, sometimes even bewildering, stuffed to the gills with incident and declamation. Moreover, <em>Richard III</em> lacks witches, moving forests, young Malcolm, Macduff&#39;s mysterious birth, and above all, ambitious Lady Macbeth. While Richard is famously amusing, Macbeth hasn&#39;t the slightest sense of humor even though he can be unconsciously ironic.&#0160;</p>
<p>When similar circumstances arise, as they must, it becomes obvious that the rhetorical strategies of<em> Richard III</em> are rudimentary compared to the richer and more satisfying language of <em>Macbeth.</em></p>
<p>Here is one passage in the earlier play that has an echo or correspondence in the later. Richard instructs a follower to slander King Edward (&quot;luxury&quot; means &quot;lust&quot;)&quot;</p>
<p>&#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; urge his (i.e. Edward&#39;s) hateful luxury,<br />And bestial appetite in change of lust;<br />Which stretch&#39;d unto their servants, daughters, wives,<br />Even where his raging eye or savage heart,<br />Without control, listed to make a prey.</p>
<p>In <em>Macbeth</em>, Malcolm slanders himself.</p>
<p>&#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160;There&#39;s no bottom, none,<br />In my voluptuousness. Your wives, your daughters,<br />Your matrons and your maids, could not fill up<br />The cistern of my lust, and my desire<br />All continent impediments would o&#39;erbear<br />That did oppose my will.</p>
<p>Unbounded lust is the subject of both speeches - &quot;servants, daughters, wives,&quot; expands into the even more inclusive wives, daughters, matrons, and maids. Richard&#39;s statement is strong, its power strengthened by the litany of allusions to the uncivil wild: &quot;bestial,&quot; &quot;raging,&quot; &quot;savage,&quot; &quot;prey.&quot; Macbeth&#39;s is considerably more powerful, primarily because of the extended metaphor in which lust is conceived as some sort of fluid. Many an acre foot of lust could be contained in a &quot;cistern&quot; without a &quot;bottom.&quot;&#0160; Yet in fact a bottomless cistern would impound only a portion of Malcolm&#39;s sexual gusher which, it seems, is many times more abundant than a single cisternfull; it&#39;s a deluge that &quot;continent impediments&quot; such as embankments or dikes or dams cannot restrain. It&#39;s a tsunami.</p>
<p>A second correspondence occurs when Richard engages in a moment of self-evaluation. &quot;But I am in/ So far in blood that sin will pluck on sin;/ Tear-falling pity dwells not in this eye.&quot; Macbeth&#39;s improvement: &quot;I am in blood/ Stepped in so far, that should I wade no more/ Returning were as tedious as go o&#39;er.&quot; Blood in both, to be sure, but there are improvements. In the earlier passage, the key terms are sin and pity, abstractions which are rooted in the antecedent allegorical drama. &quot;Sin&quot; becomes a personage: &quot;sin will pluck on sin.&quot; And pity or perhaps Pity, is also vivified through the use of the modifier &quot;tear-falling.&quot; But these harkings back to allegory hint at the less abstract and more imaginative figure adumbrated in the phrase &quot;so far in blood.&quot; It would be more ordinary and idiomatic to say not &quot;stepped in so far&quot; but &quot;stepped in so <em>deep</em>.&quot; Unless, of course, the playwright had an idea lurking in the recesses of his brain which he didn&#39;t quite articulate. Ten years later, Richard&#39;s puddle became Macbeth&#39;s river or lake or even ocean, deep enough that it required the usurper king to &quot;wade&quot; in it. Shakespeare pursues the metaphor to its completion: &quot;should I wade no more/ Returning were as tedious as go o&#39;er&quot; -- a figure which makes it clear that Macbeth is overshoes, knee deep -- or even hip deep --&#0160; in a nightmare swamp of his own making, There&#39;s no side channel, no bridge, no way out.</p>
<p>So apprentice &quot;sin&quot; and &quot;pity&quot; are superseded by masterly &quot;cistern&quot; and &quot;blood&quot; and &quot;wade.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>It&#39;s not by accident that <em>Macbeth</em> is so deeply unsettling.</p>

                                <p>Another automobile accident and another hospitalized amnesiac. Once again, the poor guy might have committed a murder, but he&#39;s not sure. And once again, there&#39;s a loyal young woman (Gina McConnell, played by Jennifer Jayne) to help him reconstruct his past. As well as a beguiling dangerous femme fatale and a double-dealing psychiatrist. Knockout drops, hallucinations, an escape through a window, a clever detective, a disappearing corpse, multiple flashbacks. The usual stuff, another day at the noir office.</p>
<p>The gimmick this time: Chris Smith (Robert Webber) has recovered his memory but keeps up the pretense so he can solve the murder. Everyone is kept in the dark, including the befuddled audience. It&#39;s a tricky move and highly unpersuasive. The last line of the Wiki plot summary tells you all you need to know in the way of cliche: &quot;Chris is reunited with Gina.&quot;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I&#39;ve now reported on thirty-two separate amnesia movies and there are surely many more out there to which I am unacquainted. Why so many? How come Shakespeare didn&#39;t write an amnesia play? Why are there no classic novels about amnesia? Didn&#39;t unsuspecting folks get themselves bopped on the head in previous centuries? Didn&#39;t knights ever fall off their stallions and thwack their helms and beavers?</p>
<p>Here&#39;s an obvious answer to the gimmick&#39;s popularity: amnesia provides three of the major elements of all story-telling: Mystery, Quest, and Identity (or as Lear puts it, &quot;Who is it that can tell me who I am?&quot;) But why is it repeated so obsessively in film?</p>
<p>Today a twofer, bringing the grand total to thirty-four. In <em>Two in the Dark&#0160;</em>(1936), an amnesiac (Walter Abel) comes to awareness on a street corner and suspects that he has committed a murder. Rest easy; he didn&#39;t do any such thing. But he needs the help of a good-looking out-of-work actress (Margot Grahame) to establish his innocence. His amnesia is garden variety, &quot;bang-bang&quot;. One blow to the old bean and he forgets who he is; later a second whomp and it all comes back in a flash (in the form of a flashback). Very convenient, very tidy, but not very imaginative. The film is languidly paced, almost slow-motion.</p>
<p>Curiously, <em>Two in the Dark</em> was remade nine years afterward as <em>Two O-Clock Courage </em>with the director of the earlier film serving as the producer of the later. It was a good idea to try again, because the later film was directed by Anthony Mann, who keeps things brisk. Although the plot and a great deal of the dialog was copied wholesale, it&#39;s a much better and different film, mostly because the amnesiac&#39;s fellow investigator is now a wise-cracking female taxi-driver -- a character straight out of the screwball comedies. When she&#39;s on screen, the film becomes a feast of badinage. Tom Conway as the amnesiac is dignified and expressionless, but Ann Rutherford steals the show as the fast-talking cabbie.&#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;Bang-bang&quot; or &quot;thwack-thwack&quot; amnesia arrives and departs easily. It comes with an on-off switch. Contrary to human psychological experience, it leaves no residue except for a couple of neat Band-Aids -- one on each side of the head.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I&#39;m a movie lover, but I&#39;m not indiscriminate. Here follows a list of common movie occurrences that compel me either to seek out nineteenth-century novels or force me to bury my head under the blankets.&#0160;</p>
<p>1. Cute puppies, especially when the boy and the girl kiss for the first time, and the director, unfazed by cliche or rank sentimentality, cuts to the pooch&#39;s just darling head-tilt. Even worse when the doggie covers his cute eyes with his cute paw. Aaargh.</p>
<p>2. Child actors, with rare exceptions. Some few gifted children know how to be natural, but most just make me cringe.&#0160;</p>
<p>3. Gratuitous killing of &quot;redskins,&quot; especially when aestheticized. How gracefully, when shot by the cavalry marksmen, do the Comanches plummet from the face of the cliff or tumble down the scree. In Western after Western, they take huge losses -- presenting themselves as targets while they ride crazily around the circled wagons -- a strategy that is cinematic but nonsensical. And also: all the retrogressive, antediluvian blackface and yellowface and brownface stereotypes that make us gasp with horror at our racist forebears.</p>
<p>4. Those far too frequent scenes, where the guy, pursued either by the police or the husband, goes out the 16th story window of his hotel and works his way across a narrow ledge to another window (always unlocked). Such scenes give me the willies.</p>
<p>5. Car chases. Boring, boring, boring. I&#39;ve discussed this <a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2008/02/car-chases.html ">in the past. </a></p>
<p>6. Montage dating scenes: boy and girl meet cute. After the mandatory misunderstanding, they reconcile, and then we see five seconds of them sitting in a restaurant, smiling; next they&#39;re rowing in a boat in the park; then they&#39;re on a ferry, or at a picnic etc. etc. From this we are supposed to deduce that they&#39;re in love. Predictable cut to the predictable soft-focus bedroom. Romance, which ought to be thrilling, becomes, through repetition and want of originality, almost as boring as a car chase.</p>
<p>7. Funny drunks. They&#39;re not funny. Alcoholism is a destructive disease.&#0160;</p>
<p>8. The scene in which the stoic hero has taken a bullet in the shoulder and it&#39;s going to be extracted by an amateur. No anesthetics. &quot;Here, bite on this.&quot; Even worse, if possible, when it&#39;s not a bullet but an arrow.</p>
<p>9. Background music that dictates the emotions we are supposed to feel. Worse still, the background noise that is currently so fashionable. Not music, just a loud drone, which sometimes drowns the dialogue.</p>
<p>10. Zachary Scott</p>
<p>Also, movies adapted from cartoons: Batman, Superman, etc. Horror films, designed to scare the pants off you. I can&#39;t bear to watch them (I&#39;ve never recovered from <em>Abbott and Costello Meet</em> <em>Frankenstein</em> [1948]). Action films, especially ones in which a retired CIA agent or detective or whatever is called back to duty for one last assignment. And finally, anything with zombies, cyborgs, extraterrestrials, robots, demonic children who vomit blood, or tentacles.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>This time, amnesia minus the amnesia. Heiress Matilda Frazier, presumed to have perished in a shipboard fire, returns home where she&#39;s met by Steven Howard who claims to be her recently-wedded husband. She fails to remember him for the good reason that she&#39;s never met him and hasn&#39;t lost her memory. It&#39;s a case of &quot;attributed amnesia.&quot; Not a disease at all -- merely a handy plot device, credible in black-and-white 40s murder mysteries where amnesia is as common as a slight cold. Matilda is temporarily deceived by Mr.Howard. So are the spectators.</p>
<p>Terrific direction by Michael Curtiz, fine performance by luminous Joan Caulfield, reliable work by steady Fred Clark, effortful ventriloquism by Constance Bennett in a part originally written for Eve Arden.</p>
<p><em>The Unsuspected </em>borrows much too much from <em>Laura</em> (1944). In addition to the prominently-displayed portrait, there&#39;s Claude Rains channeling Clifton Webb. Plus the heroine&#39;s return from presumed death, the curious sexless relationship between an older man (the murderer) and a much younger woman. A smitten investigator. Good thing there&#39;s a dollop of fake amnesia to help differentiate the two films.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>In <em>Cymbeline</em> (1611?), Shakespeare, still innovating even at the end of his career, deepens the character of Innogen by supplying her with an unusual psychological trait. He presents her to us as an escapist or fantasist who leaps to imagine herself a different person in a different world. Here&#39;s Innogen early in the play, when she realizes that her cross-class marriage to Postumus (she&#39;s a princess, he&#39;s a poor but worthy gentleman) is at risk: &quot;Would I were/ A neatherd&#39;s daughter, and my Leonatus/ Our neighbor shepherd&#39;s son.&quot; She fantasizes herself surrendering her nobility to become a peasant. A few moments later, she learns that her lover Leonatus and his rival the clotpoll Cloten have been in a sword fight and that Cloten has retreated. Innogen&#39;s reaction: &quot;I would they were in Afric both together/ Myself by with a needle, that I might prick/ The goer-back&quot;. Why Africa? Because, among other reasons, it is far from the British court where Innogen&#39;s activities are heavily restricted. So in two short speeches Innogen has expressed willingness to being transformed in both class and geography. Shortly afterward, Innogen describes (in another &quot;would that&quot; imagining) how she would have stared at the retreating ship which takes Postumus into exile: &quot;I would have broke mine eye-strings, cracked them,/ To look upon him till the dimunition/ Of space had pointed him sharp as my needle.&quot; Indifferent to physical pain, she now imagines herself transcending not only class and space, but also the limitations of her own body.</p>
<p>It was no accident that Shakespeare gave Innogen such freedom to re-invent herself, because in the scenes that follow, she will undergo a series of radical transformations -- from princess to a &quot;franklin&#39;s wife,&quot; into a boy cooking fancy food for three cave-dwelling mountain-men, and then a dutiful page to the general of the invading Roman army, all the while avoiding betrayal, attempted rape and apparent poisoning. It&#39;s a lot for Innogen to deal with, but Shakespeare knew exactly what he was doing when he started her off with an imagination equal to the task.&#0160;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>It&#39;s a commonplace that every one of us is improbable and accidental -- a fluke of all flukes. The odds against you or me or any particular person being born, of coming into life, are infinitesimal -- a positron&#39;s dimension (if positrons have dimension) shy of nothing, of zero.</p>
<p>Why is any birth so unlikely?&#0160; To begin, while every sperm is sacred (as we&#39;re told on good authority), every sperm is also unique. There are 200 million or more of the little whipper-snappers in the normal ounce or so of human male ejaculate -- each one a quirky unique assemblage of genes. Both your and my individual existence depends on one particular sperm lashing itself into a lather to be the first to break the tape. If the sperm with your name on it had foundered, and the dark horse sperm in the next lane had penetrated the egg, you yourself wouldn&#39;t have been conceived, wouldn&#39;t have existed. An entirely other human being would have suckled at the breast, cried in the crib, perched in the high chair. If you&#39;re a boy, your &quot;other&quot; might have been a girl, and vice versa.</p>
<p>So we are all many-millions-to-one long shots. But multiply the odds against you yourself being welcomed to the world by the even more remote odds against the conceptions of your four grandparents. Your grandmas and grandpapas exist only because in each case two people out of all the potential great-grandparent-generation cohort on earth chanced to meet and find a particular opportunity on a particular day and particular spot of time to copulate so that those remote grandsires could launch their own flotilla of swimmers upriver. How many accidents had to occur to compile the particular DNA which comprises your own identity and individuality?&#0160;</p>
<p>Then we must add factors such as the strife and wars and migrations and diseases that united or separated our great-grandfolks and their great-great grandfolks and yea, even unto our Olduvai forebears and to the pliopithecoids who preceded them, and then back through the early mammals and to the dark backward and abysm of time. Gosh, it makes you wonder how anything at all ever happens to happen in this random chancy aleatory world -- and yet remarkable things (such as you and I being born) continue to occur. And a good thing, too.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>This entry is written at the specific instruction of my daughter, who says, &quot;your grandchildren will want to know about your birth. It&#39;s their history too.&quot; The following paragraphs are for them and for their descendants.</p>
<p>My older sister, Susan, died of pneumonia at the age of nine months on March 15, 1938. If she had lived, I wouldn&#39;t exist, nor would my ten descendants, and no one would notice.</p>
<p>I was born on March 11, 1939, just one year minus four days after Susan died. It seems obvious that I was purposely conceived as a substitute for the dead child -- and it therefore follows that I was delivered into a disrupted, stressed family. Was I to be treasured as a compensation for past grief or to be resented as an imperfect interloper? Or both, simultaneously? To raise the ante, it is also a fact that during that fatal March of 1938 when Susan lay dying, my older brother Eugene, then just shy of three years of age, was gravely ill of the same disease that killed his younger sister, and that although he was at death&#39;s door, he managed to pull through.</p>
<p>So let us consider the situation of my parents, Manny and Lil, in June of 1938, the month of my conception. Poor Susan lay a-mouldering in her tiny grave for just three months. The Great Depression was still going strong and Hitler&#39;s Nuremberg Laws had been in force since 1935. Father Coughlin, celebrity Jew-hater, was agitating thirty million American radio listeners a week. Kristallnacht was just five months away and most everyone knew that war was imminent. Residing on East 9th Street in Flatbush were my grief-stricken young parents, who had helplessly watched one child die and had come within a hairbreadth of losing another. We must imagine them reeling, tearful, clinging to one another, dealing as best they might with heartbreaking anxiety and pain. Yet despite public and personal disasters, they made the courageous choice to throw the dice again, and out of their anguish to bring forth another child -- and to run the real risk, in those pre-antibiotic days, of offering still another sacrifice to pneumonia or some other dread incurable illness.</p>
<p>If my parents were still alive, I&#39;d congratulate them, celebrate them, not because their resilience produced me, but because to beget a substitute child in chaotic, dangerous 1938 seems to me, now, looking back from the perspective of 2020, to be an act of unfathomable courage.</p>
<p>Or so I would like to think. It&#39;s also possible that I&#39;m here not because of their heroism but because of a failure of contraception. I&#39;ll never know. I didn&#39;t ask; they never said, and the facts are unrecoverable. Lil and Manny wouldn&#39;t dream of speaking aloud about anything so intimate as sex or reproduction, certainly not with their children and, who knows, perhaps not even with one another. In that regard, they were typical of their generation. Personal matters were kept close to the vest.&#0160;</p>
<p>When Lil was five months pregnant, Hitler annexed the Sudetenland. Exactly three weeks before I landed on this planet, 20,000 Nazi supporters rallied, complete with Fascist salutes, at the old Madison Square Garden on 49th Street. Four days after I arrived, on the anniversary --the yahrzeit -- of the death of little Susan, while my mother was regaining her strength in Manhattan&#39;s Park East hospital on East 83rd Street, German tanks rolled into Czechoslovakia. For Lil, for Manny, personal and public crises intersected. Nazis foreign and domestic were at the gates, and inside the hospital, my mother was still mourning the loss of the little girl whom my Uncle Dan, my mother&#39;s brother, remembered as an &quot;exceptionally beautiful child.&quot; And lying beside Lil in her bed was the newborn, who was welcomed with joy, I&#39;m sure, but with ambivalence also. Not an eternally glowing-in-memory girl child but me --an undistinguished chap, to put it in the most favorable light. Not &quot;trailing clouds of glory&quot; but instead enveloped in a fog of danger and possibly regret.</p>
<p>My parents, as I have said, kept their emotions tightly buttoned, so while Susan was not mourned or even mentioned within the family, she was never forgotten. In fact, throughout my childhood she remained a mysterious ghostly presence. In my parents&#39; bedroom was a simple display -- a child-size wood-and-wicker chair and above it, on the wall, a gold-framed picture of a very pretty infant. The shrine fascinated me, and I would sneak into my parent&#39;s bedroom to study it. Sneak? Yes, because their bedroom was a consecrated place not to be defiled by Eugene or Jonathan or me. Off limits. It was the sin of all childhood sins to violate the taboo and cross into the forbidden zone. My mother made an unholy fuss about this rule. &quot;You are not to go into our bedroom. Ever.&quot; Which I did, regularly, when no one was looking --- but it felt like a midnight intrusion into a deep dark country graveyard. Very creepy. Who is that infant in the picture? And why is she not allowed to rest in peace? I knew better than to ask.</p>
<p>I never thought, then, to wonder how Manny and Lil, contemplating the gilded idol morn and eve, could fail to compare their frozen-in-time lost infant to her scruffy successor? Of course I was aware that my &quot;difficult&quot; mother was a deeply troubled woman. But never, trust me, did I have the least glimmer that the shade of the dead infant haunted our family -- and myself in particular. No child, certainly not me, would have been so insightful. It&#39;s transparent now, but it was anything but obvious then. Nor could anyone possibly have predicted that there was to be an area of study within the discipline of psychology called &quot;The Replacement Child Syndrome&quot; (RCS). And that I was unequivocally a textbook case of such.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>RCS lay dormant. Forty years later, and forty years ago, when I was in midlife, not having thought for decades about my dead sister or her shrine or my long-departed parents, I experienced something of a revelation. It came about indirectly, but dramatically.</p>
<p>I was teaching classes on Shakespeare&#39;s plays. and I found myself paying much more heed to <em>Romeo and Julie</em>t than that immature early tragedy warrants. I was especially intrigued by Shakespeare&#39;s invention of the character of young Juliet -- which is far more subtle than is necessary for the plot. With Juliet, Shakespeare attempted something utterly unprecedented in any previous work of literature. He cleverly situated his young heroine in a complicated family in which Juliet had, in effect, two mothers -- a birth mother, <em>Capulet wife</em>, who is cold, distant and aloof, and a metaphorical and therefore real mother, Nurse Angelica, who is undisciplined but sensual and sexual. The two mothers, carefully differentiated, precipitate or echo or explain the conflict within Juliet between propriety and passion. One mother embraces and promulgates Verona&#39;s rigid mores, while the other is impulsive, emotional, and anarchic. In addition -- and now it all was starting to become extremely personal for me -- Shakespeare provided Juliet with a backstory (unusual because his characters rarely have prior histories). It comes to light that the Nurse&#39;s own natural daughter had died in infancy, that the bereaved mother was engaged to suckle Juliet -- and that Angelica has been Juliet&#39;s surrogate mother and companion for almost fourteen years. So Juliet is, for the Nurse, clearly and obviously a replacement child. How curiously relevant! How provocative!</p>
<p>I then remembered that William Shakespeare himself was such a child. According to the Trinity Church records, John and Mary Shakespeare had suffered two tragedies before April 23, 1564 when William was born. Their first child, a daughter named Joan, had been baptized four years earlier, in 1560, but lived only for two months. A second daughter, Margaret, was baptized in 1562 and lived for just under one year. A full year! and then the grave! How horrible for all concerned! Young Will therefore entered the world as the boy child who replaced not one but two older sisters. Even in an age of staggering infant mortality, two such premature deaths must surely have weighed on both John and Mary and on William himself. Is it an accident that Juliet is the only certified replacement child in early modern English literature (at least, the only one that I can recall at this moment)?</p>
<p>Mulling these matters, I soon discovered that I had failed to register some additional facts about the Capulet family that by rights ought to have set my heart all aflutter. Listen to the Nurse nattering on about her surrogate daughter Juliet.</p>
<p><em>Even or odd, of all days in the year,</em></p>
<p><em>Come Lamass Eve at night shall she be fourteen,.</em></p>
<p><em>Susan and she -- God rest all Christian souls--</em></p>
<p><em>Were of an age.&#0160; Well, Susan is with God.</em></p>
<p><em>She was too good for me.</em></p>
<p>How could I have missed it?&#0160; Right at the heart of the Capulet family dynamics, and therefore at the heart of the play, is not just a dead infant and a dead daughter, but a dead Susan.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>I have to say that this discovery put my brain into quite an epiphanic tizzy. How could I not have recognized the parallels between the Capulet family and my own?&#0160; And also, given my near-compulsive interest in the bonds and affiliations among <em>Capulet wife</em> and Nurse Angelica and Juliet -- how could my conscious mind have ignored information that had so vexed my unconscious?&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Alerted by this 1595 play to my own personal being, I set out to learn about the Replacement Child Syndrome (RCS) in what is charitably called the &quot;literature&quot; of psychoanalysis. While almost everything I read was either obtuse or so encrusted with obscurantist jargon as to be indecipherable, it was not hard to distill the gist. According to the experts, a replacement is always vulnerable and at hazard, especially so if the deceased infant has not been properly mourned, or-- as they say -- if there has not been &quot;closure.&quot; Such a lad or lass goes through childhood constantly judged to be inferior to the idealized dead child. At worst, the love that is owed to the living child may be withdrawn and the replacement resented --&#0160; less loved, or even unloved; tolerated but undervalued.</p>
<p>Had she lived, the dead girl, let us call her Susan, of infinite and golden potential, would certainly have grown up to be an exceedingly dutiful daughter as well as a concert cellist and a world-class figure-skater who when just two years out of Yale would have created a state-of-the-art gynecological clinic in an underserved village in Moldova. The other, the replacement -- me -- bawls and pukes, bites a neighbor child on the cheek, throws a colossal shitfit over a missing puzzle piece, shatters an heirloom lamp, steals comic books from the local candy store, wastes weeks moping in his bedroom, totals the DeSoto, and fails trigonometry. No wonder he&#39;s a disappointment.</p>
<p>Well, maybe I&#39;m laying it on with a trowel, but that&#39;s the general idea.&#0160;</p>
<p>Now (this is still forty years ago) reconstituted as a Syndrome, I entered into my &quot;poor poor pitiful me&quot; period. I wasted kilowatts of energy and eons of precious time conceptualizing myself as a case of &quot;wrongful birth.&quot; I shifted the blame for all my emotional foibles onto my parents, especially, to be honest, onto my mother. Right at her doorstep I laid low self-esteem, intermittent depression, fear of success, disabling shyness and even (this was a bit of stretch) procrastination. But it didn&#39;t wash and it didn&#39;t last. I&#39;m ashamed and embarrassed that I allowed myself to attribute my personal problems to my willing but helpless mother. Not that there wasn&#39;t a smidgeon of truth to the RCS analysis. Freud says that &quot;a man who has won the love of his mother is always a hero in his own eyes&quot;; well, that kind of heroism wasn&#39;t going to be my lot. Of course I would have preferred to have enjoyed intimacy with a smiling supportive mother. Not what happened. But it was selfish and wrong of me to dwell on slights which were trivial compared to the traumas undergone by my parents.They, not me, were and are the heroes of this story.</p>
<p>The bedrock is that the RCS, though real, was only of middling significance to me. It was devastating for Juliet, because it led directly to her suicide, and it may have served as a spur to Shakespeare, who became Shakespeare and, incidentally, fathered a daughter named Susannah. For me -- well, it was it only important for the moment. I was a wounded child -- no, not wounded, scratched --but not a disabled one. I was healthy enough to pursue if not a distinguished, certainly a respectable career, to become a reliable father, to meet my obligations to my extended family and community and to form a long-lasting marriage -- and when that first marriage was cut short by disease and death, to achieve in old age a second mature and satisfying relationship. My parents must have done a great deal right, for I became what my father used to praise, without a shred of irony, as a &quot;proper, tax-paying citizen.&quot; At this point in my octogenarian life, there&#39;s no room for that old self-pitying me; instead, there&#39;s great admiration and regard for both Lil and Manny, who endured. And who, in the successes of their grandchildren and great-grandchildren, continue to thrive and prosper.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>An addendum: in the psychological &quot;literature&quot;, I found no mention, neither jot nor tittle, of the family configuration in which a male child replaces a female. No doubt such situations have by now been thoroughly researched by trained analysts, but not back then, when such a discussion might have been useful to me. The case of Juliet, where one girl replaces another, has been explored, but not Shakespeare&#39;s situation, or mine. I wonder sometimes whether the case of a boy succeeding a girl might lead to gender confusion, or as they now say, &quot;fluidity&quot; (if, for example, the parents unconsciously favor female traits in their son). I don&#39;t mean sexual practice, because I myself have never been (or wanted to be) anything other than a vanilla heterosexual. But I&#39;m not even slightly macho; I am strongly domestic, comfortable with roles that have been traditionally reserved for women. I&#39;m a gatherer, not a hunter; not the kind of person who goes to the fights with the guys or plays rugby and eventually, shunning the entrapment of wife or family, rides off on his horse into the sunset. I am much more likely to clean the bathroom, weed the garden, make some bad rhymes, play casino with the grandkids, and whip up a beef stew for dinner.&#0160;</p>
<p>Another addendum: I always wondered why Lil and Manny decided to give me an awkward obscure Biblical name. They had no interest in anything remotely smacking of religion. So why choose the name of one of Job&#39;s false comforters?&#0160; What were they thinking?&#0160; During my pitiful period, I imagined that they chose the name because they were disappointed with me. We can&#39;t name him Susan, said their joint unconscious, so let&#39;s give him an ugly name the diminutive of which is female. That was my theory, but now I have another idea. Perhaps, in March of 1939, to resurrect an obscure biblical name was to give the middle finger to Hitler. If so, it was an act of defiance. I hope I&#39;m right.</p>
<p>And finally: my younger brother Jonathan, who was as equally improbable a replacement as I, was born in July of 1942, seven month after the Day of Infamy. He too entered in troubling times. Jon was an extremely handsome youth, regularly gushed over by friends and family -- and slightly envied by me. One of his shaping childhood experiences is of my mother holding his head in her hands and saying, &quot;You would have made a very beautiful girl.&quot;</p>
<p>Jon too is a gatherer rather than a hunter, and when I&#39;m in the kitchen slicing the potatoes and carrots for a big pot of beef stew, it&#39;s his excellent recipe that I follow.</p>
