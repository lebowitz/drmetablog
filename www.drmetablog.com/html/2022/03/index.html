		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p><a href="   https://www.drmetablog.com/2008/05/ccny-basketball.html"></a>Of the many Brooklyn novels that I&#39;ve read this last while, <em>Big Man</em>, by Jay Neugeboren, comes closest to home. Neugeboren was newborn in 1938, just a year before me, and he attended fabled Erasmus Hall High School, most likely graduating with the class of 1955 (I was &#39;56). It&#39;s a mark of my ignorance of modern American letters that I had no idea that my near-classmate was the author of 24 books, most of them novels. <em>Big Man</em> was Neugeboren&#39;s first novel.&#0160;</p>
<p>Close to home? Here are couple of sentences that will shiver the nostalgia timbers of wistful ex-Erasmians.&#0160;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I walk down Church Avenue, past the Kenmore Theater. Across the street the old church, used to cut classes and sit in the graveyard....&#0160; In front of Garfields&#39;s Cafeteria all the guys hanging out with their broads and their puffed hair.... Guys with Erasmus jackets on. I keep walking. Past the firehouse and the Holy Cross schoolyard.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wow, it&#39;s a guided tour of the old neighborhood as it was in the 1950s. Who from Erasmus hasn&#39;t sprawled on the steps of the Dutch Reformed Church?</p>
<p>The novel revolves around the 1951 basketball scandals, which were world-shaking news at the time. A number of New York City college players (CCNY, St. Johns, Fordham, LIU) fell into the clutches of shady gamblers and were paid to shave points.&#0160; A few were indicted and convicted. I wrote a few melancholy and disillusioned paragraphs about the scandals some years ago -- <a href="   https://www.drmetablog.com/2008/05/ccny-basketball.html">here.</a></p>
<p>In <em>Big Man,&#0160;</em>Neugeboren tells the story through the eyes and mouth of a character named Mack Davis, who had been an upcoming star but is now, because he missed a couple of baskets, stuck in a dead-end job at an automated carwash. It&#39;s an ambitious conceit and a promising plot. <em>Big Man, </em>I regret to say, is not a very artistic piece of work, but what the heck! Neugeboren was only 25 or 26 when he wrote it and had had only a few years to recover from uninspiring Erasmus Hall English classes.&#0160;</p>
<p>I confess that I was uncomfortable that Neugeboren wrote the novel in a black voice. I don&#39;t object in theory, because there&#39;s no earthly reason why a white novelist can&#39;t impersonate a black person, any more than male novelist can&#39;t speak as a female (or vice versa), or a young writer speak in the voice of an old. So wny was I troubled? I think it was because the voice that the novelist invented didn&#39;t seem genuine. It seemed &quot;literary&quot; -- as though the Davis character had been heisted out of a&#0160; blaxploitation film. Occasional inadvertent lapses in the dialect were particularly painful to my ever-sensitive ears.</p>
<p><em>Big Man</em> reminds me how central basketball was to my adolescent life. I think if I had spent as much time and effort on my schoolwork as I did practicing my foul shots I might have been somebody. But I think I learned as much about life from basketball and its scandals as I did from any other 1950s phenomenon (such as the antics of &quot;Tailgunner Joe&quot; McCarthy). I&#39;m grateful to Jay Neugeboren for preserving an important piece of my history and especially for bringing the old neighborhood right to the forefront.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>It should be remembered and recorded that in October of 1960, Eleanor Roosevelt herself visited the home of my parents --my childhood home (539 East 9 Street in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn).</p>
<p>I myself missed the occasion, alas. I was then living in Massachusetts, undergoing the first disorienting days of graduate school. But I know the story.&#0160;</p>
<p>During the 1960 presidential campaign (John F. Kennedy versus &quot;Tricky Dick&quot; Nixon), JFK&#39;s Catholicism emerged as a divisive issue. It&#39;s hard to believe what a fuss was made about his religion, especially nowadays, when no one bothers themselves that Joseph Biden is not only a Roman Catholic, but a serious one at that (JFK&#39;s personal commitment to his religion was, let&#39;s say, nominal).</p>
<p>Among Jewish voters, some of whom had grown up in Brownsville or Williamsburg or the Lower East side where Jewish-Irish conflict was a fact of life, there was a great deal of resistance to voting for JFK. And other Jewish voters, harking back to the old country, remembered Catholics as their antagonists and were hard put to vote for a candidate of that persuasion.</p>
<p>It fell to the task of Mrs. Roosevelt to persuade these reluctant voters that they could and should cast a ballot for Kennedy. At the time, there was no one in America who had more credibility with Jewish populations than she. It was well known that Mrs. Roosevelt had lobbied her hesitant husband for more lenient policies toward &quot;displaced&quot; Jews</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know how it came about that our living room was chosen as a site for Mrs. Roosevelt to meet with voters. I suspect that it was through my mother&#39;s extensive contacts with members of the League of Women Voters, an organization of which she was a stalwart volunteer. I know that my mother assembled 50 or so voters, almost all Jewish women, and seated or stood them in our very crowded second floor living room. Mrs. Roosevelt arrived, and as my father said to me later, she &quot;dragged her ass&quot; up two flights of stairs, spoke for 20 minutes, presumably in that upper-class nasal twang for which she was famous, answered a couple of respectful questions, and then limped back down to her car. And went on to the next venue. And the next. (She was 76 at the time, and not in great health.) Apparently she followed this same arduous routine for months.</p>
<p>That&#39;s how elections are won.</p>
<p>Eleanor Roosevelt died two years later, in 1962.&#0160;</p>

<div class="bRMDJf islir" role="button" tabindex="0">&#0160;</div>
<div class="bRMDJf islir" role="button" tabindex="0">I&#39;m proud that our home hosted Mrs. Roosevelt. It&#39;s too bad that 539 East 9 was demolished in 1988. It deserved a better fate, especially since there was a day when it was graced by one of the previous century&#39;s finest human beings.</div>

To football fans, he was as renowned a home-town boy as Sandy Koufax was to followers of baseball. But until I read R.D. Rosen&#39;s new biography of Sid, called <em>Tough Luck,&#0160;</em>I didn&#39;t know that football&#39;s first T-formation quarterback was a neighborhood guy, and that his modest childhood home was just four blocks off the route that Stephen Lewin and I took every morning for four years to EHHS. And that his house was just around the corner from the Sears department store where <a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2007/07/summers-at-sear.html">I spent the summer</a> of 1957 pulling down $1.25 large an hour.&#0160;&#0160;</p>

I suspect that the house is not much changed from the way it appeared in the 1930s but that the bars on the windows and front door are later additions. According to Zillow, the House of Sid is 1664 sq. ft. and is now priced at c. $750,000. I&#39;d bet $2500 was the number in the 1930s, when the Luckman family was in residence.</p>
<p>Shouldn&#39;t there be a bronze plaque on the property?</p>
<p>It&#39;s a measure of the chanciness of the old neighborhood that Sid&#39;s father was convicted and imprisoned for a gangland murder and that he died in Sing Sing.</p>

		<a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2022/03/girl-in-translation-2010.html">Yet Another Brooklyn Novel: Jean Kwok, Girl in Translation (2010)</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p><em>Girl in Translation</em> is the story of a young, impoverished immigrant from Hong Kong. I may be wrong, but it reads as if it were less a novel than a barely fictionalized autobiography (Jean Kwok, the author, made her way from an unheated tenement to Harvard; Kimberley Chang, the central figure, escaped to Yale.) <em>Mutatis mutandis</em>, and all that. It&#39;s a familiar kind of work: a <em>bildungsroman</em>, of course, but also an immigrant novel, a coming-of-age adventure, and thanks to an inartistic tacked-on ending, an H. Alger rags-to-riches saga. Sometimes I felt that I was reading a century-later re-imagining of <em>A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, </em>things Irish replaced with things Chinese -- except that there is not a single tree in this novel&#39;s bleak landscape, not even a symbolic one. Plus ca change, plus de meme chose.</p>
<p>While it&#39;s not original or innovative, nor written with any particular flair, <em>Girl in Translation is </em>nevertheless valuable for the world it opens up to us. Plus it&#39;s on the whole uplifting, even if there are some unfortunate moments in which &quot;triumphant&quot; shades over into &quot;triumphalist.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>There&#39;s not much to admire about the Brooklyn of this novel; it&#39;s an unpleasant place. Manhattan&#39;s Chinatown, where much of the action takes place, is no better.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>On our prosperous Boulder Mall, where all the men are handsome, all the women are good-looking, and all the mendicants take Venmo, there are 44 separate and distinct signs that declare, <strong>No Pets</strong>. Such clear instructions do not inhibit our infatuated dog owners, who can&#39;t bring themselves to believe that the injunction applies to their particular o-so-lovable canine. They cannot fathom that not every recreational mall-walker is in love with Bowser. As a result, the No Pets law is widely and defiantly flouted.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a second mall rule: no amplified music. Acoustic guitars, string quartets, bluegrass bands, accordionists, and singers are all allowed and encouraged. But every once in a while, some itinerant assembles an appallingly large apparatus on our otherwise peaceful Mall and produces sounds that can be heard for half a mile. Rude, ear-shattering noises.</p>
<p>Canines and amplifiers are everyday commonplace violations. But yesterday, walking on the mall, we observed a remarkable and unprecedented novelty. Along comes a nondescript scruffy guy walking an oversized nondescript dog, and lo and behold, onto the beast is strapped a boombox. Honest to Pete, I&#39;m not making this up! The attached mechanism is a powerful one and it generates an extremely loud noise. Unidentifiable sounds, possibly though not certainly some sort of music.</p>
<p>A woofer with a woofer, so to speak.</p>
<p>The man and his faithful friend proceed shamelessly along the mall, bass notes vibrating the shop windows and oscillating my pancreas.</p>
<p>I was floored, frankly. One dog, one amplifier; two concurrent violations.&#0160;</p>
<p>And then I watched in amazement as the big ol&#39; dog dropped a big ol&#39; deuce. A double deuce, actually. Two long brown glistening, smoking turds. Lurking right there on the bricks, preparing to ambush the pretty white shoes of the next three-year-old princess-in-a-pink-tutu to come tripping by.</p>
<p>In our town, it&#39;s the inviolable custom that every dog owner carries a plastic bag and politely disposes of his pet&#39;s droppings. Not this guy. He just kept on walking, pretending that he didn&#39;t know what was going on at the end of his leash -- which was, as a I have said, 1) a pooch, 2) an attached amplifier, and 3) pooch poop. A jackpot -- a perfect trifecta.</p>
<p>Do I have a theory to account for such contemptible misbehavior?&#0160; Well, I&#39;ve been thinking and mulling and contemplating, and I&#39;m aware of the talk of the breakdown of civil society, but all I can come up with is this: some people are royal jerks.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I liked Paul Auster&#39;s <em>The Brooklyn Follies</em> (2006) so much that I read it twice. It was even better the second time. Even though it begins scary (&quot;I was looking for a quiet place to die. Someone recommended Brooklyn...&quot;), it&#39;s a cheerful and warm-hearted novel. Auster&#39;s gift is to make barely credible events seem commonplace and normal. So<em> Follies </em>packs in a mute nine-year-old girl who journeys many miles to find her uncle, and then a forger of paintings, a noir-y blackmail scheme, a wacky pseudo-Christian religious cult, a Jamaican transvestite who mouths &quot;Can&#39;t Help Loving that Man&quot; at a sad funeral, and so on.</p>
<p><em>The Brooklyn Follies</em> is a comedy not because it labors at one-liners but because everyone who should get married or at least find a mate, manages to do so by the last page. Plus it&#39;s rich in Park Slope locations and lore.</p>
<p>I also enjoyed Colm Toibin&#39;s <em>Brooklyn (</em>2009<em>), </em>which is another version of the immigration novel. It&#39;s set back in the 1950s but the 50s might as well be the &#39;20s as far as oppressive social customs are concerned. Although the central figure, Eilis, travels to Brooklyn, she never quite frees herself from provincial Ireland or the interventions of transatlantic priest Father Flood. Young, inexperienced, she falls hard for a boy of Italian extraction -- and her doing so turns out to be more of a problem that it needs to be. Eilis must make some important, life-determining decisions, but whether she makes the right choices is left to the reader to decide (I myself think she loses her bearings). It&#39;s a lovely, understated, carefully wrought and admirable novel.&#0160;</p>
