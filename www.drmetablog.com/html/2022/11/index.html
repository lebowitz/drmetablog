<p>I&#39;ve arrived at the age in which even a momentary lapse of memory is worrisome. Have I at last begun the ineluctable descent into senility?&#0160;</p>
<p>But then there&#39;s the contrary. When I happen to dredge up some bit of buried knowledge, I experience a rush of triumph. I feel it as evidence that I&#39;ve put off the inevitable for another couple of weeks -- perhaps even months. And I preen and strut shamelessly. I become unbearable.</p>
<p>At the Phillips, yesterday, we came upon a painting by Giuseppe De Nittis called &quot;Spring&quot; (there&#39;s a pretty poor reproduction of it above). I glanced at the picture, and in a flash, without hesitation, announced, &quot;that&#39;s a trullo in the left distance.&quot;&#0160; And I was correct -- my assertion confirmed by the scholarly description on the accompanying wall plaque.</p>
<p>What is a trullo?&#0160; It&#39;s a building, obviously, a kind of drystone architecture, common in Apulia, usually whitewashed and with a conical roof, often constructed as a temporary shelter for shepherds and other agricultural workers and occasionally for long term occupancy.&#0160;</p>
<p>But how does a Flatbush yoot recognize and immediately name a trullo at first glance?&#0160; I could be coy and say something like, &quot;Oh, who doesn&#39;t know about trulli?&quot; and leave my friends baffled and dazzled by my prodigious memory.&#0160;</p>
<p>But of course that would not be the full story.</p>
<p>Some seven or eight years ago, as <em>turisti</em>, we visited an Italian village called Alberobello in Apulia in southern Italy. Here&#39;s a picture:</p>

<div class="uhHOwf BYbUcd" data-bla="">It is, obviously, all trulli -- architecture that is striking and memorable. So it&#39;s not mysterious that I would instantaneously recall the building and the name. Not mysterious, but still rather impressive, I think. And temporarily reassuring.</div>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>When I was a Brooklyn schoolyard &quot;yoot&quot; (sixth or seventh grade I reckon), I impulsively bragged to a group of fellow ragamuffins, &quot;I&#39;ll bet a buck that the Dodgers win the pennant.&quot; What prompted me to make so uncharacteristically bold a claim? Way out on a limb, I was. One of the guys in the gang immediately jumped: &quot;I&#39;ll take that bet.&quot; So there I was, stuck. I backed off a bit: &quot;I meant half a dollar.&quot; Against my better judgment, it was set down as a bet, even though he and I never actually locked pinkies on the deal. Then the Dodgers lost; so did I. My antagonist badgered me continually for his money. Eventually I paid him off with a 1950 Franklin half-dollar (a mint example of which is now selling on Amazon for $3751 -- you can look it up!). Even more painful, I must confess, is that the character who beat me was the loathsome kid about whom many years ago I wrote an entire blog post called <a href=" https://www.drmetablog.com/2009/09/my-first-racist.html">My First Racist</a>. You can look that up also.</p>
<p>I am sure that that half-dollar disaster was my first and only venture into the world of chance and hazard. My lifetime losings therefore: 50¢ (which of course was worth a lot more in 1950 than it is now). I had been burnt once, and once was enough to teach me a lesson.&#0160;</p>
<p>I&#39;m not a risk-taker. I don&#39;t play cards, not even gin rummy for matchsticks. I don&#39;t care about the ponies and never even visited Yonkers or Belmont Park (where my ne&#39;er-do-well uncle lost scads of moolah and came close to losing his wife and family). I&#39;ve never been to Atlantic City or to Blackhawk. I don&#39;t bet on sports and have never even had a clear understanding of what it means to &quot;cover the spread.&quot; I was in Las Vegas once, in 1963. We slept in sleeping bags in the desert and rolled into town early the next morning. At one of the many palatial casinos, I came upon addicted gamblers who&#39;d been up all night playing the slots. They were dirty and tired and (is it too strong to say?) degenerate. Desperately in need of Gamblers Anonymous. It was not a glamorous scene.</p>
<p>Moreover, I&#39;ve never played the numbers. I&#39;ve never even purchased a lottery ticket.</p>
<p>My resistance to gambling isn&#39;t moral -- I don&#39;t think that gambling is inherently wrong or sinful. It&#39;s just my nature. I&#39;m a frugal guy (some say &quot;skinflint&quot;; others say &quot;cheap as dirt&quot;) who can&#39;t bear to throw money away.</p>
<p>I think there&#39;s a practical reason to resist gambling. Take, for example, the lotteries. They were illegal until a few years ago but now every state seems to sponsor one or more. The result is a huge transfer of money from people who can&#39;t afford the loss to the government. Lotteries are in effect a hidden regressive tax -- another subsidy of the rich by the poor. In addition, people who put their hopes in winning a jackpot are, I believe, less inclined to work for the progressive changes that our society needs. People who buy lottery tickets are more likely to become quiescent rather than active. They wait passively for their ship to come in. And it never will.</p>
<p>Now gambling has moved into an even more dangerous phase. Anyone who watches sports on the TV is inundated with ads that encourage gambling. They&#39;re omnipresent and unavoidable. It&#39;s another gift to us from the Supreme Court, which in <span class="ILfuVd" lang="en"><span class="hgKElc">2018, struck down the federal ban on state authorization of sports betting -- a decision that opened the doors to the flood. A peculiar inconsistency: yes, freedom to gamble, but no, no freedom to do what you want with your own womb. And we today learned that </span></span>gambling has invaded the university. In our state, in 2020, the University of Colorado made a $1.6 million deal to promote sports gambling on campus. A betting company sweetened the arrangement by offering the school an extra $30 every time a student downloaded the company’s app and used a promotional code to place a bet.</p>
<p>To be clear, it wasn&#39;t the &quot;University&quot; that made the deal; it was the semi-autonomous Athletic Department -- or, in actuality, the football team. It&#39;s an outrageous decision. A respectable university is now in cahoots with a shady industry to promote gambling on campus, and make money off the deal. What future opportunities for corruption with the nose of that particular camel under the tent of innocence!</p>
<p>One solution would be to lessen the emphasis on football. After all, our team is 1-8 so far this year in the Pac-12, having been outscored 374 to 138.&#0160; Perhaps Colorado should drop down a notch, say to Division III. We&#39;d thrive, I think, against the lesser competition. But don&#39;t bet on it.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I seem to have plowed a path of destruction, suicide-wise, in my earlier years.&#0160;</p>
<p>In 1958, I studied &quot;intermediate algebra&quot; with a cheerful, well-regarded teacher named Ruth B. White. One Monday morning, she wrote her new name on the blackboard; she was no longer Mrs. White; she was now Mrs. White-Green. Her supportive students, I remember, applauded enthusiastically. But just as the semester ended and we pupils moved on to trigonometry, newlywed Mrs. White-Green, sadly and incomprehensibly, took her own life. What a shock and puzzle for a gawky innocent Flatbush &quot;yoot.&quot; Why, I asked myself, should re-marriage lead so suddenly to suicide (if indeed the two events were at all related)? To me, this tragic occurrence was an early indication that human psychology was a heck of a lot more mysterious than cocooned me had imagined. And then, a few years later, in the spring semester of my second year in college, I enrolled for a course in medieval history with the very distinguished Professor Theodore Maroon. Just a few months after the class concluded, Professor Maroon destroyed himself. Moreover, the very next year, I surveyed early American literature in a course taught by Professor Stephen Emerson Black, who, the following summer, attached a hose to the car exhaust, shut the garage doors, and put an end to his existence.</p>
<p>I need to reassure myself that it was only a few, not all, of my many teachers who pulled the trigger after trying to educate me. Nevertheless, something of a pattern emerged. The trajectory continued in 1960, when, two months after he officiated at our wedding, cigar-chomping Rabbi Herschel Gray walked into Lake Yahnundasis in order to drown himself. Why? I had nary a clue; still don&#39;t, in fact.&#0160;</p>
<p>Several other people with whom I&#39;ve crossed paths have also chosen to leave life behind. I remember dour Alfredo Naranja, a college acquaintance from Costa Rica or perhaps Panama. He graduated from Cornell, returned home, and immediately shot himself. I also remember handsome fair-haired Stanley Brown. He was a classmate at EHHS; the two of us studied four years of Latin in the same half-empty schoolrooms. He was not a close friend, though I clearly recall that we occasionally trudged home from school together. Stanley went on to Columbia, where, I was later informed, he graduated first in his class, which is no mean achievement. I wasn&#39;t surprised -- he was smart and extremely serious about schoolwork. Stanley then proceeded to Harvard Medical School. Cambridge was my home at that time as well and although our paths had not crossed in four or five years, Stanley telephoned me &quot;out of the blue,&quot; as they say, and engaged me in conversations that were longer than I wished. I realize now that I was not as hospitable to him as I might have been. He was lonesome, I think. And then came the news that he had killed himself. I now wish that I had been more cordial -- but how was I to know that he was in such mortal pain? The story has a coda: Stanley&#39;s grandparents owned a delicatessen on Ditmas Avenue between East 7th and East 8th. Some years after the suicide, I stopped in at the store for a salami sandwich (or something) and encountered the diminutive elderly storekeepers -- a sad, crushed couple. I knew, or thought I knew, that they were mourning the death of their promising grandchild. Was it my imagination, or was my intuition correct?</p>
<p>And then in graduate school there was Arthur Blue. Arthur was a serious poet and budding scholar. I was a close enough friend that I was invited to his Episcopal wedding in, I think, Wellesley, Massachusetts, where, for the first time in my life, ceremonious kneeling was required of me. Arthur and I kept up an intermittent correspondence after I moved to New York and he to Seattle. I remember congratulating him on the births of his two daughters. But then one December, I received an end-of-the-year card from Barbara Scarlet-Blue, which contained a most memorable sentence: &quot;Of course you have heard of Arthur&#39;s suicide.&quot; Well, no, I hadn&#39;t. I was later informed that Arthur had turned on the gas at his summer house on Vachon Island, where he had been on a solitary vacation. Barbara offered no theory to account for Arthur&#39;s act, but now, fifty years later, I suspect, without evidence, that he had sexual identity problems with which he could not cope. If so, he would be another casualty of the commonplace bigotry of that era. Arthur&#39;s death is a suicide to which I am not reconciled, and never will be.</p>
<p>And I must also remember Mary Crimson, wife of famous Shakespearean scholar Reginald Crimson, who, depressed, slit her wrists in the bath. It was an absolutely devastating act for Reg and his many friends and admirers.</p>
<p>And then there are the young people, the next generation, who made irreversible decisions when they were far too young to do so. There&#39;s the horrible story of Carol Pink, a daughter of friends, who jumped off a balcony in Lincoln Towers in Manhattan and landed, twenty stories below, on the roof of a yellow taxi. Apparently, she tried to grab her brother and pull him down with her, but thankfully she did not succeed. And Alice Magenta, daughter of Hill neighbors, who killed herself in her late teens, a disaster made more excruciating because her elder half-brother had done the same deed few years before. Their parents never recovered from the twin losses; but why should they?&#0160; Another young person was twenty-two year old Francesca Crimson, the daughter of a pair of famous artists and herself a promising photographer; another plunge from the roof of a tall building. And also, the teen son of my longtime colleague Richard Purple, who did himself in with drugs, though his religious family chose to believe, against all the evidence, that it was an accidental overdose.&#0160;</p>
<p>I respect suicides, even when I don&#39;t understand them, because I believe that everyone has a right to do what they want with their own selves. But I am saddened beyond ordinary sadness when very young people take their own lives. If an adolescent or twenty-something boy or girl told me that they had suicidal thoughts, I would say &quot;almost everyone has a few bad years; almost everyone is miserable during adolescence. But almost every one of these unhappy beings turns out to live a productive, useful and essentially happy life. Give it a few years; don&#39;t make a precipitous decision. Hold on; hang tough; trust me, it&#39;s going to get better.&quot;</p>

		<a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2022/11/reading-obituaries.html">Obits</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Like many of my peers, I&#39;ve lately taken to reading the obituaries. When I was a youthful fellow, I took pleasure in announcements of births and weddings and anniversaries. No longer, alas; nowadays it&#39;s nothing but deaths. Reading about the departed is not a habit of which I&#39;m particularly proud. It&#39;s an unsavory fixation upon the newly dead -- and is slightly ghoulish to boot. Yet daily checking of the obits is not without a positive side: often it&#39;s exhilarating to read about those amazing folks who have survived wars, dictatorships, displacement, injury, and disease to live accomplished and joyful lives. Obituaries are confusing.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not that I search out the obits -- they intrude upon me willy-nilly, like it or not.</p>
<p>For one, there&#39;s the <em>New York Times </em>which every day memorializes a couple or a dozen famous persons -- some of them people of my exact age cohort -- who have made a mark, for good or ill, in this our shared life. How does one properly respond to such departures?&#0160; With empathy, certainly. But also, not infrequently, with a touch of reluctant (and embarrassing) survivor-superiority.</p>
<p>I must admit that I&#39;m frequently dazzled by these eminent people&#39;s list of accomplishments, even if I haven&#39;t the least clue about exactly what they have achieved. My own life has been, it would seem, so dominated by hearth and home, so narrow and provincial that I cannot always appreciate the eulogized. Often they have distinguished themselves in areas of expertise that have completely passed me by: computer technologists who have created portals and platforms that will always lie beyond my ken, physicists who have shed light (incomprehensible to me) on dark mysteries, superstar rappers, mvp&#39;s in sports that I didn&#39;t know existed, billionaire entrepreneurs with their 35,000 sq. ft. homes and their stupendous megayachts, generals and spies, etc., etc., etc. It&#39;s astonishing how little these famous folk have touched me; how little overlap there is between their worlds and mine. Clearly, I&#39;ve inhabited an impermeable bubble.</p>
<p>If so, why do I care, why do I read their obits, why do I bother to applaud or (secretly and guiltily) pooh-pooh their contributions?</p>
<p>But hey, I can&#39;t blame it all on the <em>Times</em>. Every second month, I receive an e-mail notice from the college that I attended, back there in the 50s, that lists the recent deaths of my classmates. Only a few years ago, it was a trickle, now it&#39;s a flood. While nothing forces me to open the electronic envelope, nevertheless, I do so, &quot;attracted&quot; as David Copperfield once said about Uriah Heep, &quot;in very repulsion.&quot; Nor must I read the obituaries of members of the graduate school through which I slipped, barely noticed, sixty-years ago. Do I remember these people? Rarely, even despite occasional parallels in our careers. In addition, I follow the obituaries in the local <em>Daily Camera</em>. People I know, or, given my fifty-year residence in this fair city, those to whom I am connected by a couple or three degrees of separation. Sometimes I am shocked by the death of a person whom I hadn&#39;t heard was ill, or who died suddenly in a bicycle crash or a fall from a step stool. Such revelations deeply disturb a Sunday morning. And yet, is it so horribly wrong for me to congratulate myself that it was not I but that other guy who was mowed down by a speeding truck on Canyon Boulevard? (I had just crossed at that same spot a day before, uneventfully. Luck of the draw!)</p>
<p>Does it matter that the obits that I read are not truly representative of my contemporaries? They are accounts of people who have made something of themselves, lived useful and noteworthy lives. I can&#39;t help thinking about the others: the ones who slunk off the planet quietly -- those who were drunkards or druggies, or who were seduced by some weird religious cult and disappeared into the desert, or those who gave up the struggle and took their own lives, or those who retreated. along with their six scrawny cats, to a dirty SRO on the upper West Side (except when they venture to the street to harangue passers-by with their idiosyncratic religious theories).</p>
<p>Even the obits that do come to my notice don&#39;t tell the whole story. They&#39;re <em>curricula vitae</em> that 99% of the time are entirely laudatory. The ancient tag &quot;de mortuis nihil nisi bonum&quot; is rigorously honored. The notices don&#39;t state what everyone knows -- that the dearly departed was a notorious skinflint who squeezed the last nickel from his tenants and his employees, stiffed his partners, and regularly harassed his former friends with nuisance suits. They fail to mention that an apparently upstanding citizen was also a neglectful father who eventually ran off with his peroxided mistress and a Harley, or that he was known to the neighbors as the guy who poisoned the Labrador retriever of that nice elderly couple down the street. Or who was fired because he showed up plastered once too often. Sometimes it&#39;s what&#39;s left out that&#39;s most revelatory. Obits should be read with care; I don&#39;t always remember to do so.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>But to tell truth it&#39;s not the obituaries themselves that bother me --it&#39;s my own ambivalence and confusion. Why the fascination with obits? Is it the same impulse that causes commuters to stop and stare at the wreck on the highway? Could it be that I enjoy, genuinely enjoy, reading about the deaths of my fellow creatures? And if I do so, what sort of morally defective person am I?&#0160; Do I suffer from an incurable case of schadenfreude -- a delight in the misfortunes of others? Or is it even worse -- mere undiluted gloating? For truly, I am forced to admit, there is something almost triumphant about reading an obit. &quot;He&#39;s dead, but I&#39;m alive.&quot; How pathetic and reprehensible a feeling -- and how transitory!&#0160;&#0160;When I am in a generous mood, I know that when I read an obituary, I daren&#39;t gloat, but should rather mourn the common fate of all of us poor fragile mortals. &quot;Death is certain, sayeth the Psalmist.&quot; &quot;No man is an island entire of himself.&quot; Although I might gloat today, tomorrow I too will be as dead as a doornail. Another bucket, mine, will be kicked. And yet I do not always experience the fellow-feeling that I would like to admire in myself. If I&#39;m not a bad person, I&#39;m certainly not always a good one. No question but there&#39;s a chasm between what I feel and what I am convinced that I should feel.</p>
<p>Some obituaries present special problems. For example, I am immediately put off when the the obituary begins with the foolish new age euphemism, &quot;he transitioned.... &quot;&#0160; Such a phrase hardens my heart, I&#39;m sorry to admit. Let&#39;s face it; he didn&#39;t &quot;transition.&quot; He died. But I&#39;m equally saddened by the obituary that announces that &quot;he went to live with the Lord.&quot; Such pathetic self-deception.</p>
<p>But the hardest moral problem for me occurs when I come upon the obituary of a person I genuinely disliked. There aren&#39;t many of them; I&#39;m not a hater. But still, it&#39;s very difficult for me to find genuine empathy for someone I truly loathed. It&#39;s wrong for me to rub my hands in triumphant glee because that nasty s. o. b. is gone forever? I would prefer not to be the kind of person who dances on graves.</p>

                                <p>The world&#39;s ugliest building, or at minimum a top competitor for the title, is located just a block or so down the street from our present abode. Too damn close, in fact, because it broadcasts its miasma of aesthetic gloom directly at me. It&#39;s a large ungainly brick cube -- windowless, characterless, featureless, probably designed by an untalented deadwood kind of guy who drew his inspiration from a childhood of toying with Legos. &quot;A doctor can bury his mistakes&quot;, said Frank Lloyd Wright many years ago, &quot;but an architect can only advise his clients to plant vines.&quot; Vines is what this shameless structure needs -- thick ropes of kudzu and lianas, whole Jurassic jungles of them -- but no such luck.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a CenturyLink building nowadays, but for what purpose it was originally created is unknown to me. CenturyLink is an &quot;internet provider.&quot; No doubt its insides are more beautiful than its outside. How strange! Magnificent images and lovely turns of phrase, unknown and invisible to its neighbors, portal in and portal out!&#0160;</p>
<p>I can&#39;t get a good picture of the entire building, but, please, take a good luck at this street-side ornament:&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Alas and alack, I&#39;ve now known far too many folks who have endured serious memory problems. As a consequence, I seem to have developed an interest in amnesia not only in real life but also in fiction and film. There are many many books on the subject and Wiki offers an astonishing list of 234 Hollywood amnesia films -- some of which, judging by their titles, do not appeal to my mature taste and which I promise never to view -- including such not doubt remarkable productions such as <em>Raft of the Dead</em>, <em>Zebraman 2: Attack on</em> <em>Zebra City,</em> and <em>A Shaun the Sheep</em> <em>Movie: Farmageddon.</em></p>
<p>I sometimes imagine that there are fewer actual cases of loss of memory than there are films on the subject.</p>
<p>Literary amnesia is a recent obsession; while the ancients had their Lethe, the river of forgetfulness, I can&#39;t recall amnesiacs wandering lost around Athens or Rome. Shakespeare never wrote an amnesia play, though at one point Lear, who&#39;s had a rough go of it, asks &quot;Who is it that can tell me who I am?&quot;</p>
<p>I suppose that we moderns put amnesia front and center because we are concerned with the integrity and the continuity of the self. Loss of memory threatens us; no memory, no identity. But let us not forget that amnesia is a cheap and easy all-purpose convenient and superficial no sweat plot device. The formula: loss of memory = mystery; restoration of memory =&#0160; anagnorisis. Very little thinking required.</p>
<p><em>The Majestic </em>is an eccentric unsatisfying fairy tale that provides the usual car crashes but also lost love, the FBI, HUAC, and an art deco movie theater -- all in the Capraesque context of small-town standards versus big-city corruption. Pete Appleton, played by an uncharacteristically subdued and expressionless Jim Carrey, falls into what is depicted as a total global amnesia. He lacks the least glimmer of his past life. In &quot;real life,&quot; any human forced to cope with such an experience would suffer from anxiety, shock, disorientation, fear, and worry -- but not so in this slice of hollywoodiana. Amnesiac Pete is calm and patient, because he is rooted not in our communal vale of woe but in a movie tradition where amnesia is ordinary and effortless. Don&#39;t worry, folks, he&#39;ll recover his memory by the last reel. No big deal. And he does.</p>
