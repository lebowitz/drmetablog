                                <p>Her language consists mostly of nouns: &quot;baby&quot; -- both herself and her beloved doll; &quot;wawa&quot; (water);&#0160; &quot;mommy&quot;;&#0160; &quot;daddy&quot;; &quot;ayi&quot; (Chinese for aunt);&#0160; &quot;didi&quot; (Chinese jiÄ›jie, older sister); &quot;paopao&quot; (Chinese, grandmother); &quot;pock&quot; (pocket); &quot;book&quot;; &quot;ball&quot;: &quot;eye&quot;; &quot;nose&quot; etc.&#0160; Her words are occasionally less specified than they will soon become; for example, &quot;duck&quot; seems to mean &quot;bird.&quot; At the zoo, she identified an emu as a duck. Similarly, &quot;gogo&quot; (Chinese for dog), means mammal, even including the zoo&#39;s llama. &quot;Up&quot; can mean either up or down; it seems to signify a change of position. &quot;No&quot; occasionallly means &quot;yes&quot;; she seems to conceive it as a response to a question. There is, however, no ambiguity to her very definitive &quot;mine.&quot;</p>
<p>When she slid down the slide in the park, her audience exclaimed &quot;whee.&quot;&#0160; Lola responded, &quot;I do whee,&quot; understanding &quot;whee&quot; to be the name of the action rather than an exclamation of pleasure.&#0160;</p>

                                <p>There&#39;s been a re-birth of nativism in the &quot;give me your tired, your poor&quot; land that I love. The right-wingers, who need someone to hate, have decided that anti-Hispanic and anti-Muslim noise-making is just what our beleaguered country needs right now.</p>
<p>All of which brought to mind a painful memory. Sometime in the 1970s, I was sitting in a coffee room at the U. -- a rare event for me -- and a group of people were recalling happy moments from their various childhoods. One of the participants was a grey-haired woman perhaps 15 years older than I. She was a secretary or administrative assistant at not mine but some other department. She was a kindly, competent, unpretentious woman with whom I occasionally exhanged a few words of greeting or business.</p>
<p>&#0160;I can&#39;t remember exactly what the other participants ibn the discussion remembered from their early days -- probably hunting trips with dad, hitting the winning single in a softball game, a romp with the family dog -- but I will never forget what Masako recalled: &quot;When I was in the internment camp in Utah, one day Marian Anderson came to sing for us.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Evreryone down here, all they ever talk about is their pains, their doctors, their diets, their diseases.&#0160; Now&#0160;I have something to talk about.&#0160; For years I went to this doctor, maybe forty years, he&#39;s almost as old as I am&#0160; Every time I go into see him, with a sore knee or pains in the chest or whatever,&#0160;he&#39;d look at it, and he&#39;d say,&#0160;&#39;what can you expect at your age?&#0160; You&#39;re lucky to be alive.&#39; &#0160;I&#39;d go in with a sore throat.&#0160; He&#39;d say, &#39;Can you swallow.&#0160;So what it hurts.&#0160;You&#39;re too old to worry.&#39;&#0160;If I had a headache, he&#39;d say,&#0160;&#39;whatever happens, happens.&#0160; You&#39;re old, enjoy the day.&#39;&#0160;Finally he retired.&#0160;He took a job as a&#0160;dance instructor on a cruise ship. I&#39;m not kidding. He leads exercises or something.&#0160;So I went to a younger doctor.&#0160;He listens to me breathe, pokes around a bit, puts me in the hospital, and&#0160;now&#0160;I have three stents.&quot;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>When I was a child, haircuts were perpetrated at Joe&#39;s Barber Shop on Coney Island Avenue. It was a pleasant place: there were wall-to-wall mirrors on either side of Joe Montuori&#39;s shop, and a boy sitting in the chair could lose himself in the series of infinitely-regressing images. Joe always had a friend or two in the shop with whom he spoke incomprehensible rapid-fire Italian.&#0160;The haircutting itself was an ordeal. Joe charged 75 cents a head, but my mother had driven a bargain: three haircuts (myself and my two brothers) for $1.80.&#0160;Joe revenged himself on me by a) working the electric buzzer as rapidly as possible, and b) frequently re-arranging the angle of my head with a blow from the heel of his hand.&#0160;Back home, my mother would sigh and say, &quot;Turn around.&#0160;Let&#39;s see what he did to you this time.&quot;</p>
<p>I&#39;m not big on personal adornment, and, perhaps because of my early hair-chopping experiences, I&#39;ve never been comfortable in the barber&#39;s seat. As soon as the cloth is fastened around my neck I feel hogtied and hopeless.&#0160;&quot;What are they going to do to me today?&quot;&#0160;Once, on the west side of Manhattan, in the late 1960s, when my hair was rather long (it seems absurd that you could signal your opposition to the war in Vietnam by letting your hair grow, but such was the case), I walked into a shop and asked the barber to &quot;leave it long.&quot; He immediately transformed me into a rabid supporter of carpet-bombing.&#0160;Also in New York: when I naively wandered into a shop with a specialized clientele, a hair technician employing a razor and a variety of gels and lotions turned me into someone whose hair was giving off signals with which the rest of his body was not in accord.&#0160;In Hanover, New Hampshire, in an upstairs &#39;salon,&#39; the barber suddenly stopped work, drew back, studied me for fifteen or twenty seconds, and asked, &quot;Are you Jewish.&quot; I mumbled something about not really wanting to discuss my ethnicity with him, whereupon he launched into a disquisition of which I understood not much and remember less, except that that it involved prophecy, the Book of Isaiah, and The Hatching of the Egg. He hauled out his heavily annotated King James Version and pointed me to various passages underlined in coded colors.&#0160;As it happens, I&#39;m more conversant than most people with scripture, and so I can assert with moderate authority that his reading of the Bible was -- how shall I say -- original.&#0160;It took me an hour to extricate myself from his insistent and wayward scholarship: fifteen minutes of hair-cutting and forty-five minutes of exegetical enthusiasm.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>For a decade or so, when our finances were perilous, my wife cut my hair. There were some benefits (a guy could cop a feel while being ministered to) but I must admit that although my good woman was earnest and effective, she never fully mastered tonsorial technique. She had the habit of yanking upwards on the strands with the scissors, with the result that each snip produced a stab of pain -- although nothing more intense than might have been alleviated by the injection of a dozen or score shots of novocaine directly into the scalp. And then there were the ear nicks.</p>
<p>After a while, I returned hair responsibility to the world of commerce.&#0160;I had success for many years with Liz of Chicago Hair across town.&#0160;Liz was good at her work and respected my multiple cowlicks. But then she started to raise her prices. When she reached $20, I would just hand her the Visa and ask her not to tell me what she charged. When she went to $30, I retaliated by spacing the haircuts further and further apart in order to keep my annual cost constant.&#0160;But when she broached the $40 barrier, the puritan in me rebelled.&#0160;I started to patronize the cheap ($14) barbershop across the street from the college. There&#39;s a rotating staff and it&#39;s hit-and-miss:&#0160;sometimes the results are acceptable, sometimes disastrous.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>When I come home from the expedition, my wife says, &quot;Let&#39;s see what they&#39;ve done to you today.&quot;</p>
<p>And then she sighs.&#0160;</p>

Lima beans which came into the house&#0160;dried but which were soaked to plump up, then boiled and mashed (but not&#0160;for me, if I could possibly avoid them).&#0160;Potatoes in any form, but usually mashed and buttered. No chicken or lamb chops, but lots of tongue.&#0160;(When I left home, I vowed never to eat tongue again, and I&#39;ve kept the faith.) Chopped chicken liver. Steak, when we could afford it.&#0160;Roast pork with applesauce.&#0160;Delicatessen meats -- salami, baloney, corned beef, frankfurters.&#0160;Baked beans, courtesy of Heinz.&#0160;Apples, right down to the stem.&#0160;Chocolate in any form, but especially white chocolate.&#0160;Halvah, a particular favorite.&#0160;Dates and figs, dried.&#0160;Black radishes and onions, covered with <a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2010/01/haute-cuisine-c-1945.html" target="_self">gribbinis</a>.&#0160;Tschav, borsht with huge helpings of sour cream. Corn on the cob.&#0160;No alcohol, nary a drop.&#0160;On hot days, no beer, but instead iced tea or iced coffee. Cheese, either Velveeta or swiss.&#0160;Good bread --&#0160;pumpernickel or rye.&#0160;Crumb cake direct&#0160; from Ebinger&#39;s Bakery.&#0160;Bacon and two eggs, sunnyside up or soft-boiled.&#0160;Cream o&#39; Wheat. Swee-Touch-Nee tea.&#0160;On Sunday morning, bagels and rolls, warm from the oven, eaten while reading&#0160;the <em>Times</em> (25 cents) and the <em>Eagle</em> (10 cents).&#0160;Ice cream, the more exotic the flavor the better.</p>

                                <p>This reminiscence will not mean much to anyone but my born-and-bred-in-Brooklyn readers.&#0160;</p>
<p>One of my smart schoolyard buddies, Jimmy Nolan, won a scholarship to Columbia. He was a year or two older than I, and the first of our gang/crowd to venture out of the neighborhood. The summer after his first college year, we were sitting in front of the candy store, drinking egg creams and practicing our spitting, when someone asked Jimmy &quot;what&#39;s it like up there.&quot; &quot;Up there&quot; was the far north, Morningside Heights, in Manhattan, where Columbia was located -- the end of the earth, kind of. Jimmy said, &quot;You might not believe this, but up there they pronounce &quot;hua,&quot; &quot;hor.&quot;</p>
<p>I remember thinking,&#0160;why would they do so?&#0160; Don&#39;t they know any better?</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Sometime in the early 1950s I was given a great gift: a hand-knitted gray-and-white Norwegian sweater. It may have been a bit too large for me, but I wore it almost every day through high school and college and for many years thereafter. True, it became a little ratty around the waist, but my mother-in-law, a skilled knitter, was able to repair it, and did so, more than once. The leather elbow patches were my own contribution, and if they&#0160;were not exactly symmetrically placed, so what?&#0160; I disagreed with those who felt that the beauty of the garment&#0160;was compromised by the vivid mustard stain on the right sleeve. I was still wearing the sweater in the 1980s, when my daughter begged it. Of course I gave it to her, but I now believe that she was in surreptitious league with other members of my family to get the sweater out of my hands and off my back. I&#39;ve never seen her wear it.</p>
<p>It was in the 1970s that I received another gift of an important garment -- a Guatemalan shirt -- a camisa -- of the sort worn in Todos Santos: a multicolored embroidered -- &#0160;or is it brocaded -- piece of fabric attached to a blue-and-white striped shift that hung&#0160;down to mid-thigh -- very convenient for use as towel or hot cloth. I loved that shirt&#0160;and wore it even to work. It&#39;s possible that some people dismissed me as an&#0160;eccentric or that others presumed that&#0160;I was making an anti-colonial statement, but in fact I just thought the shirt&#0160;was comfortable and handsome. I remember overhearing&#0160; a student&#0160;-- one of the brainless ones -- who hated college, hated literature, and hated me -- mumble under his breath (in those days I could still hear), &quot;Well, at least he&#39;s not a dull dresser.&quot; I don&#39;t know what became of the&#0160;camisa. I suspect that it was <em>desaparecida</em>.</p>
<p>Another favorite garment was a yellow leather shirt jacket which I wore until it shredded. This jacket ran into trouble on a cross-country trip when it was packed on top of the car, under a canvas. It lay too close to a dyed leather coat&#0160;(not mine) and during a flash Nebraska rainstorm was thoroughly&#0160; soaked and acquired a large purple stain. I didn&#39;t mind, because the stain was in the back, but I bowed to social pressure and gave it up, which was a shame, because I didn&#39;t get more than twenty years use out of it.&#0160;&#0160;And then there was that lovely orange-brown corduroy jacket that I bought at the Presbyterian thrift store for $2.00. That was real beauty.&#0160; So was the&#0160;tailored denim&#0160;suit coat&#0160;which I have vainly tried to replace&#0160;--&#0160;they just don&#39;t make them like that any more.&#0160;</p>
<p>Still another memorable&#0160;garment: a green hooded cotton sweatshirt that, after I had worn it for a decade or so, was nicely broken in.&#0160;It had lots of wear left in it, but I made the dreadful error&#0160;of mentioning to&#0160; my&#0160;daughter-in-law that, wearing it, I had twice been taken for a homeless person. She&#0160;snatched the sweatshirt away from me and&#0160;threw it into the garbage (I rescued it for rags). She then immediately went out and bought me a perfectly lovely new Carhartt hooded sweatshirt, very high quality, with a zipper and everything, which I have worn&#0160;every day during the cold months for two seasons and which will, within a dozen or so years, no doubt become quite comfortable.&#0160;</p>

                                <p>In the summer of 1963, we were somewhere in southern Illinios on our first cross-country adventure (the first of many).&#0160; I was not an&#0160;experienced driver and the Nash Rambler was not a superb-handling car.&#0160; We were driving a&#0160;two-lane, and it was raining hard , and&#0160;something happened (can&#39;t remember what) that caused me to brake much&#0160;too hard. The&#0160;car spun out of control, first swinging&#0160;into the oncoming lane (empty, thank you very much) and then rotating into a three or four foot ditch on the right side of the road.</p>
<p>I was grateful&#0160;to be&#0160;alive but I knew that I was&#0160;in a predicament.&#0160; How to get the Rambler back on the road?&#0160;</p>
<p>Within a&#0160;minute, a small truck pulled up behind me.&#0160; A hale-fellow Elks-Lions-Rotary-Presbyterian kind of guy stepped out, assessed the situation, hitched a cable to the Rambler and winched us out of the ditch.&#0160; Took him two minutes max.&#0160; He said, &quot;you OK?&quot; and drove off.</p>
<p>Many thanks to that man.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>In 1984, I had to fly from&#0160;Lebanon, New Hampshire to Salt Lake City through Boston.&#0160; We were fogged in at Lebanon and I didn&#39;t arrive at Logan until a few minutes before my next leg was about to leave.&#0160; Logan consisted&#0160;then (probably still does) of half-a-dozen separate terminals linked by a bus line.&#0160;&#0160;I went up to a man in a uniform and I&#0160;asked him where, in the jumble, would I find&#0160;Continental.&#0160; I told him that I had&#0160;less than&#0160;twenty minutes&#0160;to board.&#0160; He said, &quot;wait right here.&#0160; I&#39;ll&#0160;get you there on time.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;He was not a policeman, as I thought,&#0160;but a uniformed chauffeur to some Rich Person.&#0160; After a few minutes he&#0160;returned, having launched&#0160;his&#0160;employer.&#0160;&#0160;He took me to&#0160;his extra-long Cadillac limousine and&#0160;speeded me to my terminal.</p>
<p>Many thanks to that man</p>
<p>And&#0160;to all the other&#0160;anonymous people who have helped me with life&#39;s travels and travails.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Am I becoming&#0160;sentimental?&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>

                                <p>My first railroad (not subway) trip was in 1945 -- a New York Central train from NYC to Glens Falls, New York.&#0160; I was dazzled but queasy;&#0160; it was a coal-burning engine&#0160;and the smoke was both visible and smellable.&#0160; I spent my infant time looking out the window and studying the adjacent&#0160;set of tracks as they combined and separated -- a most vivid memory.&#0160; I was born into a sedentary family&#0160;and have no further recollection of being in a train again until&#0160;1952 when Aunt Mollie took me to Washington.&#0160;We ate dinner on the train, a marvelous luxury.&#0160;&#0160;in 1956, testing my adolescent independence,&#0160;I voyaged&#0160;to Ithaca on the old Lehigh Valley R. R. (the &quot;Leaky V.), then in its dotage and quite seedy.&#0160; During the late 1950s, &#0160;I occasionally rode up to Utica NY on the NY Central.&#0160; The round-trip fare was an astonishingly steep&#0160;$20.50, or half a week&#39;s work.&#0160; But afterwards it was almost all automobiles.&#0160; I don&#39;t know that I was on a train again until 1975-76, when I commuted weekly from Canterbury (second class with the accompaniment of&#0160;Cadbury chocolates) to Charing Cross station.&#0160; Calais to Paris, 1976. I can remember&#0160;also Lugano to Florence to Rome, c. 1990, and Stockholm to Copenhagen a decade later.&#0160; NYC to DC, on Amtrak, many times&#0160;around the turn of the new millenium.&#0160; Not a great deal of train travel, but then, as we all know, the railroads are a&#0160;glorious but dying institution, at least in the US.&#0160; Nor adventuresome either:&#0160; no Orient Express or Trans-Siberian.&#0160; Planes?&#0160; My first trip was from NYC to Ithaca, on&#0160;a&#0160;12 seat Mohawk -- perhaps to this day my smallest plane and&#0160;bumpiest flight.&#0160; Many, many trips&#0160;from Boston to NYC (Eastern Airlines), from Logan to LaGuardia and back.&#0160; A dozen&#0160;or so jumps&#0160;across the water to Europe, all of them accompanied with headaches and disorientation.&#0160;&#0160;My longest so far:&#0160; Denver to Port Elizabeth, South Africa.&#0160; To Hawaii and back.&#0160;To San Jose, Costa Rica.&#0160; Innumerable,&#0160;far too many, &#0160;domestic flights from Denver to NYC, Denver to Oakland, Denver to DC -- all highly routinized.&#0160; At first, decades ago, flying was romantic;&#0160; dinner was served;&#0160; people dressed up for the experience.&#0160;&#0160;Now it&#39;s being sardined into a grudging Greyhound in the sky, with bodyscans and shoe checks to boot.&#0160; And waste:&#0160; all that time and money thrown into the sea&#0160;looking for plastic explosives&#0160;secreted&#0160;in &#0160;my retired-teacher/ grandpa orifices.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>The word Greyhound reminds me those horrible 1950s trips (midnight to 8am) from the Port Authority on 34th and 8th to Ithaca with &quot;rest stops&quot;&#0160;in East Stroudsburg and Scranton at 3am, with&#0160;no food available except rancid sandwiches from the slot machines.&#0160; I cannot shake the&#0160;memory of the awful smell of&#0160;spoiled tuna, gas fumes, eructations and flatulence on those filthy cramped buses.&#0160;&#0160;Nor of the degenerate displaying his private parts in the men&#39;s room in Hackettstown, New Jersey one slushy night.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>But put me in a car on a two-lane anywhere&#0160;west of the Mississippi, with no particular place to go,&#0160;and I&#39;m one happy guy.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Cherry pie in Hannibal, Missouri or breakfast at the Jesse James Cafe in Casey, Iowa.&#0160; Bliss!</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>When I was a child, there were two neighborhood dentists.&#0160;&#0160;One was named Caress and the other was named Yankowitz. &#0160;My parents chose Nathan Caress, possibly for onomastic reasons, but they might have made a mistake; &#0160;Nathan Caress&#0160;should have been called Nathan Butcher. &#0160;Dentistry sixty years ago was much inferior to dentistry today, especially in our dark corner of the universe. &#0160;There was no anaesthetics, no novacaine. &#0160;Baby teeth that developed cavities were summarily yankowitzed with a pair of what looked like industrial pliers. &#0160;Adult teeth that needed repair were excavated with a low-speed mechanical drill, then sterilized with carbolic acid, and filled with a mercury compound that has over the years not doubt lowered my IQ by dozens or scores of points. Dentistry was painful. No, it wasn&#39;t painful, it was torture. &#0160;Dr. Caress, whose office was in the living room of his house on Rugby Road, had a big black ugly mole on his left cheek. I studied that mole for many too many hours.</p>
<p>Sometime in my early teens I was sent to an orthodontist, Irving Pollack, who had a very official suite of rooms in a high-rise on Joralemon Street, a subway ride away. &#0160;I am grateful to him because, although he made a miserable adolescence even more miserable, his &quot;appliances&quot; helped keep my mismatched, askew anthology of teeth in my head. &#0160;In fact, I have all but one of them to this day. &#0160;</p>
<p>No thanks to my next dentist, T. Gorfein of Cambridge, Massachusetts, a genuine criminal who asserted that I had twenty-two cavities and set out to fill them. I left him after a couple of weeks, not because I was wise enough to suspect that he was&#0160; a cheat,&#0160;but because while he was working on me, he called over his assistant and said -- genuine historical quote coming here -- &quot;Would you look at that sucker bleed.&quot; &#0160;At the university clinic, the dentist to whom I was assigned could find only two cavities, which she (my first female practitioner) painlessly filled. I must have had other dental experiences before Colorado&#39;s Amiot and Johnson, both of whom were competent but both of whom insisted on talking Republican nonsense to defenseless me while my mouth was filled with equipment and fat fingers. Johnson left a crown too high, causing enormous pain; searching for an alternative for his ham-handedness, I remembered that I had bus-commuted with a dental student who seemed intelligent. She became a dentista of high regard for many years until she took very early retirement from the trade -- I never knew why. She sold her practice to another competent woman who charges outrageous sky high prices for her services, but keeps me healthy.</p>
<p>So the score as we head into overtime: &#0160;one fake tooth, two root canal jobs, a couple of tender spots, two unerupted wisdom teeth waiting to cause trouble, but unabated ability to eat and enjoy corn on the cob. Nevertheless, lots of residual Caress-caused nervousness every time I need to see someone in the tooth business. &#0160;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Our final stop on the road westward was Gothenburg, Nebraska.&#0160; We set up the old canvas tent in a park in the heart of town and slept to the screeching of cicadas (a sound new to me).&#0160; (In those days we couldn&#39;t possibly have afforded the $10 or $15 for a motel.)&#0160;&#0160;By noon the next day we had reached Crook, Colorado (population 128 in 2000 but considerably more in 1969 -- the town was then large enough to support a restaurant and a gas station). We ate lunch but when we got back into the green Dodge station wagon, purchased ($2500) for our new life in the Rockies, we discovered that something had gone terribly wrong with the gears and that the car would only go backwards. I worried that we were going to be stuck in Crook with two boys under four years old while we waited for a transmission part to be trucked in from Detroit. Filled with financial trepidation, I backed the car around the block (there was only one block, fortunately) to the town&#39;s lone mechanic. He said he&#39;d &quot;take a look.&quot; He did, got himself a great big screwdriver and banged away under the hood for a few minutes. &quot;Fixed it.&quot; When he charged me $1.00 for the service, I began to think well of Colorado. We piled back into the car and continued with the last 150 miles of the trip, gazing at the mountains in the distance and the arid steppes, populated only by the occasional cow -- with nary a human being in view.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>We made it to Boulder sometime in that &#0160;same afternoon. It took a while to find the house we had rented by mail. We missed it on the first pass and drove by the old Pioneer Cemetery, which became our first landmark. We had no idea that we had rented a cute small 1915 arts and crafts bungalow with the original fir woodwork still intact -- what a change from our Manhattan apartment overlooking Broadway. Our few sticks of furniture were delayed in transit (and would be for three weeks), so we all slept on air mattresses for the while.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>The Daughter (at whose request I am writing this reminiscence), was conceived before the furniture arrived.</p>
<p>Our landlord and next-door neighbor was Jack David Angus Ogilvy, a rangy cowboy and professor of Anglo-Saxon who was, contrary to all expectations, a distant relative of the queen of England.&#0160; (Was it 1969 or the next year that I met Jack&#39;s cousin, a pimply English boy named Angus, known across the sea as Lord Ogilvy)?&#0160; That was a surprise. Another surprise:&#0160; the alley behind our house was bordered with a huge crop of wild plums. The boys discovered the plums very soon after our arrival.</p>
<p>I was taken by surprise by the Colorado light.&#0160; &#0160;had always lived in the cloudy east, and that bright western sun was a complete surprise. High altitude, no humidity, and very big sky. I&#39;m still not quite used to it. &#0160;</p>
<p>Boulder was not the sophosticated, foodie, high-tech, trendy town it has become. It was all white bread, the downtown unMalled and still dominated by banks, car dealerships, Valentine&#39;s Hardware, Smith&#39;s Shoes, a big old Woolworth&#39;s and wide empty streets. There were only a few restaurants -- I remember the Harbin Inn, a mediocre Chinese joint, and the Gondolier ditto but Italian (still in business but much changed). And our favorite, the Aristocrat, a breakfast place with portions that could remedy in a single sitting those dangerous drops in cholesterol.</p>
<p>On our first day in town, we drove by Boulder High School. Mrs. Dr. M. said, &quot;That&#39;s where I want to teach when I go back to teaching.&quot; Which she did, a few years later and then for many years.&#0160;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>It&#39;s an ancient commonplace -- sleep is the image of death. &#0160;In some versions, it&#39;s a preparation for death: God has provided us with sleep to get us ready for our inevitable end. &#0160;&quot;Somnus imago mortis&quot; is all over Shakespeare: &#0160;&quot;sleep thou ape of death,&quot; &#0160;&quot;death-counterfeiting sleep,&quot; etc.</p>
<p>My own personal sleep is so wracked with awakenings and nightmares and night-sweats and fluff in the lung and a feverish tongue that I can&#39;t easily think of it as a preparation for anything. &#0160;For me, sleep is rather a task, an effort, than a period of oblivion. &#0160;I want my tombstone to be inscribed with the motto, &quot;No more insomnia, forever.&quot;</p>
<p>But just six weeks ago, I experienced&#0160;a pure &quot;somnus imago mortis&quot; moment. &#0160;I was on a gurney, drugged, prepared for surgery. &#0160;I was wheeled into a room.&#0160; Time came to a complete halt. &#0160;And then several hours later I was awakened. Nothing -- nothing -- intervened from the time that I was put under until the moment when I came to. (Perhaps there was an amnesic in the drug cocktail -- I wouldn&#39;t know.)</p>
<p>It was such a profound and eventless sleep that it has, in fact, prepared me for the sleep of death. &#0160;There was not a whisper, not a thought, nothing. &#0160;Now, at last, I know how it will be.</p>
<p>In the hospital, there was a very welcome rebirth.&#0160; But why, then, does&#0160;the phrase, &quot;I have been half in love with easeful death&quot; continue to resonate in my brain?</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Regular readers of Dr. Metablog know that the good doctor has been flat on his back for&#0160;a couple of months.&#0160;&#0160;However, I&#39;m glad to say, the crisis has passed and I&#39;m upright once again.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>While lying there I had an opportunity to think about old times. I began to recall some things that my father used to say.&#0160; I wouldn&#39;t say proverbs or gnomic wisdom or anything so formal -- just sentences that would occasionally, casually, pass his lips.&#0160;&#0160;Here are a few of them, lightly annotated.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>1.&quot;Never omit an opportunity to do a someone a favor, and never be embarrassed to accept a favor.&quot; My father would say, &quot;people like to help each other.&quot;&#0160; My own experience has confirmed my father&#39;s wisdom and I&#39;ve tried to follow his example. However, there was a time that I ran into a stone wall with this one,&#0160; I was forced into close dealings with a man whom it was impossible to help -- because whenever I did something for him, he thought that it meant that he had outwitted me. My favor, offered freely, became his triumph. Needless to say, our relationship did not prosper.&#0160;</p>
<p>2.&#0160; &quot;Anyone can get rich if he makes it the entire effort of his life.&quot;&#0160; My father was the least materialistic person I&#39;ve ever known. He had no possessions and wanted none. Not only did money hold no allure, but he was contemptuous of those who felt the need to acquire it. But was he right? Can &quot;anyone&quot; get rich?&#0160; I don&#39;t think so. I&#39;ve known people who tried and have gone down in flames.&#0160; But I certainly understand my father&#39;s point.</p>
<p>3.&#0160;&#0160;&quot;When the stock market is going up, everyone&#39;s a genius.&quot; I know that my father owned one stock in his entire life -- because a friend insisted. He would have kept his cash in the mattress if he could have. I think that recent world economic events confirm his sentence and lead to a corollary -- &quot;sometimes the geniuses only seem to be geniuses.&quot;</p>
<p>4.&#0160; &quot;Never get into an argument with a drunk.&quot; He was certainly 100% on target on this one. There&#39;s just no odds -- even if you win the argument, the drunk doesn&#39;t know it. Plus the jerk is liable to throw the beer bottle at you. (I doubt that my father was drunk a single time in his entire life. I was drunk once, in 1962, and it was enough).&#0160;</p>
<p>5.&#0160; &quot;Try to do the things you&#39;re not good at.&quot; He said that when he was younger he would say, &quot;I don&#39;t like to swim&quot; when the truth of the matter was that he wasn&#39;t a good swimmer. (He was a fine athlete.)&#0160; He would counsel me -- &quot;do what if you&#39;re not good at it. Try it.&quot;&#0160; I wish I could say that I&#39;ve honored this precept, but in all honesty, I haven&#39;t. Sorry, pop.</p>
<p>6.&#0160; &quot;Don&#39;t forget to wash behind your ears.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>7.&#0160;&#0160;&quot;Always try to appeal to the better side of human nature.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;For example, in raising children, you should not punish a child; instead, you should say, &quot;you don&#39;t want to be the kind of person who would do such-and--such.&quot;&#0160; I believe this saying of his to be practical and useful. Needless to say, my father didn&#39;t respect&#0160; that side of the political/ religious/ social spectrum that considers human beings to be fallen, inherently depraved and selfish creatures. He was basically optimistic -- though his optimism was certainly tempered by the public events of his last decade.</p>
<p>8.&#0160; &quot;Never run with the crowd for the sake of being one of the boys.&quot;&#0160; This saying was central to his view of the world. I believe it came out of some particular experience of his youth but he never shared the details with me. I can certainly say that I&#39;ve honored this precept -- perhaps to a fault. I could have been more sociable, more &quot;clubbable&quot;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Miss Dusenberry, an English teacher at Erasmus Hall High School, was a formidable presence.</p>
<p>It was 1954 or 1955 and I was a junior, carrying just sixteen years of experience on my skinny back. To my shy, inhibited self, Miss Dusenberry (Edna? Grace?) was perceived as ancient (50s), statuesque (5&#39; 10&quot;), domineering (she spoke authoritatively on all things literary) and wildly eccentric. She wore fragrant cosmetics and bedecked herself with so many bracelets and bangles that, striding imperiously around the room, she jingled atonally and constantly.</p>
<p>My schoolwork did not please her. Miss Dusenberry derailed my educational career, demoting me from the honors track in English (where the bright students were grouped and where lessons were taught) to the general track where classrooms were disorderly, students ranged from noncompliant to sociopathic, and it was assumed that nothing would be learned, and it wasn&#39;t.</p>
<p>Yesterday, on an odd nostalgic impulse, I re-read Hawthorne&#39;s <em>Young Goodman Brown </em>for the first time in close to sixty years. The story is more shocking to me now than it could possibly have been in the 50s, when I had no background to understand puritanism or the manichean view of the world. The story is more alarming in what it takes for granted about American culture than for what it consciously critiques. Hawthorne&#39;s world is not and never has been, my America.&#0160;</p>
<p>Not only was I distressed by the story, but my mind flew back, or regressed, to Miss Dusenberry herself, who tried to present the story to unsophisticated, un-empathetic me back there in the Duke Snider/Joe McCarthy/Sid Caesar era. No wonder that I flopped in Miss D&#39;s class. Good grief, was I ever unwordly/unPuritan! On my intellectual horizon, the big worry was whether Roy or Gil might go hitless two days in a row. I had not the merest tad of experience (or even reading) to bring to bear on the elucidation of a dark allegorical treatment of severe Calvinist soul-sickness. Didn&#39;t, for that matter, know what Christians were talking about, except that the women and the kids dressed up and went to mass on Sundays (in our Neapolitan and Sicilian immigrant neighborhood, men stayed home and washed the car). There were no devils, real, imaginary, or allegorical in my deep, mysterious forests -- and no forests either, in concrete Brooklyn. I had no concept of spiritual despair or sin or damnation or salvation or any such things -- still don&#39;t in fact -- not in any personal way.&#0160;</p>
<p>Anyway, back in Erasmus Hall,&#0160;Miss Dusenberry led the class through some stories by Hawthorne.&#0160;We might even have read <em>The House of Seven Gables -- </em>that other novel, the one with the A-word, would have been far too sexual and embarrassing. Then came the unit exam and that&#39;s when the allegorical world of Calvinism hit the fan of naive Flatbush literalism. The topic on which we were assigned to write an in-class essay was -- &quot;Is there balm in Gilead?&quot;</p>
<p>I got to&#0160;tell you, I was buffaloed.&#0160;</p>
<p>It&#39;s easy to look back now, sixty years later, and translate Miss Dusenberry&#39;s question into &quot;in Hawthorne&#39;s view, is there hope for spiritual redemption in a fallen universe?&quot; An invitation, I must say, to turn the bullshittery up to eleven. But I didn&#39;t know the word &quot;balm&quot; and I had never heard of &quot;Gilead.&quot; I didn&#39;t know the hymn and I most certainly didn&#39;t know that there was any such thing as a Book of Jeremiah which contained relevant dark sentences to be interpreted allegorically or mystically.</p>
<p>So I failed, ignominiously. Not the worst failure of my childhood -- being thrown out at home plate when I had been sent in as a pinch-runner was a far greater ignominy. But to tell truth, I&#39;ve never made my peace with Miss Dusenberry. Her bangles occasionally rattle my sleep.</p>
<p>Hawthorne? well, I&#39;ve just kind of set him to one side.&#0160;&#0160;</p>

We&#39;re missing your pithy and astute commentary. All these athletic contests come and gone, even including the World Cup, and all those political follies,&#0160;and not a word of commentary?&#0160; How can it be, Dr. M? Cat got your tongue?&#0160;</p>
<p>Well, dear blogreaders, the fact of the matter is that Dr. M. has been sidelined with an injury and has been languishing on the disabled list. Ruptured his disc, he did. L5 if you want to be specific. On his back now these last two weeks, gulping the oxycodone, enduring a series of trips down there to the regional hospital. Dependent on family and friends for succor and sustenance</p>
<p>Lying here, solitary for longer periods than is his wont, Dr. M,, who never had a mind for philosophy, has had an opportunity to meditate on a subject of particular relevance to his condition. He&#39;s been thinking about pain. About dealing with pain.</p>
<p>Sometimes even Dr. M has to deal with very practical problems.</p>
<p>At the hospital,&#0160;various &quot;providers&quot; ask me, over and over again, to&#0160;&quot;put a number from 1 to 10 on the degree of your&#0160;discomfort.&quot;&#0160; &quot;Imagine,&quot; they say,&#0160;that 10 is the worst pain that you can conceive, what is your number?&quot; For me, this becomes a very difficult question, and one to which I don&#39;t know how to respond honestly or accurately. For one thing,&#0160; I have a rather vivid imagination, and for another, I&#39;ve read more than is healthy&#0160;about ingenious systems of&#0160;medieval and&#0160;&quot;renaissance&quot; torture. It&#39;s true that my back hurts,&#0160;and the&#0160;pain is real, but it&#39;s nothing compared to the worst that human beings have endured or can be compelled&#0160;to endure. I&#39;m sorry to say that I can imagine pain an order of magnitude beyond what my questioner can begin to conceptualize.&#0160;</p>
<p>But if I should say, &quot;one&quot; on a scale of one to ten, they&#39;d throw me out of the hospital and give my place to a more deserving&#0160;patient. So I say, &quot;eight and a half&quot; or &quot;nine&quot; -- not because such a&#0160;number has the least bit of&#0160;meaning but because I think I&#39;ve given my interrogators&#0160;the magic number that will allow me to get the care I need.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>I have a friend who had a very painful form of arthritis, but couldn&#39;t get the attention of the medical establishment for many horrible months -- until he answered the pain question with &quot;I&#39;m going to go out in the backyard and shoot myself.&quot; Then he was diagnosed and put on medication in an hour.</p>
<p>Moreover,&#0160;I don&#39;t know how to measure my pain against another&#39;s. My eight might be someone else&#39;s five, or vice versa.&#0160;I don&#39;t want to be theatrical (I can&#39;t bear to be a spectacle), but I also have no desire to be excessively stoical. A ruptured disc hurts. Ask anyone who&#39;s been there.&#0160;Is it equivalent to childbirth? I suspect not.&#0160;I know that burns are supposed to be infinitely more agonizing. I got to the point of&#0160;wincing and moaning and feeling faint, but not to fainting or writhing or screaming. And&#0160;I could always get relief from oxycodone, which is not always the case in more serious situations. I even had some morphine, which, at the time, was surprisingly ineffective. Now I&#39;m on the road to recovery, I believe, and the pain is very much handled with those horse-size ibuprofen. But ten days ago it was all narcotics, all the time. And I was grateful for them. Very much so.</p>
<p>I am reminded once again&#0160;that pain is&#0160;isolating. It separates you from your friends. You live in the pain, and with the pain, and you deal with the pain. You can&#39;t communicate it and you don&#39;t want to communicate it.</p>
<p>I fault myself for not having been sufficiently empathetic during my lifetime to the pain that other people have experienced.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>While I&#39;ve been lying here, I&#39;ve read two books by daring people who do not hesitate to court pain. The kind of person who decides to climb an unclimbable mountain, break his leg and then drags himself miles, freezing, starving, crippled. The kind of person who leaves warm hearth and happy home to walk to the South Pole dragging a two hundred kilogram sledge. These folks endure all sorts of horrors, voluntarily. Then they write books about their pain (whole paragraphs which I involuntarily skim and skip). When I read these stories, I feel like a wimp to complain about a ruptured disc. On the other hand, I feel sane -- not to have deliberately injured myself for the sake of some wild, inexplicable impulse.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I would have been six or seven years old, so it was&#0160;1945 or 1946. I was visiting the apartment at 334 Eastern Parkway where my grandmother lived with&#0160;Aunt Mollie. Mollie and my father were engaged in an earnest conversation of which I understood not a whit. I suspect that&#0160;they were speaking the language of the old country. Very likely they didn&#39;t want me to know what they were saying.</p>
<p>I was on the floor studying what I now realize was some sort of halftone illustration. Perhaps a magazine illustration -- something from Life or Look or Collier&#39;s. Halftone is a style of reproduction in which a picture is comprised of a myriad of tiny dots. When halftones are done inexpensively, as in comic books, the dots are plainly visible. When they&#39;re done expertly, they&#39;re almost beyond the perception of the human eye. But they&#39;re not invisible to the inspection&#0160;of a small child.</p>
<p>I said to my father and to my aunt something to the effect that&#0160;&quot;if you look at this picture closely, you can see a lot of dots.&quot; I passed the illustration to my father. He said, &quot;No, there are no dots there.&quot; I said, &quot;Look again. I can see dots.&quot;&#0160; He looked again and so did Mollie. &quot;Nope, no dots,&quot; they both agreed. They handed back&#0160;the picture and resumed&#0160;their discussion. I had been, in modern terms, totally dissed. &#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;Who are you going to believe? Me, or your own eyes?&quot; says&#0160;Chicolini in <em>Duck Soup.</em></p>
<p>I was shocked. My father, whom I knew to be correct in all things -- to deny the existence of something that I could plainly detect. And my aunt as well. Two adults, neither one who had ever been wrong about anything! What was going on here? What was a child to think? It was a moment of great revelation, and a turning point in my worldly experience.</p>
<p>Well, I wasn&#39;t about to argue with such formidable figures. But I knew in my heart that I was right and they were wrong, wrong, wrong.</p>
<p>I also knew that I had to choose between Authority and my own senses. And of course I chose sensation. The picture was made out of dots, no matter what they said.</p>
<p>But my infant mind did not rest. At that moment, I knew that I would never ever put blind trust in authority, never again. If my own father couldn&#39;t see the dots and I could, then how could I believe anything that was contrary to the evidence of my senses. My infant bosom got its back up, and I became a skeptic -- and I&#39;ve remained a skeptic.</p>
<p>It was&#0160;not until many years later that I realized that&#0160;the senses themselves could be untrustworthy.&#0160; But by that time, my habits were fixed. In a contest between authority&#0160;and the evidence of the senses -- it would be sense all the way.&#0160;&#0160;</p>

                                <p>Novacaine was discovered sometime around the turn of the last century, but it hadn&#39;t reached the backward interior of Brooklyn during my childhood. As a result, I endured hours of drilling and filling without anaesthetics. It was horrible.</p>
<p>The local dentist was named Dr. Caress. It would have been more appropriate if he had been called Dr. Butcher.&#0160;</p>
<p>There were no high-speed drills. Dr. Caress used a mechanical drill -- a motor attached to a system of small pulleys, if I remember correctly, at the business end of which was some sort of bur. It was slow and awkward and It took forever to drill out a cavity. There was lots of starting and stopping and moaning and readjusting and rinsing and spitting. I can still remember the pain. It was not a &quot;discomfort&quot; kind of pain. It was a torture kind of pain.&#0160;</p>
<p>All this in the office of Dr. Caress.&#0160; I can&#39;t even imagine what it was like across Ocean Parkway where the local dentist was named Dr. Yankowitz.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>So it was 1946 and I was in first grade in P. S. 217 and I must have been throwing my massive seven-year-old weight around because one of the &quot;class mothers&quot; took me aside and accused me of quote picking on unquote her dear son Michael who was at least six inches taller than poor poor pitiful skinny me. I remember that I was astonished and taken aback but that I was still in my own head poised enough to think, what a jerk Michael must be to tell on me to his mother -- although frankly I don&#39;t know now and didn&#39;t know then what I could have done to earn her enmity or deserve the reproach. I was innocent! What I remember most clearly is that I was rendered quite speechless when Michael&#39;s mommy asked an explanation or apology from me and especially that she two or several times demanded of me, scornfully, &quot;what&#39;s the matter, cat&#39;s got your tongue? Cat&#39;s got your tongue?&quot; I had never heard that expression before and didn&#39;t know what it meant, but it sure added a deal of mystery to the confrontation. My tongue was still in my mouth and not in the possession of some feline and I was neither clever enough nor bold enough to stick it out at her.&#0160;</p>
<p>What does it mean, &quot;Cat&#39;s got your tongue.&quot; It&#39;s still a mystery to me even today. Interestingly enough, the expression isn&#39;t of ancient origin and apparently dropped to earth only in the late nineteenth century. It&#39;s a puzzle, though. Why a cat?&#0160; But then, why &quot;cat&#39;s pajamas?&quot; Why &quot;cat o&#39; nine tails?&quot; Why &quot;cat&#39;s meow?&quot;</p>
<p>In any case, I was nonplussed that Michael&#39;s mommy spoke to me so obscurely and I was indignant to be accused of misbehavior. In fact, sixty plus years later I&#39;m still indignant.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Is it possible that the cat-and-tongue episode stimulated my interest in language?&#0160;</p>
<p>I really don&#39;t know why this antique event swam out of the dark backward and abysm of the past. Just yesterday, when I mentioned it to Mrs Dr. Metablog, she recalled that one day, also in 1946, when she was in elementary school and she was not sitting as still as we were then expected to sit, she was accused of having &quot;ants in her pants.&quot;&#0160; She&#39;s indignant.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Last night, the grandkids had a little fun with the old guy. Miss T. (b. 1999), concluded that Grandpa&#39;s electronic and computer skills were (her exact words) &quot;stone age.&quot;</p>
<p>Is she correct? Let us review the circumstances. I was here, in B--ld-r, trying to watch the Cornell-Kentucky sweet-sixteen on streaming video (CBS again gave the Big Red the back of its network-y hand) while simultaneously following the Kansas State-Xavier double-overtime epic on Tivo (slightly behind real time so as to sidestep the mini-dramas on the subjects of beer and deodorant). Miss T and Mr. O were snuggled in bed with their mom out there near the Pacific shore and we and they were sending messages back and forth on Facebook chat. Hey, not exactly a &quot;stone age&quot; situation.</p>
<p>The kiddies were testing my knowledge of IM acronyms, and I was failing badly. I didn&#39;t know ROTFL or JK or TMI or LMAO. Then Mr. O became dissatisfied at the pace of the conversation, so he started sending me messages (&quot;texting&quot; me is the jargon) on the cellphone, thereby giving me another device to manage. Which is when I ran out of hands, and in frustration, told what HF (according to SLC), also known as MT) calls a &quot;stretcher.&quot; I said (or wrote, rather) to Miss T. and Mr. O., something to the effect of &quot;what do you mean I don&#39;t know about electronic media. I used to IM all the time with my grandparents.&quot;</p>
<p>Frankly, they didn&#39;t buy it. I can&#39;t blame them; they know that my grandparents didn&#39;t have much English.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Ivy League fell further and further behind, mostly because Kentucky was quick enough to step&#0160;around the screens and stop Cornell&#39;s three-point game. In the other bracket, Kansas State lasted it out.&#0160;</p>
<p>I know that it&#39;s negligent not to enlighten&#0160;myself about&#0160;useful chat acronyms. Nevertheless, I suspect that the o-so-up-to-date grandkids at the other end of the IM line are also missing something. They probably think that a &quot;whopper&quot; is a hamburger. They probably don&#39;t know what a &quot;shellacking&quot; is. Or shellac, for that matter. Probably think that it&#39;s something that originated in the Stone Age.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>There&#39;s been some criticism -- justified, I must admit -- about the dexterity of my shaving.&#0160;It appears that my face has become more, what shall I say? <em>intricate</em> over the last years, and has developed some interesting crannies that resist the approach of the razor.&#0160;In order to improve my shaving technique, I bought one of those circular magnifying mirrors that allows you to view your face in such great detail that you can hunt down and harvest that last otherwise inaccessible follicle.&#0160;The mirror&#0160;seemed like a good idea, but, dear friends of a certain age, I do not recommend this purchase. Big mistake.&#0160;</p>
<p>It had been many years since I studied my face so intently.&#0160;Things have happened.&#0160;While I can still locate the remnants of the scar on my forehead, where, when I was a boy, I was pushed into a subway pillar, the mark used to reside just at the hairline.&#0160;Now, the hairline has migrated a good three inches to the north of the scar and -- thanks to the new mirror -- I can clearly detect that the first remaining&#0160;inch or so of brown-gray hair, which I&#0160;had thought&#0160;to be of a healthy bushiness, consists of no more than a few well-spaced strands.&#0160;And what&#39;s this cross-hatching on my forehead?&#0160;Not just the prominent horizontal furrows but new vertical ones as well -- when did they appear? And the deep gorges around my eyebrows!&#0160;And the eyebrows themselves -- when did they become parti-colored?&#0160;Randomly black and white?&#0160;And how many years ago did these long recurved eyebrow hairs begin to sprout?&#0160;Fie upon it --&#39;tis an unweeded garden that&#39;s gone to seed. Why are the eyebrows themselves so utterly asymmetrical?&#0160;and what should I make of the thicket of whiteheads -- or whatever the heck they are -- at all four corners of my bloodshot eyes?&#0160; Was it always the case that my eyes were set so deeply into those wrinkled dells?&#0160;And my nose-- thanks to the new mirror, I can plainly see the scars where the pre-cancerous lesions were frozen off.&#0160;What in the world has happened to the tip of my nose?&#0160; Was it always so preternaturally pointy?&#0160;I could use it as a letter-opener.&#0160;When I lift my head just slightly, I see that my nostrils, which I always took to be a matched pair, have set out on separate paths. The right one now sits&#0160;at a 45 degree angle to the left.&#0160;It&#39;s wandered off-center, like the eye of a flounder.&#0160;And those nasty black hairs jutting from my nostrils -- I must attend to them. And look, there are long hairs coming out of my ears as well.&#0160;And hanging, floppy earlobes marked with deep lines.&#0160;What&#0160;are these fleshy nobs at the sides of my mouth?&#0160;Were my lips always covered with white flakes?&#0160; How is it that the&#0160;left side of my underlip is so much thicker than the right?&#0160;And my pearly whites?&#0160;Cracked and chipped and not much of a row: sixty or so years of gnawing has given each tooth its own unique size, shape, color, and identity.&#0160;And what&#39;s this under my chin?&#0160;A single off-center hanging wattle?&#0160;No symmetry even in Wattlelandia?&#0160;Friends, this magnifying mirror is a disaster.&#0160;I should have stopped shaving entirely and grown a camouflaging beard.</p>
<p>But hold on, there&#39;s some good news.&#0160;It may not be a youthful or symmetrical face,&#0160;but It&#39;s not&#0160;unfriendly.&#0160;There&#39;s no sneer, or lip curl, or disdain, or anger. Puzzlement, certainly.&#0160;Wryness, perhaps. Curiosity, for sure.</p>
<p>Folks, at least we&#39;re not in a wicked-Dorian-Gray-kind-of-situation.</p>
<p>Wear and tear, yes; villainy, no.&#0160;Things could be worse.</p>

                                <p>When I was a mere tad, perhaps seven or eight years old but already an enthusiastic reader, I was given a subscription (by whom?) to a children&#39;s magazine, perhaps <em>Jack and Jill. </em>It arrived once a month and took perhaps ten minutes to read. It was certainly my older brother (who later owned a large house that had twice as many mirrors as books, who said, &quot;you still readin&#39; that thing for babies?&quot; Always susceptible to public criticism, I soon turned against the publication. Since then, I&#39;ve subscribed and unsubscribed to dozens of periodicals, many more than I can remember.&#0160; Here are a few: in my pathetic teens, <em>Mad Magazine, </em>of which I was a serious enthusiast (and had been so since <em>Mad</em>&#39;<em>s </em>Harvey Kurtzman comic book days). Closest I ever came to anarchy. Also, <em>Sport Magazine -- </em>a precursor of <em>SI.&#0160; </em>Pre-steriods, pre-scandal, the athletes profiled were virtuous, sober, and generous family men who had overcome venomous small town upbringings and acute physical handicaps to rise to the top of the mound or sit astride the Derby winner. Also, when I went though my adolescent fantasy phase, various pulp sci fi mags -- <em>Astounding Science Fiction </em>and <em>Galaxy Science Fiction </em>and probably others that came and went. I was much enamored of the stuff, which was monumentally escapist and therefore analogous to my sports obsessions. In the &#39;60s, I matured to political magazines: <em>The Reporter, The Nation, </em>and before it went totally and bizarrely wrong, <em>The New Republic. </em>A decade later, when I had set out to study literature through a social lens, I subscribed to <em>Local Population Studies, The Journal of Interdisciplinary History, The Psychohistorical Review, and The History of Childhood Quarterly. </em>When I became serious about Shakespeare I was an assiduous reader and collector of the <em>Shakespeare Quarterly </em>and <em>Shakespeare Survey </em>and the <em>Shakespeare Newsletter </em>and <em>Shakespeare Research and Opportunities </em>and the <em>Shakespeare on Film Newsletter. </em>Closely related: <em>English Literary Renaissance,&#0160;</em> to which I sent a number of my own contributions, and the <em>George Herbert Journal </em>(of which I at one time owned every issue). In the &#39;70s or &#39;80s, <em>Organic Gardening (</em>sample title -- &quot;How We Grew Papayas on our Vermont Hillside Using Organic Methods and Faith in God&quot;); later<em>, Fine Gardening</em> (sample title: &quot;How We Converted a Defunct Brick Brewery into an Extremely Expensive Bed-and-Breakfast Complete with a Replica of an 18th-century Capability Brown Landscape&quot;).&#0160; At then at various times: <em>Scientific American, Science News, Bluebirds Across Vermont, </em>the newsletter of the Southern Vermont Dairy Goat Association, <em>One Two Three Four </em>(a magazine briefly in existence that concerned itself with the early history of rock and roll), the <em>Atlantic, The Skeptical Inquirer. </em>Newspapers:&#0160; <em>The New York Times, Valley News, United Opinion (</em>since renamed&#0160; the <em>Journal-Opinion), Behind the Times, </em>the <em>B--ld-r Daily Camera. </em>Nowadays: <em>Harvard Magazine, New Yorker, New York Review of Books, Northern Forests</em>. A long list, but note: no movie star mags, no style, no self-improvement, no golf, no detectives, no alternative healing, no finance, no how-to-pyramid-your-money, no automotive, no weapons. It appears that I&#39;m a person of narrow but eclectic interests, magazine-wise. &#0160;</p>

                                <p>The grand-daughter, age 10, visited here last December.&#0160; She showed me her new cellphone. She was &quot;texting&quot; with a friend.&#0160; I asked her how she does it, and she gave me a lesson, even though she was startled and horrified, I imagine, to realize that, although an adult, I didn&#39;t know that it&#39;s one click for a d, two for an e, and three for an f. Her thumbs flew, mine limped, but I got the idea -- and then forgot about it until, a couple of days ago, when&#0160; was waiting in the doctor&#39;s office without a book and wasn&#39;t in the mood for Golf Magazine. I started to play with my two-month-old entry-level cellphone and discovered that if you press Menu, and then Messaging and then Send Message and then Enter Number that you can &quot;text&quot; -- of which I had no idea, my cellphone skills being usually limited to &quot;what is that noise coming from my pocket I&#39;d better check.&quot;&#0160; So I laboriously scribed (or thumbed) my first message to the grand-daughter: &quot;Thank you for teaching me to send text messages.&quot;&#0160; And then, miracle of miracles, a few hours afterward (after fifth grade had been dismissed for the day, I suspect), I received an answer, which I now reproduce verbatim: &quot;when ur txting u dont have 2 use full sentences.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>Live and learn.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Although youngsters sometimes try to piss off their parents by inserting into their nose a modest jewel or a gold circlet, we (as a nation or as a civilization) aren&#39;t terribly enthusiastic about decorating the old schnozzola. While the English language has words for many kinds of jewelry (ring, earring, brooch, bracelet, necklace, tiara, pectoral), it is vacant of vocabulary for objects that are affixed to or hang from the nose. Consequently, this magnificent piece of gold jewelry, crafted in Peru two thousand years ago, which certainly bore a name in proto-Quecha or whatever was spoken at the time, is now simply called a &quot;nose ornament.&quot;</p>
<p><img border="0" class="mainObjImage showEnlargeArea " jquery1265854892578="43" rel="1979.206.1172" src="http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/images/h2/h2_1979.206.1172.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 289px;" /></p>
<p>It&#39;s spectacular, isn&#39;t it? The four jolly, fat spiders in their intricate communal web of mesh are truly lovely. We moderns can&#39;t compete.&#0160; We have nothing to offer.&#0160;</p>
<p>Here&#39;s another beauty, this one from the area that is now Columbia.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/images/h2/h2_66.196.23.jpg" /></p>
<p>This nose ornament is five inches long from top to bottom, which means that it would cover the mouth and hang well below the chin. The small gold discs and the long flattened cylinders are loosely attached, so the ornament was designed both to catch and reflect the light and to jingle. This one, like the spider ornament, is glittery, ostentatious, and unapologetic.</p>
<p>I imagine that like most such jewelry, these nose ornaments were designed to say, &quot;I&#39;&#39;m rich, I&#39;m powerful, and I&#39;m sexy. Come mate with me.&quot; To me, they also say, very loudly, &quot;I can endure massive rhinal discomfort.&quot; It appears that these nose ornaments were inserted between the nostrils and attached to the septum. To wear such an ornament would be painful even if the wearer never sneezed or blew his nose, but to insert and remove it would be sheer nasal agony. Those sharp points would dig into the tender flesh. And the object must have been frequently removed,&#0160; because with the ornament in place, drinking or eating would be impossibly messy. While the nose ornament might get a guy a date, it would certainly inhibit chat or flirtation, and would also become a major impediment if he got lucky.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not impressed by the pitifully small nose ornaments worn by modern teenagers, but I would definitely respect the child who was willing to brandish something equivalent to these wonders. Especially the&#0160;one with the spiders.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>In the course of their long evolution our insect friends solved the problem of adolescence.While we humans grow ever so awkwardly from childhood to sexual maturity, your efficient, clever insect larva merely sequesters himself for a few weeks or months and then emerges as a completely fledged adult. No whining, no rebellion, no pimples, no door-slamming -- one day a child, and then, presto, a full member of society. There&#39;s not a beetle on what Antigonus called &quot;the whole dungy earth&quot; who ever had to &quot;find himself.&quot;</p>
<p>I wish that my own pupa-hood had been so quick and painless, but in fact, it was a commonplace mix of anxious folly and meaningless alienation. My most successful strategy for coping with the mess was to escape into the imagination. Not my own imagination, of course, for I had little or none, but into other people&#39;s. In my pupal stage, I was an indiscriminate reader of the genre known as fantasy and science fiction. Inhabiting, as I did, the wrong body, and having been birthed in the wrong time and place, I preferred fantastic alternative universes to so-called &quot;real life.&quot; I subscribed to a bunch of pulp mags and I also gobbled the extensive collections of sci-fi in the local public library. Not everyone will recognize the writers who were then my literary heroes, but for me they were names as familiar as Koufax and Drysdale or, for that matter, Truman and Eisenhower. Does anyone out there remember these folks: Robert Heinlein, James Blish, L. Sprague de Camp, Richard Matheson, Isaac Asimov, Robert Sheckley, Arthur C. Clarke, William Tenn, Poul Anderson, Fredric Brown, Fritz Leiber, Theodore Sturgeon, Clifford D. Simak, Fletcher Pratt, Ray Bradbury?&#0160; Names to conjure with, so to speak.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a paradox. While I vividly recall the names of these authors, I can remember almost nothing of what they wrote. I was fully immersed in the genre and yet it&#39;s evaporated from my memory -- leaving less of a mark than does the grub that becomes a butterfly. I seem to recall a novel or story about a planet in which the trees were murderous -- they would send their roots through ventilating ducts and strangle people in their beds. I have a hazy recollection of a story about a society in which overconsumption was the norm and in which to take a sofa and a set of chairs off the hands of newlyweds was an act of love. I recall some precocious evil children endowed with supernatural powers. Do I remember, or do I just imagine that I much admired a story about human beings shrunk to infinitesimal size who had to go mano-a-flagellum with paramecia. I&#39;m certain that I encountered a superfluity of post-apocalyptic stories: after the A-bomb, after the plague, after the invasion from another planet -- all such fictions obvious symptoms of cold-war paranoia. Why in the world should an adolescent earthling have consoled himself with stories of extragalactic invaders spaceshipping&#0160;to our green earth to exploit, or colonize, or enslave, or, occasionally, to butcher and stew us? In the 1950s, aliens were always hostile. None of my authors, as far as I can remember, could envision them greeting us with the outstretched tentacle of peace.</p>
<p>Although I think that some of the stories were imaginative, most of them were no more than starwarslike space operas-- Westerns but with death rays instead of six-shooters.</p>
<p>It&#39;s been many a year since I could abide fantasy. The genre is now repugnant to me.&#0160; I can&#39;t read Tolkien or Harry Potter, I can&#39;t watch movies about ghosts, or satanic possession, or space travel, or time travel, or about people stuck in other peoples&#39; bodies. All such nonsense bores the living heck out of me. Nor is it merely the lowbrow stuff. I can no longer read Spenser or Ariosto and&#0160;my least favorite character in Shakespeare is the magician Prospero. Is it a failure of imagination on my part?&#0160; Perhaps. But I don&#39;t feel it as a loss. There&#39;s more than enough of the non-fantastic to keep me joyfully occupied. I&#39;m grateful that sci-fi served my pupal needs, but it&#39;s gone forever.</p>
<p>Nowadays I tend to think back to my adolescent reading only when I&#39;m at the drugstore filling a prescription. The names of the new concoctions devised by Big Pharma all sound extraterrestrial to me. For example: Cyclessa is the queen of the distant planet Pulmicort which circles around the star Ativan in the galaxy called Levaquin. Cyclessaâ€™s evil brother Coumadin, along with his henchmen the evil twins Zantac and Zocor, have attacked the queen, using their secret weapons Restoril and Ritalin. They&#39;re accompanied by the enchantress Ambien, aka Zolpidem, who causes her enemies to fall into profound sleep. But deep in the forest, young Prozac awakens from a spell, mounts the great horse Oxycontin, and with the aid of his sidekick, the amusing but randy Cialis, who has escaped from the clutches of the evil witch Prevacid....&#0160; Etc., etc.</p>

                                <p>&quot;It was irresponsible for me to have bought this house,&quot; he thought. &quot;And yet it is so glamorous, so desirable.&#0160; I should have inspected it more closely.&#0160; There are many parts of the building that I&#39;ve never even looked into. Take this room, for example.&#0160; It&#39;s far too long and narrow to be useful&#0160; I must have been attracted to the bookshelf and to the books. But now that I look closely, I see that the books are tattered and&#0160; worthless. I thought that they were valuable, but they&#39;re just thrift store discards. And the kitchen -- I don&#39;t think it&#39;s functional. These hand-carved boards, which I thought were so beautiful -- they obstruct the sink and the stove. I&#39;ll have to remove them. And in this room -- what is it, a bedroom? -- the murals are nothing more than the scrawls of children. What could I have been thinking? I have purchased a house that is a shambles. It&#39;s going to cost me a fortune just to make it habitable. Look, in the living room the wallpaper is pulled off and the lath is exposed. And here, in the grand ballroom, there&#39;s been leakage around the window frames. This huge fireplace is falling in. This passageway, which ought to go to the nursery --it&#39;s been blocked off. And this sitting room has no outside wall. No protection from the weather at all. The wind could blow right through. It was self-destructive of me to buy this house. It&#39;s financial suicide. What could have attracted me to it? Let&#39;s walk around the outside. There are entrances that I didn&#39;t know existed. Anyone could come in. It&#39;s not secured; there are no locks, no doors. And a garage -- but the garage floor isn&#39;t concrete or paved -- it&#39;s just sand and rocks. And this outside wall, which I took for marble or granite -- it&#39;s just old loose, cracked, unpainted stucco. The yard is a complete wreck -- all concrete and razor-wire, nothing alive. Who&#39;s that strange man prowling around?&#0160; Why was I attracted to this place?&#0160; Why do I still find it alluring, despite everything that I know about it?&quot;</p>
<p>Later, we all went for a drive in the mountains. It was cold and the roads were completely covered with snow and almost impassable. We arrived too late for the party. &quot;Let&#39;s all meet at the Unitarian church,&quot; one of the other guests said. &quot;I&#39;m going to kill me a chicken,&quot; said another.&#0160;</p>

                                <p>Last night, I had a specific sense that I hadn&#39;t been sleeping in clover. I worried for hours and I worried about everything. I started, I think, by brooding on the inevitability of a comet striking the earth and extinguishing life as we know it. From there I moved to the collapse of the ecosyste. The earth will soon (in geological terms) be hot, waterless, and lifeless. In the nearer future, monsoons, tornadoes, tsunamis, hurricanes and other &quot;acts of god&quot; will occur with increasing frequency. My pillow was hot, and the bed sheet somehow managed to tangle itself around my legs.&#0160; I worried about the possibility of nuclear weapons or vials of botulism falling into the hands of jihadists. I worried about the declining population of our swifts and swallows, our frogs and toads, our bats and bees and about the certainty that the Asian longhorn beetle is about to do to the maples what the blight did to the magnificent chestnuts and the Dutch elm disease did to <em>ulmus americanus.</em> Not to mention the wooly adelgid that is intent on making hash of our hemlocks. I worried about the decline of the American economy, about the rebirth of bigotry and know-nothingism among the Republicans and about the pitiful fecklessness of the Democrats. I was working myself up to quite a state, sweating into my blankets. What about our radical-reactionary-interventionist supreme court? Oh my gosh, I forgot to worry about all those poor people in Haiti! At about four in the morning, I switched to more local worries: my apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, my increasing failure of memory, and my lifelong tendency toward procrastination, once resisted but now re-emerging with a vengeance. I reviewed the recent deaths and diseases among my age-cohort of friends:&#0160; -- K&#39;s polycynthemia vera, R&#39;s brain tumor, S&#39;s alcoholism, J&#39;s obstructed colon, B&#39;s shingles, C&#39;s lung cancer, my brother&#39;s sudden death of stroke or embolism or who knows what it was. I thought of the friends to whom I should have been more kind, more concerned. I worried about my children and grandchildren, all apparently thriving, but you never know. I fell in and out of sleep. I got up and paced.</p>
<p>Toward dawn, I straightened the bedclothes, took a leak, ate some yogurt, and tried again. I woke up in a cold sweat, having dreamed that I was painfully plucking hairs out of my lips. Not hairs, exactly. More like boar&#39;s bristles. And that every handful of bristles was infested with spiders and other verminous insects.&#0160; Eew, hairy lips. How disgusting.</p>
<p>I did not worry about dying.</p>
<p>Death: no more nightmares, no more insomnia, forever.</p>

<p>What would prompt a guy to dream that his carrots were growing upside-down? Their abundant orange roots pointing straight into the air?&#0160; What point is my dreamatorium trying to make?&#0160; In this particular nightmare, I&#39;m absolutely perplexed about photosynthesis. If they&#39;re upside-down, how do they..?</p>
<p>There&#39;s more. In the dream, my lettuce is growing right-side-up, but it&#39;s encrusted with some sort of white stuff that forms a collar around the base of the plant.&#0160;</p>
<p>Courageously, I taste it. It&#39;s -- by gosh -- feta cheese. Salty, but still quite good.</p>
<p>What the heck?&#0160;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Before Grandma died, she specified cremation and asked that her ashes be divided between the graves of her husband Dan and her daughter Phyllis. Now the time has come to fulfill the first half of the assignment. We&#39;ll fly to NYC later this month. We&#39;ll make a pilgrimage to the Baron Hirsch cemetery on Staten Island, scatter a portion of the ashes, leave behind a ceremonial stone or two, and think thoughts as positive as the occasion will allow.&#0160;</p>
<p>However, in the light of the Detroit plane incident, I&#39;m concerned about carrying a box of white powder on board. Am I paranoid? is it completely nuts to imagine that some vigilant but misguided TSA employee will take a gander at the ashes and think &quot;anthrax&quot; or &quot;explosives.&quot; Take me into that little room where they peruse your &quot;body cavities.&quot; And then on to Gitmo.</p>
<p>Apparently, I&#39;m not the only person with this worry.</p>
<p>&quot;Passengers are allowed to carry a crematory container as part of their carry-on luggage, but the container must pass through the X-ray machine. If the container is made of a material that generates an opaque image and prevents the security screener from clearly being able to see what is inside, then the container cannot be allowed through the security checkpoint.&quot; Is our container sufficiently transparent? How would one know?</p>
<p>Instead of carrying the ashes&#0160;aboard, why don&#39;t we just check them through?</p>
<p>&quot;Some airlines do not allow cremated remains as checked baggage so please check with your air carrier before attempting to transport a crematory container in checked baggage.&quot; Why would United Airlines care whether I put ashes in my bags?&#0160; It&#39;s obvious -- they lose the luggage and then we sue them for zillions.&#0160; How about if I promise not to sue?</p>
<p>I&#39;m going to guess that it&#39;s&#0160;not a good idea to sew the &quot;cremains&quot; -- hideous neologism -- into my underwear.&#0160;</p>
<p>OK, here&#39;s the plan.&#0160; We take a symbolic portion the ashes, secure it in a transparent ziploc baggie, and insert a visible all-caps large-font note: &quot;These are Grandma&#39;s ashes. They are not dangerous. Feel free to examine or to sample.&quot;</p>
<p>Incidentally, I can offer no confirmation to the rumor that the Department of Transportation plans to ban all underwear. Or that it will insist that underwear be worn on the outside. These are vicious canards.&#0160;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Another day, another solicitation&#0160; from Cornell, the university that I attended back there in the Bronze Age 1950s. I&#39;ve got to admire their tenacity -- they&#39;ve been holding out the tin cup for fifty years and I&#39;ve never dropped in a nickel. Not even a copper.&#0160;</p>
<p>Why so negligent? Well, there are a number of reasons. The first, and probably most important, is that I took my education so seriously that I became a teacher, and as a result,&#0160; I never accumulated the kind of dough that would make the least impression on a multi-billion dollar endowment. A second reason: I sent my daughter to Cornell during the 1980s (at what now seems like the bargain rate of only $20,000 - $25,000 a year), and the total four-year cost of her stay was a sufficient contribution to the ole alma mater. And finally, other causes felt more pressing (last year, for example, Obama, and this year, helping to keep our state legislature blue). But these reasons are mere rationalization and excuse, for, truth to tell, I bear a grudge against Cornell. Let me unclasp a secret book and tell you about it.&#0160;</p>
<p>In my first year at Cornell, I shared a room in an all-freshman dormitory. It was not gracious living, but I hadn&#39;t expected it to be. Cinder-block walls, composition floors, cheap extruded-aluminum furniture. Worst of all, the doors were fragile, hollow-core, and were always busting. I busted one -- I slid a piece of furniture and sliced a hole into the 1/8&quot; plywood sheathing of Room 2117. (Whose brilliant idea was it to put fragile doors in the way of a thousand adolescent males?) Anyway, some guys came to fix the hole, which they did by gluing a 2&quot; by 6&quot; piece of plywood ONTO THE SURFACE OF THE DOOR. Talk about craftsmanship!&#0160;</p>
<p>But here&#39;s the rub. I was billed $10 for the so-called repair. $10.00?&#0160; Not so much, you say?&#0160; Well, I was then employed at $1.25 an hour, so the perfunctory repair, which couldn&#39;t have taken five minutes to complete, represented the before-tax wages of a full day&#39;s labor. (Further context: the rent for my half of the room was $315 for the 32-week school year, or less than $10 a week.)&#0160; Plus the bill was sent directly to my father, who was scrimping to send me whatever bucks he could afford and didn&#39;t need to know that I had wasted $10 laying waste to the elegant decor.&#0160;</p>
<p>I was outraged. I&#39;m still outraged.</p>
<p>Hey, Cornell. Make it up to me. Do the right thing. When you&#39;ve contrived an apology and a recompense, well, then, maybe we can start to talk about possible donations.&#0160;</p>
