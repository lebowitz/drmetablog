                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Reading at one of our local Starbucks, I was, as is often the case, lost in my book. But I looked up when a late 20s-early 30s blonde and bearded man sat down at a table across the way. I noticed that he was holding his cup of coffee in an odd way. And then I realized that where his right hand should have been there were a pair of stainless steel hooks. Sad, I thought. And yet he seemed cheerful and optimistic. I wondered if I would be in such good spirits if I had lost a hand in an accident. I went back to reading, but looked up again when he fumbled with the sleeves of his jacket. And then I saw that he had no left hand either. Instead, a&#0160; pair of hooks, left and right, where hands and fingers should be. What terrible accident could have caused a young man to lose both hands, I wondered. Perhaps I was more sensitive than usual, but I was moved almost to tears as I watched him manipulate his coffee and his napkin and his muffin with his mechanical prosthetics. Soon his young and attractive girlfriend joined him. She came on aluminum crutches. &quot;Must have broken her foot,&quot; I thought. Then I saw that there was no foot and that she had only one leg.</p>
<p>I&#39;m slow, but I figured it out at last.</p>
<p>Soldiers. Home from Iraq. Bombs -- IEDs --&#0160; took off his hands and her leg. They met at a rehabilitation hospital. Fell in love. They&#39;re trying to start life over again.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not ashamed that I turned away and started to cry.</p>
<p>&#0160;And then grief converted to anger.&#0160;</p>
<p>That damned useless war! That idiot ignoramus Bush! That villain Cheney!. Those two megalomaniacs, and their co-conspirators,&#0160; who started this war -- they&#39;re sitting pretty right now, aren&#39;t they? But these young folks right next to me -- they&#39;re not sitting so comfortably. They&#39;ve paid the price.</p>
<p>Belatedly, I wish them all the joy that life can offer. As for crazy George and strutting Dick, there&#39;s no penalty that they can pay, there&#39;s no retribution sufficient -- but if their pernicious bodies would rot half a centimeter a day, why, that would be a start.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I was all alone for a week or so.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not what you would call a spiffy dresser, even on the best of days, and perhaps, solitary, I was even less attentive than usual to my presentation. It is possible that I had neglected to comb my hair and it is also possible that I hadn&#39;t shaved for a few days. I do know for sure that I was wearing my favorite, familiar blue sweatshirt, the one with the hood, which is perhaps fifteen years old and a trifle faded. It may even have had a stain or two on its sagging front -- perhaps jam or spaghetti sauce or something equally tasty. The veteran sweatshirt may also have been slightly frayed at the sleeves -- but it is, or was, in my opinion, a very wearable garment.</p>
<p>In any case, one morning last week I took a walk over to Breadworks, my favorite establishment for day-old muffins. I set down my notebook, which is, I admit, slightly chewed, on a vacant table, noting that the next table over was occupied, but at that moment only by a plate of eggs and a cup of coffee, the customer no doubt hunting up more food or making a quick trip to the bathroom. I dug into a stack of used newspapers, came up with yesterday&#39;s <em>Camera </em>and sat down to read.</p>
<p>And then my putative neighbor, the young woman who must have previously claimed the next table, returned. She took a long look at me. I smiled slightly, as one does in such situations.&#0160; She quickly gathered her plate and coffee and moved to a vacant table three over from me.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh! I know exactly what she was thinking. &quot;Homeless.&quot; &quot;Loathsome.&quot;</p>
<p>How awful it must be to be regularly and unapologetically shunned!</p>
<p>My daughters have been visiting this week. I hadn&#39;t even mentioned this incident, but they independently took one look at my well-worn-in stained garment and quite spontaneously trotted off to Army-Navy store just off the Pearl Street Mall and came home with a brand new Carhart sweatshirt, which after a few years of use will become a new favorite. The old blue friend-of-long-standing is in the rag bag.</p>
<p>I can now I enter any coffee shop in our fair city and proudly rejoin the respectable citizenry. Or should I say the fastidious citizenry?</p>

                                <p>A friend of mine was teaching a course in life drawing and was having trouble finding models. He asked me if I&#39;d be willing to donate an hour. Hey, it was the drug-crazed 1960s (or perhaps early 70s) and I had long since put modesty behind. So I agreed.</p>
<p>It was odd to be naked&#0160; among a roomful of the clothed. I was more sensitive to drafts than I would have guessed. It was difficult to remain motionless, especially with all the houseflies a-lighting on the sensitive areas. It was peculiar and a little flattering to have so many pairs of eyes fixed upon me. However, my clearest memory is the student, a young woman, who at the end of the hour, asked the teacher, &quot;Next week, could you try to find someone with a more interesting body?&quot;</p>
<p><em>December 20</em>.&#0160; I now realize that, bodywise, I <em>have</em> become more interesting over the last forty years -- if interesting means lumpy, wrinkled, and asymmetrical.&#0160;</p>

                                <p>So, a couple of days ago, we were watching some basketball on the HDTV, and despite the fact that Carmelo was going to the rim virtually at will, I was kind of down and depressed. Trying to cheer me up, the companion of fifty-plus years says, &quot;I&#39;ll tell you what. I&#39;ll get you anything you want -- absolutely anything at all.&quot;&#0160; Meaning, of course, anything edible, anything from the kitchen. We&#39;ll I&#39;m not abstemious, I&#39;ve always been a good eater, and I recognize that food has the power to confer good cheer, so I thought and thought, and finally I said, &quot;I know what I&#39;d like. How about a cup of decaf tea and two prunes.&quot; And then after a few seconds, I screamed, &quot;Holy moley, what in the living heck has happened to me?&quot;&#0160; Is it now the case that the outer limit of my once-voracious imagination is a cup of decaf tea and two prunes?&#0160; So embarrassing, so downright geezerish. What ever happened to ice cream sundaes with Fox&#39;s U-Bet and real whipped cream, to rich and gooey lasagna, to late-night salami sandwiches on deli rye (not that we would have any of those ingredients stocked in our bland healthful-but-tasteless-low-cholesterol refrigerator). It&#39;s all downhill, this septuagenarian eating. Ou sont les pepperoni pizzas dantan?&#0160; Where are the bacon cheeseburgers of yesteryear?</p>

                                <p>I did so write a check to register the car, it turns out, but since we have changed our residence, the registration certificate and the little adhesive tab that you&#39;re supposed to fix to the license plate never arrived here, and of course I forgot all about the legality of the vehicle. Had no idea. The upshot is that while driving to the airport, I was stopped by a police guy who was lurking in the shadows to pounce on malefactors such as I. I was issued an expensive ticket. Very annoying. I&#39;m generally a law-abiding citizen and I&#39;m not used to being in trouble with the authorities.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Not immediately able to figure out what went wrong, I hustled down to the Motor Vehicle Bureau out there on 33rd Street. I took a number, sat down and rehearsed what I would say to the clerk on duty. All I could think of was, &quot;I need help.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>When my number was called, I walked up to the designated clerk, a woman of uncertain age. The sign on her desk said, in rather large letters, &quot;Rhonda.&quot; And so I did it. I couldn&#39;t help myself. I said, &quot;Help, help me Rhonda.&quot; And then, of course, I was immediately chagrined. &quot;I&#39;m sure you hear that all the time,&quot; I apologized, admitting to my appalling banality. &quot;Not all the time,&quot; she said, &quot;but often enough.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>It could have been even worse. I could have declaimed the entire poetic chorus to the Beach Boys&#39; 1965 hit:</p>
<p>Help me Rhonda<br />Help, help me Rhonda<br />Help me Rhonda<br />Help, help me Rhonda<br />Help me Rhonda<br />Help, help me Rhonda<br />Help me Rhonda<br />Help, help me Rhonda<br />Help me Rhonda<br />Help, help me Rhonda<br />Help me Rhonda<br />Help, help me Rhonda<br />Help me Rhonda, yeah.</p>

People who know me only slightly&#0160; imagine&#0160;that I am unsociable or ascetic.&#0160;Or that I&#39;m a recovering alcoholic.&#0160;In fact,&#0160;I suffer from an&#0160;inherited&#0160;disability.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Now at long&#0160;last the&#0160;culprit gene has been fingered. It&#39;s ADH2*2, &quot;a rare variation of ADH2, which produces a more active form of alcohol dehydrogenase, the enzyme that catalyzes the first step in alcohol metabolism.&quot;</p>
<p>Alcohol dehydrogenase? There are more than a sixpack of them:&#0160;&quot;alcohol dehydrogenases are a group of seven dehydrogenase enzymes that facilitate the interconversion between alcohols and aldehydes or ketones with the reduction of NAD+ to NADH....&quot;&#0160;More succinctly, &quot;they break down alcohols.&quot; I don&#39;t know whether ADH2*2 digests alcohol too fast, or too slow, or just idiosyncratically, but the effect on me is stomach-ache, headache,&#0160;and general queasiness. Wine, &quot;the merry cheerer of the heart,&quot; sours my digestion.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>The eccentric allele&#0160;occurs in 20 to 30 percent of Jewish populations &quot;suggesting that&#0160;ADH2*2 is one of the factors explaining the low rates of alcoholism in this group.&quot; Recent investigations have demonstrated &quot;significant relationships between ADH2*2 and alcohol use ... in all Jewish groups studied.&quot; &quot;Those with the variant gene have been seen to drink less frequently, consume less alcohol overall or have more unpleasant reactions to alcohol.&quot;</p>
<p>This analysis makes perfect sense to me, but Science is apparently unsatisfied: &quot;the exact reason why ADH2*2 tends to discourage heavier drinking isn&#39;t known.&quot; Well, Science, let me see if I lend a hand here. If you get sick rather than high from a few sips, you stop drinking -- unless you&#39;re a complete and total Schmuck.&quot;</p>
<p>Perhaps because I&#39;m a teetotaler (though a reluctant one), I have little tolerance for drunken excess. I&#39;m not amused by loss of inhibition, by sloppy speech, or by too-loud staggering enthusiasm. I&#39;ve honored my father&#39;s warning -- &quot;never get into an argument with a drunk&quot; -- to the letter. In actual fact, I try very hard not to engage the alcoholically-addled in any discussion, whether serious or flippant.&#0160;</p>
<p>I regret that I can&#39;t participate in wine-tastings -- the stuff looks and smells so good. But even there, I&#39;m skeptical of the poetic language that oenophiles employ -- hints of rubber and raspberries and old leather and that sort of hyperbole. I tend to sniff deeply, and then proclaim,&#0160;&quot;tumescent but not rigid.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#39;s not hard to be witty when you&#39;re sober and your Falernian audience has been quaffing the pinot grigio.</p>

<p>Recently I looked up K on the internet. He&#39;s a retired professor of economics and is a &quot;fellow&quot; at a right-wing think tank. He&#39;s made a career out of opposing third-world development and supporting &quot;free market solutions&quot; to all our ills. That dogged dullness has produced a number of books. I&#39;ve even found a picture of him -- where he was once flabby and pimpled, he&#39;s now bald and sleek, with a malevolent cast to his eye.&#0160;</p>
<p>There&#39;s always been a connection in my mind between conservatism and racism. The link is narcissism. &quot;I&#39;ve got mine, let &quot;them&quot; take care of themselves.&quot; For the Ks of the world, it&#39;s not &quot;how do we take care of less fortunate and of our old people?&quot;&#0160; It&#39;s, &quot;how do &#39;we&#39; deal with &#39;them.&#39;&quot;&#0160;&#0160;And &quot;they&quot; are usually, almost always, darker-skinned than &quot;we.&quot;&#0160; I&#39;m sure that K would deny that his &quot;free-market&quot; views have anything to do with racism. But I know better -- I was there at the beginning, before K became quite so sleek.&#0160;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Richard Poirier died last week at age 83. <em>The New York Times </em>paid tribute with a long obituary and an appreciative essay. Poirier was a &quot;distinguished man of letters&quot; and also a Professor of English.</p>
<p>In 1960, as the juniorest and least-sophisticated graduate student in the history of the universe, I enrolled in an AmLit course taught by Poirier. Fifty years later, I can affirm that it was the single course in my graduate career in which I performed the absolute worst -- both in the instructor&#39;s judgment and in my own. I&#39;m still embarrassed at the woeful mess of a paper I offered him. I remember little of it, except its incompetence and the recollection that I used the phrase &quot;a writer of his ilk&quot; -- I can&#39;t remember to which I writer I referred -- and that Poirier wrote a longish exasperated note explaining to me that I did not have the standing to treat any American author with disrespect. However, the honest-to-goodness reason why I did so badly in the course was that Poirier expected his students to think -- and thinking was not an area in which I was gifted. I had discovered early in my educational career that my memory was far superior to most of my contemporaries, that I had an ear for language, and that I had a moderately fluent prose style. But I never, ever, possessed a logical, orderly, or penetrating intelligence. (I could remember sentences and phrases and whole poems, but not arguments or chains of reasoning).&#0160; My skills were sufficient for literary study -- indeed I doubt that I could have managed an academic career in any other discipline.</p>
<p>In fact, I did rather well&#0160;in studies&#0160;with most of&#0160;my graduate-school professors -- distinguished&#0160;and learned gentlemen all of them -- who&#0160;were&#0160;so happy to encounter facility that they didn&#39;t notice the want of brain.</p>
<p>It is curious that some of the most profoundly learned of my professors were the least adventurous of thinkers. I remember, particularly, Douglas Bush, now a mere trivia question, but a most renowned scholar in his day, whose superficial, fey, conservative, neoChristianist, pixie observations on Spenser and Milton I duly recorded. for two endless semesters, learning absolutely nothing of worth or value.</p>
<p>Poirier was more serious. Only 35 (I was 21), he was thinking deeply about the qualities that made American literature distinctive (he was formulating the ideas that came together in <em>A World Elsewhere</em>). He was an intellectual rather than an academic. It would have been wise for me to have listened carefully to him. I might have learned something.&#0160;</p>
<p>It&#39;s shocking to me that the young, dashing lecturer whom I remember so clearly could be so old, so dead -- but there&#39;s no denying that half a century has slipped away since I last listened to his rumbling voice.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>

                                <p>In our part of Vermont, the common wisdom is, &quot;never keep your car unlocked in August, because someone will open your door and throw in a couple of zucchinis.&quot; Like most local gardeners, I&#39;m drowning&#0160; in the&#0160; squash. We can&#39;t eat our zucchinis fast enough. And no matter how vigilant I am in picking them, I wake up in the morning to lift one of those huge hairy leaves and there it is --- another baseball-bat long, sumptuously fat zucchini, staring its one-eyed stare at me. To make matters worse, this year I&#39;m growing two kinds of zucchinis -- the standard green supermarket variety and a fancy striped &quot;Romanesco.&quot;&#0160; Also another exotic squash, a buttery globe called &quot;Ronde de Nice,&quot; most plentifully produced.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Last week I was weeding in the garden when I had an unexpected visitor -- unusual for our dirt-road, off the beaten track neighborhood.&#0160; I can&#39;t remember having to deal with a solicitor since two barely fledged Mormons popped by, fruitlessly, in 1978. This young man, who arrived noiselessly on bicycle was from VPIRG, and he came to tell me about the hazards of the Vermont Yankee atomic power station. I told him right up front that I wasn&#39;t going to donate any money and I told him why -- it all went to Obama.&#0160; But he was cordial nevertheless, and we chatted. He&#39;s a Latin major, just graduated from UVM, off in the fall to join Americacorps. Nice kid, I thought, but an easy mark. After twenty minutes, he rode off with no donation but with&#0160;&#0160;two substantial zucchinis and a Ronde de Nice in his backpack. Also a large head of broccoli and a handful of beets.&#0160;</p>

                                <p>The Stephen Foster songbook was a staple of my childhood. My mother sitting at the old Hardman baby grand, sang &quot;Camptown Ladies&quot; and &quot;O Susanna&quot; and &quot;Old Black Joe.&quot; But times change and Foster was pushed to the sidelines years ago. Too racist, too sentimental, too &#39;soft&#39;. It&#39;s undeniable that the lyrics of many of his songs are reprehensible.</p>
<p>Now we&#39;re enjoying a Stephen Collins Foster Revival and Festival in our very own home. It began with the discovery of the &quot;American D<span id="fck_dom_range_temp_1249064936000_683"></span>reamer&quot; cd that Thomas Hampson recorded in 1992.&#0160; Hampson, opera lovers will know, is the world champion of living baritones, and in this cd, he does Foster proud -- to the inventive accompaniments of Jay Ungar and Molly Mason. No question but that Foster was a truly superb melodist -- with a long string of songs that would have gone double-platinum, if there had been such a thing, in pre-Civil War America.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Hampson sings&#0160;the Foster songs as if they&#39;re Schubert lieder, but there&#39;s another recent cd, &quot;Beautiful Dreamer&quot; -- a &quot;tribute album&quot; in which Suzy Bogguss, John Prine, Allison Krauss,&#0160;Mavis Staples and&#0160;a bunch of excellent lesser-known (to me) but wonderful musicians lay into these tunes with enthusiasm and verve.&#0160;Who would have guessed the&#0160;&quot;Beautiful Dreamer&quot; was country before country was cool?&#0160;Pure country.</p>
<p>Foster was a better melodist than poet. Often his lines are awkward and time-bound and mawkish, but occasionally he hits the nail on the head. I like &quot;beautiful dreamer, queen of my song&quot;; I think that &quot;slumber my darling the birds are at rest&quot; is fine, but a succeeding line in the same song -- &quot;thy pillow shall sacred be&quot; -- is bad beyond ordinary bad; &quot;weep no more, my lady&quot; is positively Shakespearean and &quot;all the world is sad and dreary/ every where I roam&quot; is well-rooted in the medieval contemptus mundi&#0160; tradition; &quot;long may the daisies dance the field, frolicking far and near&quot; is far too pseudo-Wordsworthian for my palate. Foster&#39;s best lyric, in my view, is &quot;Hard Times Come Again No More&quot; --&#0160; &quot;&#39;Tis the song, the sigh of the weary/ Hard times, hard times, come again no more/ Many days you have lingered, around my cabin door/ Oh! hard times, come again no more.&quot;&#0160; It&#39;s inspired, heartfelt, and eternally pertinent -- and also, wedded to an excellent melody. &quot;Hard Times&quot; was not known to me in the days of my youth -- more&#39;s the pity.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Old guy, maybe a bluesman, bottle of hooch in a brown paper bag, sits on a bench in the middle of the night, downtown, playing air-sax, nodding. Young fellow comes by, cheerful, asks him, &quot;Crosstown buses run this way?&quot; Blues guy looks up, pauses for a second, and then drawls, &quot;Doo--dah, doo-dah.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I stopped at one of those highway gas-station convenience stores a few weeks ago, searching for some invigorating M&amp;Ms.&#0160;I couldn&#39;t find them, but I said to myself, this is America and&#0160;I&#39;m an American, and if there&#39;s one thing I know it&#39;s that there are going to be M&amp;Ms somewhere in this quickstop. I poked around a little more and sure enough, just a little out of the way, there they were -- five different kinds of M&amp;Ms. I went for the classic multi-colored ones. Am I the kind of person who&#39;s going to experiment with peanut butter M&amp;Ms? &#0160;It wouldn&#39;t be me.&#0160;</p>
<p>But I&#39;m off the point, which is, that when you&#39;re a native of the place, you know more or less what to expect.&#0160;You&#39;re not likely to be taken by surprise very often.&#0160;But every once in a while, something hits you right between the eyes, and you say, where the heck am I?&#0160;I had such an experience today when I read a flyer from the West Fairlee Center Church, which is right over there on Middlebrook Road, not more than three or four miles from where we live.</p>
<p>I have no quarrel with the &quot;Old Fashioned Community Hymn Sing&quot; on July 12 or the &quot;Shape Note Singing&quot; on August 2 -- that&#39;s exactly what I would&#0160;expect from a church in&#0160;West Fairlee Center.&#0160;I&#39;m a little puzzled by the &quot;Blessing of the Animals&quot; on July 19, but then I remembered St. Francis, in some ways my favorite saint, and I remembered that he preached to the birds and that when he was dying, he thanked his donkey and (this is a bit hard to believe but what the heck) his donkey wept.&#0160;So I&#39;m OK with blessing the animals, although I myself would&#0160;feel hypocritical blessing the particular animals&#0160;that I was preparing to transubstantiate&#0160;into&#0160;lambchops or hamburger.</p>
<p>But what makes me feel like a stranger in a strange land is&#0160;the event that is&#0160;scheduled for August 9 --&#0160;the &quot;Blessing of the ATV&#39;s&quot; (sic).&#0160;ATVs, for those of you who don&#39;t know, are &quot;all-terrain vehicles,&quot; and are very useful if you&#39;re out on the range in the vast West patrolling miles and miles of barbed-wire fence, but which in the crowded East&#0160;are&#0160;used mostly&#0160;for &quot;recreation,&quot; which&#0160;seems to involve tearing&#0160;up private&#0160;land (someone else&#39;s private land, that is) or government land,&#0160;making a whole lot of noise, and sometimes driving underage and illegally, and much too fast, on our usually peaceful &quot;unimproved&quot; dirt roads. No mufflers, no insurance, no license.</p>
<p>So&#0160;what&#39;s with &quot;the blessing of the ATVs?&quot;</p>
<p>St. Francis&#0160;has become the patron saint of environmentalists.&#0160;Is &quot;the blessing of the ATVs&quot; supposed to be a rejoinder to St. F and to ecological thinking?&#0160;Are we experiencing a&#0160;Christian sanction of anti-environmentalism?&#0160;&#0160;Or have these back-country bible churches long been blessing tractors and balers and pickups and backhoes, and I&#39;ve just not noticed?</p>
<p>WTF is going on?&#0160;Am I in the America I know and understand?&#0160; Why am I feeling&#0160;vertiginous?&#0160;</p>
<p>Would St. Francis have thanked his ATV?&#0160;&#0160;And if he did, would his ATV have wept?&#0160;&#0160;</p>

                                <p>For the new downtown apartment, we&#39;ve purchased a Sonos ZonePlayer. What does this oddly-named machine do?&#0160; It simply allows me to capture the signal of radio statios all over the world (through the internet connection), pipe them through the amplifier, and broadcast&#0160;them on our old but functional speakers.</p>
<p>Quite a step up in standard of living, especially since&#0160;over-the-air reception in our mountain town is severely compromised by the bumpy terrain</p>
<p>With&#0160;this new device, I can listen to classical music stations from all the capitols of Europe -- all over the planet, in fact. I can choose from among&#0160;5 or 6 crystal-clear stations dedicated entirely to opera, as well as a&#0160;few that specialize in the baroque period, or in chamber music, or piano.&#0160;There are also five Beatles stations, one of them&#0160;from Moscow!&#0160; Several &quot;big band&quot; stations. An all&#0160;Grateful Dead specialist beaming directly to me from&#0160;Connecticut. An all Bruce, all the time.</p>
<p>I&#0160;love the &quot;Paris Chanson&quot; station, twenty-four hours a day of Edith Piaf and friends,&#0160;from Tokyo.</p>
<p>But so far my favorite is&#0160;the all doo-wop station out of&#0160;Winter Haven, Florida, which, on demand, has the power to return me to my&#0160;teen-age years.&#0160;Just now I heard the Jacks&#39; plaintive, &quot;Why Don&#39;t You Write Me,&quot; a song which functioned, earlier in my life, as a personal anthem of&#0160;self-flagellation. And just at this moment,&#0160;a glorious version (and one that I didn&#39;&#39;t know) of the much-recorded &quot;The Glory of Love.&quot;&#0160; Aural bliss!&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>What&#39;s missing?&#0160; A good American roots (1920s and 1930s)&#0160;station. A station specializing in 1940s and 1950s black gospel -- definitely not &quot;contemporary gospel&quot; -- which, according to&#0160;AH, the world&#39;s expert, is called contemporary&#0160;because it is both&#0160;a &quot;con&quot; and &quot;temporary.&quot;&#0160; An all Gilbert and Sullivan station -- but perhaps that would be a gift too precious to imagine?</p>
<p>But if&#0160; there can be&#0160;eight&#0160;all-Elvis stations, shouldn&#39;t there be at least one that is all-Haydn, all the time?</p>
<p>And yet&#0160;I&#39;ve only begun to search.&#0160;&#0160;Who knows what other pleasures are out there in modern radioland?</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>We&#39;ve left the old place for a slick new condo.</p>
<p>It was a good ol&#39; house. A 1912 arts and crafts bungalow, probably built right out of the Sears, Roebuck catalog.&#0160; When we arrived, in 1973, she had been much abused:&#0160; some of her fir woodwork painted, some removed; the stained-glass window and the original prairie-style chandeliers long gone; &#0160;the handsome five-paneled living room window (prominent in the old photographs) replaced with an Eisenhower-era &quot;picture window,&quot; the original fireplace mantle superseded by a monstrosity in native stone; the brass registers covered with layers upon layer of paint, all those beautiful, then-fashionable pre-World War I built-in cabinets carted to a dump; the classic oak floors covered with wall-to-wall carpets.&#0160; Over the years, little by little, we did what we could for the old lady: insulated her walls and ceilings, replaced the primitive electrical wiring, stripped and refinished the woodwork and the registers, fabricated a &quot;new old&quot; mantle and &quot;new old&quot; bookshelves and cabinets, modernized the heating system, removed the asbestos, and (Boulder is hotter than it was a hundred years ago) retrofitted it with air-conditioning. We updated the kitchen -- brought the kitchen into the modern world.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>We left the old dear in far better condition than we found her.&#0160;Trust me on this.&#0160;</p>
<p>And let&#39;s not forget the&#0160;backyard garden.&#0160; Where there was once an incoherent jumble of thorny plants, there are now peonies both herbaceous and tree (Including my favorite, the&#0160;ever-larger&#0160;Joseph Rocks), irises bearded and Siberian, a variety of multiplying day lilies, climbing roses, a thriving&#0160;weigela, a Rose of Sharon, an abundance of clematis, and fences draped with thick healthy ivy. I&#39;m sorry to report that I never did get around to replacing the sticky, aggressive bear-berries.</p>
<p>Are we sad to leave?&#0160; A little, but only a little. We did well by the old house, and the house did well by us. We leave with a good conscience. But the time has come to move along. It&#39;s only an object, after all; a machine for living.&#0160;</p>
<p>So here we are now, in this bright shiny new apartment. Floor-to-celing windows. Fancy new appliances. A &quot;great room,&quot; a &quot;master bedroom.&quot; &#0160;An elevator.&#0160; It took almost a full month to move, but in that month we progressed from the turn of the previous century to the turn of the next.</p>
<p>And it feels right. It&#39;s OK.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>In the course of the Great Downsizing, a long-buried letter emerged from the &quot;archives.&quot;&#0160; It&#39;s from my long-gone father, and was written in December of 1974 on the occasion of his seventieth birthday.&#0160; A most fortuitous discovery -- inasmuch as I am now exactly the age that Pop&#0160;was on the day that he wrote to me.&#0160;&#0160;In his letter, Pop reports that he is taken aback by the person whom he has become.&#0160; Who is this guy&#0160;with the gray hair and&#0160;the &quot;little paunch&quot; who &quot;takes a day or two to recover from any physical activity&quot; and who &quot;finds events repeating themselves.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;In my mind,&quot; he says,&#0160;&quot;there is another me, a real me,&quot; who looks upon&#0160;this present self as a&#0160;&quot;stranger and an interloper.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#0160;appears as though my father&#39;s&#0160;self-image was lagging behind the reality of things</p>
<p>I hadn&#39;t remembered reading the letter --&#0160;it sat in a box for&#0160;thirty-five years -- but I&#39;m not surprised&#0160;by its content.&#0160; My father was&#0160;a strong, athletic, handsome man who&#0160;didn&#39;t&#0160;easily accept the&#0160;inevitable changes that come with septuagenarianism.&#0160; I&#0160;vividly remembering him saying, at eighty, &quot;I hate my body.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>I&#39;m with him, but only a part of the way.&#0160;Of course I&#39;m dismayed by the decline.&#0160;The gray hair, the thickened figure, yes.&#0160; The deterioration of memory, certainly.&#0160; But I don&#39;t share Pop&#39;s sense&#0160;that my real or better self is somewhere in the past. True that I can&#39;t jump as high -- yet, paradoxically,&#0160;I feel&#0160;more like myself, more comfortable&#0160;being me&#0160;now than ever before.&#0160; I&#39;m also more cheerful, on the whole -- although not at nighttime, when i sleep just as badly as ever my father did).&#0160;When&#0160;I look in the mirror, I don&#39;t see a face ravaged by age -- I see a face that now looks like it was always destined to&#0160;look and finally got there.&#0160; I have become more like&#0160;myself, so to speak, every year.&#0160;But how long until the&#0160;me-ness starts to plummet?&#0160;It must happen eventually. Time will tell.</p>
<p>My father used to say, &quot;You&#39;re&#0160;entitled to your&#0160;biblical three score and ten.&#0160; But after seventy, you&#39;re in extra innings.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;o which I would respond, &quot;In some sports,&#0160;extra innings is known as&#0160;sudden death.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>But hey, let&#39;s not forget that&#0160;the extra innings are frequently the most exciting part of the game.&#0160; &#0160;</p>

                                <p>&quot;I was born in 1920 in Bayonne. I had four older sisters.&#0160;When I was eleven, my mother died and my father disappeared.&#0160;I was taken in by my sister Jennie and her husband Jack.&#0160;She was eighteen, he was nineteen.&#0160;They raised me.&#0160;I graduated from Bayonne High School in 1938.&#0160;For years I&#0160;worked for an insurance company in New York City.&#0160;I started at&#0160;$5 a week.&#0160;I lived with Jack and Jennie in Bergenfield.&#0160;I took the bus and then a train and then a subway.&#0160;One of my girlfriends was seeing a guy, I can&#39;t remember his name, but he had a friend named Dave.&#0160;I married Dave in 1942.&#0160;He was sent overseas, I didn&#39;t see him for three years. In Oman, he was coming off a ship, they were shooting at them, he was wounded right here, if it had been an inch this way&#0160;I wouldn&#39;t have any children.&#0160;Dave&#39;s father had a business, Broadway Arcade on Broadway and 53rd Street.&#0160;Dave took over the business. He was a good mechanic. We had Madame Esmerelda the fortune teller.&#0160;Pinball, skiball.&#0160;In the basement were pool tables, we sublet the space.&#0160;It was a good business. We were famous for our nuts. We had two boys, Steve and Mark.&#0160; Steve ran the&#0160;Arcade after we moved to Florida, Mark is a food chemist. The Arcade is closed now -- the landlord kept raising the rent.&#0160;If we had bought the building I&#39;d be rolling in it.&#0160;Dave died at 68 in 1987.&#0160;I play mah-jong&#0160;once a week.&#0160;I go bowling once a week.&#0160;My team is in first place.&#0160;I take my sister Sophie with me but she can&#39;t see well enough to bowl.&#0160;She&#39;s ninety-six. So I&#39;ve been married, it&#39;s sixty-seven years.&#0160; Hard to believe.&quot;</p>

<p>It was horrible. I woke up with a nosebleed.</p>

                                <p>Last night -- another horrible dream. I was riding in the passenger car of an old-fashioned railroad and there was this big puffy guy, a smaller version of Oliver Hardy, who was brandishing a pistol. He was about to take hostages and shoot us folks. I grabbed his gun arm and wrestled him to the floor, but he was mighty strong. I called out to the other passengers, &quot;Help me!&quot;&#0160; Eventually, a couple of people came to my aid and started to twist his arm. Then I yelled out, &quot;Hit him!&quot; and a couple of people started to bang his head with books. Heavy books. Then I shouted &quot;Kick him!&quot; and a crowd gathered and started in with their feet. After a while, I realized that the gangster/terrorist/kidnapper was dead, but I continued to punch to and kick him. I woke up with my heart beating 180 or so.</p>
<p>It took a while to regain my equanimity, but it wasn&#39;t long before I returned to sleep. I dreamed that I was reporting the dream to my daughter and son-in-law and that they were totally uninterested and bored by my story. Which I took to be a critique of my ability with narrative.</p>
<p>So if I tell any more dreams, I&#39;ll abbreviate (as I did above, where I left out all sorts of interesting details) for fear of alienating my audience.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I&#39;m reading, or re-reading (what does it matter when it&#39;s been fifty years since the last go-around) Henry James&#39; <em>The Wings of the Dove. </em>Once again, I&#39;m variously stimulated, frustrated and infuriated. Has there ever been a writer who cries out to be parodied more than does Hank the J? Try to resist the impulse to make fun house mirrors of this representative, convoluted sentence.</p>
<p>&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&quot;Her welcome, her frankness, sweetness, sadness, brightness, her disconcerting poetry, as he made shift at moments to call it, helped as it was by the beauty of her whole setting and by the perception at the same time, on the observer&#39;s part, that this element gained from her, in a manner, for effect and harmony, as much as it gave -- her whole attitude had, to his imagination, meanings that hung about it, waiting upon her, hovering dropping and quavering forth again, like vague faint snatches, mere ghosts of sound, of old-fashioned melancholy music.&quot;</p>
<p>Let me guess that most of Dr. M.&#39;s loyal readers did not finish reading the quoted bit. They made a good faith attempt at the first few words, then whistled, threw up their metaphorical hands, and surrendered. Or if they did get all the way to the end of the sentence, they were certainly puzzled as to whether they had fully deciphered the Jamesian code. It&#39;s not that the sentence has no meaning, but is it worth a reader&#39;s time to parse and disentangle its many syntactic knots? Now, dear friends, just Imagine 539 small-print pages of prose, every paragraph on every page loaded with similar abstractions, assertions, modifications, withdrawals, subordinations, and equivocations. It&#39;s taxing. James takes it out of you, wears you down.</p>
<p>And therefore let me confess that a big chunk of my Henry James problem is that it&#39;s so damn hard to keep the ol&#39; eye on the ball when every sentence is so laborious to construe. In most novels, readers are pulled along by the plot. You might have trouble &quot;getting into it,&quot; but once you do, your attention is galvanized and you start to sail. In the case of HJ, there&#39;s very little plot, very little in the way of story. It&#39;s all hyper-subtle character analysis and teasing conversation. I can&#39;t speak for every reader, but I must admit that, while reading <em>Wings</em>, my mind frequently took flight. I regularly had to forcibly snap myself back to attention. It&#39;s anything but effortless to stay with the Jamester.&#0160;</p>
<p>But let me return to the exemplary sentence that I quoted above. The two key words are &quot;poetry&#39; (line 1) and &quot;meanings&quot; (line 5).&#0160; To paraphrase: she (i.e. James&#39;s character Millie Theale) has &quot;poetry&quot; and the situation has &quot;meanings.&quot; Underneath all the wobbly circumlocutions, that&#39;s kind of it.</p>
<p>But neither of these two crucial nouns gives much away. What sort of poetry does Millie &#39;have,&#39; you might ask?&#39; What particular &#39;meanings&#39; inhere in the situation? I myself want --crave, in fact -- further definition and explication. That&#39;s the novelist&#39;s job. If he wants to keep me happy and focused, he has to provide considerably more specificity that HJames deigns to supply. Words such as &quot;poetry&quot; and &quot;meanings&quot; don&#39;t constrain a reader;&#0160; rather, they are empty vessels into which I, or any other reader, can pour a variety of significations. The reader, i.e. me, is simply asked to do far too much of the work. I resent it, some of the time.&#0160;</p>
<p>Which takes me back to where I came in, in the 50s and 60s, when James was the king of the American canon -- or at least he was very much the boss in the Large Eastern University where I was a graduate student in literature. I don&#39;t know how my ever-so-civilized teachers managed it, but to appreciate and understand Henry James was framed not as a test of the author&#39;s creative skill, but as a test of the reader&#39;s sensitivity. James, it was confidently and regularly asserted, was subtle, delicate, loaded to the gills with the most exquisite sensibility. Did I, a kid from Coney Island Avenue, possess the sophistication, the tact, the sensitivity to grasp James superfine insights and his characters&#39; inclinations and velleities?</p>
<p>You know what? I didn&#39;t.I failed the test.</p>
<p>James portrays a world to which I could not easily relate. No one in <em>Wings of a Dove </em>works for living.The characters all live off their incomes, derived who knows how? When HJ has to bring two characters together, he has two choices and two choices only -- a dinner party or a chance encounter at a museum. Action?&#0160; Yes, the characters travel from one resort city to another. I&#39;m exaggerating just the tiniest bit. There is one character in <em>Wings </em>who has an occupation. Although we never see him at work, Merton Densher is a journalist. Which is precisely his problem. How can he be a suitable mate for Kate Croy if he has a job? How shockingly vulgar!&#0160;</p>
<p>It was a chore to take James seriously, especially in 1960 and especially for someone of my background. But then, not to take James seriously, not to understand him, was presumed to disqualify a guy from the serious study of literature. Which turned out not to be the case.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>But I&#39;m glad to say that I persevered with Wings. If I hadn&#39;t, I never would have re-read the infinitely splendid, magnificently tawdry piece of dialogue between Densher and Croy that brings Book 8 to a conclusion -- a conversation that&#39;s as well done as anything in English since WS lay down his quill in 1613.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>Coming soon to these pages: my Marcel Proust problem. Hint: way worse than my James problem.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Today&#39;s essaylet is being composed thirty thousand miles above ground, somewhere over, it appears from up here, Utah. I&#39;m flying on Southwest Airlines, the Trailways of the sky -- no frills, no food, no nothing. No passengers to speak of, either. Big ol&#39; three-quarter-empty jet plane. &quot;Nobody&#39;s flying nowadays,&quot; a stewardess told me. Chalk up another one for W.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">Air travel was in its florid adolescence when I was a boy. Propeller-driven planes flew over Flatbush every two minutes on their way to Idlewild (latterly JFK). But not with me or anyone I knew on board. I can&#39;t imagine who traveled by plane in those days -- probably only the Filthy Rich, certainly no one from the old neighborhood. In the late 1950s, I remember hearing rumors that there were Cornell undergraduates so wealthy that they regularly made the journey from NYC to Ithaca in the air (while I crawled upstate on a smelly Greyhound that left the Port Authority at midnight and made &quot;rest stops&quot; at East Stroudsburg, Scranton and somewhere in the southern tier before arriving on Aurora Street at 8 in the morning). My very first airline flight (it was on an expense account) took place in 1960 on a 12-passenger Mohawk from Ithaca to NYC. I was one wide-eyed gawker, let me tell you. There were very few flights for me during the 60s but by the 70s, I was more prosperous and air travel became semi-routine. Airlines had once been an upper-class preserve, and there was still some leftover graciousness, especially on the long haul to Europe. Menus and decent food and complimentary wine. But little by little, flights became more expensive and less elegant. Is it my imagination or have they magically shrunk the size of the seat? I recall a particularly bad run of luck when I was routinely placed in a middle seat, surrounded on both sides by plump widestance armrest-hogging smokers.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&#0160;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">The extinction of the cigarette is a plus, but it&#39;s hard to think of another improvement. Nothing to look forward to<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> air-travel-wise </span>but &quot;consolidation,&quot; fewer flights, smaller seats, negative frills, and grubbier planes. The great age of the airplane has gone the way of the steamship and the railroad. No more dress up, no more glamor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> Just as well, I think, or would be if the decline of service were reflected in a decline of prices. <br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&#0160;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">There&#39;s no </span>first class on Southwest<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span>-- although what would it matter to me? I never once sat in a first-class seat -- not a single time. In fact, in all honesty I must admit that I indulge a bit of class resentment that there should be any distinction of classes. Although I wouldn&#39;t mind if someone offered me something more gracious than one of those nasty mini-bags of over-salted pretzels -- the kind&#0160; you have to be an experienced safe cracker to break into.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I&#39;m jubilant that, come January 20, we&#39;ll once again have a president whose brain waves are dancing, who can bring an English sentence to completion, and who understands that America consists of much more than the Bushian roster of Fortune 500 executives, evangelicals, know-nothings, high school dropouts, gay-bashers, neocon imperialists, dittoheads, gun nuts, military contractors, upward redistributionists, fetus-worshipers and health insurance profiteers. The new president will abandon the present system of government (trust the market -- capitalism is always right!) and return us to the world of evidence and reason. Quite the revolution, isn&#39;t it?&#0160; And speaking of revolutions, the new president, if you haven&#39;t heard, is black (or to be more accurate, black-and-white, which is this country still means, in defiance of all logic, black). How splendid to bury a long-standing racial taboo. Nothing makes me prouder than that we&#39;ve elected an African-American, Kenyan-Kansan president. With a brain.&#0160;</p>
<p>The election of Barack Obama brought me back to hometown Brooklyn of sixty-one years ago. I was eight years old on April 15, 1947, when Jackie Robinson &quot;broke the color barrier.&quot; It was Jackie on first or Jackie running the bases that alerted me to the idea that I lived in a conflict-riven society. We (family, friends, neighbors, writers for the <em>Brooklyn Eagle</em>) were enthusiastic about Jackie, but there were those reactionaries and bigots in other cities who were convinced that their world had just come to an end. No question but that the advent of Jackie Robinson was the major formative political experience of my early childhood -- even though it was decades before I could fully appreciate its cosmic significance.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>In my mind, and I think in the minds of others of my generation, there&#39;s a direct line from Jack Roosevelt Robinson to Barack Hussein Obama. Two smart, skilled performers; two ferocious but very cool competitors. Two very courageous gentlemen.Two barriers busted all to smithereens.Two milestones in American history. Never the latter if hadn&#39;t hadn&#39;t been for the former.&#0160; &#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Jackie&#39;s fabulously athletic body fell apart early and he died young of diabetes. He was born in 1918, and if he had been blessed with longevity, he would have been ninety years old today.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>Wouldn&#39;t that have been a pretty picture -- Jackie Robinson, frail, gray, stooped, leaning on his cane, but still in possession of that marvelous knowing glint in his coal black eyes, sitting right there on the platform in front of the United States Capitol, a tear on his cheek while Barack Obama holds up his hand and swears to protect and defend the constitution of the United States of America. I see it oh so clearly in my mind&#39;s eye. It gladdens my fond old heart.&#0160;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>An &quot;orphan precinct&quot; is one that lacks a regular committee and chair. We have one nearby, and I&#39;ve been recruited to walk the neighborhood and deliver GOTV flyers to registered Dems. I&#39;m natively shy and I hate knocking on doors, but there are votes to be had and lordy-mercy don&#39;t we need every single one. The neighborhood in question is near to the university, high-density, undergraduates mostly -- 98% of the people on my lists are under 25 years old. But the squalor! Here are these beautiful old 1910s and 1920s arts and crafts bungalows, or the remnants of them, and they&#39;ve been allowed to go to seed, or way past seed -- bricks unpointed, wood unpainted, porches sagging, screen doors ripped and hanging off.&#0160; And then the beer cans, the cigarette butts, the newspapers that have been decaying in their plastic sleeves for half a year. Garbage strewn everywhere, foul odors. It&#39;s disgusting, an affront to the decent citizenry. Who are these children?&#0160; How can they live in such cisterns of filth?</p>
<p>I was working myself up into quite a fit until I started to think about the conditions in which I lived when I was in college, back there in the just-barely-post-diluvian 1950s. I didn&#39;t drink alcohol, even then, or smoke cigarettes, but I lived amongst as much dirt and disorder as any modern undergraduate could manage. When I concentrate my mind, I remember the floor of my room littered with every garment I possessed. Every sock and every shirt grey with dirt, sweat, food droppings. I remember an ancient tattered rug that was not swept or vacuumed a single time in two consecutive semesters. I remember a bathtub that was so foul that it was shunned by the roaches. And am I right (my apartment mate Otis J. Brown might be able to confirm this) that we found two hundred empty Coke bottles strewn around Terry Cannon&#39;s room <u>after</u> he had cleaned up and moved out. And also that our back stairs were littered with a thousand dog droppings, around which we maneuvered in and out, not thinking that such pollution was a circumstance that we might think to remedy.</p>
<p>Is it possible that these degenerate kids are no filthier than their venerable grandfathers? Gives one pause. Well, who cares, really, just so long as they get their pathetic drunken butts in gear and vote for Obama.</p>
<p>Incidentally, for anyone who cares: I&#39;m now compulsively neat and cleanly.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>My father smoked cigars and later a pipe;&nbsp; my mother smoked Lucky Strikes -- lots of them.&nbsp; When I was a boy, the air in our house was a blue-gray haze. I believe that my mother smoked throughout her four pregnancies. Why shouldn't she have?&nbsp; The tobacco industry advertised that smoking was good for you.&nbsp; There wasn't &quot;a cough in a carload.&quot;&nbsp; Doctors smoked Camels and were paid to testify that smoking was harmless all the while corporate leaders knew about but suppressed evidence of fetal damage, heart disease, and lung cancer.&nbsp; Cigarettes were the perfect product:&nbsp; &quot;make it for a penny, sell it for a dollar, and it's addictive as hell.&quot;</p>

<p>I tried to smoke -- I stole my mother's cigarettes and lit up in the cellar.&nbsp; It was horrible, nasty, and disgusting.&nbsp; I couldn't do it.</p>

<p>Smoking was omnipresent in those days.&nbsp; Foul odors and brimful ashtrays were the norm.&nbsp; In my first year in college, I was assigned a roommate who smoked constantly.&nbsp; I hated it, but there was no recourse.&nbsp; Professors smoked while lecturing and students, naturally, followed suit, so classrooms were distractingly polluted.&nbsp; Smokers had everything their way and dissenters were a prissy minority.&nbsp; At dinner parties, guests would bring their cigarettes to the table.&nbsp; Is there anything more odious than a tray of smelly ashes at the festive board?</p>

<p>In the 70s, I got up the courage to place a modest, hesitant sign on our front door:&nbsp; &quot;Please no tobacco.&quot;&nbsp; But sometimes guests would smoke anyway, unwilling to believe&nbsp; that a hospitable person would try to restrict a commonly accepted right.&nbsp; I was regularly outraged by the insensitivity of my friends.</p>

<p>But little by little, customs and laws began to change.&nbsp; It took lots of hard work by anti-smoking lobbyists and organizers.&nbsp; Many lawsuits. Now it's hard to remember that until recently airplanes had smoking and non-smoking sections -- although in fact, the air stunk no matter where you sat.&nbsp; As did restaurants, buses, arenas, theaters, offices.</p>

<p>Nowadays, no one that I know would dream of smoking indoors; certainly not in someone's home.&nbsp; Cigarette smoking has become a shameful addiction.&nbsp; The change in attitude toward tobacco has been one of the few unequivocal social betterments of my lifetime&nbsp; -- but too late for those dear friends and family members who died far too painfully and far too early. </p>

<p>And what about those knots of poor proud deluded newly-addicted teen-agers?&nbsp; The increase in tobacco use world-wide?&nbsp; And those fat pompous corporate execs, still lying through their shiny teeth, who deserve to be strung up by their thumbs?&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Yesterday, in a long-buried collection of file folders, I found some papers of my father&#39;s that were written during those last painful years when he was a widower. Some of the pages comprise a &quot;commonplace&quot; book, the theme of which is, &#39;why am I still alive when my wife is dead?&#39;&#0160; In addition to the lamentations, there are two anomalous paragraphs of reminiscence&#0160; -- constituting the sum of my father&#39;s known autobiographical writings. For the benefit and edification of my own children and grandchildren and family, I now put these writings on the record.</p>
<p>My father writes:&#0160; &quot;My maternal grandmother was a thin, almost gaunt&#0160; woman about 5 ft 5 inches tall. Although I am sure she loved all her children &amp; grandchildren, I cannot remember her ever showing any overt sign of affection. We children always knew when grandma was to visit us. My mother would go into a frenzy of housecleaning. All the curtains would be washed and re-hung; the kitchen floors scrubbed and the silverware washed and polished. Her [i.e. my father&#39;s grandmother&#39;s] face was unwrinkled, the skin drawn tightly. Her most dominant feature was her eyes, piercing, direct, demanding. There would be Grandma, wearing a little hat, glancing around the room while she slowly took off her gloves. If she was satisfied with what she saw, she would give a little nod as if to say, &#39;well done.&#39; We would all relax.&quot;</p>
<p>A historical footnote:&#0160; my grandparents came to this continent in about 1895 and the events that my father remembers are all turn-of-the-century and pre-WWI.</p>
<p>Until I uncovered this paragraph, I thought my grandparents came to North America on their own.&#0160; I did not know that they were accompanied by this formidable great-grandmother. Although she herself was long gone when I came on the stage, I certainly encountered those piercing black eyes in other faces, my father&#39;s in particular.&#0160; I wonder why my father (who was born in 1904) never mentioned his grandmother to me -- she certainly made an impression that lasted to the end of his life. Come to think of it, why the heck was my family so entirely tight-lipped about their ancestry?</p>
<p>But wait.&#0160; There&#39;s more.</p>
<p>&quot;My grandparents (that would be the ferocious grandmother and her equally unknown-to-me husband), had 5 children, 4 daughters and one son. There were born to their children in a space of 10 years, 18 grandchildren.&#0160; Each one of these children were delivered at home. My grandmother attended every one of these births.&#0160; About 2 weeks before the expected date of birth, my grandmother would appear wearing her little hat and gloves &amp; carrying a small satchel; she immediately took charge of the household. The expectant mother would be freed of all household obligations.&quot;</p>
<p>From this evidence it would appear that in addition to his three siblings (Max, Sol, and Molly), my father had fourteen cousins on his mother&#39;s side of the family.&#0160; Why didn&#39;t I know about them?&#0160; Why did I never meet a single one? Or even hear their names?&#0160; Or the names of their progeny, if there were any?</p>
<p>Also in my father&#39;s hand, scribbled in a corner of the paper, is a calculation:&#0160; Mom - 4, Manya - 6, Nadya - 3, Mary - 2, Maris (or Saris, or Norris) -3.&#0160; And then the sum:&#0160; 18.</p>
<p>So, children and children&#39;s children and collateral descendants, you now understand a piece of the family history.</p>
<p>And readers:&#0160; if there&#39;s anyone out there in internetland who had a strong, perhaps dictatorial great or great-great or great-great-great grandmother who came to assist at births armed with a satchel, a little hat and memorable black eyes (first name unknown but surnamed Hessel), and who knows that his or her ancestry includes a woman whose maiden name was Mary Hessel or Manya Hessel or Nadya Hessel, or if there&#39;s someone who&#39;s descended from Noris or Moris or Saris Hessel, hey, cuz, take a moment and add a comment to this entry and I&#39;ll get right back to you.&#0160; &#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>My friend Otis Jefferson Brown reminds me of the crushing sports-and-morals tragedy of our joint childhoods. It all took place in 1950/51, when I was a creeping like snail to sixth grade in P. S. 217 and Otis, a child of Bay Ridge, was trudging his shining morning face to P.S. 102. Our guys, our local heroes, the CCNY basketball team, won both of the major basketball tournaments, the NIT as well as the NCAA. The city -- New York City, especially Brooklyn&#0160; -- was electric with excitement. Headlines, victory parades, and demonstrations in all the neighborhoods.&#0160;</p>
<p>The twin wins -- it never had happened before and will never happen again -- were great events in the public sphere but of even greater moment in our 9th Street home.&#0160; Back in the 1920s, my father had attended CCNY for a year, but like so many of the sons of impoverished immigrants, had to drop out to help put potatoes and black radishes on the family table. While at City, he had played on the freshman basketball team. Would he have made the varsity? Who can tell? He was a strong man, a fine natural athlete, very graceful in his movements even into his 70s, and very serious about basketball.</p>
<p>His coach had been Nat Holman (one of the earliest stars of professional basketball), and Nat was still the City College coach twenty-five years later. So whenever CCNY played, everything in our family came to a halt, and we all gathered around the wooden Philco to listen as my father&#39;s team went down to the wire against Bradley or Kentucky or Toledo. My father, generally a restrained man, was as partisan and as jubilant as I ever knew him to be. Not only were the victories a fulfillment of his own hopes, but they were all achieved by a bunch of local players -- Jews and &quot;Negroes&quot; from the Bronx and Brooklyn who, in those days, would not have been welcome at most of the big basketball powers. Ed Roman and Ed Warner and Irvin Dambrot and Normie Mager and Floyd Lane were household names as familiar and as admired as those of Koufax and Campanella.&#0160;</p>
<p>It was the very next year that it all blew up in our faces. The CCNY players, or many of them, confessed to taking bribes from the gamblers and bookies and to shaving points and managing the spread. There were indictments, &quot;perp walks,&quot; headlines, indignant editorials. O the shame!</p>
<p>My father was devastated. Although in size he was just a scrappy guard, in person he was a tower of rectitude, and it was beyond his ken that our guys, even poor guys who desperately needed cash, would compromise their integrity and their futures for a few bucks.</p>
<p>My father turned the disgrace into a morality play. Every day, for years it seems in retrospect, I listened to still another passionate sermon about keeping to the straight and narrow. (Not that there was anyone in the world who would pay me to miss a shot; I could miss shots on my own. But I knew what he meant.)&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>I&#39;ve now read Charles Rosen&#39;s <em>Scandals of &#39;51, how the gamblers almost killed college basketball </em>[New York, 1971]). It&#39;s a shoddy, melodramatic, disheartening book, but it does help to put things in perspective. Rosen makes it clear that there was more than a little American nativist glee about taking CCNY and its upstart culture down a peg. It was sad to read that players from many other colleges were also indicted (I hadn&#39;t remembered), but discouraging to learn that their defenders were happy to extol heartland values and to scapegoat the corruption onto big city immigrant depravity. It was also sad to be reminded that the only basketball player who served hard time was Sherman White, the biggest, the best, and the blackest of all the athletes. Nor was it pleasant to discover that although there were apparently point-shavers at St. Johns, a Catholic college, DA Frank Hogan brought no indictments because the evidence against the Red Men was &quot;inadvertently&quot; destroyed.</p>
<p>The events were a blight on my basketball-loving childhood. And still a great sadness after all these years. But I must say that we, as a family, engineered a strong comeback. It was only a few years after the scandals that one of those 13&quot; black and white TVs with the rabbit ears made its first appearance in our home. And along with the Zenith came the NBA. I think that my father was on perpetual alert for signs of malfeasance, but our faith in the game and in humanity was restored by a new set of New York heroes: Harry Gallatin, Connie Simmons, Carl Braun, Dick McGuire, Bud Palmer, Vince Boryla, Sweetwater Clifton, Max Zaslofsky.&#0160; &#0160;</p>

Was it heart attack, aneurysm, or stroke?&#0160; Bob had taken early retirement a few months ago to spend more time with his ladylove, from whom he had been forced to live apart by circumstances. His sudden collapse was untimely, but not more so than the death of Edward Peter, who had a bad reaction to a flu shot, or Rubin, who drowned while fishing, or JB, whose testicular cancer went to his lungs, or Phyl, whose stealth ovarian cancer finished her after nine dreadful months, or my brother Gene, dead thirty seconds from the onset of whatever it was that leveled him. It&#39;s all happening much too frequently and and much too fast. Nowadays, I read the obituaries first and I keep my one respectable suit, my funeral suit, cleaned and pressed. I do not like this trend among folks of my own years. &#0160; &#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>We&#39;re still cleaning out and throwing away (as I reported a couple of days ago).&#0160;Today I discovered, in amongst a small cache of books that I inherited from my father, a volume of poems called <em>Earthbound. </em>I&#39;d never heard of the poet, Helene Mullins, but I traced her via a 2001 <em>The New York Times </em>obituary. &quot;Helene Mullins Johnson, a poet, died on Oct. 26 at her home in Manhattan. She was 92 years old. She died of congestive heart failure. Mrs. Johnson first had her poems published in <em>The Pagan</em>, a Greenwich Village magazine, in the 1920s. After Thornton Wilder introduced her to his publisher, Harper&#39;s published her first novel, <em>Convent Girl,</em> and her first volume of poems, <em>Earthbound,</em> in 1929. Her final collection of poems, <em>Mirrored Walls,</em> was published in 1970.&#0160;There are no survivors.&quot;&#0160;Google provided me with another couple of facts.&#0160;Helene Mullins was born in 1899 in New Rochelle, New York, and educated in &quot;convent boarding schools.&quot; In 1935, she was so severely injured in an automobile accident that she lay unconscious for three weeks.&#0160;</p>
<p>And also: the library nearest to me that owns a copy of <em>Earthbound </em>is the Dakota State University, in Madison, South Dakota, which is precisely 502 miles from where I sit.&#0160;</p>
<p>The poems are, in my view, brimming with pre-Raphaelite fervor. The precursoress whom Mullins most resembles is Christina Rossetti, though there&#39;s an occasional dash of Ernest Dowson, and every once in a while, a gesture borrowed from the early Yeats. The poems are as intense and agonized and spiritual as Rossetti&#39;s, and were, even in their own time, composed in an extremely old-fashioned style.&#0160;</p>
<p>What does the world offer a hard-working but not brilliant poet who was clearly ambitious and tense, and who poured all her strength and feeling into her writing? There she was, a young woman fleeing the convent and shocking her family by taking up residence in Greenwich Village, where she lived near Thornton Wilder and other 1920s gentlemen of literature and where she frequented the irreligious offices of <em>The Pagan</em>. I mourn for the struggle and yearning and effort that went into those long-forgotten poems.&#0160; And which, all said and done, earned her little beyond a&#0160; perfunctory obituary in the <em>Times</em>.</p>
<p>But what in the ever-living universe was this volume doing in my staid father&#39;s library?&#0160; It&#39;s implausible that he could have found anything empathetic in such poems as &quot;St. Theresa&quot; and &quot;The Boy Christ.&quot;&#0160; Especially since <em>Earthbound </em>was the only volume of &quot;contemporary&quot; poetry that he seems to have possessed. In 1929, when <em>Earthbound</em> hit the streets, my father would have been a buoyant, studious young fellow of twenty-five<em> -- </em>a diligent bachelor law clerk with still a year or so to go before he would find Lilly.&#0160;Helen Mullins herself was just thirty years old.&#0160;Is there a story here?&#0160;Am I missing something?</p>
<p>There are no clues; not even a single pencil mark. Nothing from one end of the book to the other. Something doesn&#39;t compute.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I&#39;m not a person who cares terribly about material objects. Some of the evidence: I&#39;ve now written two hundred and fifty essaylets on this blague, and nary a one of them took as its subject a purchase or a possession.</p>
<p>What I&#39;ve read, what I&#39;ve thought, where I&#39;ve traveled, people I&#39;ve known, yes; what I own, or bought, or didn&#39;t buy, no.</p>
<p>But in these last weeks, we&#39;re in the process of discarding and giving away while we prepare to move to much smaller quarters. The things we own, and there are too many of them, have been front and center. The general rule here is, &quot;when in doubt, throw it out.&quot;&#0160; But yesterday, I didn&#39;t throw away, I packed and preserved.&#0160;</p>
<p>We have two sets of crockery. The first was part of the 1960 wedding loot. It&#39;s a perfectly fine set of dishes, and we&#39;ve used it on formal occasions for half a century. It&#39;s Franciscan china, very 1950s abstract-modernist in design. Entirely sufficient. Why, then, is there a second and redundant set?</p>
<p>Because when I was a boy, my folks owned a handful of pieces of flowery Charles Field Haviland china that came out of storage once a year, at Thanksgiving, to eke out the festive board.&#0160; I thought, and still think, that these plates were simply beautiful. In addition, because they were so seldom used, they had very specific and warm Thanksgiving-y associations -- food and drink and laughter and conviviality&#0160; -- that were once-a-year events in our not-particularly-sociable household. When the folks died, I inherited the Haviland remnants:&#0160; a few hand-painted plates, some of them chipped; a number of saucers and a few very delicate coffee cups. A decade ago, at age sixty, feeling nostalgic, I decided to make it my business to fill in the set. It wasn&#39;t easy. I located a couple of cups at an antique show and by mail-order acquired some plates from a &quot;replacement warehouse&quot; in Georgia. But one day, browsing Ebay, I discovered on auction a complete -- serving pieces and all -- set of dishes in what I had come to think of as &quot;my pattern.&quot; I bid, I was nervous, I won. The design exceeded my hopes. It&#39;s a handsome bunch of crockery and it&#39;s now standard for our occasional parties and our annual Thanksgiving. We&#39;ll carry the Haviland with us to the new home.</p>
<p>What to do with the old? The next generation expresses utter and uniform indifference; the generation that follows is far too young to care. Nor can we sell or discard -- there are just too many fond memories. But here&#39;s what I&#39;m thinking. Suppose one of the offspring comes to feel, as I did at sixty, an odd longing for objects that carry familial resonance. That set of Franciscan china might become valuable to them. I don&#39;t mean monetarily valuable, but genuinely valuable, in the ways that matter.&#0160;</p>
<p>So I&#39;ve carefully packed the crockery. It&#39;s multi-newspapered and double-boxed. If not preserved for all eternity, it&#39;s certainly packed in a way that will outlive every member of my age cohort.&#0160; It&#39;s labeled. It will go into the &quot;storage unit&quot; in the basement of the new condo. It will sit there for an unpredictable but not infinite length of years.</p>
<p>We&#39;ll let someone else decide whether to retain or discard.&#0160; &#0160;</p>

Here’s a small sample of the novels that Dr. M has reported upon: <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2007/02/what_we_read_in.html">I the Jury</a>, <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2007/01/more_on_king_so.html">King Solomon&#39;s Mines</a>, <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2006/01/what_we_read_in_2.html">The Caine Mutiny</a>, <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2006/01/what_we_read_in.html">Blackboard Jungle</a>, <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2007/03/what_we_read_in.html">The Amboy Dukes</a>, <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2006/02/what_we_read_in.html">Lord of the Flies</a>, <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2006/02/what_we_read_in_1.html">Catcher in the Rye</a>, <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2007/04/what_we_read_in_1.html">Scaramouche</a>. It’s quite the roster, isn&#39;t it, of time-sensitive material.</p>
<p>Some of these novels have worn astonishingly well. Others are merely astonishing: what in the world could I (or the drab Eisenhower-era sensibility, for that matter) have possibly found worthwhile in most of these colossally dated and inartistic fictions?</p>
<p>To extend my anti-nostalgia, I’ve now tackled, for the first time in more than fifty years, a novel that enthralled the heck out of me back then. It’s Nordhoff and Hall’s <em>Mutiny on the Bounty</em>, first published in 1932 but widely read at least through the 1950s. Why was I so infatuated? Certainly not because of the novelists’ skill. The story of the tyrannical Captain Bligh, the Byronic rebel Fletcher Christian, the mutiny, the open boat, and the settlement of Pitcairn offered the opportunity to engage all the important themes: family, power, sex and love, religion, sanity, rebellion, technology, colonialism and cultural conflict. But N and H fell far miles short of the mark – not only did they write gawky sentences, but they also left gaping holes in the plot, created disappointingly shallow characters, and failed to explore the opportunities for thoughtful commentary. The novel is swift and superficial and clumsy.&#0160; It’s not for all time; it’s for the supermarket checkout stand.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there’s little mystery as to why the novel captured this Brooklynites&#39;s youthful fancy. What adolescent would demand artistry from a novel that is awash with exoticism, romance, and sex?</p>
<p>Let us consider the following piece of reheated anthropological observation. Midshipman Byam (the story is cunningly told through the eyes of a juvenile narrator) attends a Tahitian entertainment at which young women perform a dance “believed by the Indians (i.e. Tahitians) to ensure the fertility of the crops.”</p>
<p><span style="color: #0066cc;">The dress of the dancers consisted of no more than a wreath of flowers and green leaves about their waists, and the dance itself, in which they stood in two lines of three, face to face, was of a nature so unbelievably wanton that no words could convey the least idea of it. </span></p>
<p>“No more than a wreath of flowers about their waists?”&#0160; Does that mean…?&#0160; Holy smoke. “Unbelievably wanton?&quot;&#0160; Exactly how wanton is that?&#0160; What in the censorious world did these young ladies actually do?&#0160; They didn’t…?&#0160; &#0160;No, they couldn&#39;t. “No words could convey….”&#0160;</p>
<p>What grand openings did N and H leave to be filled by an inexperienced but lascivious imagination!</p>
<p>And how does Midshipman Byam deal with such provocations?&#0160; Good luck for him as well as for all the randy young readers who identified with his circumstances.&#0160; Byam takes as his eager concubine a young Tahitian woman. “Slenderly and strongly made, in the first bloom of young womanhood, and with her magnificent dark hair unbound, Maimiti made a picture worth traveling far to behold.”</p>
<p>OK, so I fell for it.&#0160; Sure it was contrived and manipulative.&#0160; But I was thirteen or so years old, living in concrete, subwayed, bepigeoned Flatbush where young ladies danced not in wreaths of flowers but in stiff and forbidding crinolines. Exactly how many fertility ceremonies had I attended?&#0160; I was exoticism-deprived.</p>
<p>I’m just slightly embarrassed to admit that I did not just read <em>Mutiny on the Bounty </em>and call it a day.&#0160; Not at all.&#0160; Instead, I read everything that I could find about Bligh and Christian and Pitcairn Island and even about Norfolk Island, where the mutineers relocated after Pitcairn became overpopulated. I became something of an expert on the geography of these islands. I also took to reading about nineteenth-century sailing vessels, and though an arrant land-lubber, I could accurately, in those days, define taffrail, yardarm, orlop, lanyard, hawse-hole, gimbal, lanyard, poop, mizzen.</p>
<p>Nor was it all erotic displacement. Although I began with Nordhoff and Hall, I later read Cook and Bouganville and eventually moved on to the writings of Mead and Malinowski and others in that pioneering generation of anthropologists.&#0160; Of course I didn&#39;t understand much and have long forgotten what I read -- but neither Maimiti &quot;with magnificent dark hair unbound&quot; nor that unbelievably wanton ceremony ever entirely evaporated from my susceptible, impressionable young brain.&#0160;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I can&#39;t recommend Marion Meade&#39;s <em>The Unruly Life of Woody Allen</em> (New York, 2000), which I too hastily snatched off the library shelf. Written at the tabloid height of the Woody-Mia-Soon-yi fracas, it masquerades as a biography but in truth it&#39;s nothing more than scandalmongery.&#0160; <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 3.75pt; margin-right: 3.75pt;"><span style="color: black; font-family: &#39;Trebuchet MS&#39;;">Before it gets down in the dirt, however, <em>Unruly Life </em>offers<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>a quick summary of Allen’s life, a matter of which I was largely ignorant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>Of course I knew that Allen was a Brooklyn boy who grew up in the old neighborhood. Allen Koenigsberg attended P. S. 99 on East 10 Street near Avenue K (where my cousin Louie was also a student). In addition, I knew, from Louie, that P. S. 99&#39;s principal was Eudora Fletcher and that, in the very inventive chameleon movie, Woody gave Ms. Fletcher&#39;s name to the psychiatrist who takes Zelig under her wing.&#0160; </span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 3.75pt; margin-right: 3.75pt;"><span style="color: black; font-family: &#39;Trebuchet MS&#39;;">But cousin Louie did not know, or did not bother to tell me, that Allen was a frequent patron of the Kent Theater on Coney Island Avenue and that it&#39;s rumored that it was at the Kent that the interior scenes in <em>The Purple Rose of Cairo</em> were filmed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> I&#39;ve seen <em>Purple Rose </em></span>recently and if it wasn&#39;t the Kent, it sure looks like the Kent of my memory. The Kent, along with its sister theater, the Leader, was one of my own <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2006/09/the_leader_thea.html">childhood</a> <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2007/04/what_we_read_in_1.html">haunts</a>. In fact, it was my father’s aunt Manya, substitute cashier, who sometimes sat in the box office and took my quarter.&#0160; <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 3.75pt; margin-right: 3.75pt;"><span style="color: black; font-family: &#39;Trebuchet MS&#39;;">It was not at the Kent but at the Jewel Theater on Kings Highway that Allen encountered Ingmar Bergman for the first time. Well, not exactly Bergman himself. It was Harriet Andersson disrobing in <em>Summer with Monika </em>that seems to have caught Allen&#39;s attention.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> <em>Unruly Life </em></span>reports that Allen sat “with eyes bulging” to watch this and other early Bergman films.&#0160; </span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 3.75pt; margin-right: 3.75pt;"><span style="color: black; font-family: &#39;Trebuchet MS&#39;;">Allen’s protruding orbs brought to mind the impact that those shocking 1950s Scandinavian films had on the days of my early adolescence. It was at the Kent (aunt Manya must not have been on duty that day) that I once watched a Danish film in which there was a very brief flash of a woman in naked silhouette. All I can remember is that I sat through to watch the picture again -- it might even have been a double feature -- and that by the time the silhouette appeared a second time, my poor bladder was so swollen (I was afraid to leave my seat for fear of missing the moment) that it was about to rupture. How embarrassing it would have been to die of an aneurysm of the urinary tract simply to catch a glimpse of Harriet Andersson or one of her friends.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 3.75pt; margin-right: 3.75pt;"><span style="color: black; font-family: &#39;Trebuchet MS&#39;;">In the 1950s, naked bodies were simply not on view.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> Never at all, at least not in my slice of the universe. </span>I doubt that anyone from the post-Vietnam, post-sexual-revolution generation can imagine how nude-deprived were those severely repressed years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> Bodies, women&#39;s bodies, were so rare and mysterious that a brief and evanescent flash of shadowed skin, circa 1953, could remain in the memory for more than fifty years. </span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 3.75pt; margin-right: 3.75pt;"><span style="color: black; font-family: &#39;Trebuchet MS&#39;;">Which is why I retain the warmest feelings for Coney Island Avenue&#39;s Kent Theater. </span></p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>From 1965 to 1969 we lived on Manhattan&#39;s Upper West Side. Now we&#39;ve returned for a month-long visit. In days of yore, we were the busy young parents pushing our baby carriage down Broadway. Now forty years more &#39;mature, we step aside as nannies maneuver the twins (without question there are both more nannies and more twins) around and past us.</p>
<p>And the eternal West Side -- has it also matured? Certainly it&#39;s a more prosperous neighborhood and a more crowded one. With scores of giant high-rise apartment houses added in the intervening years, it&#39;s become even more densely populated. Paradoxically, it&#39;s also safer. In the 1960s, received wisdom stated that to wander onto 85th Street or onto Columbus Avenue after dark was to risk death or at least a good mugging. Now the area is peaceful morning, noon and night, and newly-fashionable Columbus Avenue houses dozens of trendy ethnic restaurants. Forty years ago, it was foolish to venture across Central Park to the aristocratic East Side, where, it was rumored, there lived people who were fair-skinned and blond. Some areas of the Park, like The Ramble, were famously dangerous and were visited only by those who were itching for action. Now, single women jog without the least concern. We took advantage of the new freedom by taking frequent jaunts to the row of fabulous museums along Fifth Avenue. (In the 1960s, museums were difficult for West Siders to access but admission was free; today, they&#39;re easy to reach but the ticket prices are staggering.) In the good old days, West Side street-corners were gathering points for enterprising drug-dealers. On this visit, I didn&#39;t spot a single dealer or a single transaction. Moreover, the neighborhood used to be thick with policemen on patrol; this time, police are scarce and apparently unnecessary. Why the improvement in public safety? In a word, money. Only the rich can now afford to live on the Upper West Side, and rich people don&#39;t need to knock you down and empty your wallet. They have other fish to fry.&#0160;</p>
<p>There&#39;s a new feature of transportation: droves of briefcase-bearing suit-wearers are shuttled Wallstreetway in luxurious &quot;private cars.&quot; Meanwhile, the subway is as efficient and as filthy as ever, but nowadays we pay not with tokens but with &quot;metro cards.&quot; The New York Times, then 10 cents, is now $1.25; it has fewer columns, a larger font, and poorer writing. More changes: in yesteryear, a man shouting in public was very likely a paranoid schizophrenic; now a noisy talker has a gimmick in his ear and a cell phone and he&#39;s doing nothing more lunatic than snapping up undercapitalized mortgages.&#0160;</p>
<p>Dogs, here as elsewhere, are horribly indulged. One day we peeked into a &quot;pet exercise&quot; gymnasium and later were amused by a well-appointed van labeled &quot;Pet Limousine.&quot; Although there are many more curs, there are fewer piles of canine poopery on the sidewalks; most dog-walkers make use of plastic bags. Thank you, dog-walkers.</p>
<p>Affordable supermarkets have disappeared and there are only specialty food shops where the prices are beyond astronomical. But where do the waitresses, cooks, cleaning ladies, nannies, cashiers, shop girls, bank tellers, kioskers, subway maintenance men, bus drivers, janitors, and policemen shop?&#0160; Where, in fact, do they live? Not in the neighborhood; not since the entire West Side went condo.</p>
<p>It&#39;s still a polyglot world, but there&#39;s much less Spanish and a lot more Russian, Chinese, Hindi and Arabic.</p>
<p>More novelties: there&#39;s a Duane Reade (sometimes two) on every street and there&#39;s a second crowded Starbucks visible from the Starbucks where you sit poring over your wireless laptop and nursing your gigantico skinny dry vanilla latte. In the 1960s, there were seven movie theaters within walking distance -- including the New Yorker and the Thalia, the mother churches of cinema worship. Now, there are none -- nor even a single dvd rental store. It&#39;s all Netflix and downloads.</p>
<p>There&#39;s been a phenomenal growth of personal services: not just the barbershops and hairdressers of old, but also whole galaxies of nail care shops. Who could have imagined that in the new millennium, fingernails would become the cornerstone of the economy? An economy of which I&#39;m not a part; my nail care consists of occasionally biting off a sliver of stray keratin and taking a cosmetic nibble or two at the paronychium. I don&#39;t believe I&#39;ve spent a nickel, lifetime, on my nails, nor do I intend to do so. Nope, no manicures, nor pedicures, nor medicures (what the heck is a medicure?) nor massages nor aromatherapy for me. Nor will I have my ears candled (a process that one medical website calls &#39;useless and dangerous&quot;) or my eyebrows threaded or any part of my body, public or private, waxed. It appears that every facial feature and every organ has an entire industry dedicated to its hygiene and its remediation. Is the upper West Side experiencing an outbreak of good health? Or a triumph of narcissism?</p>
<p>One final observation: since we lived here, many expensively-architected fancy-shmancy private schools have appeared. Meanwhile, public schools have been allowed to slide further into poverty. Ugly, concrete block buildings surrounded by chainlink fence and razor wire -- not temples of learning, but prisons.The gap between rich and poor, evident then, has become a chasm. Manhattan is safer and more livable than it was (at least for the prosperous), but it will not be truly healed until its citizenry moves beyond &quot;private wealth and public squalor.&quot;</p>
