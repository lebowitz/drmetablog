                                <p>Today it was my assignment to pick up the five-year-old granddaughter at the local Montessori school. We walked home together.&nbsp; It's a ten minute walk but it took us more than forty minutes.&nbsp; Here's why.</p>

<p>There was a patch of frozen snow on the ground. Ella pretended to skate back and forth on it for a few minutes.&nbsp; After a while she happened to push some lumps of ice onto the sidewalk and decided to see how far she could kick them.  When the ice disintegrated, she went back for more clumps to practice her kick upon.&nbsp; She repeated this four or five times. But finally, searching for more ice, she found a black and white feather (she collects feathers), which she closely inspected and gave to me to carry.&nbsp; After that she looked at a number of leaves both on the ground and hanging upon the low branches; she gathered a few of last year's brittle brown oak leaves.&nbsp; Next she came upon a small flock of English sparrows who were pecking at some seed; she chased them off but waited to see how long it would take them to return. She decided to add to her rock collection: she found a beautiful, potato-size rock that I was allowed to carry home.&nbsp; &quot;Could I open it with a knife?&nbsp; I'd like to see inside it?&quot;&nbsp; Then it was time to dance on a brick retaining wall.&nbsp; Finished with that activity, she found two hunks of packed snow and scraped them together.&nbsp; &quot;It's beautiful music,&quot; she said.&nbsp; She stopped to practice her whistling, a newly acquired skill. Then came an experiment:&nbsp; what happens when clumps of snow are rubbed on the trunk of a pear tree.&nbsp; And so on.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

<p>Ella's world:&nbsp; so various, so beautiful, and so new!&nbsp; </p>

                                <p>We're in Manhattan (New York, not Kansas) where I'm suffering from two kinds of sticker shock:&nbsp; regular and newyorkish.&nbsp; Regular:&nbsp; at DIA, I treated myself to a cylinder of Life Savers:&nbsp; $1.35.&nbsp; Life Savers, as everyone knows, were invented by Hart Crane's father and are still manufactured to the formula that has made them a gourmet delight for a hundred years:&nbsp; &quot;sugar, corn syrup, high fructose corn syrup, artificial flavors (Red 40, Yellow 5, Blue 1).&quot;&nbsp; But Life Savers cost, in my childhood, exactly a nickel.&nbsp; Now it's $1.35 for a small package!!&nbsp; Beyond belief!!&nbsp; But if regular sticker shock is bad, what about high-voltage newyorkish shock?&nbsp; In my own lifetime, it was possible to ride the NYC subway for 5 cents.&nbsp; Now it's two count 'em two bucks, making the lifesaverish increase seem like peanuts.&nbsp; And what about this morning's breakfast?&nbsp; An omelet and a cup of coffee:&nbsp; $17.23 plus tip.&nbsp; And the earmuffs at a boutique for brazillionaires on Madison Avenue:&nbsp; $650.&nbsp; After an efficient deliberation, we decided against purchasing the designer earmuffs. At a nearby shop, knockoffs just as effective were available at $32.00, which, in context, seemed like a bargain. Only $16 per ear.&nbsp; But shouldn't a pair of earmuffs retail for $1.59?</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p class="EC_MsoNormal">In 1895, my grandparents wisely left the abysmal, backward Ukraine and struck out for the new world. Nine years later, my father was born in a cold-water flat in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn. The date of his birth: December 22, 1904, exactly at the winter solstice. &quot;And they called his name, Emanuel, God with us.&quot; If he had been born in the old country, before the Russian authorities imposed legal cognomina upon us, he would have been named Emanuel ben Isaiah--his father&#39;s name appended to his own as a patronymic.</p>
<p class="EC_MsoNormal">Despite his traditional moniker and his commitment to the essence of Judaism, my father was fiercely hostile to the irrationalities of religion. His view -- and my grandfather Isaiah&#39;s even more strongly--was that for a thousand years our lineage had been kept in poverty and darkness not just by the czars but also by the rabbis. In politics, my father and grandfather began as socialists and became New Dealers; in philosophy, they rejected theological doctrine and were among the children of the enlightenment whom Moses Mendelssohn had led to the promised land of evidence and reason. I doubt that any of my ancestors knew Karl Marx&#39;s sentence that &quot;the criticism of religion is the beginning of all criticism,&quot; but they acted as if they had absorbed it from the cradle. My brothers and I were taught to resist religious exclusivity, superstition, and ceremony.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p class="EC_MsoNormal">We now have a religious controversy in our peaceful, progressive, and largely secular western town. A group of orthodox Jews have petitioned the city council for permission to construct an <em>eruv</em>. What is an <em>eruv</em>?&#0160; It’s a “symbolic boundary that allows orthodox Jews to carry things, including their own children, outside their home during the Sabbath.&quot; (Carrying is considered work, and orthodoxy&#39;s strict interpretation of religious law prohibits any sort of sabbatical labor.) A latter-day <em>eruv </em>is constructed out of fishing line that is strung on utility poles; curiously, it may incorporate functioning electric and telephone wires.</p>
<p class="EC_MsoNormal">I know that my forbears detested <em>eruvim </em>and similar expressions of irrational piety. I myself am not enraged by these useless but harmless superstitions.&#0160; Constructing an <em>eruv </em>does not endanger our species; it&#39;s not like opposing contraception or prohibiting stem-cell research. An <em>eruv </em>consoles the believers and doesn&#39;t much bother the rest of us. Yet if there is a spirit in the sky, which I very much doubt, I would hope that he would not be so small-minded as to issue ukases about carrying infants on Saturdays; infants should be carried as much as they want, which is just about everywhere and always. And if any god were so narrow as to promulgate an inside/outside-the-home rule, I would hope that he would be intelligent enough not to be flummoxed by such transparent trickery as hanging mylar filament on poles.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p class="EC_MsoNormal">I have no intuitive conception of god, but I think that the orthodox trivialize our shared longing for transcendence when they sanctify such petty practices. It would be far more pious for the orthodox to take every nickel spent to appease the Ancient of Days and bestow it on a poor Jewish family from Tashkent.&#0160; If these folks can&#39;t locate eligible Jews, there are Hondurans and Sudanese a-plenty who deserve their attention. When the orthodox re-direct their enthusiasm and their resources toward truly charitable enterprises, they will honor the universal immigrant experience and they will also practice the very worthy Jewish virtue of compassion. Constructing an eruv is a foolish waste of time and fishing line.</p>
<p class="EC_MsoNormal">Here&#39;s my father&#39;s view:&#0160; &quot;It took us hundreds of years to fight our way out of the ghetto and they want to put themselves back in jail. If the rabbis had their way,&quot; he would say, &quot;Mahler and Bernstein and Gershwin would play accordion in a klezmer band in Bialystok, Einstein would balance the books for a caftan maker in Kiev, and a hundred and fifty Jewish Nobel Prize winners would spend their days davening in some dirty dim synagogue in Vilna.&quot;</p>
<p class="EC_MsoNormal">I think it’s in a Wallace Markfield novel that an old Jewish guy confronts a group of twenty-something Jewish hippies/slackers in Miami Beach. After a heated discussion, he admonishes them:&#0160; &quot;And don&#39;t ever be ashamed that you’re Jewish. It’s enough that I’m ashamed that you’re Jewish.&quot;</p>
<p class="EC_MsoNormal">Which is pretty much how I feel about the <em>eruvistas</em>. Well, not exactly ashamed. Embarrassed, perhaps, by their superstitious infatuation with the &quot;dark backward and abysm of time.&quot;&#0160;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Our own dreams are fascinating to ourselves but not particularly interesting to others (exceptions to the general rule are the dreams recounted and expounded in Freud's <em>Interpretation)</em>.&nbsp; I know that I presume upon my readers to record the following nightmare.&nbsp; I do so only because it's such a shocking fantasia. </p>

<p>I was in a jewelry store with my wife somewhere on the Continent and we were about to purchase a small gold medallion.&nbsp; It was tarnished;&nbsp; I called the hint of greenness to the attention of the middle-aged, bald salesman.&nbsp; At his instruction, I rubbed the medallion with my thumb until it began to shine.&nbsp; Just as I did so, I noticed that the salesman's flaccid pecker was hanging out of the fly of his pants;&nbsp; I said, &quot;OK, that's too weird, we're out of here.&quot;&nbsp; We hurried to leave but the door to the shop was locked.&nbsp; The salesman, who now looked menacing (the dream began to take on the ambience of a horror movie), reached into his pocket and pulled out a key --strangely enough, a large, castle-size key.&nbsp; He flourished it and opened the door for us to leave, but there was another locked door behind the first.&nbsp; He took another key, equally large, out of his pocket and opened the second door.&nbsp; There was still another door and I began to think that we'd never get out of the shop.&nbsp; Then the salesman reached deep into his pocket, pulled out a large hunting knife and cut off his own dingus right at the root.&nbsp; At this point I decided that I'd had enough and woke up. </p>

<p>Hey, don't tell me that I suffer from castration anxiety.&nbsp; I don't, despite what the dream seems to say.&nbsp; I hate to give such fodder to Freudians, but I don't invent these dreams, I just report them.&nbsp; And yes, I'm well aware that a key is reputed to be a phallic symbol.&nbsp; </p>

<p>I'd welcome interpretations that don't make the dreamer out to be infantile, maniacal, or excessively StephenKIngish.</p>

		<a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2007/12/more-on-contrac.html">More on Contraceptives and Prudery</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p><a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2007/11/empson.html">Last week</a> I reported that in 1929 William Empson was expelled and expunged from Cambridge University for owning a condom, a circumstance that I judged to be an scandalous instance of ancient prudery. But in thanks to one of those fascinating moments of cultural convergence, I&#39;ve just re-read, after almost fifty years, Philip Roth&#39;s <em>Goodbye, Columbus, </em>which also turns on a discovered contraceptive -- in the latter case, a diaphragm. Readers of the novella will remember that Roth&#39;s Newark alter ago, Neil Klugman, enjoys a summer romance with rich &#39;Cliffie Brenda Patimkin and pressures her to obtain a pessary. In due time the incriminating object is discovered by Brenda&#39;s protective, overbearing mother. Shock and outrage ensues, and the romance founders.&#0160; </p>
<p>When I read about the Empson-Cambridge contraceptive scandal, I felt as though I was entering an alien, distant and incomprehensible past. But <em>Goodbye Columbus </em>appeared in 1959, when I was an undergraduate at Cornell -- and is therefore very much a part of my conscious lifetime. Nor is Roth inaccurate about 50s sexual prudery. Contraceptives were difficult to obtain (even for married folk) and pre-marital sex was still taboo -- though, I must say, a taboo honored more in the breach than the observance. The old ways were slowly changing. In 1958, I participated in my first political demonstration -- or riot -- when Cornell authorities tried to prohibit women from visiting men&#39;s off-campus apartments. We staged a late-night moderately out-of-control protest march to the president&#39;s office. It was an all-male event because after 11 pm, women were confined to their all-female dormitories.(The action is recorded in Richard Farina&#39;s <em>Been Down So Long It Seems Like Up to Me </em>[1966]). It all seems so positively quaint now -- the university trying to police our sexual life and all that. Parents nowadays, at least the parents that I know, would be delighted to learn that their college-age daughters are using contraceptives.</p>
<p>In <em>Goodbye, Columbus</em>, Neil Klugman accuses Brenda of allowing her diaphragm to be discovered so that she can end the uneasy romance. Neil&#39;s argument seemed rational in 1959, but it no longer does so. From the vantage of 2007, it&#39;s clear that the many Roth alter egos have consistently been able to find justifications and excuses to end both their affairs and their marriages. Klugman, and Kepesh, and Zuckerman are never, ever, going to be more than momentarily and intermittently loyal or satisfied, but on the whole it&#39;s going to be circumstances, not their own volition, which causes them to flee. We didn&#39;t know that then. In 1959, <em>Goodbye, Columbus </em>seemed like a disinterested clearing of the Victorian air; now it has been transformed into a overture&#0160; to Roth&#39;s long and tormented psychosexual opera. </p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>&quot;Skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it is,&quot; said the Great One, famously.&#0160; There you have it: perfect advice for hockey players.&#0160; It goes without saying that Gretsky&#39;s sentence applies equally well to entrepreneurs, intellectuals, artists, and in fact, to anyone who has to cope with a world in continual flux. Ah, but how can anyone know where the puck is going to be next second, or next week, or a decade hence?&#0160; Gretzky was one of those rare intuitive geniuses who did it all by instinct.&#0160; Ordinary mortals must wrack their tiny brains until their heads hurt to guess at the trajectory of their own particular puck.&#0160; Most of us, no matter how hard we try, are doomed to skate counter.&#0160; There are other people (alas, I&#39;m one of them) who skate aimlessly, only dimly aware that somewhere out there on the field of play is a target puck.&#0160; Gretzky&#39;s wisdom deserves a prominent spot on the refrigerator of every moderately forward-looking, ambitious human being, where it can hang as both goad and frustration.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s another brilliant bit of Gretskyiana:&#0160; &quot;You miss 100% of the shots you don&#39;t take.&quot;</p>
<p>Let us now turn to wisdom from Alan Sillitoe (young &#39;uns might not remember Sillitoe, but he was one of the important &#39;angry&#39; English writers of the 1950s).&#0160; Sillitoe blessed us with the forceful and epigrammatic truth that &quot;all writing is fiction, especially non-fiction.&quot;&#0160; I particularly savor that uncompromising, zingy &quot;especially.&quot;&#0160; If I understand rightly, Sillitoe meant that a) no matter how faithful to experience a writer wishes to be, the act of writing inevitably emphasizes or omits or compresses or expands and therefore transforms experience into a story, a fiction.&#0160; And he also implied that b) no matter how factual the information, if it doesn&#39;t tell a story and act as a fiction it&#39;s not going to make its point.&#0160; &#0160;Moreover, and more subtly, he meant that c) any story is ineluctably influenced and shaped by common modes of storytelling, and even against a writer&#39;s will assimilates itself to existing genres.&#0160; Bloggers, for example, are willy-nilly fictioneers who can&#39;t help writing bloglike posts.&#0160; But beware:&#0160; Alan Sillitoe most definitely did not mean to imply that because all narratives are culturally and artistically determined that they are therefore equivalent in value or truth;&#0160; he was a practiced, practical writer, not some post-modern theory-soaked obscurantist.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>Here&#39;s wisdom from the great Anatole Broyard.&#0160; &#0160;Of his adolescence, he wrote, memorably, &quot;if it hadn&#39;t been for books, we&#39;d have been entirely at the mercy of sex.&quot;&#0160; &quot;Mercy&quot; is the well-chosen word that makes the sentence so piquant.&#0160; Books, says Broyard, have the power to civilize all of us, even pubescents.&#0160; Books can, and did, rescue him.&#0160; As for myself, if I remember accurately, adolescence was, in spite of extra-large doses of books, merciless.&#0160;</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know who first said that &quot;you can&#39;t coach seven feet,&quot; but it&#39;s a common enough saying.&#0160; It doesn&#39;t mean that that you can&#39;t coach a seven-footer, but that no matter how much instruction you offer a guy who&#39;s five-ten, he&#39;s never going to be seven feet tall or fill the space on the floor that requires a seven-footer.&#0160; As I once heard a track coach remark, &quot;I can teach them everything but speed.&quot;&#0160; A similar sentence, of baseball pitchers: &quot;you have to be born with the whip.&quot;&#0160; For those of us who tried to teach less exotic subjects, I can offer some parallels from my own experience.&#0160; &quot;You can&#39;t coach brains&quot;;&#0160; &quot;you can&#39;t coach talent.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>But you can do something.&#0160; You can, in words of great uncommon wisdom, &quot;play the hand you&#39;re dealt.&quot;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Here we are again in Alameda, California.&nbsp; Last night, just after 8 pm, we were lying in bed reading (me: Conrad's <em>The Secret Agent</em>;&nbsp; she, Roth's <em>Exit, Ghost</em>) and recuperating from the grandchildren's pre-Hallowe'en hysteria, when I said to A., &quot;<em>W</em>ould you please stop shaking the bed.&quot;&nbsp; She, of course, replied, &quot;I'm not moving,&quot; and I joked, &quot;Then it must be an earthquake.&quot;&nbsp; And, much to my surprise, so it was.&nbsp; Five point six on the Richter scale, just twenty miles south of here, five miles underground, along the Calaveras fault.&nbsp; There's the possibility of another one, but so far, nothing that we've been able to discern.&nbsp; Astonishing to say, but just a few hours ago, the sure and firm-set earth was feverous and did shake -- which put me in mind of the fragility of our earthly being and also made me recall some other natural phenomena that I've witnessed.</p>

<p>All that I can remember of the famous 1945 hurricane was watching at the window while my father, out in the storm, tried vainly to secure his precious peach tree, which was being shredded to oblivion by the fierce winds.&nbsp; I have a vivid recollection of the great blizzard of 1947, because after the storm subsided, snow was piled so high on both sides of the sidewalks that, for a small boy, it was like walking though a canyon -- and great fun to clamber up the mountainous heaps.&nbsp; I was a young witness to a sudden squall on Long Island Sound that sank, if I remember correctly, hundreds of pleasure boats.&nbsp; Even more serious was the Connecticut River flood of 1972, which washed out the culverts on our road, tumbled downstream some hefty boulders, and isolated us for a couple of days.&nbsp; Throughout the summer, there were memorable mud stains thirty feet in the air on the trees that grew in the river valley.&nbsp; Once in the 1980s, driving across the country just after the Mississippi had overflowed its banks, we observed standing water many miles from where water had any business to be.&nbsp; We were at Mt. St. Helen's a year after the mountain blew its top, but signs of the devastation -- bald patches, toppled trees -- were still writ large on the landscape.&nbsp; Same with the Black Tiger fire;&nbsp; we missed the fire but couldn't ignore the extensive blackening.&nbsp; In Hawaii once, we walked along hardened lava flows for a couple of miles to find a standpoint to observe magma, fresh from the earth's interior, fall steaming into the ocean to create new land.&nbsp; In Costa Rica, we visited a dormant volcano -- monumental even in its sleepiness.</p>

<p>Not many such events, but a sufficient number to produce respect for the natural processes.&nbsp; No tsunamis or crackings of the ice shelf.&nbsp; And nothing, thank goodness, comparable to the explosion of Tambura on the island of Sumbawa that caused the summer without sun and a crisis of subsistence in parts of Europe and North America.  And certainly nothing whatsoever like the meteor that landed  70 million years ago in the Yucatan, after which the fossil record becomes a blank for a thousand years and every creature larger than a pussycat went extinct.&nbsp; Yesterday's trembling was a good reminder that our mother earth is a lot more fragile than she appears to be on your average warm, pleasant, quakeless evening.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>First the exchange, exacty as it occured in real life, and then the gloss.</p>

<p>The cashier: &quot;Breakfast of Champions?&quot;</p>

<p>Me: &quot;Well, I'm a vegetarian.&quot;</p>

<p>The cashier: &quot;Yeah, I know, all organic.&quot;</p>

<p>So here's the story. We were driving across the western, uninhabited part of South Dakota, heading toward the glorious Black Hills and the Badlands. Somewhere out there, I stopped for gas. It was about 9:00 or 9:30 in the morning.</p>

<p>As a general rule, I don't drink coffee or other caffeinated liquids, but when I'm driving long distances, I keep a Coca-Cola by my side on the conservative principle that whatever damage the caffeine might do to my eccentric heart, it will be probably be a lot less dangerous than falling asleep, crashing the car, and mangling myself and my passengers. Moreover, I'm not a consumer of candy bars, but the day before, somewhere in Minnesota, A. had treated herself to a package of M &amp;Ms.&nbsp; I had wheedled a handful or so from her and I had decided to make good her loss.&nbsp; So when we stopped to refill the gas tank in Somewhere, South Dakota, I purchased, at one of those roadside convenience stores, a 12 oz bottle of Coke and a small plastic bag of multicolored chocolate candies, and the friendly, tough, old lady who kept the register looked at me aslant and said, affectionately, questioningly but also with a touch of scorn, &quot;Breakfast of Champions.&quot; I was feeling defensive and while I could have responded by explaining that I don't usually eat junky stuff, and that it wasn't even my breakfast, I didn't feel that I needed to apologize, so I went the other route and capitulated: &quot;Well, I'm a vegetarian.&quot; Which made the lady smile a bit, as I had hoped, and made me feel as though we were on the same mock-serious wavelength.&nbsp; It was a moment of deep communication, far superior to the commonplace vacant salesperson/customer/middle-of-nowhere encounter. Feeling a kindred spirit, the lady went along with the game and both assimilated and expanded on my gambit, saying, &quot;Yeah, I know, all organic' --an expression that was in part friendly but which also carried a little bite, as if she detected that I was from some tofu/granola city (which, in fact, is true, even though I myself am an old-fashioned cheeseburger --as opposed to veggieburger -- kind of guy). Altogether, it was one of the more satisfying conversations I've had in the last while.  A moment of deep and profound understanding, the kind of intimate communication that we all strive for all day, every day, even out there on a two-lane in one of the &quot;flyover&quot; states. </p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>&#0160;<br /><a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef01539118f99f970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Newkirk" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef01539118f99f970b image-full" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef01539118f99f970b-800wi" title="Newkirk" /></a>This Here is a <a href="http://brooklynpix.com/photoframex1.php?photo=photo1/F/flatbush11.jpg&amp;key=FLATBUSH%2011">photograph</a> of Coney Island Avenue, the grim commercial thoroughfare along which I crept to school unwillingly like snail between the years 1944 and 1952. The unknown photographer who left us this record stood at the corner of Newkirk Avenue, just in front of the P. S. 217 schoolyard, and pointed his camera north toward Ditmas Avenue. It&#39;s the east side of the street; on the west side stood a used-car lot and a gas station, where, if the view were more panoramic, signs reading &quot;Veedol&quot; and &quot;Mechanic on Duty&quot; would have been visible.</p>
<p>It takes only a few seconds of detective work to date the photograph. In the center is the marquee of the Leader Theater, which advertises the 1947 release <em>It Happened in Brooklyn</em>, a soldier-returns-home musical with Frank Sinatra, Kathryn Grayson, Peter Lawford, and especially Jimmy Durante, who was clearly the neighborhood favorite.&#0160; The second feature, <em>Undercover Maisie</em>, a <em>policier </em>with Ann Sothern and Barry Nelson, was released in the same year. (The double bill was standard -- and at 14 cents for kids and a quarter for adults, a darn good value). It&#39;s early autumn not only because the ivy and, in the distance, a Norway maple are still in full leaf, but because the Casa del Rey advertises High Holy Day services (the orthodox congregation&#39;s synagogue on 18th Avenue had not yet been constructed). I would guess that the large traffic sign that dominates the frame has something to do with the fact that the old trolley tracks had recently been removed. The shops near the Leader are too small to identify, but I remember Singer&#39;s drug store, Safier&#39;s candy store, a shoe repair place, a small liquor store owned by P. V. Melia, and Joe Montuori&#39;s barber shop.&#0160; At the moment the camera snapped, I was eight years old, in Mrs. Sherwood&#39;s third grade class at P. S. 217.&#0160;</p>
<p>The architecture is hodge-podge -- the featureless apartment house and shops, the vaguely deco Leader, and then, closer to the camera, the what-the-heck-is-it-doing-there Moorish Casa del Rey (for weddings and other gatherings;&#0160; I passed it thousands of times but never once entered).</p>
<p>The man at the right of the frame, jingling his car keys in the pocket of his voluminous slacks, stares at the camera unenthusiastically.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a dreary picture, I&#39;m afraid. Gray. A nondescript street in a nondescript neighborhood.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>I&#39;m trying, but I just can&#39;t seem to work up the requisite nostalgia for the old country.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Aficionados of this blague know that I&#39;m <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2006/09/geographical_dy.html">directionally disabled.</a> I don&#39;t think that I&#39;ve admitted that I suffer from frequent nightmares in which I&#39;m totally lost in a strange city or building.&#0160;</p>
<p>Last night I experienced another such dysgeographical dream. I was trying to walk north in some unidentifiable but mysterious city. A large building, which seemed to me to be a junior high school, blocked my path. I decided to cut through the building and continue on my way. I traversed various confusing corridors and staircases until I was satisfied that I was about to exit the correct door (one of many). But I couldn&#39;t get out because there were wires (which looked like electric fencing for animals) strung across the doorway. I attempted door after door and each one was wired -- chicken wire, barbed wire, all sorts of stuff. I started to panic, as I often do in such dreams.&#0160;</p>
<p>At last I decided to force my way through one of the doors. I tangled myself in various wires which had somehow metamorphosed into thick chains. The chains rattled loudly and I said to myself that someone would hear them&#0160; --&#0160; it was as though I was back in school and had gotten myself into deep trouble with the principal. And sure enough, along came a guy who seemed to be either a janitor or a detective. He was speaking rapid Spanish and I couldn&#39;t understand him. Although I begged him, he would not untangle me. I cried out, &quot;I&#39;m&#0160; tired of this basura (basura is the word for garbage in Spanish, which happens to be a language I&#39;ve never studied and don&#39;t know). I shouted, &quot;With basura, with basura.&quot;&#0160; And then I thought, wow, the phrase &quot;with basura&quot; could be used as the basis of a parody of Ezra Pound&#39;s Canto XLV, &quot;With Usura:&quot; (&quot;<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">With usura hath no man a house of good stone/ each block cut smooth and well fitting/ that delight might cover their face&quot; etc. etc.)&#0160; &#0160;</span>A person could substitute the word &quot;basura&quot; for the similar sounding &quot;usura&quot; and make good fun of Uncle Ez&#39;s economic theories -- theories which are in fact nothing more than a great big load of reactionary pseudo-medieval poppy-and-lily trash. Inspired, I decided to wake up and get to work on the poem, but I wasn&#39;t alert more than a few seconds before I came to the realization that the great world is probably not exactly aching for a parody of Pound&#39;s Canto XLV.&#0160; Even an exceedinglyl clever parody.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I worked for Sears, Roebuck and Company at its warehouse on Utica Avenue during the summers of 1957, 1958 and 1959. The job lasted for ten or twelve weeks each year and I was paid $1.25 an hour for the first two summers and then was catapulted to $1.30 for the third. At 40 hours a week, I could, in theory, earn $50 a week and take home $40, but Sears managed to calculate it so that I had worked 39 hours or 38.5 hours. Always less than forty. I was routinely baffled and disappointed by my pay envelope. I&#39;m utterly convinced that the time clock was rigged, but there was no one to whom to protest, and if I had made a fuss, I wouldn&#39;t have won my case anyway. No one did. (It might seem frivolous to worry about a few cents, but cents mattered a lot more in the 50s than they do now. Ten weeks at $40 amounts to $400. When I entered Cornell in 1956, tuition cost $450 a semester and a half of a double room in the dorm for the year was $315. At college, I survived on chocolate malts ($.25), hamburgers ($.25), and an occasional celebratory cheeseburger ($.30).)</p>
<p>At the Sears warehouse, my job was to pinch hit for people who were absent for their annual two-week vacations. I performed a variety of services of which I have clear memories of just two. I was a substitute &quot;receiver&quot; on the loading dock where I kept records of railroad cars and tried to minimize &quot;dunnage.&quot; A second job: I operated the manual telephone switchboard, inserting jacks into receptacles in order to complete a connection; it&#39;s stunning to remember that such equipment, now seen in old black-and-white movies and found only in museums of early technology, was still in wide use. I can&#39;t remember my other jobs, except that each one took about two hours to learn, was interesting for a day, but stupefyingly boring for the remainder of the two-week stint. I developed real sympathy for the people who were Sears lifers. What a test of will to come to work every day, year in and year out, to the tedious rote dehumanizing employment that the warehouse provided! Job satisfaction? I doubt that anyone, employee or employer, had stumbled upon such a concept, let alone given it an instant&#39;s thought.</p>
<p>The warehouse stocked &quot;big-ticket&quot; items: washing machines, dryers, and reefers (refrigerators). Day one: sales orders were sorted and routed; day two: goods were pulled and lined up on the dock in the reverse of the order in which they would be delivered; day three: items were loaded onto trucks and sent out to various Brooklyn neighborhoods. The system worked well but there were always crises when a particular model in a particular color wasn&#39;t available. It might be impossible for this generation of youth to believe, but in those pre-civil rights years Sears didn&#39;t sell refrigerators at a fixed rate. Salesmen (at the main store on Flatbush Avenue) received 11% of the negotiated price on an item and therefore had an incentive to set the figure as high as possible. It quickly became evident to me that there was a pattern: the poorer the neighborhood, the higher the sale price. Moreover, 99% of big-ticket items were purchased on time. The obvious corollary: the poorer the neighborhood, the higher the negotiated rate of interest. Prices and interest were most outrageous in Bedford-Stuyvesant, at that time -- and perhaps now -- Brooklyn&#39;s Harlem. Occasionally I&#39;d see a repossessed used model (no cardboard carton) on the loading dock. It was to be delivered as if new to Bed-Stuy. When I questioned the practice, I was told, very definitively, &quot;Who&#39;s going to believe them?&quot; Working for Sears was, in a word that had not yet come into existence, &quot;radicalizing.&quot;</p>
<p>The warehouse was a Staszewski-Sullivan stronghold. No Italians, no Jews, no &quot;Negroes.&quot; Well, actually, there was one African-American, but he was assigned to a broom rather than to a forklift. I didn&#39;t make any friends at the warehouse (I was chronically, disablingly shy), and although I was fearful that I might be ostracized as a &quot;college kid,&quot; I was treated not unkindly. I suspect that my paltry wage made me an object of pity.</p>
<p>An embarrassing moment: Sears held a sale on cheap, shiny suits. They sold so many that I was called to the main store to help fold and pack. Even today I&#39;m a hopelessly inadequate folder and packer. It was a nightmare. After watching me fumble for a few moments, the wives would snatch the suit impatiently from my hands. &quot;Here, sonny, let me do that.&quot;</p>
<p>A good moment: I was on the ROR desk for a week or so. ROR stood for &quot;record of return.&quot; When a refrigerator or washer came back, Sears didn&#39;t reimburse the purchase price until the ROR had been cleared. One day, bored, trying to kill some time, I was searching the desk to which I had been temporarily assigned. Stuck behind a drawer I found a misplaced three-or-four-year-old ROR, unprocessed. I called the telephone number on the ticket and asked the woman who answered if she&#39;d ever been reimbursed for the refrigerator she had returned -- $350 or so. There was a long silence. Then the woman broke into tears and into fervent thanks. &quot;I&#39;ve been trying to get my money back from Sears for years. I&#39;ve tried everything. I can&#39;t get anyone to believe me.&quot; I arranged to have the money sent to her and I felt that I had done a good deed. Not much satisfaction for three summers of employment, but something.</p>
<p>The principal result of doing my time at Sears: a decision to give a wide berth to the much revered &quot;corporate sector.&quot; It&#39;s a decision that I&#39;ve never regretted, not for a moment.</p>

                                <p>When I was seven or eight years old, I was given a subscription (by whom?) to a children&#39;s magazine (which one?) Was it my older brother who said, &quot;you still reading that magazine for babies?&quot; Always susceptible to public criticism,  I soon lost interest in the publication. Since then, I&#39;ve subscribed and unsubscribed to dozens of periodicals. Here are some that I remember. In my teens, <em>Mad Magazine, </em>of which I was a serious enthusiast, and had been since <em>Mad</em>&#39;<em>s </em>Harvey Kurtzman comic book days. Also, <em>Sport Magazine -- </em>a precursor of <em>SI. </em>And various pulp sci fi mags -- <em>Astounding Science Fiction </em>and <em>Galaxy Science Fiction </em>and probably others that came and went. In the &#39;60s, political magazines: <em>The Reporter, The Nation, </em>and before it went totally wrong, <em>The New Republic. </em>A decade later, <em>Local Population Studies, The Journal of Interdisciplinary History, The Psychohistorical Review, The History of Childhood Quarterly. </em>When I became serious about Shakespeare, I was an assiduous collector of the <em>Shakespeare Quarterly </em>and the <em>Shakespeare Newsletter </em>and <em>Shakespeare Research and Opportunities </em>and the <em>Shakespeare on Film Newsletter. </em>Closely related: <em>English Literary Renaissance</em> and the <em>George Herbert Journal </em>(of which I at one time owned every issue). In the &#39;70s or &#39;80s, <em>Organic Gardening (</em>sample title -- &quot;How We Grew Papayas on our Vermont Hillside Using Organic Methods and Faith in God&quot;); later<em>, Fine Gardening</em> (sample title: &quot;How We Converted a Defunct Brewery into an Extremely Expensive Bed-and-Breakfast Complete with a Replica of an 18th-century Capability Brown Landscape&quot;). At various times: <em>Scientific American, Science News, Bluebirds Across Vermont, </em>the newsletter of the Southern Vermont Dairy Goat Association, <em>One Two Three Four </em>(a magazine briefly in existence that concerned itself with the early history of rock and roll), the <em>Atlantic, The Skeptical inquirer. </em>Newspapers: <em>The New York Times, United Opinion </em>(nowadays the <em>Journal-Opinion), Behind the Times, </em>the <em>Daily Camera. </em>Nowadays:&#0160; <em>Harvard Magazine, New Yorker, New York Review of Books, Northern Forests</em>.</p>
<p>I&#39;m sure there must be many others that I can no longer recall.&#0160; &#0160;</p>

                                <p>Regular readers of this blague will remember that Dr. M. has long ago <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2006/09/geographical_dy.html">confessed</a> that he suffers from a serious case of &quot;directional disability,&quot; or as some call it, &quot;geographical dyslexia&quot; -- which means that he regularly loses his way, is subject to travel-based panic attacks, and is consequently abused by friends and family who refuse to recognize that he&#39;s not stupid, just utterly lost.&#0160;</p>
<p>Advanced technology rides to my rescue. I now own a mobile navigator. It affixes to the windshield of the car, and, using signals bounced off three or four satellites, instructs me how to get from point A to point B. I&#39;ve fallen profoundly in love with the disembodied female British voice who doesn&#39;t criticize me when I make a wrong turn: she just says, very politely, &quot;recalculating.&quot;&#0160; Then she says, &quot;drive point five miles and turn left.&quot;&#0160; What a boon to the chronically lost! I now drive as accurately as a migrating bird. My only reservation: I think that my friend should congratulate me when I get to where I&#39;m going. She should show a little enthusiasm. But all she says is &quot;arriving at destination, on left.&quot; What would it hurt her to offer congratulations?&#0160; I&#39;m not asking for a commitment or for flowers.</p>
<p>The navigator has now moved into first place among my prostheses, supplanting the <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2006/09/my_new_tooth.html">incisor.</a>&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Ever since I retired a few years ago, friends and relations have been asking what I intend to do with the rest of my life. It&#39;s time to start on a new career, and after much deliberation, I&#39;ve decided to fulfill a lifelong dream. I&#39;ve always had the soul of a power forward;&#0160; now I&#39;m going to make it happen. With this blague entry, I declare my eligibility for the NBA draft.</p>
<p>Let me confess:&#0160; I don&#39;t expect to be a lottery pick. There&#39;s too much college talent and too many 7-foot Lithuanian teenagers. High second round is what I aspire too.&#0160; I might even have to play a year or two in a European league to sharpen my game -- no problem.&#0160;</p>
<p>I figure that to play in the NBA, a guy needs three things: the game, which I have; the attitude, which I certainly have; and the body, which I am working on.&#0160;</p>
<p>Let me point out that at 5&#39; 10 1/4&quot;&#0160; (formerly 5&#39; 10 3/4&quot;) I am a full five inches taller than Earl Boykins. Plus I can get into the air higher than Yao Ming; I&#39;m a better three point-shooter than Shaquille O&#39;Neal; and I&#39;m a more consistent at the charity stripe than Ben Wallace. Those are some big names there. Not only that, I&#39;m a better interview than anyone in the league past or present--even better than Sir Charles himself. I&#39;m a team player. I don&#39;t need to play 48 minutes;&#0160; I don&#39;t need to take the game-winning shot. On defense, there&#39;s not a player in the league whose flopping will be more authentic.&#0160;</p>
<p>Because I&#39;ve lived a more-or-less bookish life, my body is still in tiptop shape. No gimpy knees or repaired Achilles tendons or fused vertebrae. True, the A-fib could be a problem down the road, but I don&#39;t imagine that the apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, of which I have the merest tad, will hold me back in the slightest.&#0160;</p>
<p>To the club owners and general managers who are reading this blague entry -- let me point out that I appeal to an entirely different demographic than players now in the league. Until now, there was no one to be a &quot;spokesman&quot; for Beltone hearing aids or Avodart or AARP. Untold, untapped commercial opportunities waiting to be seized!!</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been running this idea by my friends and family for the last few weeks, and I&#39;m sorry to say that there&#39;s a lot of ageism and size-ism and negativity out there.&#0160; Let&#39;s leave that skepticism behind us! I&#39;m ready to roll! I just have to decide on the appropriate tats.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>(For an update on this subject, read more <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2008/06/my-new-career-.html">here.</a>)&#0160; &#0160;</p>

Here&#39;s one. &quot;Rosie and I were at a hotel in Vegas, in bed.&#0160; About one in the morning, we hear a hooker knock on the door across the hall.&#0160; &#39;Anyone want a little action.&#39; No answer. Then, sure enough, she knocks on our door. &#39;Want some action?&#39;&#0160; Rosie says, &#39;Move on, honey, I&#39;m working this room.&#39;&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>Good dialogue.&#0160;</p>
<p>I assume that Rosie is the wife.&#0160; But the story, at least to my tired old ears, has a slightly different valance if she&#39;s a date, a business associate, or a mistress.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Last night I dreamed that I was in conversation with two English professors (both male and middle-aged) from a college in New Orleans (query -- why New Orleans?). One of them said, &quot;Rex is a very good baseball player. Thanks for recommending him.&quot; I said, &quot;Yes, he&#39;s good, even though he has two prosthetic shoulders. But I didn&#39;t recommend him to you as a baseball player. I recommended him as a novelist. He writes detective stories.&quot;&#0160; One of the professors said, &quot;I like his stories, but he doesn&#39;t transcend the genre&quot;&#0160; (&quot;transcend the genre&quot; is an actual verbatim quote from the dream. I don&#39;t invent the dialogue; I only report the facts.)&#0160; And then I said, and I think I remember this accurately, &quot;if you want to read someone who &#39;transcends the genre,&#39; you should read novels by Leonardo Sciascia.&quot; Once those words were out of my mouth, I started to feel foolish -- did I mention the name Sciascia because I was genuinely trying to add to the conversation, or was I just showing off?&#0160; (I often bother myself with such questions in &#39;real life&#39;.)&#0160; While I was cross-examining myself, a young woman appeared on the &quot;set.&quot;&#0160; She was no one I recognized, but I can report that she was wearing a white blouse and a long, dark skirt. She held a gift-wrapped package and she opened it, pulling out a book. She said, &quot;here&#39;s something that will transcend the genre.&quot; And then she shouted, &quot;Transcend the Genre.&quot;&#0160; &quot;Transcend the Genre.&quot;&#0160; Just at that moment I heard shooting and realized that a sniper was firing at at her. She took a bullet to the stomach and another to the head, and lay there at my feet, dead and bloody. It seemed like a good time to wake up, and I did so.</p>
<p><em>May 18.</em> Marion Morrison, associate professor of English at the University of Iowa, who has contributed to this blague <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2007/01/more_on_king_so.html">in the past</a><em>, </em>writes:&#0160; &quot;Dr. Metablog, or Vivian, or whatever you&#39;re calling yourself today, I&#39;m embarrassed for you. That&#39;s the most mysognynistic dream I could imagine. As soon as true creativity arrives on the scene of your dream, in the form of a young, attractive and obviously creative woman, your unconscious killed her with a shot to the heart. Your dream admits no other interpretation.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p><em>May 19.&#0160; </em>Spike Schapiro writes:&#0160; &quot;Marion, that&#39;s a crock of you know what. The dream is not a bit &#39;mysogynistic&#39; -- I presume you mean &#39;misogynistic&#39;. It&#39;s about pretentiousness. The woman who shouts &quot;transcend the genre&quot; is an pretentious intellectual bully. She deserves to be obliterated -- incidentally, not with a bullet in the heart, as you claim, but in the head and stomach. You can&#39;t even get the facts right. But what can you expect from someone who thinks that Rider Haggard wrote a novel called <em>King Solomon&#39;s Minds,</em> which is what you called it in your pretentious little slice of literary you know what. Hey everyone, click on &quot;in the past&quot; in the preceding paragraph and check out what I&#39;m saying. Marion, go back to the classroom where you can poison the brains of another generation of vulnerable children.&quot;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>At a community meeting a few days ago, the question of alcohol consumption came up (as it frequently does in our adjacent-to-a-university neighborhood). One young man complained that when local bars (where over-serving is -- in theory -- proscribed) shut down, the students then take their drinking to &quot;house parties&quot; where there is no adult present to oversee how much can be consumed. &quot;They just go and get themselves totally wasted,&quot; said the student. Our local police sergeant challenged him. &quot;What do you do,&quot; she asked, &quot;when your friends make plans to get drunk? Do you try to stop them?&quot; Her question took the student aback. I don&#39;t think that the idea that someone his age could or should intervene had occurred to him until that moment.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>I was surprised that the sergeant asked the young man to look after his friends. It was as though she asked him to become that dreaded folk-figure, the busybody.&#0160;</p>
<p>What are the rules in such cases? Isn&#39;t the notion that each person is responsible for only his own welfare a contemporary American dogma? &quot;You can&#39;t help people; they have to help themselves.&quot;</p>
<p>Some score or so years ago, I had a friend (I&#39;ll call him Vincent) who was a two-(or three) pack-a-day smoker. He was an intimate enough friend that I crossed the invisible busybody barrier. I&#39;d argue with him about the health risks of using tobacco; I&#39;d send him articles to read. He was not impressed or persuaded, but he was often irritated. Once he said, scornfully, &quot;you are trying to be your brother&#39;s keeper.&quot; Vincent was angry when I asked him not to smoke when he visited my house. His conviction was that when you have a friend, you don&#39;t try to change him or to regulate his habits; you accept him with all his foibles. Perhaps he was right, but nevertheless, for several years I didn&#39;t invite him home, which was a great loss, because he was smart and informed and charming and sociable.&#0160;</p>
<p>Then came the lung cancer, the surgery, the chemo, the false remissions, the swings between hope and despair, and eventually, the premature death. In an interview in the local newspaper a few weeks before he died, Vincent said, &quot;I have simply lost twenty years of my life to smoking.&quot; To me he said, once, very quietly, &quot;you were right.&quot;&#0160; Did he mean, &quot;you were right that smoking was dangerous,&quot; or did he mean, &quot;you were right to try to change me?&quot; I don&#39;t know.</p>
<p>I may have been right, but what good did I do? I alienated a friend and I didn&#39;t add a day to his life.&#0160;</p>
<p>When I look back now after so many years have passed, my regret is not that I intervened but that intervened so ineffectively. It haunts me that I didn&#39;t I do a better job.&#0160;</p>
<p>In our neighborhood, we lose a local student to alcohol poisoning each and every year. Can there be a sadder or more useless death?&#0160; Mom and dad nurture a child for eighteen years, send him or her off to college, and a week later receive a phone call that their child has choked to death on his own vomit.</p>
<p>Who is the responsible party?&#0160; Friends, teachers, police, family, liquor-purveyors? Or only the individual?&#0160; &#0160;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Intermittently throughout the decades, I&#39;ve been afflicted with what has been called, at various times in history, &quot;the spleen,&quot; &quot;vapors,&quot; &quot;falling into a brown study,&quot; &quot;melancholy,&quot; &quot;the blues,&quot; and currently, &quot;depression.&quot; But now I have devised a very effective remedy for this affliction.</p>
<p>With the help of the Ellis Island Foundation, I located the manifest of the <em>Rotterdam</em>, the ship that arrived in New York on August 23, 1904 and which brought my grandparents to the new world. I purchased and studied a copy of this document. My grandfather, Joseph Uzilewsky, was 27 years old when he arrived and is listed as a &quot;chemist&#39;s (i.e. pharmacist&#39;s) assistant.&quot; My grandmother, Sonia, was 20 and has no profession. Neither of them admitted to being either a polygamist or an anarchist. There&#39;s a specific column on the manifest in which each new arrival was required to say how much money he&#39;s bringing into the country. Almost all of the immigrants have a few dollars, but Joseph and Sonia have nothing at all. Nothing.</p>
<p>When I fall into periods of unhappiness, I think about my grandparents arriving here without a nickel in their pockets and unable to speak the language. And then I think of my own position in life. I had a job that allowed me -- no, required me -- to read as much as possible, and occasionally to write something about what I had read. My principal task was the pleasant and useful one of learning the young &#39;uns how to read and write. Now I&#39;m retired and someone puts money in my bank account at the beginning of each month. It&#39;s not a lot of money, but it&#39;s enough to allow me to do whatever I please.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>I have no reason to think that I&#39;m smarter or more talented than my grandparents&#0160; -- in fact, everything that I know about genetics leads to the conclusion that they were exactly as gifted as I. No question but that I&#39;ve been a heckuva lot luckier. I could have spent my entire lifetime rolling cigars in a hot, airless back-room-behind-the-store, as my grandfather did.</p>
<p>I keep the <em>Rotterdam</em> manifest under the glass on my desk. When I start to feel gloomy, I force myself to take another look. I don&#39;t dare allow myself to succumb to depression. How justly would my grandparents have scorned the mopings and the woe-is-mes of someone so privileged as I have been.&#0160;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>We&#39;ve had two major snowfalls in the last week and the road crews haven&#39;t yet found their way to our street. It&#39;s a knee-deep icy mess out there. Yesterday one of my neighbors spun himself into quite a hole. He needed a push, so I went outside to help. Even with my professional-grade ice-chopper, I had to bang around for a while and the task took a lot longer than I had expected.&#0160; Eventually, I had to resort to the old towel trick to gain enough traction to release the vehicle. My neighbor said, &quot;I&#39;m embarrassed. You shouldn&#39;t be doing this.&quot;&#0160; Which took me aback, of course. I replied, quite spontaneously, &quot;It&#39;s exactly what I should be doing.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>And then I recalled one of my father&#39;s maxims: &quot;Never omit an opportunity to do a favor for a friend, and never be embarrassed to accept a favor.&quot;</p>
<p>The old guy did lots of favors. When someone on East 9 Street had a problem or got into a little trouble, my father acted as <em>consigliere</em>; as far as I know, he never took a nickel for his trouble--though occasionally someone would drop off a compensatory lasagna. In his last years, when he lived alone and his arthritis was very bad, someone mowed his lawn and someone took in his garbage cans and someone raked his leaves.</p>
<p>My father was the least materialistic person that I&#39;ve encountered in an entire lifetime. He didn&#39;t seem to need possessions. No car, no clothes beyond the absolute minimum, no items of personal adornment. He didn&#39;t &quot;shop.&quot; I was with him once when bought a new hat: &quot;See this. I want another one just like it.&quot; We were in and out of the store in two minutes.&#0160;</p>
<p>Although he lived in a world of weasels (he was a real-estate lawyer), he was uncontaminated by what went on around him. He&#39;d often tell me stories about the various chicaneries by which people cheated each other--and every time he would express the same astonishment at the fallibility of human nature. He knew of public officials who were on the take, but he preferred to talk about the state legislator who had a large sign on his desk that said, &quot;NO GIFTS.&quot;</p>
<p>In one of our very last conversations, I asked him if he himself had ever done anything illegal. He thought for a long time. &quot;I don&#39;t know if you&#39;d call this exactly illegal. Do you remember the B-----s?&#0160; Rose was a widow and she was dying of cancer, but she didn&#39;t know it. She was a teacher with two young children and she had a benefit coming to her from the city. She made a very bad decision--a lump sum instead of an annuity for her children. I went to her school and substituted a new form for the one that she had filed. It was technically a violation and I could have gotten into a lot of trouble.&quot; And then he surprised me by quoting some Wordsworth--the lines from <em>Tintern Abbey </em>about the &quot;best portion of a good man&#39;s life,/ His little, nameless, unremembered acts/ Of kindness and of love.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#39;s hard to believe that he&#39;s been dead for twenty years now. But I remember him when we come around to the winter solstice (he was born on December 22, 1904)--and he&#39;s especially real to me when a neighbor lets me help him extricate his car from a snowbank.&#0160;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>When I was a child, haircuts were perpetrated at Joe&#39;s Barber Shop on Coney Island Avenue. It was a pleasant place: there were wall-to-wall mirrors on either side of Joe Montuori&#39;s shop, and a boy sitting in the chair could lose himself in the infinitely-regressing images. Joe always had a friend or two in the shop with whom he spoke incomprehensible rapid-fire Italian. The haircutting itself was an ordeal. Joe charged 75 cents a head, but my mother had driven a bargain: three haircuts (myself and my two brothers) for $1.80. Joe revenged himself on me by a) working the electric buzzer as rapidly as possible, and b) frequently re-arranging the angle of my head with a blow from the heel of his hand. Back home, my mother would sigh and say, &quot;Turn around.&#0160; Let&#39;s see what he did to you this time.&quot;</p>
<p>I&#39;ve not big on personal adornment, and, perhaps because of my early hair experiences, I&#39;ve never been comfortable in the barber&#39;s seat. As soon as the cloth is fastened around my neck I feel hogtied and hopeless. &quot;What are they going to do to me today?&quot; Once, on the west side of Manhattan, in the late 1960s, when my hair was rather long (it seems absurd that you could signal your opposition to the war in Vietnam by letting your hair grow, but such was the case), I walked into a shop and asked the barber to &quot;leave it long.&quot; He immediately transformed me into a rabid supporter of carpet-bombing. Also in New York: when I naively wandered into a shop with a specialized clientele, a hair technician employing a razor and a variety of gels and lotions turned me into someone whose hair was giving off signals with which the rest of his body was not in accord. In Hanover, New Hampshire, in an upstairs &#39;salon,&#39; the barber suddenly stopped work, drew back, studied me for fifteen or twenty seconds, and asked, &quot;Are you Jewish.&quot; I mumbled something about not really wanting to discuss my ethnicity with him, whereupon he launched into a disquisition of which I understood not much and remember less, except that that it involved prophecy, the Book of Isaiah, and The Hatching of the Egg. He hauled out his heavily annotated King James Version and pointed me to various passages underlined in coded colors. As it happens, I&#39;m more conversant than most people with scripture, and so I can assert with moderate authority that his reading of the Bible was -- how shall I say -- original. It took me an hour to extricate myself from his insistent and wayward scholarship: fifteen minutes of hair-cutting and forty-five minutes of exegetical enthusiasm.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>For a decade or so, when our finances were perilous, my wife cut my hair. There were some benefits (a guy could cop a feel while being ministered to) but I must admit that although my good woman was earnest and effective, she never fully mastered tonsorial technique. She had the habit of yanking upwards on the strands with the scissors, with the result that each snip produced a stab of pain -- although nothing more intense than might have been alleviated by the injection of a dozen or score shots of novocaine directly into the scalp. And then there were the ear nicks.</p>
<p>After a while, I returned hair responsibility to the world of commerce. I had success for many years with Liz of Chicago Hair across town. Liz was good at her work and respected my multiple cowlicks. But then she started to raise her prices. When she reached $20, I would just hand her the Visa and ask her not to tell me what she charged. When she went to $30, I retaliated by spacing the haircuts further and further apart in order to keep my annual cost constant. But when she broached the $40 barrier, the puritan in me rebelled. I started to patronize the cheap ($14) barbershop across the street from the college. There&#39;s a rotating staff and it&#39;s hit-and-miss: sometimes the results are acceptable, sometimes disastrous.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>When I come home from the expedition, my wife says, &quot;Let&#39;s see what they&#39;ve done to you today.&quot;</p>
<p>And then she sighs.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>When I lived in Cambridge in the first years of the 1960s, it was not unusual to encounter, on a warm winter afternoon, the poet Robert Frost walking slowly along Massachusetts Avenue. I&#39;d watch him as he strolled over to Plympton Street and to the Grolier -- which was then as now, I imagine, the only all-poetry bookstore in America. One day I crept behind him to the shop and sat in a secluded corner, studying him as he browsed the shelf of new arrivals. With his leathery old skin and unruly iridescent white hair, he was an iconic figure -- famous not only among friends of poetry but among readers of <em>Life</em> and <em>Collier&#39;s</em> and <em>The Saturday Evening Post.</em>&#0160;When he &quot;said&quot; his poems at Sanders Theater (in late 1961 or 1962), he filled every seat and every standpoint of a large auditorium. He was an honest-to-goodness celebrity, a presence, a man who had created a body of work and had earned a reputation that no poet or cultural figure today can rival.</p>
<p>At JFK&#39;s inauguration in January of 1961, Frost commanded a national television audience. He started to read the poem he had composed for the occasion, but his 87-year-old eyes were blinded by the bright sunlight and he couldn&#39;t continue. There was a moment of embarrassment, and I remember cringing in sympathy with his struggle. But then he gathered himself and recited from memory, in a rejuvenated voice, &quot;The Gift Outright.&quot; &quot;She was our land more than a hundred years/ Before we were her people.&quot; It&#39;s an almost mystical but grandly patriotic poem about rude, unlettered colonials transforming themselves into a Nation. &quot;Such as we were we gave ourselves outright.../ To the land vaguely realizing westward,/ But still unstoried, artless, unenhanced, / Such as she was, such as she would become.&quot;</p>
<p>Frost died in January of 1963, just ten months before our young president was shot. It&#39;s almost impossible now to reconstruct the effervescence of the Kennedy years -- a brief exciting moment between the lukewarm bland Eisenhower administration and the interminable nightmare of Vietnam. Frost&#39;s &quot;Dedication,&quot; the poem that he couldn&#39;t read at the inaugural, is not his best work, but its last lines catch the spirit of the time. The poet took his inspiration from the Rome of Augustus and of Horace, Virgil, and Ovid. &quot;It is no miracle the mood is high,&quot; he wrote.&#0160; &quot;It makes the prophet in us all presage/ The glory of the next Augustan age/ Of a power leading from its strength and pride,/ Of young ambition eager to be tried,/ Firm in our free beliefs without dismay,/ In any game the nations want to play./ A golden age of poetry and power/ Of which this noonday&#39;s the beginning hour.&quot; Frost proved to be a better poet than a prophet. Instead of a golden age of poetry and power, we&#39;ve had, after the three horrible murders, a parade of fools: first the crook, then the senile puppet, then the congressional fellatio hunters, and now the smirking, dangerous dunce.&#0160;</p>
<p>Like the nation, I too am in steep decline. It used to be that I could memorize short poems with ease. Nowadays, it&#39;s a titanic effort of will. To forestall hardening of the mind, and in a desperate effort to keep my brain supple, I decided to memorize Frost&#39;s &quot;Birches.&quot; It&#39;s when you learn a poem by heart that you truly appreciate it, and so I can now say with absolute confidence and authority that &quot;Birches&quot; is a poem not just for the age, but for all time. In point of fact, I&#39;ve been bothering myself about how Frost will fare in civilizations as far into the future as Virgil and Horace are in our past. Will students of poetry be able to grasp the subtlety of &quot;Birches?&quot; The story, the plot itself, will pose no problem. Frost knows that birches are bent to the ground by ice-storms, but he would fancifully &quot;prefer to have some boy bend them/ As he went out and in to fetch the cows.&quot; For the &quot;boy,&quot; tree-climbing is a high art: &quot;He always kept his poise/ To the top branches, climbing carefully/ With the same pains you use to fill a cup/ Up to the brim, and even above the brim.&quot; Frost then shifts perspective, and the fantasy that birches are bent not by ice-storms but by athletic youngsters transforms into a memory, a truth: &quot;So was I once myself a swinger of birches;/ And so I dream of going back to be.&quot; He closes the poem with a vision in which he leaves the real world and starts life anew: &quot;I&#39;d like to go by climbing a birch tree,/ And climb black branches up a snow-white trunk/ Toward heaven, till the tree could bear no more,/ But dipped its top and set me down again.&quot; Even though our descendants will read the poem in an extinct language and in an edition encrusted with explanatory footnotes, I&#39;m sure that they&#39;ll understand its outline. (I imagine too that some future scholar will make his career by explicating the line &quot;A boy too far from town to learn baseball.&quot;) But will anyone in 4006 A.D. be sufficiently conversant with everyday twentieth-century American English to recognize the skill with which Frost masks his deep insights into the relationship between the material and the eternal with art-that-hides-art colloquialisms? Or appreciate to the full the sly understatement of &quot;one could do worse than be a swinger of birches?&quot; The beauty and the profundity of &quot;Birches&quot; tease us who share Frost&#39;s language. What a challenge the poem will be eighty generations down the road! Moreover, Is there even the remotest possibility that our successors will be equipped to grasp how much of Roman poetry (Ovid especially) Frost distills into &quot;I&#39;d like to get away from earth awhile/ And then come back to it and begin over./ May no fate willfully misunderstand me/ And half grant what I wish and snatch me away/ Not to return.&quot; Frost possessed the genius to keep us in touch with our past and to connect us to our future.</p>
<p>I wish that I had talked to Robert Frost that winter day when he was trudging on. &quot;How are you, Mr. Frost,&quot; I might have asked. Perhaps he would have smiled or said &quot;Nice day.&quot;</p>
<p>That would have been a good thing to recall.&#0160; &#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>During the 1940s and early 1950s, when I was a pupil at P. S. 217, the school auditorium was given over to formal weekly &quot;assemblies.&quot;&#0160;Boys were required to wear white shirts and green ties (girls had a specified outfit as well, but in those days I was so unconscious of a) girls and b) their costumes that I&#39;m darned if I can remember what was worn by the young ladies).&#0160;Before entering the auditorium, classes lined up in &quot;size places.&quot;&#0160;P. S. 217 was particularly strong on &quot;size places&quot;&#0160;-- a point of particular humiliation for me, because I was, as WS says about R of G, &quot;so long a-growing, and so leisurely&quot; that I was by far the smallest child in every class from first grade to eighth.&#0160;After we found our assigned seats (boys in one row, girls in the next), our principal Miss Bildersee, a formidable and incredibly ancient woman with nostrils so huge and distended that an agile boy could go spelunking in them, would perform the mandatory reading from the Bible.&#0160;Blessings on her fond old heart, Miss Bildersee regularly choose melodious passages from the book of Psalms.&#0160;I was particularly struck by the eloquence of &quot;Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful,&quot; with its abrupt counterbalancing antistrophe: &quot;the ungodly are not so, but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away.&quot;&#0160;After the Bible reading and some announcements, there was usually a performance of some sort.&#0160;Choral readings, the oddest of art forms, were far too frequent. I remember that I was once a member of a sextet of quavering sopranos who memorized and recited the patriotic World War I poem &quot;In Flanders Fields.&quot;&#0160;What in the world was a second-grader supposed to make of &quot;We are the Dead. Short days ago/ We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,/Loved and were loved, and now we lie/In Flanders fields./Take up our quarrel with the foe:/To you from failing hands we throw/The torch; be yours to hold it high./If ye break faith with us who die/ We shall not sleep, though poppies grow/ In Flanders fields.&quot;&#0160;(Such poppycock was received as true literary greatness. It would have been beyond utopian imagination that our teachers would have known or introduced us to the distinguished WWI poetry of Wilfred Owen or Isaac Rosenberg or Siegfried Sassoon or Edward Thomas.)&#0160;Then our music specialist Mrs. Georgia Keiselbach would sit down at the piano and teach us songs, some of them also left over from the first World War:&#0160; &quot;Keep the home-fires burning,/ While your hearts are yearning,/ Though your lads are far away/ They dream of home;/ There&#39;s a silver lining/Through the dark cloud shining,/Turn the dark cloud inside out,/Till the boys come home.&quot;&#0160;And also: &quot;Give me some men who are stout-hearted men/ Who will fight for the right they adore... Shoulder to shoulder, and bolder and bolder.&quot;&#0160; And: &quot;<span>Tramp, tramp, tramp along the highway/Tramp, tramp, tramp, the road is free...&#0160; We&#39;re planters and Canucks/ Virginians and Kentucks/Captain Dick&#39;s own Infantry/ Captain Dick&#39;s own Infantry,&quot; which I now know to have come from Victor Herbert&#39;s <em>Naughty Marietta</em> (1910) and which provoked a great deal of surreptitious tittering because it had the word &quot;dick&quot; in it.&#0160;In those unenlightened days we sang very many overtly religious songs: &quot;White Christmas&quot; and &quot;Silent Night&quot; and &quot;Easter Parade.&quot;&#0160;I much admired the tune of &quot;The First Noel&quot; but I had no idea what was meant by &quot;born is the king of Israel&quot; -- the only Israel I knew of was a recently-founded democracy.&#0160;I loved the Thanksgiving hymn &quot;We gather together to ask the Lord&#39;s blessing;/ He chastens and hastens His will to make known;/ The wicked oppressing now cease from distressing,/ Sing praises to His name; He forgets not his own&quot; and many more stanzas, none of which I could parse or understand (still can&#39;t, in fact!).&#0160;Another Thanksgiving song:&#0160;&quot;Over the river and through the woods/ To grandmother&#39;s house we go/The horse knows the way/To carry the sleigh...,&quot; which I found to be curiously disorienting because my particular grandmother lived in a tiny third-floor walkup on noisy and sweaty Coney Island Avenue.&#0160;We sang the immensely mysterious Lord&#39;s Prayer (in the Schubert setting, I later discovered).&#0160;Why did we so?&#0160; Were the heathens and Jews among us expected to convert on the spot?&#0160;</span><span>I much preferred the patriotic songs, although even they too were permeated with inexplicable theology.&#0160;We were fervent jingos.&#0160;&#0160; Not one, but two full stanzas of &quot;The Battle Hymn of the Republic&quot;:&#0160;&quot;In the beauty of the lilies, Christ was born across the sea,/With a glory in His bosom, that transfigures you and me/&#0160;As he died to make men holy, let us die to make men free,/ For God is marching on.&quot;&#0160;And two stanzas also of &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;: &quot;Oh! thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand/ Between their loved home and the war&#39;s desolation!/&#0160;Blessed with victory and peace, may the heav&#39;n rescued land/&#0160;Praise the Power that hath made and preserv&#39;d us a nation./Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just,/ And this be our motto: &#39;In God is our trust.&#39;&quot;&#0160;I preferred the rousing &quot;O Columbia! the gem of the ocean,/ The home of the brave and the free,/ The shrine of each patriot&#39;s devotion,/ A world offers homage to thee&quot; and &quot;God Bless America&quot; as well as the jingoist exceptionalism and cluttered syntax of &quot;Our father&#39;s God, to thee/ Author of liberty/ To thee we sing./&#0160; Long may our land be bright/ With freedom&#39;s holy light;/ Protect us by thy might/ Great God our King.&quot;&#0160; </span></p>
<p><span>Here&#39;s a song we were distinctly not taught and did not sing: </span><span>&quot;This land is your land, this land is my land/ From California, to the New York Island./&#0160;From the redwood forest, to the Gulf Stream waters/ This land was made for you and me.&quot;&#0160;We especially did not sing:&#0160;&quot;In the squares of the city&#0160; -- in the shadow of the steeple/&#0160; Near the relief office -- I see my people/&#0160;And some are grumblin&#39; and some are wonderin&#39; /If this land&#39;s still made for you and me.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span><em>December 17.</em>&#0160; I now remember that we sang musical settings to two familiar poems.&#0160;The first, Emma Lazarus&#39;s inscription on the Statue of Liberty:&#0160;&quot;Give me your tired, your poor/ Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free/ The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.&quot;&#0160;Hey, that&#39;s my grandparents you&#39;re calling &quot;wretched refuse.&quot;&#0160;The second, Joyce Kilmer&#39;s horrid &quot;Trees&quot;:&#0160;&quot;I think that I shall never see/&#0160; A poem lovely as a tree...&#0160; A tree who&#39;s hungry mouth is pressed/ Against the earth&#39;s sweet-flowing breast&quot; etc.&#0160; This song was only palatable because it allowed us to say the word &quot;breast&quot; out loud.&#0160; </span></p>
<p><span>(Thanks to Steve and to Barry, graduates of P. S. 217, for jogging my memory;&#0160; thanks also to David [P. S. 102].</span></p>

                                <p>We're in Washington visiting our four-year-old granddaughter (and her parents, of course).&nbsp; This morning I walked the little girl to her Montessori pre-school. As we passed some dormant rhododendrons, the grand-daughter told me that she saw a &quot;very large antelope&quot; resting under the bushes.&nbsp; I like her style -- not a dog, or even a deer -- an antelope!&nbsp; And a very large one to boot.&nbsp; I love her sincerity, and I love it that she's still young enough to live in the imagination.&nbsp; What a gift!</p>

<p>Here are some other &quot;stretchers&quot;&nbsp; -- Huck Finn's word&nbsp; -- that she's told me during this visit.&nbsp; That she once ate thirteen bananas in a row.&nbsp; That her mother and her grandmother had just gone to the Antarctic.&nbsp; That she had six brothers and eleven sisters.&nbsp; That the cheese that she was eating was made entirely of &quot;green slimy boogers.&quot;&nbsp; That she had just pooped on her cat.&nbsp; That she built the neighbor's new picket fence.&nbsp; &quot;You did?&nbsp; How did you do it?&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;With power tools.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;That she had eaten a whole meal of eyeballs.</p>

<p>Well, she'll have to live in the world of hard facts soon enough.&nbsp; Everyone must, even those of our leaders who would prefer to reject the &quot;reality-based&quot;&nbsp; universe.&nbsp; I say, let her enjoy the fantasy just as long as she is able.&nbsp; </p>

                                <p>A few weeks ago, I wrote about my <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2006/10/a_recurring_vio.html">violent nightmares</a>.&nbsp; And now I shall unclasp a secret book and write about real-life violence in my life -- to be exact, about a murder and an attempted murder.</p>

<p>In the middle-1970s, I exchanged jobs, homes and automobiles with a faculty member of a university in England.&nbsp; I will call this person by the fabricated name of Maurice Shaper.&nbsp; Although I certainly profited from teaching in a new setting, and I loved the city in southeastern England in which we lived, Mr. Shaper himself was a disaster.&nbsp; He missed half of his classes and was cruel to my students when he did present himself.&nbsp; He fled town early, leaving behind stacks of unread papers, distressed students who had not received grades or credit for the work, and a mess that took me a full year to resolve.&nbsp; Moreover, Mr. Shaper, who had a friend on the west coast and was commuting 1200 miles bi-weekly, put 60,000 miles on my Dodge station wagon before smashing it into another vehicle on a rainy California road.&nbsp; Within an hour of our arrival home, we were greeted with a summons and a lawsuit -- as owners of the car we were liable -- from the occupants of the maimed vehicle. It was a lawsuit that took a number of years to run its expensive course.&nbsp; In short, I must admit that I nursed more than a little antagonism to Mr. Shaper.&nbsp; Anger, I'd say, but something less than murderous rage.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Some five years later I returned to England.&nbsp; The morning after I arrived, I was standing on the steps of the British Museum in Bloomsbury waiting for the building to open when an acquaintance came up to me with a newspaper.&nbsp; &quot;Have you seen this?&quot; he asked, and showed me an item in <em>The Times. </em>&quot;University Lecturer Murdered.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;And sure enough, Mr. Maurice Shaper had been killed in his own home -- the home in which I had lived for a year.&nbsp; Although it didn't say so in the newspaper, I was later informed that he had been in the habit of picking up young men on the Dover Road and bringing them home.&nbsp; He must have misjudged his quarry, because he had been slashed in the neck with a broken liquor bottle and had bled to death in his bathroom.&nbsp; His Peugeot and his camera and a few other items had been stolen and the presumed murderer had disappeared.&nbsp; What was so odd was that he had been killed just a few hours after I arrived at Heathrow.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>That's the murder;&nbsp; now the attempted murder.</p>

<p>In my second year at college, I had a roommate (let us call him Peter Dickerman) with whom I was in perpetual conflict.&nbsp; I'm not generally short-tempered, but once, I was so angry at him that I actually picked up a carving knife and waved it in his direction.&nbsp; Eventually we came to a truce of sorts;&nbsp; although we inhabited the same rooms, we didn't speak to each other for the last months of the semester.&nbsp; Mr. Dickerman then went his way and I went mine.</p>

<p>Thirty years later, I was in Washington DC for a couple of weeks doing some reading at a specialized library when I read in the <em>Washington Post</em> that someone had attempted to murder a northern Virginia psychologist.&nbsp; The victim, Peter Dickerman, had received a letter-bomb in the mail.&nbsp; He had opened it, there was an explosion, and he was burned over 60% of his body.&nbsp; The story was a sensation for a few days but gradually faded from view.&nbsp; It's my understanding that Dickerman did not die.&nbsp; (I've now googled him under his real name and I see that he's still practicing psychiatry in Virginia.)</p>

<p>So two times in my life, a person with whom I've been in serious conflict has been violently attacked.&nbsp; And both times, I've been close at hand.&nbsp; A little creepy, isn't it?&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

<p>The man who murdered Maurice Shaper was arrested and convicted.&nbsp; The identity of the person who mailed the letter bomb to Peter Dickerman is unknown to me.&nbsp; </p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Life has certainly changed since I was growing up in the 1940s and 1950s.&nbsp; Here are some of the key inventions that have made life better for me and for all sentient Americans.</p>

<p>1)&nbsp; <strong>the</strong> <strong>retractable vacuum cleaner cord. </strong>Truly one heck of an improvement.&nbsp; Just step on the little lever, and the cord comes flying back into the machine.&nbsp; It used to be, I'd waste minutes tying the thing up only to watch it immediately unravel.</p>

<p>2)&nbsp; <strong>fitted sheets</strong>.&nbsp; Just snap them on and have done with it.&nbsp; Perhaps the greatest improvement in standard of living in my lifetime.&nbsp; No more folding under and then waking up in the middle of the night sleeping on the mattress tufts.</p>

<p>3)&nbsp; <strong>the bungee cord.&nbsp; </strong>A stroke of true genius.&nbsp; For packing the top of the car, an unparalleled innovation.&nbsp; And nowadays, I keep a pair of them strapped to the lawn-tractor cart.&nbsp; I use the bungee cords to double the load that I can carry in one trip.</p>

<p>4<strong>)&nbsp; luggage wheels</strong>.&nbsp; Pull instead of carrying.&nbsp; What a concept!!&nbsp; Luggage, marooned for centuries in the paleolithic, finally discovers the wheel (and just in time to save my shoulders).</p>

<p>5) <strong>the mute button</strong>. Just a flick of the thumb and the commercial voice disappears.&nbsp; A godsend.</p>

<p>That's my top five.&nbsp; Any other suggestions out there in the blogworld will be sincerely appreciated.</p>

<p><em>November 30.&nbsp; </em>I'm so chagrined.&nbsp; I've forgotten the most remarkable invention of the last several decades:&nbsp; <strong>duct tape.</strong>&nbsp; In our household, duct tape holds together more items than gravity.&nbsp; </p>

                                <p>On November 22, 1963, we were living in a small third-floor walkup on Irving Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts.&nbsp; It was in the afternoon.&nbsp; Some high schools students (Cambridge High and Latin was just around the corner) were walking by.&nbsp; One of them shouted to another, &quot;Kennedy's been shot.&nbsp; In Dallas.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;I immediately thought &quot;this is bad.&nbsp; That kid shouldn't know that Kennedy's in Dallas.&quot;&nbsp; So we turned on the radio.&nbsp; And began to grieve.</p>

<p>I don't think that this country's ever regained its balance.&nbsp; Jack, and then Bobbie and Martin Luther King&nbsp; -- the heroes of the left taken out, one by one, by assassins.&nbsp; Without the murders, we'd never have had Nixon and Reagan and Cheney and Bush and Rumsfeld.</p>

<p>If we ever can get the United States on track again, then, only then, can we cease to grieve.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

Used to work wonders.</p>
<p>The system doesn&#39;t work any more?&#0160; Why?&#0160; Because my antiquated ears no longer register high-pitched sounds. I can&#39;t hear mosquitoes until one of them pecks on my eardrum.&#0160; I&#39;m vulnerable to sneak attack.&#0160;</p>
<p>It&#39;s bad: all mosquitoes are now stealth mosquitoes. It&#39;s good: I&#39;ll never again be troubled by that nasty whine.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Regular readers (and even stray internet pilgrims) know that Dr. M. has composed a series of entries called What We Read in the Fifties, in which he&#39;s revisited books that were noteworthy or notorious during the days of his youth. It&#39;s been a rewarding exercise, at least for him. Some of the books have been canonical novels that were required reading in English class at Erasmus Hall High School, some have been pop best-sellers which his more earnest teachers would have scorned, and some have been cheap sensational paperbacks passed under the desk from hand to grimy pubescent hand.</p>
<p>In the years that have passed since I first read these books, rivers have changed course, glaciers have melted, and American society has altered almost beyond recognition -- and yet the books have remained exactly the same. Reading them has been an exercise in nostalgia and a test of memory, and also an unwelcome insight into the incalculable callowness of adolescence. And yet, Dr. Metablog has found readers -- or, at least, he thinks he has, for in May and in December, when high school students all over America, yea, even across the waters, write their assigned term papers on <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2006/02/what_we_read_in.html">Lord of the Flies</a> or <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2006/02/what_we_read_in_1.html">The Catcher in the Rye</a>, blague-traffic spikes, and the dissenting views offered in these essaylets are plagiarized and offered to a new generation of English teachers, who reward them with grades of D or F.&#0160;</p>
<p>I fear, however, that my readers might have gathered an erroneous impression of 1950s Flatbushian youth -- that they might have been literate or intellectual. Let me clear my conscience and confess that for every hour that I spent reading books that had actual bindings, I spent ten hours reading comic books and an equal measure with my ear to the radio. It was the comics that taught me how to read; I was well along in years before I came to realize that there were such things as lower-case letters and that there could be sentences that didn&#39;t end with exclamation points! In my neighborhood, super-heroes (Batman, the Flash, Green Lantern, Wonder Woman) were as common as squirrels or starlings. But radio -- radio serials-- affected us even more than the comics. Radio stimulated the imagination, took us to worlds far way, presented us with alternative realities. Members of my age-cohort will not forget the glories of radio:Jack Armstrong, the All-American boy, who trotted the globe in support of native ideals and Wheaties; Bobbie Benson, the youth who inherited the B-Bar-B ranch in the Big Bend country, and who, along with Tex, Windy, and Harka, triumphed daily over snakes, droughts, famines and outlaws; the Shadow, who had the power to &quot;cloud men&#39;s minds so they cannot see him,&quot; and who taught us, every day, that &quot;the weed of crime bears bitter fruit&quot;; Sergeant Preston of the Northwest Mounted, who fought crime and bad guys in the Yukon with horse and dog (&quot;Well, King, this case is closed&quot;); and the Lone Ranger, who with the aid of Tonto and the &quot;thundering hoof beats of the great horse Silver&quot; and with the marvelous voices of exotic Detroit&#39;s Fred Foy and Brace Beemer, created an enduring mythology of a spacious but vague and unlocatable west.&#0160;</p>
<p>Radio gave scope to the listener&#39;s imagination. When television came along, and these programs were translated into a visual form, they were all inevitably diminished. It&#39;s no wonder that the great epics (<em>Gilgamesh</em>, the <em>Odyssey</em> and <em>Iliad, Beowulf, </em>the Icelandic sagas) are oral creations. The spoken word can cast spells that are beyond the capacity of visual forms. When it comes to heroes, a single word is worth a thousand pictures.</p>
<p>Radio prepared me for Shakespeare. It&#39;s a fact that when Londoners crossed the Thames to attend the Globe, they did not go to &quot;see&quot; a play; they went to &quot;hear&quot; a play. There&#39;s a world of difference between seeing and hearing. When we &quot;see&quot; a movie, 90% of the information comes to us through the eye. In a Shakespeare play, it&#39;s exactly the opposite -- 90%, or more, of the information comes to us by way of the ear -- which is why recordings of Shakespeare&#39;s plays can be so entirely successful and so true to the original intent. And because the plays are primarily oral, with their big speeches and complicated rhetorical patterning and brilliant displays of verbal acuity, they can also be larger-than-life -- and they can be heroic. Shakespeare&#39;s plays are closer to radio than they are to any other modern literary form. Those of us who grew up with radio bring to Shakespeare an intuitive understanding of oral forms that precede television, film, and even precede the theater itself&#0160; -- especially decadent modern theater with its compulsive and distracting visual distortions.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
