                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p><wbr /><wbr />Here are some career paths that it&#39;s just as well I didn&#39;t tread.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>1.&#0160; Taxi driver in a large city (especially a city that&#39;s not on a grid, such as Boston or London. Even the DC-diagonals drive me nuts). I&#39;ve earlier written about my incapacitating <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2006/09/geographical_dy.html">directional disability</a>, but I neglected to mention that I tend to get into a bit of a panic when I&#39;m lost --&#0160; I start driving much too fast and far too waywardly. So, dear friends, imagine me a befuddled cabbie, sweating super-profusely, while the fares in back scream bloody murder when I take the exact wrong turn for the fourth consecutive time. It would be a freakin&#39; nightmare. Related occupations that won&#39;t work: tour guide, wilderness guide, tracker.</p>
<p>2.&#0160; Dog-groomer. I&#39;ve hinted at my lack of affection for doggies <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2006/01/my_campaign_for.html">before.</a> I just don&#39;t think I&#39;d do a good job blow-drying Fido or brushing Fifi&#39;s teeth. (Incidentally, I&#39;m joined in my prejudice against curs by gentle Will himself, whose references to canines are uniformly unfriendly: the superbly wicked sisters in <em>King Lear, </em>for example, are &quot;dog-hearted daughters.&quot;)&#0160; &#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>3.&#0160; Trapeze artist. I&#39;m terrified of heights and I have absolutely no sense of rhythm. Imagine me launching myself at just the right moment to catch my partner by the ankles. Related opportunity for ignominious failure: dance instructor.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>4.&#0160; Surgeon.&#0160; I&#39;m far too squeamish to be poking around in someone&#39;s innards.&#0160; Even channel surfing has become a dangerous pastime since we accidentally acquired the live surgery channel.&#0160; Motto:&#0160; &quot;all gore, all the time.&quot;&#0160; I have to keep clicking that remote lest I accidentally pause at an open-heart moment. The FCC should mandate a warning and a five-second delay:&#0160; &quot;Caution:&#0160; palpitating inner organs on view shortly.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>5.&#0160; Hostage.&#0160; Chained to a bed somewhere in the &#39;stans wouldn&#39;t work for me. I must have my oatmeal every morning at 7 a.m., and I need to move my bowels shortly afterward. Moreover, if I don&#39;t eat lunch right on time, I get wicked headaches. Not to mention that I don&#39;t function well in rooms that are either too hot or too cold or not well ventilated, and which are peopled with chain-smoking guards. On the whole, I&#39;d be a mighty cranky hostage.&#0160; &#0160;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I wish I had pleasant dreams but I only have nightmares. Here&#39;s one of them. Beginning with early adolescence and continuing to this day, I&#39;ve had a recurring dream in which I&#39;ve murdered someone--I don&#39;t know whom. The victim is always an unidentifiable male, and his death is always violent. Ordinarily, I beat him to a bloody pulp with a shovel. I have problems disposing of the gory body, but usually I bury it next to the neglected garage that lay behind our house on East 9 Street in Flatbush where I lived my first seventeen years. It&#39;s an anguishing dream not because I&#39;ve killed someone, but because I&#39;ve failed to conceal the body properly and because I&#39;m going to be arrested and punished. It&#39;s amoral&#0160; -- I don&#39;t feel guilty that I&#39;m a murderer -- just embarrassed because I&#39;m incompetent. It&#39;s a very realistic nightmare. A couple of times it&#39;s been so vivid to me that even after I was wide-awake, it took me ten or fifteen seconds to realize that I was not being hunted by the police and that I could proceed normally with my life.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know why I should be so oppressed with this fantasy. In the daylight hours, I&#39;m your run-of-the-mill peaceful person. Never killed anyone.</p>
<p>Imagine my surprise when I read (and studied the illustrations of) J. M. DeMatteis&#39;s 100% autobiographical &quot;graphic novel<em>&quot; Brooklyn Dreams</em> (Paradox, 2003) and discovered that my nightmare is not entirely my own. DeMatteis suffers from exactly the same recurring dream. &quot;I remember the body -- buried out behind my apartment building... or maybe stuffed in a trash can across the street....&#0160; Some poor, innocent schmuck I&#39;ve either hacked up with a machete... or machine-gunned with Cagney-like ferocity... or maybe just kicked down a flight of stairs.&quot;&#0160; DeMatteis labors under the guilt that&#39;s provoked by this dream, and, like me, he can&#39;t explain it except to speculate that his life is a nightmare from which he&#39;s trying to awake.&#0160; But here&#39;s what&#39;s so fascinating to me: DeMatteis is a product of the exact same Brooklyn neighborhood as I (see <a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps/map.adp?formtype=address&amp;country=US&amp;popflag=0&amp;latitude=&amp;longitude=&amp;name=&amp;phone=&amp;level=&amp;addtohistory=cat=4+Newkirk+plaza&amp;address=4+Newkirk+Plaza&amp;city=Brooklyn&amp;state=NY&amp;zipcode=">map</a>).&#0160; He grew up at the corner of Ocean and Foster, and he hung out at Newkirk Plaza, a commercial island that would nowadays be called a shopping center, where I endured painful haircuts, carried my mother&#39;s dry cleaning back and forth, and entered and exited the BMT subway.&#0160; Was there something about Flatbush, or, more particularly, something about &quot;the Plaza&quot; that made us killers in our dreams. Yes, I rather think there was.</p>
<p>Is it significant that DeMatteis is a kind of replacement child? He is the survivor of a pair of fraternal twins. His potential sibling was spontaneously aborted -- although DeMatties speculates, that, prescient about life&#39;s forthcoming difficulties, he might have &quot;jumped.&quot; DeMatties&#39; mother was about to be &quot;scraped&quot; when the doctor had second thoughts. In <em>Brooklyn Dreams, </em>DeMatteis describes his mother&#39;s and father&#39;s hysterical, debilitating and inconsistent protectiveness -- traits often discovered in parents who haven&#39;t properly grieved the loss of a child.&#0160;</p>
<p>Is it possible that the person whom DeMatteis thinks he murdered is, on some level, the unborn twin?&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>And so we have still another variation of the replacement child syndrome.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>It was an entirely different world -- East 9th Street in the old days. Sometimes it seems so long gone that I find it hard to believe it even though I was there: the last horse-drawn vegetable trucks and milk-wagons in America, an &quot;old-clothes man&quot; shouting his cry in the street, an itinerant knife-sharpener with his pushcart. On the street, a few, very few, rusting 1930s automobiles (it was the war, and all the factories were turning out tanks). And me, in first grade, wearing hand-me-down knickerbockers with long socks as if I were some turn-of-the-century waif.</p>
<p>Next door to us was a two-family house. On the first floor, the very ancient Mr. and Mrs. Pynn, who tended their gladioluses in the tiny backyard. He was a retired merchant marine. (How did an old Cornish sailor come to live in our neighborhood?)&#0160; On the second floor were the Pynn&#39;s tenants the Rhodins, Thor and Pearl, who were at least a generation or so older than my parents and who had three adult children (Thor Jr, Yammie [actually Hjalmar] and Peggy) none of whom I ever met and whose existence I was aware only because Mrs. Rhodin would boast of their exploits -- Thor Jr. was a physicist who, she said, worked on The Bomb. The Rhodins were very quiet people. He, a tall, thin, aloof man who never spoke, was either unemployed or retired;&#0160; he emerged from the house twice a day to walk his poodle. Mrs. Rhodin &quot;went to business,&quot; as the saying was in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>One hot summer day, I was reading in the back bedroom. Windows (ours and the Rhodins) were wide open. Across the narrow driveway, I heard Mrs. Rhodin launch into a furious tirade. All the promises Mr. Rhodin had made to her. How little he had accomplished. The kind of place they lived in. Stuck in Brooklyn. She supported him while he lazed around at home. And other complaints that I couldn&#39;t understand or don&#39;t remember -- but there could be no doubt about her fury. Her litany of objections was loud and it seemed to go on for hours. A one-way street, though; I never heard Mr. Rhodin&#39;s voice.&#0160; Stunned, I shamelessly eavesdropped.&#0160;</p>
<p>Was it days, or weeks, or months later that Mr. Rhodin was run over by a bus on 18th Avenue and instantly killed?</p>
<p>Was there a connection between the tirade and the accident? And was it an accident?&#0160; Even in my childish naivete, I thought suicide. And because I knew Pearl and Thor&#39;s secrets, I felt as though I were a bit of an accomplice.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Yesterday the Yankees were drubbed, absolutely demolished, by the Detroit Tigers. Sent home packing. Their loss joyed my vindictive, Yankee-hating heart.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>When I was a boy hanging out at the P. S. 217 schoolyard and learning about life, there was no question but that the pin-striped Yankees were privileged bland tea-sipping Republicans, while the Brooklyn Dodgers were a bunch of upstart and underachieving heroes to whom we neighborhood kids could relate; &#0160;they were colorful, they were multicultural (before the letter), they were Democrats, and they were ours.&#0160;</p>
<p>I watched this week&#39;s games on the TV and savored not only the outcome, but all the pealing bells and slick technological whistles that modern TV can offer: the multiple replays, the ball-tracking systems that allow the viewer to inspect both the pitcher&#39;s grip and his release and also the spin he puts on the ball.&#0160; I could count the number of rotations on Kenny Rogers&#39; lovely curve.&#0160;</p>
<p>Although TV is amazingly informative, in my heart I prefer baseball on the radio -- the radio of my youth, that is. In those days, baseball was radio and radio was baseball. It&#39;s no wonder that baseball was the nation&#39;s game -- and it&#39;s only game -- when radio was the dominant medium.</p>
<p>I love the perennial rhythms of radio baseball: &quot;Steps to the plate... digs in... closed stance... takes a few practice swings.... steps up on the rubber... round comes the right arm...&#0160; slider low and outside.... &#0160;checks the runner on first...&#0160; looks down for the sign...&#0160; the pitch... high fly to left...&#0160; settles under it... two gone in the third....&quot;&#0160; It&#39;s an enduring, comforting sound.&#0160;</p>
<p>Radio baseball as I remember it transformed the players into larger-than-life figures. It romanticized them. Radio baseball was a never-ending oral epic, Homeric in dimension. TV, with all its wealth of detail, turns the players into ordinary mortals; it makes them too familiar, too common. It plucks out the heart of the mystery. It&#39;s impossible to believe that these young men with their stringy beards and their horrid tattoos and their acneed faces are reincarnations of the bronze-age superheroes of my childhood. If an announcer were honestly recording what the TV sees, it would be, &quot;steps up to the plate... digs in...&#0160; adjusts his nuts...&#0160; steps out of the box... spits a huge goober into the dirt...&#0160; now he&#39;s really excavating his left nostril.&quot;</p>
<p>Radio was reverent; television is intrusive.</p>
<p>Radio baseball was noble, and radio listeners were the better for listening to it. Radio baseball brought us together. On East 9 Street, where I grew up, there was very little in common among the Petrantos, the Burkes, the Bernsteins, the Constantinos, the Pynns, the Rhodins, and the Meinekes who populated the block&#0160; -- except that we could all talk about Cox, Reese, Snider, Robinson, Campanella. I have a strong memory of riding my Ivor Johnson (later my Raleigh three-speed) on a hot summer evening when there were so many people sitting on their porches, or on their stoops, or on the fire escapes listening to Red Barber and Connie Desmond that I could bike for many a mile and not miss a single pitch. Radio baseball turned us into a community. Which is why we&#39;ll never, ever, forgive that foul black-hearted traitor Walter O&#39;Malley.</p>
<p>But I&#39;m cheerful. It&#39;s autumn and the Republican Yankees have lost. It&#39;s a favorable omen. Is it too much to hope that, inasmuch as the Yankees have lost in October, the Democrats could win in November?&#0160; &#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>During the 1950s, I spent four long years treading water at Erasmus Hall, a jam-packed public high school at the bepigeoned corner of Flatbush and Church avenues.&nbsp; Among the required books in our overcrowded 11th grade English class was Willa Cather's prairie novel <em>My Antonia. </em></p>

<p>I've just returned to <em>My Antonia</em> after an interval of fifty years.&nbsp; It's an excellent novel, though I confess with shame that I remembered very little of it.&nbsp; I managed to retain a bit of the Nebraska atmosphere and emotion -- the empty, roadless steppe, the harsh winters, the sod houses, and the spirit of the indomitable settlers.&nbsp; I had absolutely zero recollection of the novel's details and not so much as a glimmer of the story.&nbsp; But then, there isn't much in the way of plot -- simply the history of narrator Jim Burden's socially confused and sexually troubled response to the &quot;Bohemian&quot; immigrant Antonia Shimerda, a vibrant girl (and later a woman) two or three years older than he.&nbsp; I remembered Antonia herself -- wild, willful, determined, and ultimately triumphant -- but I hadn't even a trace memory of Jim.&nbsp; Perhaps it's because Antonia remains in Nebraska where she tames her prairie acres and also births and nurtures uncountable children, while Jim, burdened with advantages and a middle-class education, leaves Black Hawk to become a lawyer for the railroad (in effect, an antagonist of the smallholding farmer) and, if I've read correctly, remains unmarried and childless, a rueful observer rather than an actor in the great pioneer epic.</p>

<p>I'm also astonished that I had no recollection of buxom, eager Lena Lingard, who teaches Jim about sex.&nbsp; Was I so virginal and naive that I was unable to construe Cather's circumlocutions? </p>

<p>I didn't remember, and surely didn't appreciate, that <em>My Antonia </em>is a lovely, evocatively written book, extremely economical and at the same time rich in telling detail.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

<p>When I read <em>My Antonia</em> for the first time, I hadn't encountered a plot of grass larger than the outfield at Ebbets Field (297 feet down the right field foul line), so &quot;prairie&quot; was a concept I had to take on faith. Now that I've been to Willa Cather country many times -- not yet to Red Cloud itself but to Hastings, where the author spent her adolescence&nbsp; -- <em>My Antonia</em> no longer seems quite so extra-terrestrial.&nbsp; Still, I wonder why the Italians and Irish and Jews and 'Negroes' who populated Erasmus Hall were supplied with such books-- <em>My Antonia</em> along with O. E. Rolvaag's no-longer-read <em>Giants in the Earth, </em>which is a desperately grim story of Norwegian immigrants in the Dakotas. I felt, and I think I was encouraged to feel, that <em>they </em>were the heroic, admirable, hard-working truly American immigrants, while <em>we (</em>shopkeepers, telephone linesman, garbage collectors, school-teachers) had somehow snuck in the easy, city way.&nbsp; Why weren't we asked to read books about us?&nbsp; Weren't we just as genuine?</p>

<p>Midway through the novel, Jim takes a few seconds to meditate on the relations between old families like his own (his grandparents came from Virginia) and the Czechs and Scandinavians whom they looked down upon.&nbsp; Conventional wisdom was that &quot;all foreigners were ignorant people who couldn't speak English.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;But today,&quot; says Jim, speaking as a surrogate Willa Cather herself, &quot;the best that a harassed Black Hawk merchant can hope for is to sell provisions and farm machinery and automobiles to the rich farms where that first crop of stalwart Bohemian and Scandinavian girls are now the mistresses.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;It's an observation that applies not only to the economics of Nebraska in the 1880s, but is perpetual to the American experience.&nbsp; Immigrants work hard.&nbsp; Is it possible that today's anti-immigration frenzy is driven by the fear that the present crop of brown-skinned newcomers will work so furiously that they'll leave in the lurch the neo-nativists who seem to have contented themselves with a lazy respectability?</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I once read the last 200 pages of Hardy's <em>Jude the Obscure </em>in a single hour.&nbsp; This extraordinary feat occurred in, I think, 1959 or 1960.</p>

<p>As a general rule, I'm not a speedy reader -- just about average, in fact.&nbsp; But for one splendid hour, I was able to read at four or five times my usual pace.&nbsp; I can't explain why except to say that I was so focused on Jude and Sue and Arabella that the whole world outside of that book just disappeared.&nbsp; Moreover, it wasn't only that I read rapidly --I read with insight and with imagination.&nbsp; I felt that I was in touch not only with the novel but with the author himself and that I could grasp and appreciate all of Hardy's contrivances and triumphs.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Thirty or so years later, I re-read <em>Jude </em>and I was astonished to find that my recollection of the novel was superb -- much more detailed and more accurate than of novels that I had recently read or re-read.&nbsp; What a difference from my usual plodding self!&nbsp; What a joy it must be to be truly intelligent about books!</p>

<p>It's obvious that my mind, and everyone's mind, must have much greater capabilities than it ordinarily exhibits.&nbsp; If only we knew how to access that ability.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Three or four times in my life, at a concert or listening to music at home I've felt myself jump to a higher level of understanding.&nbsp; All of a sudden, the form of the music -- even of complex music-- becomes crystal clear and the inevitability of the next note becomes plain.&nbsp; I seem to know what the composer thought he was doing.&nbsp; And then, after a few moments, I become self-conscious and self-aware, the flood of insights wanes, and I decline to my usual, rather pedestrian level of appreciation. </p>

<p>I also had one unique experience when I was between sleep and awake and a tune was repeating itself in my head, and just like! that I started to create interesting variations on the theme.&nbsp; Composers sometimes say that they transcribe music that they hear in their brains, and for a brief moment, it was as though I myself was a composer.&nbsp; But alack, after a few short moments, I came to conscious realization of what was happening and I was roused from my reverie;&nbsp; creativity screeched to a halt.&nbsp; I've never been able to revive within me that particular symphony and song.&nbsp; </p>

<p>It's also happened that while I'm writing something, I enter what could be called a trance state and the world seems to drop away.&nbsp; It's then that I can write four or five good pages in the same amount of time in which I would usually grind out a hundred or so words.&nbsp; It almost seems as though I engage a part of my brain that's not ordinarily available.&nbsp; Rimbaud once remarked that &quot;literature is my unconscious talking to your unconscious.&quot;&nbsp; Maybe geniuses are those who can achieve a level of concentration that allows them to delve into inaccessible areas of the brain.&nbsp; There's a story about Charles Dickens:&nbsp; it's said that he wrote the death scene of Little Nell in the midst of a crowded party and that while he was plying his quill, tears were running down his face and that he was totally oblivious to the noise around him.&nbsp; He was there, in the room, but in another sense, he wasn't there.&nbsp; </p>

<p>It happened to me two or three times that I was speaking to a group when all of a sudden I became aware that I was constructing elegant and artistic paragraph-length sentences -- that my vocabulary had enlarged and that my metaphors were apt and expressive.&nbsp; I can even remember admiring my sudden burst of eloquence-- as though I was simultaneously both performer and observer.&nbsp; But then, after a few moments, the synaptic connections that transformed me into an accomplished orator short-circuited and my supernova sentences reverted to mere competence.&nbsp; Wouldn't in be wonderful to be effortlessly eloquent!&nbsp; One can only lament.&nbsp; But to look on the bright side -- I'm fortunate to have had a few grand moments.&nbsp; Even Kekule only dreamed his benzene rings into existence one single time.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I was not a committed moviegoer as a youth -- punchball, basketball, softball, stickball in the street all having more appeal. But often enough, on a Saturday, especially when the weather was bad, there were double-feature matinees at the Leader Theater on Coney Island Avenue.&#0160; =Admission for children was fourteen cents when I first started attending; I think that by the time I reached high school the price had risen to as much as a quarter. It was a harmless way to spend a long afternoon. The theater was usually over-crowded with noisy ragamuffins who threw popcorn at each other during the love scenes. There was an impotent &quot;matron&quot; with a flashlight who had the frustrating job of maintaining a modicum of order.</p>
<p>Musicals mystified me-- I remember waiting for the dance numbers to end so that we could get on with the plot. I loved westerns and detective stories and tolerated, though I was frightened by, the war movies.</p>
<p>In the cavalry-and-Indian movies (Stentorian voice :&#0160; &quot;In the Years Following the Civil War...&quot;) there was a recurring scene that made quite an impression on me. Indians have attacked an &quot;isolated farmhouse&quot; or a wagon train. The colonel who has just come from West Point to take command of Fort Apache or Fort Bragg or Fort Collins summons the wizened scout who has spent his life on the frontier. The fresh-faced colonel tells the experienced old buckaroo that he&#39;s heard that there are Indians camped down by the bend of the river, and that he&#39;s going to send a detachment of troops to teach them a lesson. The scout looks at the arrow that the colonel shows him, and says, &quot;But colonel, them Indians down by the Brazos (or Snake or Powder or whatever river it happened to be that particular Saturday matinee) are Comanche; this here&#39;s a Kiowa arrow.&quot;&#0160; But the bull-headed, ignorant colonel won&#39;t listen. As far as he&#39;s concerned &quot;they&#39;re all injuns,&quot; so he orders an attack, and soon the whole frontier is in flames and before the movie comes to an end, settlers are hatcheted and the Kiowas are decimated.</p>
<p>Now I&#39;m sure that George Bush went to see the same movies as I did. But he couldn&#39;t have grasped their point; it was far too subtle for his intelligence. He must have thought that the stubborn colonel analyzed the situation correctly when he said that &quot;injuns is injuns,&quot; because nowadays&#0160; we have a foreign policy that says, if we&#39;re attacked by Al-Quaeda, let&#39;s just turn around and revenge ourselves on the Iraqis. After all, Arabs is Arabs. The result: the entire frontier is in flames.</p>
<p>There was a recurring scene in the war movies as well. An American soldier, or a French resistance fighter, has been captured by the Germans. He refuses to talk; won&#39;t spill any secrets.&#0160; The German colonel says to him: &quot;ve haf ways of making you talk. I&#39;ll haf to turn you ofer to <em>him.&quot; </em>And then the camera would focus on an obvious sadist in an SS uniform, licking his lips. Next there was a brief but terrifying shot of the captive sweating and screaming.&#0160;</p>
<p>In dozens of films, the villainous Germans routinely employed torture. Americans and their allies, on the other hand, were brave and upright and honorable and played by the rules.</p>
<p>I can guarantee that at this moment there are movies being made all over the world in which the colonel is American and the sadist is CIA. And these films are going to be watched on Saturday afternoons by generations of children.</p>
<p>What has George Bush done to us?&#0160; What have we allowed him to do?</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>[January 17, 2012.&#0160; There are at this moment three pages of comments appended to this entry, which I wrote almost six years ago. The comments are most interesting and revealing.&#0160; Don&#39;t miss &#39;em -- Vivian].</p>
<p>In <em>The Accidental Tourist </em>(New York [Knopf], 1991), Anne Tyler describes a malady that, as far as I know had never before been acknowledged in literature.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span>All four of her eccentric Leary siblings share &quot;a total inability to find their way around.&quot; Macon Leary, who writes travel books for a living and is the novel&#39;s focal character, christens this trait &quot;geographical dyslexia.&quot;</p>
<p>I&#39;m not convinced that &quot;geographical dyslexia&quot; is a good name for the Learys&#39; condition. An alternative, &quot;directional disability,&quot; is not much better. Whatever the name, sufferers will know what is meant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span>There&#39;s a class of people (I&#39;m one of them) who are chronically lost; who take a few steps in a strange city and can&#39;t find their way back to the hotel; who don&#39;t know how to exit the building they&#39;ve just entered because they&#39;ve strolled a corridor or two; who are totally befuddled and even panicked when they drive into a familiar intersection from an unaccustomed direction; who break into a cold sweat when someone says, &quot;you know how to get home -- just reverse the directions&quot;; and who, because they&#39;re frequently lost, are subject to ridicule and mockery from their very own families and from their most intimate friends.</p>
<p>Macon Leary has a theory about his persistent dysgeographica. He thinks he&#39;s disabled because all his life he&#39;s moved from house to house, and &quot;people who&#39;d been moved around a great deal never acquired a fixed point of reference, but wandered forever in a fog.&quot; I know of no evidence to support this wholly improbable suggestion. Macon clutches at a straw because there&#39;s no data (and there&#39;s no data, at least in part, because there&#39;s no accepted name for his condition).</p>
<p>Every sufferer nurses his own unscientific, anecdotal theory. I was once convinced that my dysgeographica was related to my total absence of rhythm -- as a child I could never learn to pump a swing or even to jump rope. My brother thinks that it must be connected to his aversion to heights. My niece takes the view that it&#39;s somehow related to her motion sickness and to her bouts of dizziness. A friend thinks that the trouble stems from the fact that she was naturally left-handed but was trained to be right-handed. In fact, no one knows whether dysgeographica is connected to any other trait, or whether it&#39;s one of a cluster of traits.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> In terms of hard science, the</span> directionally disabled have been allowed to languish in the dark ages.</p>
<p>I&#39;m almost convinced that dysgeographica runs in families. My father was monumentally disabled, and one of my brothers is so impaired that he&#39;s occasionally looked to me for directional advice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> Barking up the wrong tree, is he!! </span>(I have another brother who always knows exactly where he is -- perhaps he&#39;s adopted.) In <em>The Accidental Tourist,&#0160; </em>Anne Tyler, who&#39;s a very sharp observer of mankind, tellingly attributes dysgeographica to all four Leary siblings.Tyler also notes that Macon has learned how to cope: he &quot;kept a stack of index cards giving detailed directions to the houses of his friends -- even friends he&#39;d known forever.&quot; Coping mechanisms are essential to the dysgeographical. When I have to drive any distance without a navigator, I write the directions with a thick pen in a notebook and keep it open on the passenger seat. For some reason, I can&#39;t seem to retain more than one or two of the approaching turns in my mind, so I must continually refer to the notebook. Mapquest has proved to be a boon, especially if I remember to print out in very large type.</p>
<p>In <em>The Accidental Tourist</em>, no one pokes fun at the Leary siblings. But in real life, it&#39;s considered quite amusing to laugh at the chronically lost. People don&#39;t understand that dysgeographica is a disability like colorblindness. I can&#39;t say how many times I&#39;ve been instructed to &quot;concentrate,&quot; or &quot;pay attention&#39; -- advice which is just as effective as commanding a color blind person to make an effort to register shades of yellow or blue. Without a label and without a support group, the dysgeographical will continue to be ridiculed. It&#39;s time for us to unite. Unless we do so, we are not only doomed, like Macon Leary, to be &quot;adrift upon the planet, helpless, praying that by luck [we] might stumble across [our] destination,&quot; but doomed to be humiliated as well.</p>
<p>(July 22, 2007.&#0160; I&#39;ve written again on directional dyslexia.&#0160; If anyone is interested, take a look <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2007/07/good-news-for-t.html">here, </a><a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2007/06/a_mental_prosth.html">here,</a> and <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2007/06/travels_with_do.html">here. </a>&#0160; &#0160;And now one <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2008/02/confessions-of.html">more.</a>)&#0160; And <a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2010/05/still-another-directional-dyslexic-anxiety.html" target="_self">also.</a></p>

S. 217 and its neighborhood.&#0160;</p>
<p>Newsflash!! It now appears that P. S. 217 contributed to the worldview of the century&#39;s finest cartoonist, the <em>New Yorker&#39;s </em>Roz Chast.</p>
<p>I had long suspected that Roz Chast was a neighborhood girl -- where else but in darkest Flatbush would a nine-year-old go to bed with &quot;The Big Book of Horrible Rare Diseases?&quot; The most overt clues to her place of origin are found in the &#39;cartoon a clef&#39; &quot;Ultima Thule,&quot; in which a young girl imagines life in various exotic non-Flatbush neighborhoods: &quot;Red Hook, which was filled with drunken sailors, loose women, and stevedores; Flatland, which stretched flatly and unpopulated, into oblivion; and Sea Gate, with its maze of Venetian canals, from which, once you entered, you&#39;d never emerge.&quot; In the last panel of this masterpiece, a girl in a green pleated skirt floats freely in outer space: &quot;I just wanted to see what was on the other side of McDonald Avenue.&quot;</p>
<p>McDonald Avenue, during my childhood, was the outer limit of homey Flatbush. Every once in a while, when I was feeling particularly adventurous, I&#39;d ride my bicycle across McDonald, but I always hustled back. Two reasons: a) it was different there -- different architecture, different kinds of stores, different people, and b) the streets ran at a 45 degree angle to the norm. Very scary, very &#39;here be dragons.&#39;&#0160;</p>
<p>I had a job on McDonald Avenue when I was in high school: I shelved books at the Kensington Public Library (which was scarcely more than a storefront operation), but the building was on our side -- the Flatbush side -- of the street. I don&#39;t think that I ever crossed to the foreign side -- why would a sane person want to do such a thing? So my intuition was that if Roz Chast grasped the mystical end-of-the-earth aura of McDonald Avenue, she had to have grown up somewhere in the vicinity of P. S. 217.&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; <em>&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160; </em></p>
<p>More evidence:&#0160; In the <em>New Yorker</em> for September 4, there&#39;s a Roz Chast bildungscartoon called &quot;What I Learned.&quot; After nursery school, where she was informed that &quot;if you swallow your gum, your guts get all stuck together, and you die,&quot; our young heroine &quot;went to grade school in [her] neighborhood.&quot; And there&#39;s a full panel of a square featureless brick building labeled &quot;P. S. 217.&quot;&#0160; The building doesn&#39;t resemble the P. S. 217 of my memory except for the concrete schoolyard and the chain-link fences that surround it, but it must be the real thing. The curriculum is ever-so-familiar: Vasco da Gama, &quot;Our Friend, Corn,&quot; chain-stitching. Although nothing about the compass and the protractor, for some reason.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>I had read that Roz Chast grew up in Brooklyn, and that her parents still lived in the old neighborhood. Just for fun, I looked up the surname Chast in the white pages. It&#39;s an uncommon name;&#0160; in fact, there&#39;s just one Chast in all of richly-populated Brooklyn. Here&#39;s the relevant <a href="http://mapquest.com/maps/map.adp?formtype=address&amp;addtohistory=&amp;address=345%20Webster%20Ave&amp;city=Brooklyn&amp;state=NY&amp;zipcode=11230%2d1450&amp;country=US&amp;geodiff=1">map</a>. The Chast apartment on Webster Avenue is a block or so from the corner of Newkirk and Coney Island Avenue where P. S. 217 is located; even more startling -- it&#39;s no more than a couple of hundred feet from East 9 Street, where I lived from age zero to age 17. Case closed.</p>
<p>Roz Chast&#39;s genius cannot be circumscribed.&#0160; She&#39;s the master of the mock-heroic for which Flatbush is famed; she&#39;s to the cartoon what Woody Allen is to movies -- someone who interprets the world through Brooklynish eyes. She&#39;s the sly queen of kvetchitude. And she&#39;s a graduate of fabled P. S. 217. I&#39;m so proud.&#0160; &#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Toward the end of July, while I was in Lyme, New Hampshire celebrating a friend&#39;s third marriage, I bit into a fancy cracker that was topped with a fragment of sun-dried tomato. With my tongue I felt what I assumed to be small stone. I spit it into my hand and after a few disorienting moments realized that I was looking at one of my very own teeth. Number 10, in dentist&#39;s language, upper left front.</p>
<p>I was shocked;&#0160; I&#39;m not used to teeth falling out of my head-- especially so undramatically. No pain, no cracking sound. I put the tooth in my pocket and found a mirror to inspect myself -- mighty vampirish, I thought.</p>
<p>The next day I saw a dentist down in Thetford and was advised that I needed a root canal, followed by a &quot;post and crown,&quot; which sounded less like a dental process than a London pub. A week or so later and I was off to White River to a root canal guy, who hummed Joanie Mitchell songs while digging into my mouth and kept checking the weather to see if he could get in a golf game before the rains came. I asked him why the procedure was so damn expensive and he muttered something mighty unconvincing about the &quot;level of technology.&quot;&#0160; What with the abscess and all it took two long visits for him to finish rooting around in my canal.&#0160; And then one day I took a drink of homemade lemonade and felt another tooth fall out, but -- false alarm -- it was just a lemon pip.</p>
<p>The root canal didn&#39;t do anything about the big empty space in my head.&#0160; I&#39;ve heard that there are some ladies who find that other-side-of-the-tracks look quite attractive, but in all honestly it didn&#39;t seem to do much for my woman. So back home to Colorado and a visit to still another dentist, who installed a post and also a temporary artificial tooth and sent me to the &quot;lab&quot; for a &quot;custom color.&quot;&#0160; The lab was a surreal experience-- way out in the country in a dumpy building there&#39;s a oversize space where several rows of white-coated-scientist types with microscopes and very official looking tools sat crafting teeth. Probably out-of-work sculptors, or possibly impoverished MFA students.&#0160;</p>
<p>Custom color -- why would I want a custom color? &#0160;After the house and the car, this prosthesis is going to be the most expensive object I own.&#0160; I think it should be gleaming white, not mottled and yellowed like my native teeth. I&#39;m paying big money, and I want everyone to know that #10 is brand new.&#0160; I wouldn&#39;t&#0160; buy a new car and immediately dent and scratch it, would I?</p>
<p>Another couple of weeks and I should be all custom-colored, posted, and crowned.&#0160; And from now on I&#39;ll remember to stay away from sun-dried tomatoes.&#0160; Dangerous stuff.</p>
<p><em>September 20</em>.&#0160; I&#39;ve been putting the old tooth under my pillow for a month now, but no luck.&#0160; Apparently the tooth fairy is indifferent to sexagenarian choppers.</p>
<p><em>September 28</em>.&#0160; The permanent fake tooth has now been installed. I like it better than the original. It does its job and it&#39;s not going to have cavities or fillings or pain. If I had the cash I&#39;d give thought to a full set.&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;</p>

                                <p>On the second Monday of September,1956, I found my way to Rockefeller Hall and my very first college class. It was a laboratory section of Chemistry 105.</p>
<p>There were more than a thousand people enrolled in the course.&#0160;</p>
<p>We had all taken a mathematics aptitude test, and I had been placed in an advanced section of twenty so-called mathematically gifted students.&#0160; (Only rarely in my lifetime have my skills been so badly misjudged.)&#0160; In my section there were nineteen young men, all armed with slide rules -- a device, now blissfully extinct, that I never mastered -- and one very pretty brown-haired brown-eyed maid (still sixteen, I was later to discover) with an athletic step and a musical voice. The guys, brandishing their slide rules, clustered around the young lady-- bees, or drones rather, drawn to the solitary flower. Many were the offers to help her insert her thistle tube into her cork. Alas, I could offer no assistance, introductory chemistry class being both the alpha and omega of my scientific career.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in despite of my laboratorical inadequacies, this sunny September day fifty years later, I&#39;m still married to that brown-haired brown-eyed young woman.&#0160;</p>
<p>So today we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the first sighting.&#0160;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>In my Vermont garden, I grow a number of different varieties of German (also called bearded) irises. One variety -- a bicolor I inherited a decade ago from my sister-- had died. I put a spade into the ground to see if I could discover the source of the problem, and I found that the rhizomes had deteriorated to a loathsome smelly unholy mess the consistency of overripe bananas. It was a truly disgusting situation and one that I had never encountered before. For the sake of garden sanitation, I dug out the decay and some surrounding soil and carried the filth to the local dump.&#0160;</p>
<p>Later in the summer, I read this sentence in a garden book: &quot;we cannot confirm the folk wisdom that bacterial soft rot in irises can be caused by horse manure.&quot;&#0160; I knew that rot in iris rhizomes could be spread by iris borers, but these irises were borer-free. On the other hand, I had been working the soil with load after generous load of horse manure. So perhaps there&#39;s some truth to the derided superstition. In any case, since I switched to fertilizing irises with the abundant droppings of sheep I haven&#39;t had a recurrence of the disease. But then again, I haven&#39;t been able to re-test the particular susceptible variety--it being an iris now extinct in my garden.</p>

                                <p>The pond, once brimful of brekkekkek-kexing, has become virtually silent. What&#39;s happened to all the frogs?&#0160; Is it acid rain?&#0160; Or is it the great blue herons who patrol the shoreline morning and evening?</p>
<p>I think we&#39;ve located the culprit. The pond has been colonized by catfish, specifically, by the brown bullhead or horned pout. &#0160;Omnivores that they are, the pouts must have been dining on those gelatinous strings of frog eggs, or perhaps even hunting down the tadpoles. At least that&#39;s the theory.</p>
<p>To reproduce, pouts scoop out a nest near the shoreline and deposit a cluster of eggs. Then they hover nearby for a week or so, fanning the area with their tails.&#0160; One pair made a nest just where we enter the pond to swim and they were guarding their clutch a little too aggressively, so I decided to take action. There I was, spade in hand and poised to strike. I felt as though I was a figure in a diorama at the natural history museum -- &quot;Paleolithic Man Hunted Fish with Sharpened Sticks.&quot;&#0160; My technique might have been primitiive, but nevertheless I managed to nail one of the ugly suckers -- a twelve inch guy with a flat face covered with nasty barbels -- and a few minutes later I planted him in the vegetable garden, where he&#39;s now recycling himself into tomatoes. Later in the summer, a guest caught a second pout with a net.&#0160; More juicy red tomatoes.</p>
<p>But what about the hatchlings and fingerlings?&#0160; Perhaps the herons are on our side.&#0160; Meanwhile, we&#39;ll put out a call for a fisherman. Although horned pouts are hideous, they&#39;re reputed to be good table fare -- not my table, however.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>We&#39;re looking forward to a froggy renaissance.</p>
<p><em>September 5</em>.&#0160; I&#39;ve now read in <em>Scientific American </em>that herons kill and eat catfish. They spear them with their long beaks, carry them to dry ground, and repeatedly wound them. Then they swallow them whole. So when the herons come to visit the pond, we&#39;ll have to maintain both distance and silence and let them work. It&#39;s good to know that the great blues are our allies.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>When I was no more than a hemidemisemiquaver, I would listen attentively as my mother sat at her old Hardman piano and sang ditties by Gilbert and Sullivan. I believe that the first song I ever learned “by heart” was “I’m called Little Buttercup” with its still mysterious “pretty polonies.” In 1947, when the D’Oyly Carte company made its first post-war American tour, I was taken to see a performance of <em>H. M. S. Pinafore</em>. I was utterly transported. No subsequent theatrical experience has worked equivalent magic. I still think that it’s a little miracle that I saw with my own rapt eyes such legendary Savoyard stalwarts as Ella Halman, Darrell Fancourt, and Martyn Green.</p>
<p><em>Pinafore</em> was the only stage play that I saw until I was past adolescence and out of the house. What could have prompted such uncharacteristic extravagance on my parents&#39; part? Whatever the cause, the result was that my infatuation with Gilbert and Sullivan&#39;s operas was early established. The attachment was difficult to sustain because there was no family phonograph; moreover, those thick, heavy albums of 78s would have broken the budget. I was fortunate to possess a tattered old anthology of G&#0160; &amp; S songs from which I would pick out tunes as best I could.</p>
<p>In college I had a roommate who was a genuine savoyardophile and who arrived with a &quot;hi-fi&quot; and an extensive collection of ‘long playing’ records. I took advantage of his resources and his knowledge. During the fifties and sixties I attended performances of the full G &amp; S repertory in various amateur and semi-pro productions-–even a rare <em>Utopia Ltd</em>. at the Loeb Drama Center in Cambridge. I also acquired a treasured collection of D’Oyly Carte and Glyndebourne performances on vinyl. During the seventies and eighties, I couldn’t clean the house or cook a meal without the assistance of Sir Arthur. But turntables and 33s went the way of 78s, and then the vinyl itself came to be sequestered in plastic tubs in the basement.</p>
<p>I was G &amp; S-less for a decade or so, but <em>Topsy-Turvy (1999)</em>, the great Mike Leigh film, rekindled an unfaded love. Now, sixty years after my first <em>Pinafore</em>, I’m compiling a new collection of recordings (everything’s out there on CD if you’re patient). I now own reissues of classic D’Oyly Carte recordings and also of a sparkling <em>Mikado </em>by the Welsh National Opera. In the fall, the entire collection will be transferred to the iPod. Who would have guessed that I&#39;d have gone through four or five new technologies in my lifetime? And yet the song remains the same.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">What is the attraction? Gilbert and Sullivan, I think, gave me early authorization to be silly. The operas licensed criticism of oppressive or irrational social norms. Everything was fair game. Inasmuch as I was raised in a rigidly conformist society, the G &amp; S precedent was a great liberation. I’m absolutely convinced that a great big hunk of my sense of humor was formed around a Gilbertian core.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When I was a boy, it was the clever patter songs that most struck me. They’re still good, and some are brilliant. Bunthorne’s soliloquy in <em>Patience</em>, in which he confesses that “he’s not fond of uttering platitudes/ In stained glass attitudes” is as fully on target now as it was in 1881. Simply substitute tired modish Derridadaism for the &quot;high aesthetic line,&quot; and “the meaning doesn’t matter if it’s only idle chatter of a transcendental kind” jumps right out at you.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">But nowadays, it’s not Gilbert&#39;s free-standing wit but Sullivan&#39;s glorious ensembles that cause the shiver of delight. Instances: <em>Iolanthe&#39;s </em>“Oh, many a man in friendship’s name”<em>; </em>Ko-ko, Pooh-Bah, and Pish-Tush singing “To sit in solemn silence in a dull dark dock”; in <em>Ruddigore, </em>the trio “In sailing o’er life’s ocean wide,/ No doubt your heart should be your guide/ But it is awkward when you find/ A heart that does not know its mind.” And many others, including, certainly, the quartet from <em>Yeoman of the Guard</em>: “Strange adventure, maiden wedded/ To a groom she’s never seen.” Still another transcendent moment: the high silliness in <em>Pirates</em>, when the assembled choruses kneel to sing the resplendent, ridiculous: &quot;Hail poetry, thou heaven-born maid… &#0160;All hail, divine emollient.&quot; I think that the touchstone of all touchstones is a truly wondrous brief duet in <em>Iolanthe, </em>when the lovesick Lords Tolloler and Mountararat, tenor and baritone, rejected by Phyllis, who chooses a simple shepherd over their dignities, leave the stage singing &quot;Neath this blow/ Worse than stab of dagger/ Though we mo-/ Mentarily stagger,/ In each heart,/ Proud are we innately,/ Let’s depart, dignified and stately.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In addition to the satire, and the splendid music, G &amp;S also supplies great big helpings of joy. G &amp; S manage to persuade me, at least for the duration of the play, to give credence to “rapture, rapture,” and that “pleasures come in endless series,” and “joy unbounded,” and “laughing song and merry dance,” and “happier than any/ A pound to a penny,/ A lover is when he/ Embraces his bride.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There’s much to deplore in Gilbert’s creations: nasty racism, an insufferable obsession with class (embraced even as it appears to be refuted), jingoism, which is sometimes satirized but often (as in the faux-japonisme of <em>The Mikado</em>) unconsciously accepted, as well as the constant distasteful bludgeoning of middle-age women. But just as we forgive Shylock in order to embrace King Lear, so we must suspend our moral indignation to revel in the best of Gilbert.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Last week, two of the grandchildren visited for a few days. We rented the DVD of the Central Park Kevin Kline-Linda Ronstadt <em>Pirates. </em>The kids were attentive, engaged. Next time they visit: more Gilbert and Sullivan. Perhaps we can plant a savoyardian seed.&#0160; &#0160;</p>

                                <p class="MsoNormal">People out there misjudge me. Marcia Wainwright, for example, is certain that I need to lose thirty pounds in thirty days. She proposes that I use her &quot;miracle African weight loss herbs.&quot; OK, maybe I&#39;m a few pounds above my fighting weight, but certainly not thirty -- what the heck is she thinking? Joellie Adella is concerned about my hair loss situation. Elsie Bertie thinks that I need fuller and more erotic lips. Susan van Elk wants to help me discover the benefits of a healthy colon. The &quot;enormity&quot; of my &quot;manhood&quot; is a worry of Penelope French; its lack of &quot;rockhardness&quot; seems to make Hoodiea Gordoni mighty eager to come to my aid. Jacklyn Hughes feels that my sperm count is low; she can help (but how? and for goodness sake-- why?). Thank you very much, guys, but I don&#39;t really need your assistance: hair, lips, colon, etc. are all doing just fine.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There&#39;s more:&#0160; Caroline McPherson and William McWilliams both think that I need to accessorize: she suggests &quot;bling watches and designer handbags&quot; while he proposes &quot;Rolex replicas.&quot; I don&#39;t know what Natasasha (sic) thinks she&#0160; knows about me, but, frankly, I&#39;m not especially anxious to employ her services as a &quot;screwbuddy&quot;; nor do I welcome the efforts of Ms. Ginger Snapz -- possibly a pseudonym -- who has big surprises in store for me and whose specialty is pole-dancing. These ladies have a wrong impression. So too does Teressa Brandel, who offers to solve all my problems by introducing me to &quot;horny teen barnyard slutzz.&quot; Not this grandpa.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Considering all the negativity, it&#39;s good to know that there are not only Russian princesses but also a former Nigerian cabinet official out there who are eager to improve my finances. They both have &quot;unbelievable offers&quot; for me. Sure I have to send a few thousand bucks to an offshore bank, but I&#39;m promised a return of great enormity on an investment that is rockhard.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>On March 10 of this year, I registered an objection to use of the word &quot;within&quot; in sportscaster-slang. Here&#39;s my complaint: &quot;Why in the living heck do they say that the Nuggets are &quot;within&quot; two points of the Lakers? &#0160;&quot;Within&quot; means <strong>less than </strong>than the proclaimed margin -- 1.9 points perhaps. Why not say that the Nuggets are two points behind?&#0160; Or trailing by two points?&#0160; But not -- goodness gracious -- &#39;within&#39;.&quot;&#0160; Now, at the website Language Log, an accomplished young linguist, Benjamin Zimmer, has independently offered a theory of the origin of this idiom. He claims that &quot;within&quot; is short for &quot;pull within,&quot; as in the case of a rower plying his oars to literally &quot;pull&quot; within a certain distance from his opponent. Over time, he says, &quot;pull within&quot; migrated from sports such as racing and rowing, which measure advantage in distance, to sports such as baseball and basketball, which measure advantage in discrete numbers, and where, he concedes, &quot;the metaphorical fit was not exact.&quot; It&#39;s an interesting theory, and it might very well be correct. It&#39;s consoling to imagine that there&#39;s a reason for the irrational use of &quot;within.&quot;</p>
<p>Zimmer is less persuasive when he moves from linguistics to chronology.&#0160; He claims that &quot;it became common by the mid-20th century for announcers and reporters to talk about teams pulling (to) within a certain number of runs, points, goals, or even games in the standings.&quot; He offers no evidence for the &quot;mid-20th century&quot; assertion. I can&#39;t say that my memory supports his version of history. I&#39;ve been listening to basketball games on the radio since just after World War II, when the NBA succeeded the old BAA, and I&#39;m moderately sure that I didn&#39;t hear the idiom &quot;within two points&quot; until the 1980s at the earliest. It was an unpleasant innovation in language that stuck painfully in my ear. To the best of my recollection, &quot;within&quot; was the relatively recent invention of Marv Albert&#0160; -- one of his limited repertoire of linguistic tics. Others: &quot;from downtown,&quot; &quot;served up a facial,&quot; &quot; yesss,&quot; &quot;a spec-tac-ular move.&quot;</p>
<p>Marv Albert, it may be remembered, was a protege of the late great Marty Glickman, sprinter and sportscaster, and (regular readers of these essaylets will be delighted to learn) as far as I know the only genuine celebrity to have set foot in the fabled P. S. 217 schoolyard. Glickman would not have been proud of Albert, who is less well known for his creativity in language than for his strange sexual <a href="http://www.mugshots.org/sports/marv-albert.html">exploits</a>. In 1997, Albert plead guilty to sexual assault. He had proved himself to be a man without a tad of castration anxiety and of exceptional, perhaps unparalleled, courage, when he first bit a woman fifteen times on the back, drawing blood, and then forced her to perform fellatio. A spec-tac-ular move!! Just a couple of months after the Albert nonchalance, Mike Tyson bit Evander Holyfield on both ears, taking quite a chunk out of one of them -- the left, I believe. I had high hopes for a great TV moment: the sportscaster Marv Albert interviews the boxer Iron Mike. Two Brooklyn boys discuss the theory and practice of oral incorporation. Yesss!&#0160;</p>
<p><em>May 19:&#0160;</em>On Language Log, Benjamin Zimmer <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003146.html">responds</a> to my reminiscence that &quot;within two points&quot; was a creation of the 1980s. He offers comprehensive evidence that the idiom &quot;pull within&quot; was in print as long ago as the 19th century. Although he hasn&#39;t offered a chronology for &quot;within&quot; without a preceding &quot;pull,&quot; and hasn&#39;t discussed radio basketball (how would he access radio archives, even if they exist?), he&#39;s certainly a thorough and imaginative researcher. But just because a phrase can be found deep in the archives somewhere, doesn&#39;t mean that it was in common oral usage. &#0160;&#0160;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>&quot;Earth Angel,&quot; by Jesse Belvin&#39;s Penguins, offered, or seemed at the time to offer, a succinct and accurate distillation of relations between the sexes. The song appeared in 1954, when I was a vulnerable 15-year-old, and was a monster hit, perhaps because of its ideological clarity. &quot;Earth Angel&quot; is of the genre that has lately come to be called &quot;doo-wop&quot;; in the P. S. 217 schoolyard, we just called it &quot;juke-box music.&quot; Here&#39;s a pithy stanza: &quot;Earth angel, earth angel, will you be mine/ My darling dear, love you all the time./ I&#39;m just a fool, a fool in love with you.&quot; The heart of the matter, and the essence of life as we knew it -- the simple-minded, retro-Victorian doctrine that&#0160; girls are angels, boys are fools.</p>
<p>Looking back, I have no doubt that such an oppressive formula was painful for girls. It must have been hard for young women who knew themselves to be flesh and blood to pretend to be angelic. But I didn&#39;t concern myself with the effect of the song on <em>them</em> -- girls were clearly and obviously different from <em>us</em>. Not that I knew anything at all about female culture; the world in which I lived was rigidly segregated by gender. I didn&#39;t have sisters and while the guys talked obsessively and ignorantly <em>about</em> girls, we almost never talked <em>with</em> them. Even in the high school lunchroom, girls sat to one side, boys the other. On the stoop, and In the schoolyard and the drugstore, we talked baseball, flipped cards, played softball and basketball and stickball, and practiced spitting for distance. I didn&#39;t have a clue what girls were doing -- probably at home starching their crinolines. It was therefore easy to believe what &quot;literature&quot; told us: girls were or should be beautiful, aloof, distant, polite, ethereal, sugar and spice and everything nice, and certainly not sexual -- in short, angels. Boys, on the other hand, were not just nasty and foul-mouthed, as we knew from first hand experience, but also pathetic, filled with longings that they gratified imperfectly several times a day, fumbling, awkward, big-eared, pimpled, and sloppy. The girls were all Bettys and Veronicas -- desirable but unattainable. Perhaps in better neighborhoods there was an occasional Archy, but at the corner of Newkirk and Coney Island, there were only Jugheads. We were, in brief, exactly what &quot;Earth Angel&quot; had described: anguished adolescent fools.</p>
<p>The notion that girls were unburdened by the flesh took a big hit when I found myself in one of those lower-level high school English classes where the disorder was such that weeks would go by without the teacher attempting a single lesson. Two very young but very tough girls (huge hair, pounds of makeup, stiletto heels, and bras so pointy that they could a bore a hole in the chest of any guy brave enough to risk an embrace) were discussing a &quot;health&quot; class in which chastity had been advocated by one of the maiden-lady teachers. One of the girls whispered: &quot;She should take up a candle and see how it feels.&quot; Whoa, daddy! And then, a few days after I arrived at college, on a dark, moonless night, I overheard one &quot;older&quot; woman say to another, &quot;there must be a mile of cock on this campus and I can&#39;t get six inches.&quot; At the sound of those words, &quot;angels&quot; all over America plunged to earth.&#0160;</p>
<p>And a few months afterwards, &quot;fool,&quot; too, gave up the ghost.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Here&#39;s a letter that I wrote to the local newspaper. It appeared in 1999 when AGGP retired.</p>
<p>&quot;I have read all sorts of commentary in this paper about the public school system -- letters from parents, students, board members and from both grudging and supporting taxpayers -- but I can&#39;t ever remember reading a letter from the spouse of a teacher. So here&#39;s the perspective of a person who has sat on the sidelines for almost forty years.</p>
<p>&#39;My wife, AGGP, retired this June from a career in teaching secondary mathematics that began at Warren Junior High School in Newton, Massachusetts, in 1960 and continued in the local schools, initially at the junior high school level and since 1977 at BHS.</p>
<p>&#39;In my considered opinion, public school teachers, especially secondary school teachers, rank among the genuine heroes of American society -- right up there with hospice nurses, smoke-jumpers, and astronauts.</p>
<p>&#39;Consider the conditions of employment. Perhaps readers of this letter can bring themselves to think back to their own youth, or possibly they can remind themselves what it was like to share a home with one or two young people. Remember the mood-swings and the erratic behavior. Then try to extrapolate from this recollection and imagine two thousand energetic adolescents crowded into an ungracious old building where the air is always too hot, too cold, or too fetid. Imagine a world in which the girls are slightly more rounded and boys just a bit hairier on Tuesday than they were on Monday. Two thousand hormone-fueled young people who are so supercharged that they can&#39;t make it from history to English without playing keep-away with each other&#39;s shoes; whose normal mode of greeting is to shoulder their best friends into a bank of lockers. It is a world of games and exuberance but I&#39;m sorry to say that it is also a world of troubles -- of cliques, of alcohol and drug abuse, of private pain and of public disorder. And yet five times a day, five days a week, an accomplished teacher manages to keep thirty or so of these young ones focused for fifty minutes on conic sections or sinusoidal graphs.</p>
<p>&#39;A high school is also a place of increasing expectations and shrinking resources. Five teachers in an office suitable for one. Larger and larger classes. it was only a few years ago that BHS&#39;s mathematics department could employ a para-professional to xerox the exams and keep track of the textbooks and calculators and overhead projectors. Not too long ago there was released time for a department chairperson to make the schedules and screen prospective teachers and advise students. No longer: the public as said, &quot;cut out the fat,&quot; and has decided that teachers can handle these chores between classes.</p>
<p>&#39;What happens after school is out for the day? Piles of exams and notebooks and homework to be read and returned tomorrow. Lessons to be prepared. I have seen with my own eyes that it is ordinary for a teacher to put in two solid ten-hour days on the weekend. And the phone calls. I&#39;d be willing to wager that there are several hundred people reading this letter who have called our home between 5 p.m and 9 p.m. because Amber or Zack has stopped attending classes and hasn&#39;t handed in homework for a week, or just &quot;can&#39;t get&quot; hyperboles, or will have to miss school next week because of a family ski trip.</p>
<p>&#39;And what of that much-vaunted summer vacation? In my experience, the first half is spent in a state of profound collapse, and the second spent gearing up for the the one hundred and fifty new students who will roll in come August.</p>
<p>&#39;But let me report on AGGP&#39;s response to working conditions that would crush mortals not as strong as your heroic secondary school teacher. &quot;I love my functions class. My algebra students are trying so hard. My basic students are great. They did a splendid job on matrices. I have such wonderful kids this year.&quot;</p>
<p>&#39;Is it a good job?&#0160; For those who are fortunate enough to have a genuine calling, as AGGP has so clearly had, and who possess tremendous physical stamina, and who can look with amusement rather than horror at an infected navel-ring, it&#39;s great; for others, better to choose an easier profession.&#0160;</p>
<p>&#39;And what are the rewards for four decades of teaching?&#0160; There is a warm retirement ceremony and a letter from someone in human resources, a plaque and a handshake and a very modest pension (health insurance not included).</p>
<p>&#39;But then there are the rewards that truly matter. The first is the pleasure of knowing that in an &quot;I, me, mine&quot; culture, a teacher has honored the precept that asks us to promote the general welfare. But more particularly, there&#39;s what happens whenever we stand in line at the movies or take a walk on the mall. &quot;Oh, Mrs. P. You don&#39;t remember me, but I was in your algebra class a few years ago. I&#39;ve been meaning to write to you and thank you. I learned so much in your class. Now I&#39;m a doctor/engineer/chemist/businessperson.&quot; And not regularly, but every once in a while: &quot;Oh, Mrs. P. You&#39;ll never guess. I&#39;m a teacher now. it&#39;s exhausting but I love it. You&#39;re my model. And someday I hope to be as good a teacher as you.&quot;&#39;</p>

<p>It&#39;s a writing family. The direct descendants of Isaiah and Eta have produced books on a wide variety of subjects.&#0160;</p>
<p>It began when my father construed and annotated the standard form of real estate contract. And then my brother Jon published that novel about the dance and another family member of his generation wrote that introductory book about Shakespeare and a bunch of stuff on English literature. NGP&#39;&#39;s book on election technology. My cousin Marian&#39;s twin daughters (upon whom I haven&#39;t set eyes since their grandfather&#39;s funeral, which was in 1965, I believe) have written a number of books. Nancy, a folklorist wrote about <span class="GrayText10"><span class="GrayText11">the hammered dulcimer and about musical instrument making in New York in earlier centuries. Nora, a medical anthropologist, has written a classic account of sign-language on Nantucket as well as volumes about third-world medicine. And then there&#39;s Eve&#39;s journalism (not yet in hardcover). If we look to the descendants of Isaiah&#39;s father, we can include Hiram C&#39;s book on global justice.&#0160; </span></span></p>
<p><span class="GrayText10"><span class="GrayText11">I bet there are other books -- I&#39;ve lost track of many members of the extended family.&#0160; </span></span></p>
<p><span class="GrayText10"><span class="GrayText11">Also:&#0160; my sister-in-law Ellen&#39;s book on the internet; my daughter-in-law&#39;s writings on advanced technology, and probably all sorts of other things by non-genetic family members.&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; <br /><br />I have no statistics, but I&#39;d guess there&#39;s a higher concentration of published authors in our family than in most. Is there a gene for scribbling?</span></span></p>
<p><span class="GrayText10"><span class="GrayText11"> &#0160;It&#39;s interesting to me that except for the one novel, there are no other stories, poetry, screenplays.Our inheritance: facts rather than fantasy.&#0160;<br /></span></span></p>

                                <p>My father played excellent tennis and basketball -- he was a guard on the CCNY team under Nat Holman until he left school to put a few cents in the family coffers.&#0160; During the 20s and 30s he also played some semi-pro baseball. He&#39;d make $5.00 or $10.00 a game as a &quot;ringer&quot; -- and in those days, an extra buck or two went a long way.</p>
<p>He was a catcher and had the busted-up fingers to prove it. He paid for the broken bones when the arthritis caught up with him. Although he had been an unusually strong man, in his last years he didn&#39;t have enough left in his twisted fingers to pull the match out of the matchbook to light his pipe. But he could still discuss &quot;inshoots&quot; and &quot;outshoots.&quot;</p>
<p>Sometime in the early 80s (it was after mom died), he was in the hospital recuperating from a hip replacement. He was not a good patient and the confinement left him testy and bored, but he could be a little cheered by watching whatever sports were on the TV. One day I visited him and found the television off.</p>
<p>&quot;Pop, there&#39;s a Yankee game on. Why aren&#39;t you watching it?&quot;</p>
<p>He waved his gnarled old hand. &quot;American League. DH rule. Not baseball.&quot;</p>
<p>I&#39;m glad he didn&#39;t have to see the changes since he left the scene. It&#39;s a new, impermanent, history-hostile, TV-friendly, high-scoring production: franchises jumping all around the country; new stadiums with mighty short porches; players coming up to bat wearing not only gold necklaces and earrings, but also helmet, gauntlets and greaves; the incredible shrinking strike zone; pitchers no longer allowed to knock down the over-aggressive batter; an epidemic of steroids that has led to&#0160; unnaturally bulked-up sluggers; balls flying out of the park as if the guys were playing Sunday-afternoon slow-pitch softball; mediocre hitters slamming 40 hr&#39;s a year -- not to mention baseball played in the thin Colorado atmosphere where the batted ball takes off like a rocket and where curve balls can&#39;t curve.</p>
<p>I know exactly what my father would have said: &quot;Not baseball.&quot;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>On the night of August 23, 1990, an eighty-pound, two-year-old female mountain lion wandered into our backyard.</p>
<p>The story appears in a book on cougar-human interactions (David Baron, <em>The Beast in the Garden</em> [New York: Norton, 2004], 182-187) -- a book which also contains a picture of &quot;our&quot; lioness, lying drugged on the ground (167).</p>
<p>My strongest memory of that encounter doesn&#39;t appear in the book and deserves a report.&#0160; The lioness was crouching on a low branch of a box elder, and a goodly number of police loitered on the street and in the yards and alleys waiting for the wildlife-control officer and his tranquillizing dart. Eventually the marksman arrived and shot the lioness. The animal leaped down from the tree. As soon as she hit the ground and started to run, we could hear the sound, resonating throughout the neighborhood, of car doors being slammed shut as the officers rushed into their vehicles -- to re-emerge only when the lioness collapsed.</p>
<p>Last week, there was another mountain lion in a near neighbor&#39;s backyard. It was daylight;&#0160; the owner of the house had her video camera available and produced a very clear record of a magnificent animal -- much larger and more formidable that the one we had seen. Two nights ago, the neighbors held a meeting and the author <em>of The Beast in the Garden</em>, who lives in town, came to tell us about cougars in our county and what to do if we encounter them. The good news is that the odds of being attacked are small: only one local person (a high school student jogging alone near Idaho Springs) has been killed -- or taken, the word is -- during the last decade. The author&#39;s advice: bring a companion with you when you go walking in the mountains-- it&#39;s unlikely that a catamount will attack two people, and if he should attack, then there are two of you to fend him off. (He didn&#39;t repeat a familiar bit of local humor: &quot;Always bring&#0160; a friend with you when you walk in mountain-lion country. Remember, you don&#39;t have to outrun the lion; you just have to outrun your friend.&quot;)&#0160; He also reminded the audience that it&#39;s wrong to run away (because you will look like prey) but that you should make yourself look big, make noise, throw rocks, etc. Do not, repeat do not, play dead -- or worse yet, get down on all fours and try to crawl away. But on the whole it&#39;s not the mountain lion you see who&#39;s the danger; it&#39;s the mountain lion whom you don&#39;t see, but sees you. The one you feel.</p>
<p>A jogger was in the mountains with his faithful pooch at his side.&#0160; He came to the top of a rise and there, on the road, was a big panther.&#0160; The jogger&#39;s dog immediately disappeared into the roadside vegetation. The man did everything right -- shouted, threw things, stared the lion down. Eventually, and slowly, the big beast moved away and the jogger continued on his run. When he came to the bottom of the hill, Faithful Companion, who had taken the long way around,&#0160; reappeared and resumed running&#0160; with his master.</p>
<p>Man&#39;s best friend, but within sensible limits.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>A friend, a retired nurse, was keeping watch when her ninety-plus-year-old mother was about to breath her last. The mother, who had not been coherent for some days, was either unconscious or sleeping deeply when she suddenly roused herself, looked closely at the daughter, uttered the words &quot;you need rouge,&quot; and died.&#0160;</p>
<p>This story is self-explanatory but nevertheless I feel compelled to embark on a course of no doubt supererogatory explications. The mother expresses a variety of emotions: some positive, some not so good.&#0160; Primarily she is affectionate and protective. She wants her daughter to take care of herself and be her best, so she proposes a practical cosmetic enhancement. But at the same time, she is intrusively judgmental, because the statement &quot;you need rouge&quot; clearly finds the daughter deficient and in need of cosmetic enhancement.</p>
<p>&#0160;The mother is also impolite -- but only in the way that people who know each other intimately can sometimes be unmannerly. This particular mother wouldn&#39;t speak nearly so frankly to anyone in the world but her own daughter. In addition, she&#39;s competitive. &quot;You need rouge&quot; means not only &quot;you&#39;re pallid, you need help,&quot; but also hints at &quot;I never needed rouge.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#39;s a humorous anecdote, because it&#39;s about the eternal continuity of mothering.&#0160; Even at the moment of death, the mother remains entirely and unequivocally maternal. The phrase &quot;you need rouge&quot; also makes us smile because it displaces other last words&#0160; -- words of wisdom or serenity or love -- that we might anticipate or for which we might hope.</p>
<p>And what about the daughter?&#0160; Was she, or should she be, pleased, resigned, offended, amused?&#0160; &#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>We&#39;re in Washington&#0160; D. C., this week and inadvertently wandered by the Mayflower Hotel. &#0160;</p>
<p>A memory: in July of 1952, I stayed at the Mayflower for a few days with my father&#39;s sister, my peripatetic and eccentric Aunt Mollie. It was a rare and unique event. I came from an automobile-less family, and my parents were not in the slightest bit adventurous. The trip to Washington was the sole occasion in my childhood when I was in a city other than New York (and by New York I mean deepest Brooklyn, with an occasional foray to the Bronx Zoo or to the Museum of Natural History). It&#39;s hard to convey the full measure of the naivete with which this schoolyard boy approached a new city. I knew that Washington was smaller than New York and therefore assumed that it would consist of a smaller Brooklyn, a smaller Manhattan, etc. I had no conception that different cities had different geographies -- let alone different characters.</p>
<p>Highlights:&#0160; the Lincoln Memorial (I was exhilarated), the Jefferson Memorial, a boat ride to Mount Vernon. My strongest memory is of exciting and down-to-earth Harry Truman addressing a crowd from the base of the Washington Monument on the Fourth of July. The result of this voyage into the unknown was the realization that there were other cities, that they were accessible -- in short, that there was a world elsewhere.</p>
<p>I&#39;m permanently indebted to my Aunt for allowing me the opportunity to grasp such a big idea.</p>
<p>And also that there was such a thing as a restaurant. It might seem incredible, but from birth to college, I didn&#39;t enter a restaurant more than a half-a-dozen times at the very most. In our family, there was neither the money nor the inclination toward such extravagance. I still consider it a something of a miracle that a guy like me can walk into a shop, sit down, and that people will generously put food on my plate. All that I have to do in return is fork over a few bucks. &#0160;</p>
<p>Exactly thirty-five years later, I stayed at the Mayflower a second time when AGP was honored and celebrated. At this Mayflower reprise, it was not Truman but Ronald Reagan whom we encountered. I remember the dyed hair, the unnatural orange skin, the ventriloquist&#39;s-dummy delivery of the speech that was handed him, and the undeniable inference that he was already deeply incapacitated by the Alzheimer&#39;s that would eventually kill him.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>The American artist most dear to me is the impressionist William Merritt Chase (1849-1916). Chase painted <em>plein air</em> scenes in Brooklyn&#39;s Prospect Park and Coney Island and also produced a truly wonderful series of landscapes set in the south fork of eastern Long Island.&#0160;I knew nothing of these Shinnecock paintings nor of Chase himself until one day in 1987 when I happened upon an exhibition of his work in the National Gallery in Washington.&#0160;Even though I was much taken with the paintings, I was too frugal to buy the catalog.&#0160;By virtue of Amazon, I&#39;ve at last located a copy (D. Scott Atkinson and Nicolai Cikovsky, Jr, &quot;<em>William Merritt Chase, Summers at Shinnecock 1891-1902</em> [Washington:&#0160; National Gallery, 1987]).&#0160;</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/aimp/hob_67.187.123.htm">&quot;At the Seaside&quot;</a> (1892), a group of women and children enjoy a lazy day on an otherwise empty beach.&#0160;In the distance to the left is a sailboat and to the right, almost at the horizon, a sandy point. The costumes are of the 1890s, but the sea and the surf and the clouds are timeless. It&#39;s a busy but very peaceful scene.&#0160;Similar Chase <a href="http://magart.rochester.edu/VieO3061$104857*7874204">landcapes</a> depict sea-grasses, scrubby trees, sandy beaches, empty roads.&#0160;Many of his canvasses are populated by his wife and children.&#0160;</p>
<p>Fully as idyllic as Chase&#39;s &quot;Summers at Shinnecock&quot; were my own Wordsworthian &quot;Summers at Makamah Beach, 1947-1949.&quot; Although Makamah was on the Sound (on the north shore), it was as like as like could be to Shinnecock in the 1890s. My family spent three magical summers there -- the best summers and by far the best times of my otherwise entirely citified, asphalt childhood. We rented a very simple wood-frame beach house. If my memory is correct, the house was mostly deck with a minimal kitchen and a few sleeping rooms. It seemed like a great distance to the nearest neighboring beach house, but, in retrospect, it was probably no more than five hundred or at most a thousand feet. But to a kid from the schoolyard, a thousand feet was more than plenty. I loved the emptiness -- no trolleys, no radios, no people. I remember wandering alone for hours at low tide examining, with the patience of childhood, the crabs, snails, seaweeds and the infinite variety of dead fish. To my vocabulary, I added such novelties as inlet, point, cove, high tide, squall, blowfish, starfish, perch, sea urchin, shiner, sinker, fiddler crab, hermit crab, razorback, softshell, float, outboard and inboard, &quot;sheared a pin,&quot; oarlock, dinghy -- words and concepts previously beyond the outer limit of my imagination. There were porpoises almost every day -- once I was all alone on the beach when two of them battled furiously for several minutes right in front of my astonished eyes. No one else saw them, and no one believed me. There was also an abundance of horseshoe crabs-- not crabs at all, as I later discovered, but trilobites left over from the Paleozoic. I think it was the horseshoes that started me reading about paleontology. I remember also old Mr. van Etten, already more than a child when Chase was painting at Shinnecock, who took me out in his rowboat to trawl for bluefish.</p>
<p>Wordsworth wrote about his childhood&#39;s &quot;fair seed-time&quot; and that he was &quot;fostered alike by beauty and by fear.&quot; While it&#39;s easy to exaggerate the amount of fear back in 1950s Brooklyn, it&#39;s a fact that there was an almost absolute absence of beauty. Makamah Beach offered not only beauty and variety but also the possibility of different kind of life.&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I&#39;m not generally given to boasting, but it&#39;s a fact: the great Don Newcombe once spoke to me -- me! He asked me to refrain from conversing with him. This noteworthy event occurred in 1949.</p>
<p>During summer vacation, it was the custom for neighborhood kids to arrive at Ebbets Field early in the morning. The games didn&#39;t start until 1:30, so we&#39;d take a half a day&#39;s supply of salami sandwiches and stand outside the players&#39; entrance at 10:00 or so in the morning, hoping to catch sight of Robinson, or Cox, or Furillo walking up the ramp to the clubhouse.&#0160; After the stakeout, we&#39;d watch a couple of hours of batting practice, and then some fielding practice, and then there would be a long pause while the groundskeepers spruced up the field, and then we&#39;d listen to Gladys Gooding at the organ, and at last, anticlimactically, we&#39;d watch the actual game. I sometimes paid the 60 cents for a seat in the bleachers, but just as often I was admitted with one of the free tickets that were distributed by neighborhood fraternal organizations -- the PAL (Police Athletic League) or the Sons of Italy or the Sons of Norway. What a treat -- you could go to a Dodgers&#39; game and at the same time be Norwegian for a day!</p>
<p>One morning, there I was, loitering among a crowd of kids just as Big Don arrived. He was huge. I can&#39;t remember exactly what I shouted to him, but it was probably something like &quot;Hey Don. Are you going to pitch today? How&#39;s the arm?&#0160; Do you think you&#39;ll pinch-hit. Huh. Huh?&quot; Newk turned and looked directly at me and said, and I quote, <em>verbatim</em>, &quot;Shut up, kid.&quot;&#0160; What a thrill!&#0160; I had been noticed by the great man himself. It was a transcendent moment -- even more exciting than the time when, sitting in the left field lower deck, I scrambled for a home-run ball off the bat of third baseman Bobby Morgan (a ball that, to my eternal regret, I later sold for five bucks. But hey, five dollars could take you -- at 60 cents a ticket, two 5 cent subway fares, and another 5 cents for &quot;a big delicious glass of Nedick&#39;s tasty orange drink,/ It&#39;s cool refreshing flavor you&#39;ll adore&quot; -- to five or six games, one of which might be a double-header.)</p>
<p>How can I emphasize this sufficiently?:&#0160; Don Newcombe spoke directly, personally, to me.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s another event of titanic importance: in the last innings of a game, when the guards who policed the bleachers were too bored to pay attention, kids would sneak down into the good seats. At Ebbets, the Dodgers&#39; bullpen was along the right-field foul line, so it was possible to sit just behind the relievers and try to engage them in intimate conversation. One day I was involved in an exciting unidirectional chat with Hal Gregg, then on the downside of his career (he had won 18 games in 1945) when the frustrated reliever impatiently swung himself around and said to me, and once again I quote absolutely <em>verbatim, </em>&quot;What are you, kid, a magpie?&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>As long as I&#39;m in full bragging mode, I should also boast that I once possessed, on a treasured scrap of paper, the penciled autograph of Bob Ramazzotti, a Dodger infielder, who, in 1949, batted .154 with one home run and three rbi&#39;s.</p>
<p>Let me also add that it was considered the utmost pinnacle of schoolyard wit to sit in the front seats of the Ebbets Field upper deck and drizzle sticky orange Nedick&#39;s upon the spectators beneath.&#0160; &#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I know that I read <em>Lolita </em>sometime during my senior year in college, which was the last year of the socially-constricted Eisenhower presidency. Nabokov was a celebrity at Cornell and I remember attending a lecture in which he delivered a hilarious destruction of Soviet realism. He was the first novelist whom I ever saw with my own eyes (I had sat next to Tom Pynchon in a course in Eighteenth-Century English literature every day for a semester, but although Pynchon had published a story or two in <em>Epoch, </em>he was just another gangley guy and hardly the artist--or the enigma--that he would soon become).</p>
<p><em>Lolita </em>had been published in Paris in 1955, so it&#39;s just a bit more than fifty years old, and therefore halfway to its centennial, when, it&#39;s often asserted, it becomes possible to distinguish between works for the moment and works for the ages. An interim report:&#0160;<em>Lolita</em> is doing very very well.&#0160; It&#39;s as impressive now as it was then -- but for different reasons. When I read the novel In 1959, I was dazzled by its verbal surface: the allusions to Poe, to <em>Hamlet, </em>to Joyce (whose <em>Ulysses</em> I had read closely even then). Of course I missed much, especially because at that time I had read almost no continental literature. But I loved being able to decipher some of the novel&#39;s playful mysteries: that, for example, &quot;Vivian Darkbloom&quot; -- who is Clare Quilty&#39;s accomplice in crime -- was an anagram for &quot;Vladimir Nabokov&quot; and that Lolita&#39;s teachers &quot;Miss Horn&quot; and &quot;Miss Cole&quot; spoonerized an obscenity. It pleased me immensely that Charlotte Haze ordered a mattress from &quot;a firm located at 4640 Roosevelt Blvd., Philadelphia,&quot; because I had spent three dreadful summers working in the Sears Roebuck warehouse on Utica Avenue, where I might have composed an <em>Anatomy of Boredom. </em>I knew to whom &quot;Brown, Dolores&quot; alluded, and I knew why she squatted outside the gates of the cloister. And then there were Nabokov&#39;s extraordinary rhetorical displays. Had there ever been a novelist who cared enough to write a sentence like &quot;the least pressure would suffice to set all paradise loose,&quot; where &quot;least&quot; balanced &quot;loose,&quot; &quot;paradise&quot; balanced &quot;pressure,&quot; and &quot;set&quot; offset &quot;suffice?&quot;</p>
<p>I loved <em>Lolita </em>and I read all that I could find of Nabokov&#39;s early works and then all the new ones as they appeared. But it&#39;s been a long time since I last read the novel and the sexual abuse of children is no longer, if it ever was, a matter for flippancy. I was worried that <em>Lolita </em>would be insensitive and dated. But it&#39;s not so. It&#39;s still satirical, and it&#39;s still fun, but now it&#39;s less comic than it is sad. Humbert is still clever, but he&#39;s clearly a madman, and the murder of Quilty is the best apology that he can render to Lolita. Humbert knows he&#39;s the blackest of villains, that he&#39;s robbed Lolita of her childhood, that he lived in &quot;a world of total evil,&quot; and that &quot;even the most miserable of family lives was better than the parody of incest, which... was all I could offer the waif.&quot; The novel shocked Eisenhower America because it was thought to be lurid -- but it&#39;s no more lurid than <em>Oedipus.&#0160;</em>It&#39;s fully, designedly, and beautifully tragic.&#0160;</p>

Creating a DTD will not give us the versatility we want, so we have moved to a schema instead.&quot;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>We were in California tending the grandchildren (a girl, 6, and a boy, 4) while &quot;the daughter&quot; and her husband were on a sun-and-sand vacation down in Baja. The children are in the habit of coming into their parents&#39; &#0160;bed when they have trouble going to sleep. We&#39;re in the habit of reading aloud before putting out the lights. At present, I&#39;m reading <em>Swann&#39;s Way.</em> One night, the children, as is their custom, came in to snuggle. After they settled down, I resumed reading: &quot;I was not quite Bergotte&#39;s only admirer; he was also the favorite writer of a friend of my mother&#39;s, a very well read woman, while Dr. du Boulbon would keep his patients waiting as he read Bergotte&#39;s most recent book; and it was from his consulting room, and from a park near Combray, that some of the first seeds of that predilection for Bergotte took flight....&quot; The children fell almost immediately to sleep; Proust&#39;s undiagrammable sentences were too much for them.</p>
<p>The next night, same scenario. We&#39;re in bed. The children came in to snuggle; they thrashed about for a few moments, giggled, eventually settled down. I picked up Monsieur Proust. &quot;To Mme. Verdurin&#39;s great surprise, Swann never abandoned them. He went to meet them wherever they were, sometimes in restaurants in the outlying districts where no went went much yet, because it was not the season, more often to the theater, which Mme. Verdurin liked very much;&#0160; and because one day, at her house, she said in his presence that on evenings when there were premieres, or galas, a pass would have been useful to them, that it had inconvenienced them very much not to have one the day of Gambetta&#39;s funeral....&quot;&#0160; And then, the young lady looked at the young man, and he looked at her, and without a word, the two of them rose from our bed and padded back to their own room.</p>
<p>Literary criticism in its most elemental manifestation.&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I was at Peet&#39;s Coffee in Alameda, California this morning, drinking hot chocolate and reading <em>Lord of the Flies</em>. There were three retired guys a couple of tables away, chatting. I overheard the following story:</p>
<p>&quot;He was a lawyer for an intellectual property firm--a big-time litigator. He met this woman and fell in love with her. She wasn&#39;t at all interested. She owned a window-washing company. He quit his job and went to work as a window washer so that he could be close to her.&quot;</p>
<p>That&#39;s as much as I heard, but I would have liked to know what happened next. It&#39;s possible that the lawyer&#39;s perseverance was rewarded. The window-washer lady came to understand that he loved her so much that he was willing to give up his career to follow her. Eventually, she relented, married him, and together they developed the biggest window-washing company in San Francisco. But then again, perhaps she realized that he wasn&#39;t really in love -- in fact, he was one of those obsessive stalkers that regularly appear in horror movies. So she was forced to escape by selling her company, taking a new name, and moving to Pocatello. He continued to wash windows, and started to specialize in eighty-story buildings. One day, he failed to hook his belt properly and fell. No one ever knew if it was an accident or suicide. Meanwhile she was happy in Idaho, where she married a mild-mannered lawyer.</p>
<p>Or --another thought -- he forgot all about her but found that he liked washing windows more than corporate law. But one day, he was hooked outside a skyscraper window, and looked inside and there she was at a meeting. And he fell in love all over again.&#0160;</p>
<p><em>February 13:</em>&#0160; I now think it most likely that he forgot all about the lady, moved to rural Connecticut, changed his name to Seymour Glass, and became a recluse who lived a house with very clean windows.&#0160; &#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">In 1951, Herman Wouk won a Pulitzer prize for <em>The Caine Mutiny</em>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>The novel itself was a giant best-seller and along with it came the movie with Humphrey Bogart and also a Broadway play.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>It was a big 1950s literary event.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&#0160;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">It&#39;s almost exactly fifty years since I last read the book, and it&#39;s obvious why it was such </span>a triumph.&#0160;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"><em>The Caine Mutiny</em></span> is a first-rate popular novel: it’s long but fast-paced, clearly written, literate, suspenseful, timely, and patriotic. The characters are carefully differentiated (although they veer toward stereotypes).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>It’s memorable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>Parts of it were as vivid as if I had read them five months rather than five decades ago.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>I imagine that anyone who read the book, no matter how long ago, will remember “the strawberry incident,” “old yellowstain” and especially Captain Queeg and the two little steel balls that he rolls in his hand when he is under stress. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&#0160;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><em>The Caine Mutiny</em> is not a novel that requires sophisticated exegesis. Wouk is heavy-handed;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;h</span>e has a few points to inculcate, and he doesn’t allow his readers much wiggle room.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>Perhaps the lack of ambiguity accounts for the novel&#39;s popularity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>While the <em>The Caine Mutiny </em>raises important questions about war and authority, it resolves them too easily. Wouk lays on the patriotism with a trowel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>Although his navy is a nasty, inefficient place, individuals (at least American individuals) regularly rise above their institutions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>Wouk preserves the optimism about war that Tolstoy lost in the Caucasus.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&#0160;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">The main action of the novel turns on the mutiny and on the subsequent court-martial. There’s also an engaging secondary story that could have been extracted from a novel by John Marquand.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>Willis Seward Keith is an upper-class Princetonian whose mother opposes his romance with Marie Minotti.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>Marie is Italian, Roman Catholic, working-class, unschooled, and a night-club chanteuse to boot, and she may been to bed both with her (gasp!) Jewish agent and with her (horrors!) saxophonist.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>Is it possible that Willie can free himself from maternal authority and marry her? In the Marquand universe, he would jilt Marie, marry Constantia de Vere Buff-Orpington of the Newport Buff-Orpingtons, and live a respectable bland country-club (and sexless) existence. But Marquand was a proper Bostonian born in the nineteenth century, while Wouk was the son of Jewish immigrants who was born in the twentieth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>At first, Willie Keith bows to his mother and puts an end to his romance, but Wouk rescues him. When the U. S. S. Caine is kamikazeed, and Keith thinks he’s going to die, he realizes that he’s made a big mistake.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>He survives, writes a long, eloquent proposal of marriage, and in the very last pages of the novel seems to have persuaded Marie to come aboard.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;She&#39;s amenable and he&#39;s </span>euphoric, but whether or not Willie and Marie can make the marriage work is left very much in doubt.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span></p>
