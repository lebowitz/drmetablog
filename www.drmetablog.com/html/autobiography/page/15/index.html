		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">In Thomas Hardy’s <em>The Return of the Native</em> (1878), Clym Yeobright and Eustacia Vye are brimming with impetuous youthful lust.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>They meet at a deserted spot on Egdon Heath -- a “vast tract of unenclosed wild” in southwestern England. Here’s how Hardy describes their moment of passion:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; &#0160; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&#0160;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160; </span>“’My Eustacia.’</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span>‘Clym dearest’</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160; They remained long without a single utterance, for no language could reach the level of their&#0160; condition: words were as the rusty implements of a bygone barbarous epoch, and only to be occasionally tolerated.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160; ‘I began to wonder why you did not come,’ said Yeobright when she had withdrawn a little from his embrace.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&#0160;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">Instead of the eager hands and tongues that a modern novelist would supply, Hardy substitutes a sentence about the inadequacies of language. Even so mild an allusion to physical pleasure was shocking to Victorian moralists, who regularly rebuked Hardy for ‘vulgarity.’ Hardy’s last and best novel, <em>Jude the Obscure</em>, was derided as Jude the Obscene.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&#0160;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">I myself had no idea that Hardy was a breaker of sexual taboos when I first read <em>The Return of the Native </em>in 1955.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>During the fifty intervening years, I’ve read almost every one of Hardy’s many books, some of them--<em>Jude the Obscure</em> in particular—repeatedly and with great admiration.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>Why did I not revisit <em>The Return of the Native</em> until this past week?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>The silly truth is that the novel was required reading in English class, and inasmuch as I was an alienated and unhappy high school student, I made it a point of honor to dislike assigned books.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&#0160;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">There’s also a second and more substantive reason:<em>The Return of the Native</em> was truly disorienting for provincial city kids like myself simply because so much of it turns on landscape.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>The novel is all about the way various characters respond to Egdon Heath, a furze-covered “somber stretch of rounds and hollows,” that is isolated, extensive, unchanging, brooding, dotted with primeval pagan barrows, and populated by sheep, shepherds and heath-croppers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>To understand Hardy’s Wessex landscape,I would have had to overcome two barriers: my appalling lack of imagination and my inexperience with geography.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>Perhaps some of my classmates could visualize Egdon Heath.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>Many of them came from families that owned automobiles, and had consequently<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>voyaged beyond city limits.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>They had looked upon an expanse of land larger than a baseball field and upon feathered bipeds more exotic than the flocks of pigeons that guanoed the steps of the Newkirk Avenue subway station.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&#0160;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">Had I been less put off by unfamiliar scenery and less hostile to assigned texts, I might have recognized that sparse Egdon and my crowded concrete neighborhood had much in common. Both places were backwaters untouched by modernity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>Neither offered much in the way of education -– either individuals who possessed any, or schools that were genuinely dedicated to providing it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>My territory, like Egdon Heath, was a place which anyone who happened to prosper, even a little, speedily abandoned -- to the port city of Budmouth in Hardy’s world, and to “the island,” that is, the new prosperous suburbs of Queens and Nassau, in mine.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&#0160;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">In the 1950s, I myself had only one big idea -- that there must be a world elsewhere. Why then did I not sympathize with Eustacia Vye, whose sole and only desire is to get herself away from Egdon?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span>She is as out of her element treading aimlessly on the heath as I felt myself to be when I bicycled an endless series of claustrophobic streets.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>More to the point, why didn’t I identify with the reddleman Diggory Venn? Diggory lives alone in his spring-van and wanders the heath selling reddle (a red dye used for marking sheep).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>If I had been capable of reading imaginatively, I would have taken Diggory to heart.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>He is Romanticism’s archetypical outsider and a character whom I should or could have recognized as a fellow sufferer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>I too was solitary, introspective, and on a quest for knowledge, but these traits were not understood –- as I understand them now -- as healthy questioning but instead were stigmatized as psychological disability (“Why are you moping? Why is your nose always in a book?”)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>An understanding of Diggory Venn might have lent dignity and historical context to my private woes.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&#0160;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">Even more to the point: there I was, awash with the imperious hormones of adolescence, and yet unable to notice that, although reticent about gropings and thrustings, <em>The Return of the Native</em> attaches enormous importance to sex. While I was mesmerized by the superficiality of <em>Blackboard Jungle </em>and suchlike novels, I somehow failed to observe that Thomas Hardy was very very serious about love and lust, loyalty and betrayal, passion and jealousy — and that <em>The Return of the Native </em>challenges its readers to acknowledge that sexuality was as dangerous as it was redemptive.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>Was there a more important lesson for me to have learned? Did my sixteen-year-old self catch the least glimmer of it? Not the slightest.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">My daughter continues to urge me to write something autobiographical. To which I reply, it’s all autobiographical. But since she wants hard news, not indirect revelation, I offer this account of my grandmother, born Sonia Chafetz, later, by marriage, Sonia Usilewski and finally, after a legal name change, Sonia Green. She was born in 1884 somewhere in darkest White Russia (now called Belarus). I have no idea exactly where, but I know that she was a distinctly rural girl -- she loved to fish, to pick berries, to grow plants. Of her life in the old country, I know almost nothing -– only that she was raised in a cottage with a dirt floor and that the family brought the cow inside in the winter to keep the place warm. I know that she didn’t have a proper bed, and that at least for part of her childhood she slept on the mantle over the fireplace, which sounds mighty precarious to me. She couldn’t have had much in the way of formal education, but she did read and write Yiddish and still understood Russian in her old age. I know this because in the late 1940s or early 50s I would occasionally sit with her and listen to the broadcast of debates at the United Nations (in those days there were subsequent rather than simultaneous translations) and she would render the Russian to me, as best she could in her halting English. She never did become fluent in the only language I knew so our conversations were stilted and confined to utilitarian topics.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&#0160;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">When she was young -- I’ve seen the pictures—she was dark, attractive, and voluptuous. By the time I came to know her, when she was close to sixty, her looks were long gone and she was disfigured by goitre and other diseases and no doubt by the consequences of her many self-induced abortions. The family story was that both she and Joseph were engaged to other people when they eloped to America (my grandfather deserting from the Russian army, where he had been drafted for the usual twenty-year term, and where his salary was a ruble every other month). They arrived in New York in August of 1904 from Rotterdam. How they found their way from Minsk to Rotterdam I was never told, but the Ellis Island records report that they came through London.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&#0160;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">My mother was born in June of the following year, or just about ten months after her parents arrived in this country. My mother’s story was that at first her parents had only one pair of shoes between them, so that Sonia had to stay at home until Joseph returned from work. The family settled in Harlem; my grandfather, who was urban and more sophisticated than Sonia, had been trained as a pharmacist, but never found work in his field in the new world. I don’t know what they did for a living (was he some sort of salesman?) except that for a short time my grandparents owned a delicatessen at the corner of 4<sup>th</sup> and 10<sup>th</sup> streets in Greenwich Village. I’ve gone to that corner many times and tried imagine such a restaurant, but of course not a clue remains.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&#0160;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">As far as I can guess, their marriage was uneasy. My grandfather was frequently absent (my father once darkly hinted, “I don’t know whether it was other women, or what”) and my grandmother frequently ill. My father also told me that when he and mom married, he laid down a prohibition — it was in the days when men made prohibitions -- that she wasn’t to act as intermediary between Sonia and Joseph any longer.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&#0160;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">I know that my mother had to leave school six weeks into the ninth grade to care for her mother and two younger brothers. But that’s about all I was told and there are no documents. I have a few memories: Sonia trying to teach me to play fan-tan and five hundred rummy -– I was as bad then as I am now at card games; Sonia planting in wooden Philadelphia cream-cheese boxes every orange or grapefruit seed that came into her house, so that her tiny apartment had the pleasant aroma of a hot-house; Sonia growing avocados in the winter but setting them in my father’s garden (just around the corner from her third-floor walk-up) in the summer. And I also remember her attempt to cure my father’s sterile apple tree with an old-country remedy — rubbing the cut half of an apple on the tree trunk in midwinter. I remember also stuffed cabbage, the world&#39;s finest blintzes, and jars of apricot jam sealed with paraffin. In her last years, Sonia lived with my parents; she had her own kitchen, a room that had been remodeled from my former bedroom. She was weary of life and I suspect that she died at least in part of malnutrition. I remember also that she owned a pressed-glass ruby bowl that was always filled with hard candies. I was allowed one candy per visit.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&#0160;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">When Sonia died in 1971, she had no money and precious few possessions, but I inherited the bowl. It was pretty, and I’m sorry to say that after a few years I accidentally broke it. But it was easily replaced (it was in a popular pattern and every second-hand store had the item for sale) and I bought one for about $25.00. Some years afterward I broke the second one and bought another, but by that time the price had gone up to $50.00. So, although my inheritance in cold cash was a negative $75, I was left with grateful appreciation and many warm memories.</p>

                                <p>My positions:</p>
<p>1)&#0160; NO DOGS WITHIN CITY LIMITS. Rationale: fatal and near-fatal dog attacks, dog bites, barking dogs, whining dogs, ubiquitous dog &quot;waste,&quot; dogs annoying citizens in parks and open space, the indulgence of dog owners. But what about seeing-eye dogs? Slippery slope, that. Sorry, no dogs (except for purposes of vivisection).</p>
<p>2)&#0160; NO CHRISTMAS LIGHTS. Rationale: waste of electricity and other scarce resources. Global warming. Bad taste.</p>
<p>3)&#0160; NO MUSIC WRITTEN AFTER 1897. Rationale: obvious. Why 1897? Death of Johannes Brahms. Also, no amplified music in a motor vehicle that is audible outside the vehicle.</p>
<p>4)&#0160; NO SMOKERS. Rationale: lung cancer, heart attacks, emphysema, ashes, bad odors. Note: not &quot;no smoking&quot; -- &quot;no smokers.&quot;&#0160; No going outside of city limits to light up and then re-entering.</p>
<p>5)&#0160; NO IDLE CHATTER. Rationale: incontrovertible.</p>
<p>6)&#0160; NO VISIBLE TATTOOS. Rationale: I don&#39;t like tattoos. Why visible?&#0160; Whole-body inspections would be intrusive.&#0160;</p>
<p>7)&#0160; NEW ANNUAL HOLIDAY: Charles Darwin&#39;s birthday, February 12. Rationale: uncontroversial celebration of a great thinker. I reject out of hand those extremists who want to move the holiday to December 25. I&#39;m a uniter, not a divider.&#0160;</p>
<p>My slogan:&#0160; Brilliant!&#0160; Charismatic!&#0160; Omniscient!&#0160; Hyperbolic!&#0160; &#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p><em>Women and Thomas Harrow</em> was John P. Marquand&#39;s last novel. It was published in 1958; Marquand (born in 1893) died in 1960. It&#39;s another good but not great book. Despite the witty surface, it&#39;s very sad. Thomas Harrow (clearly a surrogate for Marquand himself) is a successful but not brilliant playwright; in the course of the novel, he comes to realize that he&#39;s squandered his talent and made a mess of his personal relationships. The last line of <em>Women and Thomas Harrow</em>: &quot;In the end, no matter how many were in the car, you always drove alone.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>I&#39;m still trying to figure out why my father thought so well of the novels of John Phillips Marquand. For one thing, Pop was clearly in tune with the author&#39;s relentless anti-modernism. In form, Marquand&#39;s novels are Victorian. There&#39;s no experimentation, nothing unusual or original in content or presentation. Moreover, in all the novels, not a landscape but has been destroyed, not a custom but has deteriorated, not a value but has been compromised. The modern world in Marquand&#39;s view has become too subject to analysis, too Freudified. Sometimes Harrow employs, with some resistance, the exact words that I heard without irony from my father&#39;s mouth: &quot;No one could escape from convention for long....&#0160; It was advisable to accept the mores of one&#39;s time, no matter if they shifted. It was better to be in tune... with the beat of marching music.&quot;&#0160; No dancing to a different drummer either in Marquand or in my father.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>When I read Neal Ascherson&#39;s <em>Black Sea,</em> I had to admit that I knew nothing at all about a huge and contested part of the world. I followed up on Ascherson&#39;s bibliography and read a series of ethnographic studies of ancient Black Sea peoples -- Scythians, Sarmatians, etc. -- and from there moved eastward to the Caucasus and leaned about the Abkhazians, the Ossetians, the Chechens, etc. Yesterday I finished Nicholas Griffin&#39;s <em>Caucasus</em> (2001), which is half travel book and half a biography of Imam Shamil. Shamil, of whom I also knew zero until a few days ago, is the legendary Avar guerrilla leader who led the opposition to the Russian conquest of the mountains in the mid-nineteenth century. He&#39;s the national hero of the Chechens, and is a compound of Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse, and Geronimo-- with a little Islamic fervor added in. The Russians conquered the Caucasus with a combination of overwhelming force, superior technology, and ruthlessness: they systematically obliterated villages, murdered as many civilians as possible, and when all else failed, cut to the ground the primeval beech forests -- defoliation not then an option -- in which Shamil and his Murids found refuge.</p>
<p>Reading about Shamil led me to <em>Hadji Murad --</em> Tolstoy&#39;s extraordinary last novel and one in which Shamil is a minor character. In 150 pages or so, <em>Hadji Murad </em>says as much about the brutality, the stupidity, and the vanity of war as <em>War and Peace </em>says in ten times as many pages. Tolstoy, who had soldiered in the Caucasus, wrote in his diary (according to Griffin) that the war was &quot;so ugly and unjust that anybody who wages it has to stifle the voice of his conscience.&quot; Hadji Murad is a charismatic leader who&#39;s involved in a foolish feud with Shamil; he surrenders to the Russians, tries to escape, and is killed and beheaded. That&#39;s the plot, but the genius is in the telling. After recounting an atrocity in which the Russians, in sport, destroy a small settlement, ruin the crops, and bayonet a small child, Tolstoy describes the feelings of the remaining villagers as they set about the hopeless task of rebuilding: &quot;It was not hatred, because they did not regard those Russian dogs as human beings, but it was such repulsion, disgust and perplexity at the senseless cruelty of these creatures, that the desire to exterminate them&#0160; -- like the desire to exterminate rats, poisonous spiders, or wolves&#0160; -- was as natural an instinct as that of self-preservation.&quot; Tolstoy is disgusted by the Russian actions, but he&#39;s equally repelled by the brutal mountaineers, and he goes out of his way to draw parallels between the utterly cruel Imam Shamil and the fat, ignorant, vainglorious Nicholas, the Czar of All the Russians.</p>
<p>In the nineteenth century, the Russians cut down the forests; in 1999, they conquered Grozhny (the capitol of Chechnya) by dynamiting every significant building in the entire city.&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Sloan Wilson&#39;s 1955 best-seller is saturated with alcohol. Nary a character can carry on a conversation without first mixing a highball, a scotch, a manhattan, or a batch of martinis. &quot;Let&#39;s have a drink&quot; is the lubricant without which the novel couldn&#39;t proceed. In <em>The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit,</em> the characters not only drink like fishes but they also smoke like chimneys. There&#39;s not a social interaction that isn&#39;t punctuated with lighting up, puffing, flicking, extinguishing. But the use of alcohol and tobacco do not pose moral challenges; they&#39;re just there, like food and water, and do not become issues for either the characters or the author. Were the 50s so rich in nicotine?&#0160; I think they must have been: our house, like everyone else&#39;s, was a thick blue haze. Between my mother&#39;s cigarettes and my father&#39;s pipes and cigars, I must have inhaled many lifetimes worth of second-hand smoke during my childhood. On the other hand, we departed from the norm in that we were not spiritous. While there was always a bottle of something or other on hand to offer to the very occasional guest, I never once noticed either of my parents drink liquor, or beer or wine for that matter, unprompted. Omnipresent alcohol, or rather the manners that surround its consumption, dates <em>The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit.</em>&#0160;Right there, in the middle of the Beat Generation, is an old-fashioned Bourbon Generation novel.&#0160;</p>
<p>The &quot;gray flannel&quot; of the title refers to the ubiquitous 50s costume of the upwardly mobile. I re-read the novel, which I remembered more from the Gregory Peck-Jennifer Jones epic than from the book, with the expectation that it would be another Marquand-like story of conformity and thwarted rebellion among the aspiring execs. In truth there is some of that, for Tom Rath, the central figure, is for a while caught up in corporate climbing. But the button-down world is not as vividly realized as is the prevailing suburban angst. Basically, the novel is a story of a marriage that&#39;s lost its juice. Rath, a good man but one who&#39;s become extremely cautious and tightly-wound, had been a paratrooper who dropped behind enemy lines in Europe and in the Pacific. He&#39;s killed seventeen men, most with his bare hands -- one an eighteen-year-old, and one (accidentally) his best friend -- but he&#39;s never been able to tell his wife Betsy about the war and about the way the war altered his values. In the last chapter he finally breaks through the barrier, but only because he has to admit to Betsy that, while waiting to be shipped from the European to the Pacific theater, he lived with and fathered a child with a Roman &quot;soldier&#39;s girl.&quot; Rath asks a very good question -- why is it that he&#39;s not ashamed to have killed, but he is ashamed to have loved. Rath&#39;s revelations are the heart of the novel, but they&#39;re given curiously short shrift (as though Sloan Wilson unconsciously allies himself Tom Rath&#39;s impulse to suppress the truth).</p>
<p>I think the book was so popular because it must have helped to purge some of the psychological traumas of the war. It&#39;s a moderately good story written in moderately bad prose.&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>It was sad to read Sloan Wilson&#39;s obituary (he died in 2002) and discover that he was an alcoholic for much of his life.&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>One of the most joyful of nursery rhymes, and a personal favorite, is this:</p>
<p>&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160; Crosspatch,</p>
<p>&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160; Draw the latch.</p>
<p>&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160; Sit by the fire and spin.</p>
<p>&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160; Take a cup,</p>
<p>&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160; And drink it up.</p>
<p>&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160; Then call the neighbors in.</p>
<p>The clicky rhymes and jaunty meter are undeniably beautiful -- and there&#39;s much more meaning than poems of this kind usually contain.</p>
<p>In the first triad, a &quot;crosspatch,&quot; -- a &quot;cross or ill-tempered person, usually a girl or woman&quot; -- is at work, spinning. In the second triad, she&#39;s exhorted to drink and also to invite her neighbors &quot;in&quot; -- presumably into the room, or just as likely, the tiny cottage -- where she lives alone. In the first strophe, the theme is isolation, but in the second, isolation is challenged by the calls of society and by the hope of a more satisfactory and convivial life.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>What can we know or imagine about the surly individual addressed by the evocative designation, &quot;crosspatch?&quot;&#0160; The first element in the name --&quot;cross&quot;-- implies not only sourness, but also resistance, as in &quot;cross-grained.&quot; The second element -- &quot;patch&quot; -- suggests that the crosspatch&#39;s discontent is not without cause. We can infer that she&#39;s poor because she&#39;s a person whose garments are either assembled from various rescued materials, as in &quot;patchwork,&quot; or that her clothes are, in another sense of the word patch, repaired. In addition, it&#39;s possible that ill health has caused her skin to become &quot;patchy.&quot;&#0160; But &quot;patch&quot; also signals a degree of mental stress, as in Shakespeare&#39;s &quot;patched fool.&quot; In this signification, patch derives from Italian <em>pazzo</em>, crazy. The crosspatch is therefore disabled physically, socially and psychologically.</p>
<p>At the outset of the poem, our &quot;crosspatch&quot; sits glowering, impoverished, perhaps muttering indistinctly, friendless, without family, her youth blighted by poverty, huddled against the last embers of her dying fire. What is it that she is spinning? No doubt she ekes out a meager living in the impersonal mercantilist &quot;putting-out&quot; system. Some exploitative proto-capitalist venturer has delivered to her lonely door a quantity of unspun wool or cotton;&#0160; her job is to return the material to him in the processed form that will then be passed on to an equally poor weaver, then to a tailor, etc. She works alone and never sees the fruits of her labor except for the occasional, paltry farthing that allows her a bare subsistence. No wonder she is slightly barmy and has &quot;drawn the latch&quot; -- closed herself off from her fellows. But then, suddenly, comes the antistrophe, and in a series of importunate injunctives the crosspatch is asked to rejoin the company of humanity. &quot;Take a cup,/ And drink it up,/ Then call the neighbors in.&quot;&#0160; What&#39;s in the cup?&#0160; Spiritous liquors, no doubt, which, though designed to dull the pain of wage-slavery, also act to augment the revelry with which the poem climaxes. The wine is not sipped, but it is drained to the lees. And once the door is unlatched, and the neighbors -- neighbors of both sexes, no doubt -- are called &quot;in,&quot; why then, let the libations and the wild rumpus begin! Alienated labor is suddenly set aside and replaced by the natural bonds of one human being to another, and the stasis of the opening lines of the poem transforms in a flash into a wildly kinetic bacchanal. Emotional weakness transmutes into healthy liberated pleasure. Dour Puritanism, with its punishing work ethic, yields to the spirit of holiday and to pagan, perhaps even dionysian, excess. Here, in miniature, is the essence of the comic vision. In a few powerful lines, freedom, good humor, and natural appetite triumph over bondage, artificiality, social constriction and repression; the justifiably sullen crosspatch, in a burst of energy, reintegrates herself into the social nexus from which she has been banished.</p>
<p>Whether or not the crosspatch can permanently liberate herself from the oppressions of industrial capitalism, or whether the anodyne and spurious relief of alcohol is a merely transient solution is left unresolved. To ask a short poem, however dense with meaning, to answer so difficult a question would, just possibly, be to ask too much of it and, perhaps, to push the evidence the merest tad too far.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>When I was a just a young sprout, every summer I would grow, from seed, in my father&#39;s crowded backyard garden, a small plot of snapdragons. Inasmuch as I had, or seemed to have in those years, endless time, I became a connoisseur of the plant&#39;s growth habit: its elongated long smooth leaves with their pastel undersides, its spikes of buds, opening from bottom to top, its varied colors, and especially its unusual flower. I&#39;d watch the bees lift the &quot;dragon&#39;s&quot; jaw, squeeze inside, sometimes to temporarily trap themselves within. As much as loved the flower, I think I loved its name even more. &quot;Snapdragon&quot;-- a euphonious, crunchy, satisfying, evocative sound -- scary too, but how can a flower be scary?&#0160;</p>
<p>I recently opened the first of this year&#39;s seed catalogs to find the favorite flower of my springtime listed as &quot;antirrhinum.&quot; The scientific name is not inaccurate -- it&#39;s Latinized Greek for &quot;snoutlike&quot; -- but I have to say that antirrhinum is not a word that sings to me. It sounds less like a border annual than a cold remedy..</p>
<p>The modern plant breeders, intent on appearing to be learned and scientific, have gone too far. I want the old names back. Not lathyrus, but sweet pea; not achillea, but yarrow; not dianthus barbatus, but sweet William; not calendula, but marigold. Let us even do away with the almost naturalized name of delphinium; bring back the larkspur. Not veronica, but speedwell. I want a garden that&#39;s filled with stocks, lilies of the valley (not convallaria), loosestrife (the yellow variety, not the invasive purple), love lies bleeding, love-in-a-mist, marguerites, brushwood.</p>
<p>I make one exception: liverwort. Not that anyone would want to grow it, but just in case. In fact, I banish all flower names that contain the element &quot;wort.&quot; In my garden, spiderwort grows under the name tradescantia. (Tradescantia, poor thing, has a second and equally unacceptable name: cow slobber.)</p>
<p>Am I alone in this preference?&#0160; Not a bit.&#0160; I&#39;m in the best company. In the noblest poem in the English language, John Milton lists the flowers that &quot;strew the laureate hearse&quot; of the dead poet Lycidas. (&quot;Rathe&quot; means &quot;early&quot;-- it survives in &quot;rather,&quot; which used to mean &quot;earlier&quot;;&#0160; &quot;freaked&quot; is &quot;streaked.&quot;)</p>
<p>&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; Bring the rathe primrose, which forsaken dies,</p>
<p>&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; The tufted crow-toe, and pale jessamine;</p>

<p>&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; The glowing violet,</p>
<p>&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; The musk-rose, and the well-attired woodbine,</p>
<p>&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; With cowslips wan that hang the pensive head.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">It&#39;s a great swelling litany. Savor again the music of that lovely last line: &quot;With cowslips wan that hang the pensive head.&quot; Instead of cowslip, Milton might have written &quot;primula veris, family primulaceae,&quot; but he was too smart to do so. Words like cowslip, lady&#39;s mantle, goldenrod, forget-me-not, and, yea, snapdragon live and breathe and are laden with metaphorical perfume. Cowslips hang their heads; primula, like antirrhinum, have no heads to hang. Moreover, if Milton had been looking about for alternatives for the cowslip, he would not have consulted the plant breeders but returned to popular lore and he would have chosen from such tasty words (alternatives all to cowslip) as herb peter, peggle, key of heaven, fairy cups, mayflower, lady&#39;s keys-- all of which are human, humane, and evocative. But John Milton, who exhorted &quot;daffodillies to fill their cups with tears,&quot; had an ear, and I can therefore affirm with absolute, unimpeachable, and total confidence that he would have rejected with horror another synonym for the common cowslip: the palsywort. &#0160;&#0160;</p>

		<a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2005/12/what_we_read_in.html">What We Read in the Fifties: The Late George Apley</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>My father was a great admirer of the popular American novelist John P. Marquand and I remember that he specifically urged me to read Marquand&#39;s best known work, <em>The Late George Apley</em>. Marquand&#39;s heyday was in the 1930s and 1940s, and I don&#39;t think that he&#39;s much read now, although it&#39;s good to see that two of his many novels are still in print. Yesterday I re-read <em>The Late George Apley.</em>&#0160;It&#39;s a fine book. The conceit is this: George Apley, an extremely wealthy Bostonian of the Cabot-Lodge-Saltonstall class, has recently died, and an old Harvard chum has been hired to condense Apley&#39;s letters and papers into a biography. The fatuous editor, who portrays Apley as an exemplary being, reveals to his readership much more than he himself can possibly understand. We hear of Apley&#39;s rectitude, his generosity, his civic-mindedness, his loyalty to his class -- but along the way we indirectly learn many truths; for example, that Apley should have married the beautiful and intelligent but alas Irish Mary Monahan, but instead was hustled into a ceremony with a drab woman of his own circle. &quot;Remember,&quot; his father assures him, &quot;beauty is only skin-deep.&quot; Apley upholds proper Louisburg Square values, but occasionally he catches a glimmer of the idea that the rules of upper-class Boston have circumscribed and warped his life. At the end, his daughter has married (gasp) a journalist and his son (double gasp) a divorcee. In his last weeks, Apley becomes just a trifle less unbending: &quot;It even occurs to me tonight, although this is simply a whim of the moment and probably not quite sound, that you (he&#39;s writing to a long-time friend) and I may have missed something in our day.&quot; But he can also say of his daughter&#39;s husband, that &quot;his peculiarity of speech and manner indicate that he comes from a very long distance, probably the Middle West, a place I have not seen, nor do I wish to see it.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>Here&#39;s Marquand at his best. Young George (we&#39;re now in the 1870s) has a daft grandmother. One day, at a &quot;festive occasion,&quot; she turns to her aged contemporary the Reverend Nathaniel Pettingill, and blurts out:&#0160; &quot;Young man, should you ever go blackbirding, be sure to select Negroes that are brought down from the mountains, they are stronger and healthier than the Blacks from the coast.&quot; Our brainless narrator explains that her outburst &quot;displays the vagaries of a dear old lady&#39;s mind,&quot; but readers now know that the great Apley fortune was built on slave-trading. (The artistry of the moment is borrowed from Dickens, and specifically from Mr. F&#39;s lunatic Aunt in <em>Little Dorrit</em>, who, at dinner, for no discernible reason, suddenly cries out to the company that &quot;when we lived at Henley, Barnes&#39;s gander was stole by tinkers.&quot; But on the whole Marquand owes far less to Dickens than to Howells).</p>
<p>I can&#39;t help wondering why my father was so insistent that I read the book. My father had as much rectitude as anyone I&#39;ve ever known, and perhaps he was attracted to the nobler side of Apley&#39;s personality. Or was he trying to warn me away from the kind of conformity which stifles poor George? Or, a very conventional man himself, did he suspect that he himself was enmeshed in Apleyan-like coils? &#0160;Or did he simply enjoy long ironic narratives?&#0160;</p>
<p>Is it time for a Marquand revival?</p>

		<a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2005/11/the_black_sea_l.html">The Black Sea;  Lermontov</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>In the Black Sea just off the Bulgarian coast lies Nessabar, an island (nowadays artificially an isthmus) that has been a trading center for several thousand years. Still standing in the old city are churches and fortifications that date from the 8th and 9th century. It&#39;s authentic and it&#39;s intriguing, but it&#39;s also one of the very few places in Bulgaria that&#39;s distinctly over-touristed, so it was a relief to hop the informal ferry (really no more than a glorified dinghy) from Nessebar back to the mainland. To be afloat on the fabled Black Sea felt--how else can I say it? -- Romantic and a far cry from landlocked Colorado. It was that windy boat ride that pushed me into reading about the inhabitants of the Black Sea littoral and of the neighboring Caucasus. This is the land of the ancient Thracians, builders of tumuli, of the Scythians, who went to war with mares only, and also of the Sarmatians (of whom the sum of my knowledge had been the story of the ten virgins of Sarmatia deflowered in a single night by the Emperor Procopius -- who was, according to Montaigne, a &quot;master workman and famous in the task.&quot; It&#39;s a land that is presently the home to Abkhazians, Georgians, Circassians, Ossetians, Chechens.</p>
<p>My ruminating eventually brought to mind that I&#39;ve read a novel set in the Caucasus -- Mikhail Lermontov&#39;s <em>A Hero of our Time.</em>&#0160;The novel was written in the late 1830s (its author was killed in an idiotic duel in 1841 at the age of twenty-seven). A sickly but wealthy Muscovite, Lermontov had been sent to the frosty Caucasus several times in his childhood for the bracing air and the healing baths. Later, as a Russian officer, he participated in the displacement and genocide of the Caucasian peoples -- a war that began in the days of Peter the Great and continues to this very moment. Of the novel itself I could recall only vaguely the deep romantic chasms and rushing mountain streams, the unlettered tribesmen, the gallant horsemanship. Re-reading was, as always, a revelation. The nominal hero, Pechorin, of whom I&#39;m embarrassed to say I had not the least memory trace -- but let&#39;s face it, forty years is a long time-- is a hyperconscious but conscienceless cad. He&#39;s the underground man as cavalry officer.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a sample hunk of plot: at a wedding, lustful Pechorin is taken by the sight of a fair young Circassian girl named Bela. Bela is also sought by Kazbich, a swarthy Chechen fighter, the owner of a most remarkable horse. The horse is coveted by Bela&#39;s younger brother Azamat. Azamat and Pechorin conspire: Azamat will kidnap and deliver his sister to Pechorin if Pechorin will help him abscond with the horse. The intrigue succeeds and Pechorin takes the &quot;wild girl&quot; Bela as his concubine. She, of course, sickens. One day, while Pechorin is out hunting boar, Kazbich returns and attempts to re-abduct Bela. Pechorin, returning home, shoots at Kazbich and wounds him; Kazbich escapes but not before fatally stabbing Bela with his dagger -- preferring, it&#39;s assumed, to kill rather than surrender her.&#0160;</p>
<p>It seems like a horribly racist tale -- made worse by the fact that the Chechens are regularly characterized as thieves, the Ossetians as stupid, and so on. The equation of horse and woman is inherently offensive. But the story is redeemed from bigotry because blonde Pechorin is by far the nastiest character in the novel, and because the whole episode can be and perhaps should be interpreted as a rebuke to the brutality of Russian imperialism.</p>
<p>It&#39;s obvious that the novel&#39;s themes are not specific to the Russian-Caucasian frontier. It&#39;s easy to imagine a translation of <em>A Hero of Our Time </em>into a film set in the American west where Chechens become Sioux, the Caucasus becomes the Rockies, Pechorin is played by James Stewart while Bela transmutes into Debra Paget in a buckskin skirt, and racial, imperialist and genocidal themes are enacted in a frontier that is more familiar but equally falsified and romanticized.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>On the library&#39;s shelf of new books a few days ago there was a biography of Gaius Valerius Catullus (Aubrey Burl<em>, Catullus, a Poet in the Rome of Julius Caesar, </em>2004). I’ve had a warm feeling for Catullus since translating, line by line as a schoolboy, the great erotic epithalamion written for the wedding of Junia Aurunculeia and Manlius Torquatus. An epithalamion is a song for the bedding of the bride, and Catullus’s poem overflows with a sexual urgency, an emotion unacknowledged in the public discourse of my younger days. While my teacher attended to such chilly questions as whether the meter was glyconic or pherecretean, I understood with my whole body that Manlius and Junia were warmer than Rock and Doris or Ozzie and Harriet.</p>
<p>I borrowed the biography of the poet because I remembered being informed that a life of Catullus could never be written. Too little was known of him—only that he was raised far to the north of Rome, somewhere in the vicinity of Verona, that he was of half-Celtic stock, that he was very wealthy, and that he died at the age of thirty in 54 B.C. And sure enough, the new biography isn’t really a biography at all, but rather a gossipy account of political, military, and social doings in Rome during the years when Catullus flourished.</p>
<p>Much was familiar, but an aspect of Roman reality that I should have remembered, yet didn’t, was that the ancients kept time differently than we do. They were, for example, weekless. Moreover, they allotted twelve hours to the period from sunrise to sunset and twelve hours from sunset to sunrise. But of course, days are longer in the summer and shorter in the winter, so an hour at the summer solstice would be about twenty-five per cent longer than an hour at the equinox, and an hour in midwinter about twenty-five per cent shorter. On any given day, the length of an hour would be slightly different than yesterday’s hour or tomorrow’s. It seems like a complicated system and I think that the modern method of keeping the hours constant in length regardless of the season is quite a sensible improvement. Rome was largely a world of sundials. Mechanical clocks, a late medieval invention, were almost a millennium and a half into the future, and the clepsydra, the ancient water-clock, was not so adjustable or so subtle an instrument that it could be altered slightly from day to day.</p>
<p>The Roman system leads naturally to another question. When the Romans lengthened or shortened the hour, did they also vary the number of minutes – say, seventy-five minutes to an hour in summer, forty-five minutes to an hour in winter? Or did they keep the number of minutes constant at sixty, but allow the minutes to fluctuate in their duration?&#0160;</p>
<p>And why does Roman horology put me in mind of James Thurber’s observation when he turned sixty-- that if there were fifteen months in every year, he’d only be forty-eight?</p>
