		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>It&#39;s that time of year once again -- time to get 2024 out of the starting gates with force and vigor. I&#39;m all into self-improvement, as everyone knows. So here are my resolutions.</p>
<p>1). Sleep longer, and stay in bed later in the morning. No need to bounce out of bed. It&#39;s warm and cozy in there. Breakfast will wait a few minutes longer.&#0160; Related resolution: take more and better naps. Nothing more pleasurable than a lie-down after a satisfying lunch.</p>
<p>2). Eat more ice cream. We are fortunate to live in an age of ice-cream abundance and variety. I intend to take advantage of the circumstances.&#0160; And by ice cream, I mean Ice cream: no ersatz concoctions of soy, whale-oil, kefir, oatmilk, yoghurt, tofu, or coconut oil. Cream, as from a cow.&#0160;</p>
<p>3)&#0160; Walk more slowly. What&#39;s the rush?&#0160; Why is everyone in such a gol-durn hurry?</p>
<p>4)&#0160; Avoid responsibility. Let others do their share. At this point in life, there&#39;s no shame in shirking.</p>
<p>I hope this program is not too ambitious. I wouldn&#39;t want to fail at it and embarrass my friends and supporters. I&#39;ll do my best.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>&#0160;In the late 40s and 50s, Marty Glickman was the radio voice of the New York Knicks. As a basketball announcer, he was simply the best. Most of us from that era, especially Brooklyn guys, can still recall in our mind&#39;s ear his melodious, accurate and rapid-fire recreation of the game. &quot;Gallatin to Braun on the left wing. Swish.&quot;</p>
<p>Until a couple of days ago, I did not know that Marty Glickman had written (in an &quot;as-told-to&quot; kind of way) an autobiography called <em>The Fastest Kid on the Block (</em>1996<em>),&#0160;</em>and that, believe it or not, one copy of this book is among the holdings of the Michener Library of the University of Northern Colorado, in Greeley, Colorado -- and is now in my very own hands. A warm thank you to UNC and to Interlibrary Loan.</p>
<p>Glickman was not only an announcer; he was also a student at fabled P S 217, my own not-so-&quot;alma&quot; mater, which he attended from first through sixth grade. He was born in 1917 so that would be in the 1920s. He was, get this, the fastest kid on the block in my very own neighborhood.&#0160;</p>
<p>He was not just a voice but an athlete, best known as a two-way football player at Syracuse University. He was also a top of the class sprinter who once ran a hundred yards in 9.5 seconds (the great Jesse Owens held the world record at 9.3). In 1936, Glickman was scheduled to run the second leg of the 4 x 100 at the Berlin Olympics.&#0160; He was scratched at the last minute for reasons that are still murky, but Glickman&#39;s opinion, and mine, is that Adolf Hitler didn&#39;t want a Jew to win a medal, so he had Goebbels whisper to Avery Brundage, who was the head of U. S. Olympic committee, that Glickman not be allowed to run. (Brundage was a notorious racist, misogynist, and Jew-hater, known as &quot;slavery Avery.&quot; (There&#39;s an unverified report that Brundage spoke at the February, 1939, Nazi rally at Madison Square Garden; it would nor have been out of character for him to have done so.)</p>
<p>Glickman is philosophical about not being allowed to run in the Olympics. It would have been good to show his grandchildren his gold medal, he says. I myself am indignant for him.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Once, when I was still a Brooklyn yoot, a rumor swept the P S 217 schoolyard that &quot;Marty Glickman is going to be here this afternoon.&quot;&#0160; He appeared, but all that I can remember is that he spoke to a knot of kids. I remember nothing more.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>My father, who was born in 1904, was a basketball enthusiast when the game was in its infancy. He played guard on Eastern District High School&#39;s team and later played as a freshman at CCNY under legendary coach Nat Holman. But Dad came from an impoverished family and left college after one year because, he told me once, &quot;I couldn&#39;t see how I could stay in school when my family needed so much.&quot; So while his formal education went by the wayside, he was able to make up the difference by a lifetime of reading. And although he was not a complaining sort, it was clear to me and I think to my brothers that he felt a bit grieved that his formal athletic career had been cut so short. He kept at it, though, on his own. Well into his forties, he was absent from family dinner one night a week. &quot;Wednesdays,&quot; my mother explained, long before I could understand what the words meant, &quot;your father goes to the gym.&quot; And Saturday mornings, in warm weather, were reserved for tennis. Dad very much wanted his three sons to carry on his athletic tradition, but I think, in retrospect, that in the long run we all disappointed him. Both my brothers were fine athletes although not big or fast enough for professional careers; I was, alack and alas, a disappointment. Dad, who had also been a semi-pro catcher in baseball, taught Gene and Jon how to throw an &quot;inshoot&quot; and an &quot;outshoot,&quot; but he could not bring himself to coach me because it was obvious that with my 55 mile an hour fastball and scattershot arm, I wasn&#39;t going anywhere, pitching-wise, and although he showed me a couple of basketball moves he was, I recognize, a bit embarrassed by my want of athletic skill. (In my defense I must report that although I was more academic than athletic, I was voted &quot;class athlete&quot; by my P. S. 217 (8-5) eighth grade class -- a group which must have been, now that I think of it, quite a collection of klutzes). My older brother was a good enough basketball player to play for his college team for a year, and my younger brother was an outstanding sandlot all-star in baseball who once struck out Joe Torre, who, it will be remembered, finished his major league career with a .300 lifetime average. (The second time he pitched to Torre, my brother says, the future MVP hit a ball that &quot;is still circling the earth.&quot;) I myself had the briefest career on the diamond. The pinnacle of my experience was that, once, playing second base, I turned a double play -- took the toss from the shortstop, stepped on the bag, gracefully wheeled, and pegged the ball perfectly to the first baseman. It happened once and once only, but it was glorious -- definitely a Hall of Fame moment. The peak of my basketball career occurred in the slippery court (which doubled as a dance floor) in the basement of the Flatbush Jewish Center on Coney Island Avenue and Avenue J. I was, I estimate, thirteen years old. Wearing number 3, in black and gold, I was steaming down the left side of the court on a fast break and was forced away from the basket, so instead of a layup I managed a sweeping running left-handed hook which caught nothing but net. There was modest applause. None of my teammates guessed that I had intended to bank the ball off the backboard and that it had slipped out of my hand and swished, entirely by accident. I only reveal this deep secret now, very now.&#0160; Another high point in my career: I once won a local foul shooting contest. I hit 23 of 25. One small caveat, though. The contest was conducted in the P.S. 217 schoolyard, where the baskets were, how shall I say this correctly, unsteady and soft. As a result, they were like sewers -- everything flushed. I doubt that I would have made 23 on a standard rigid rim. Nevertheless, I did win the medal and the other competitors all used the same ball and basket as I -- so, therefore, a modest triumph. And then playing basketball faded into the background, because I didn&#39;t get my growth until very late and for a while I was playing at 4&#39; 11&quot; or 5&#39; 1&quot; against hairy guys who had already reached their full mature height. But I continued to pursue my undistinguished career -- including the most competitive activity of my life -- three on three half court in the EHHS gym, one basket wins, and &quot;winners out.&quot; And then a little intramural in Ithaca; an occasional pickup game in Cambridge. Oh, and twenty years later on, I played a bit with my own offspring, all three of whom were more athletic than I. My last pathetic hurrah (almost a decade ago, now) was being obliterated at h-o-r-s-e by my granddaughter Ella.&#0160;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I retained my interest in the sport. No longer a participant, I became a serious spectator. I know enough about roundball to appreciate both player and play. For thirty years or so, I had a good seat at the home games of the CU Buffaloes -- it was high quality college basketball (although the Buffs rarely enjoyed a winning season). One source of interest and fun for me was to evaluate the talent and try to predict which of our guys (or the visitors&#39;) had the skill and size to move up to the next level. Over the years, I followed the early days of many a later NBA regular -- and even a couple of stars. I remember in particular Jay Humphries, who played four excellent seasons for CU and then averaged in double figures during an extended NBA career. Also local lad Chauncey Billups, &quot;Mr Big Shot&quot; himself. Andre Roberson, a terrific defender and rebounder who never lived up to his potential because he just couldn&#39;t master the corner three; Matt Bullard, a fine outside shooter; Scott Wedman; Alec Burks; Derrick White (still playing for Boston and getting better each year); and Spencer Dinwiddie, whom I didn&#39;t judge to be an NBA player but who has become a steady professional. The high point of my CU spectatorial career occurred in 2006 when the Texas Longhorns brought to our stadium a gangly teen-ager named Kevin Durant. One didn&#39;t have to be a sophisticated evaluator of talent to recognize that KD had a spectacular career ahead of him; it was grandly obvious. It took him only two years to lead the NBA in scoring. I stopped attending CU games when the athletic department, an independent entity with only a loose connection to the University, demanded that I make a donation of $400 for the privilege of purchasing season tickets. I resented the presumption, and I felt that there were many causes more worthy of my limited philanthropy than CU basketball. Although I stay away from our local Events Center, I&#39;m still an occasional arena visitor. In fact, just last season, LERM and I bought incredibly expensive tickets to watch the Cavaliers take on the Pelicans at the Smoothie King Arena in New Orleans. The venue was up-to-date but way too brightly lit, and crowded, and noisy. Moreover, I dislike the theory that attendees must be continually entertained and placated with garish novelties. I don&#39;t go to basketball games for the half-time acrobats or the animal acts or the costumed dancers or the &quot;kiss-cam&quot; or the ear-popping &quot;music&quot; nor to be commanded when to cheer or when to chant &quot;DE-FENSE.&quot; I go to watch and admire the players. Despite the distractions it was a good game, even though Zion Williamson was out with an ankle injury. These pros, even the unheralded ones, are fabulous athletes and they are especially impressive in person.&#0160;</p>
<p>So for most of my life it&#39;s been the electronic medium that has kept me abreast of the game. It all started with radio; I suspect that very few readers of this entry will be able to recall the fast-paced narration of Marty Glickman on WHN, but he was, let me tell you, a hoops artist who could bring the Knicks alive with voice alone. Then came television, sometime around the early 1950s. The thirteen inch black-and-white Dumont that my father acquired displayed an image that seemed miraculous at the time but paleolithically primitive compared to the 60&quot; HDTV that entrances me nowadays. It&#39;s all present -- right there before my astonished eyes. Incredible no-look passes and sensational blocks and three-pointers from downtown -- and also horrid tattoos -- in brilliant color. In my TV-basketball saturated brain is stored the entire history of the NBA from then until now. In the 50s, Max Zaslofsky, Harry Gallatin, Sweetwater Clifton, Carl Braun, the McGuire brothers Dick and Al, and Ernie Vandeweghe, who played only home games because he was a full-time medical student. A team that was good but always managed to lose to the Celtics -- who had Cousy and Sharman and later Bill Russell, the Jones boys (Sam and KC), Havlicek and Heinsohn. I was in those years a most loyal and enthusiastic fan of our own New York Knickerbockers -- the championship teams composed of Willis Reed, Dave DeBusschere, Bill Bradley, Earl Monroe, and Walt Frazier, names and faces as present in my memory as the more celebrated Dodger boys of summer. Then came the Magic-Bird era, LA &quot;showtime,&quot; Michael Jordan, Duncan-Ginobili-Parker-Popovich, and now LeBron James, who, although, he is certainly the most effective player in history, is less exciting to watch than his innovative contemporary, Steph Curry. During this last while, I&#39;ve become a devoted GSW fan; when they were at their best, a few years ago, they played an extraordinarily beautiful game. There were nights when they&#39;d score 30 baskets on 25 lovely assists. It&#39;s been a great ride that&#39;s now coming to an end, but there&#39;s another generation of players on the horizon and perhaps I&#39;ll be around long enough to enjoy them. After all, I&#39;ve been there for the entire history of the NBA. What developments I have seen! What was once a local, coterie sport has gone international, with many of the best players coming from overseas or south of the border. Where once all the players, save a few, were White and middle-class, now 75% to 80% are Black and inner-city, bringing with them a heck of a lot of skill and flash and dazzle. Lumbering awkward centers, with their slow roundhouse hook shots, have been superseded by astonishingly mobile 7-footers who can protect the rim but also drift outside to nail a three. Salaries, in the old days, were little more than nominal and now there are marginal players making millions off the bench. The athletes have become celebrities -- and their shoes have become almost as famous as they are, and more lucrative. Franchises, which once went for a song, are now worth billions.</p>
<p>When I&#39;m watching a game on a Sunday afternoon, I think about my father. I wish he could sit with me and discuss the progress of the sport. I&#39;d like to show him what has happened since he left us in 1985. He&#39;d like it that the players are bigger, faster, stronger, in better shape, and that the shooting is more accurate and the defenses more subtle and sophisticated. He&#39;d love the pick-and-roll and the pick-and-pop. He&#39;d appreciate the alley-oops and the accurate full court passes. I also know what he wouldn&#39;t like -- the overhasty three, the lenient interpretation of walking and palming, and the occasional showboating, Most of all, he&#39;d hate it that the NBA is now in cahoots with the gambling establishment. He would see it, as I do, as a major miscalculation -- as a scandal waiting to happen.&#0160;</p>
<p>Every once in a while, even at this advanced age, I dream that I&#39;m in the midst of a game, and I rise up and with an effortless flick of the right wrist launch a perfect 40-foot three that hardly even grazes the net. A childish fantasy, perhaps, but still very&#0160; satisfying.&#0160;&#0160;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>The singer and composer Barry Manilow writes that he took three arduous years to produce his rather thin memoir (<em>Sweet Life, Adventures on the Way to Paradise,</em> 1987). I&#39;m skeptical of his claim because his book has all the outward indications of the celebrity genre that might justly be called the &quot;as-told-to&#39;s. It&#39;s written as a flow of &quot;I did this, then I did that; I was great.&quot;&#0160; The dullest prose; I don&#39;t think there&#39;s so much as a metaphor in the entire book.&#0160; Gosh, I searched high and low for genuine feeling, for insight or learning, or for complexity of vision. No dice. How could such an unreflective, shallow being have achieved so much?&#0160; Been so popular, so highly regarded, so famous.</p>
<p>I can&#39;t say that I&#39;m very familiar with Manilow&#39;s music, but I&#39;m pleased to learn that he produced Bette Midler&#39;s debut album, <em>The Divine Miss M</em>. &quot;Delta Dawn&quot; and &quot;Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy&quot; were midlife favorites that I&#39;ve been pleased to revisit today (with the assistance of officious Alexa).</p>
<p>Brooklyn influence? Manilow seems to be a bit ashamed of his origins. At age 20, he moved from Brooklyn to Manhattan. &quot;As we drove away, I said to myself, &#39;Good-bye, Brooklyn. Thanks for everything. I&#39;m never coming back.&#39; And I never did.&quot;&#0160; The only clear evidence of his Brooklynity is that he named his beloved dog &quot;Bagel.&quot;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Half of Pete Hamill&#39;s memoir sometimes seems to have dropped down from another universe or more precisely from an alternative civilization, while the other half depicts events and ideas that are as familiar to me (as they say) as the back of my hand. Although Pete and I are both Brooklynites and near-contemporaries (he was born in 1935, and I in 1939), our lives were o so similar and yet completely different. But that&#39;s the way things were in complex, composite 1940s Brooklyn.</p>
<p>The title of Hamill&#39;s memoir establishes the differences. It&#39;s well-named -- <em>A Drinking Life</em> (1994) -- and it is saturated with liquor and Irish bars and elbow-lifting and most especially with Pete&#39;s father&#39;s uncontrollable and disabling alcoholism. Yet just a few blocks over, in my part of Brooklyn, alcohol played no part whatsoever in my own family or my life in the neighborhood. I would not call an autobiography of my own <em>An Abstinent Life</em>, because we weren&#39;t teetotalers and there was always a glass of Scotch to offer to guests, but we hardly ever touched the stuff ourselves. It wasn&#39;t until much later in life that I came to realize that my father and I were genetically incapable of digesting alcohol. I&#39;ve written about this peculiar phenomenon <a href=" https://www.drmetablog.com/2009/11/adh22-in-my-life.html">here.</a>&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Equally in contrast was Hamill&#39;s early education. The poor fellow was enrolled at Holy Name of Jesus, a Catholic parochial school where one of his teachers was the &quot;snarling vicious Brother Jan, a thick-necked Pole with a jutting jaw and bent nose&quot; -- your classic sadist -- who derived his joy in life by whipping with a thick ruler the bare hands and butts of defenseless boys. I myself learned to read and cipher at P.S. 217, a public elementary. At 217, we had teachers both gifted and incompetent but no deranged monsters and no corporal punishment. I can remember being bored at school, but not terrified. Not terrified of the teachers, that is -- among the students we had our fair share of bullies and sociopaths.</p>
<p>Hamill&#39;s Park Slope family took Roman Catholicism seriously but he himself was not an enthusiast. Although he loved the costumes and the incense and the majestic hymns, and although he confesses that the loved the &quot;cartoony name&quot; of the Holy Ghost, he was, right from the start, an instinctive atheist. My Flatbush family proffered us nary a single drop of religious information or indoctrination or training. I myself had never attended a single religious service in either synagogue, church, temple, mosque or tabernacle until 2021, and then only because it was New Orleans and we heard that Ellis Marsalis had volunteered to improvise a few measures on the piano. Hamill was a atheist by dissent; I was one by inheritance.&#0160;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Hamill and I shared a great deal -- mostly, I think, in the form of popular culture. Ring-o-levio, spaldeens, stoop ball. Where else but in Brooklyn was a &quot;do-over&quot; a &quot;hindoo?&quot; And baseball. Hamill remembers that an uncle confided to him that &quot;the Dodgers are the greatest thing in the world.&quot; He delights in reciting a litany of familiar Dodger names: &quot;Augie Galan, Dixie Walker, Ralph Branca, Joe Hatten, Henk Behrman, Hugh Casey.&quot; Except to a select few of us, these names are meaningless random syllables, but to those who were children at a particular time and place, they are poetry in its purest and most sublime form, each name a luscious mouthful of pure pleasure. Syllables that will forever bond Hamill and me to the end of the chapter. Syllables that transcend this transitory sublunary existence.</p>
<p>Like me, Hamill was a great lover and collector of comic books. Both of us savored heroes such as Captain Marvel and Captain Marvel jr. and the Human Torch and the Green Lantern and Plastic Man and the Sub-Mariner and Wonder Woman and Invisible Scarlet O&#39;Neill. Hard to believe but there are those who think that Freddie Freeman is only an all-star first baseman, but Hamill and I know better.</p>
<p>And also like me, Hamill found his way the public library where he measured himself against Jim Hawkins and Edmond Dantes and Sydney Carton and D&#39;Artagnan. Tough competition.&#0160;</p>
<p>Sometimes, Pete Hamill leaves pop culture behind and delves into his own personal psychology. Here&#39;s a paragraph of unusual sincerity and one that touches at least tangentially on my own experience. It appears in a discussion of the writings of Robert Louis Stevenson. (I should mention that I read everything of Stevenson&#39;s that the McDonald Avenue Library possessed.)</p>
<p>&#0160;&quot;I sensed (says Hamill) that I was my own version of Jekyll and Hyde. In my head, the Good Boy was constantly warring with the Bad Guy. I wanted to be the Bad Guy, tough, physical, a prince of the streets, at the same time I was driven to be the Good Boy: hardworking, loyal, honorable, an earner of money for the family. The Bad Guy cursed, growled, repeated dirty jokes and resisted Brother Jan, the Good Boy served Mass in the mornings and read novels in bed at night.&quot;</p>
<p>In retrospect, I realize that I shared&#0160; a bit of Hamill&#39;s doppelgangerism. In real life, I was a conforming Jekyll; but in my heart, in my soul, I was a fierce dissenter. Lots of anger, lots of unfocussed passion. I didn&#39;t much act upon my Hydeness, except for the occasional adolescent pilfering and the meaningless fights. But how else to account for the violent dreams -- especially the regularly-repeated nightmares where I bashed in the heads of unidentifiable adults with a heavy shovel?&#0160; And buried their bodies in my father&#39;s backyard garden underneath the hybrid teas?&#0160;</p>

		<a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2023/11/a-brooklyn-memoir-robert-stern.html">Another Brooklyn Memoirist: Robert A. M. Stern</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I must confess that I had never heard of architect-entrepreneur Robert Stern until I read Martin Filler&#39;s <em>NYRB</em> review of Stern&#39;s recent autobiography -- which is called <em>Between Memory and Invention</em>: <em>My</em> <em>Journey in Architecture</em>. How could I have been so behindhand, so ill-informed?</p>
<p>Filler&#39;s evaluation of the memoir is sharp-elbowed. He plainly doesn&#39;t like Stern himself although he grudgingly grants that he was a successful dean of architecture at Yale. His critiques of Stern&#39;s buildings are unfriendly and a bit wicked: of Yale&#39;s two newly-constructed colleges, Filler claims that &quot;first-year students might imagine that they&#39;ve wandered into a themed Disney resort called Academialand.&quot; The Comcast Center in Philadelphia, he says, is of &quot;surpassing banality&quot;; the George W. Bush Presidential Center in Dallas &quot;resembles a branch bank in a suburban shopping mall.&quot; Moreover, Filler is is both scornful (and possibly envious) that Stern married into lavish wealth (his wife was a Gimbel heiress). Is it wit or is it bigotry to deride Stern&#39;s progression from a working-class Brooklyn Jewish family to a big time Manhattan success as a typical &quot;rugelach to riches story?&quot;</p>
<p>It was when I learned that Stern was a Brooklyn boy that my interest was provoked and I trotted over to the Boulder Public Library to procure a copy of <em>Memory and Invention. </em>I doubt I would have read the book from cover to cover except for its neighborhood relevance. Robert Stern, it turns out, was not only a local lad but he was born in exactly my year, 1939. He attended public schools and had hoped to attend Erasmus Hall High School, which would have made him my&#0160; classmate, but, he claims, he lived outside of the district and so was shunted to Manual Trades High School (famously featured in the grimy novel and film, <em>The Blackboard Jungl</em>e). It was a surprise to me that he grants a sentence to one of his junior high school classmates, the &quot;diplomat&quot; Matthew Nimetz, whose name I remember from my four years at Erasmus but whose person, as far as I can recall, I never encountered. I have to doubt that Stern was districted out of Erasmus. Manual Trades was a school that students chose, like Stuyvesant or Brooklyn Tech. Stern misremembers. He probably decided to cast his lot with Manual Trades because it was reputed to be a &quot;hands-on&quot; school. It&#39;s doesn&#39;t much matter: he would have been just as unhappy at Erasmus. He craved Harvard and Manhattan and notoriety and money, and none of the local schools would have filled the bill, certainly not EHHS.</p>
<p>Although the lengthy accounts of Stern&#39;s buildings might enlighten and inspire a specialized readership, I myself found the book dispiriting. There is lots of information about commissions procured by sucking up to the mighty and a heck of a lot more about infighting among the high-flying architects than I needed to know. In addition, the book overflows with self-congratulation and is replete with assiduous and triumphal name-dropping.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not for me to judge Stern&#39;s achievement, but I cannot disagree with his contention that architects should be fully steeped in but not restricted by the architecture of the past. I gather that Stern is a &quot;neo-traditionalist&#39; and Filler, his reviewer-critic, a &quot;modernist.&quot;&#0160; I cannot say how many buckets of talent (Filler would say &quot;none!&quot;) that Stern brought to his game, but however many they are, they are only drops in an ocean of ambition.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Despite it all, I was intrigued by Stern&#39;s Brooklyn childhood, especially where his history bisects (or veers away) from my own. His grandparents, like mine, are folks of eastern European shtetl origin who struggled without much success to adapt to the new world. They landed in Brooklyn, which Stern seems to have resented. He yearned for &quot;the city,&quot; Manhattan. I myself did not sufficiently appreciate Brooklyn, and like Stern, I wanted out. Nowadays, it&#39;s embarrassing for me to recall that the one big idea of this Brooklyn &quot;yoot&quot; was to leave the old country, Flatbush, behind. Stern, on the other hand, is unembarrassed: &quot;I disliked Brooklyn--i<em>t was a place to be from and get out of</em> (his italics). The difference between us is that he knew that he wanted Manhattan; I didn&#39;t know what I wanted, I just wanted to go somewhere else, which I have managed to do, having spent most of my life in the mountain west and in green New England.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Stern also knows what all of us old Brooklynites know -- that our once provincial and disrespected borough has become a bit hoity-toity. The realtors have taken over. Stern says that his childhood neighborhood &quot;is now alternately called Windsor Terrace and Kensington, but at the time everyone just called it Flatbush.&quot;&#0160; Which is exactly my recollection. If you had asked me in 1950 what part of Brooklyn I hailed from, I would have said &quot;Flatbush.&quot; But now the PS 217 catchment area is called Kensington or Ditmas Park, expressions that I had never heard until the last decade or so.</p>
<p>One curiosity about <em>Between Memory and Invention</em>: unlike every other Brooklyn reminiscence I have ever read, Stern never mentions the Dodgers. Quite a telling omission, I think, if you think about it for a moment. Nothing about either food or sex, either. An uncharacteristic Brooklyn childhood.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Here follows a list of some of the many activities that I definitely, excruciatingly, do not wish to perform before I kick the ol&#39; kettle. My life is perfectly complete as it stands, and I feel no psychological pressure to engage in any of these anxiety-ridden ventures. Nope, all the pressure is on the side of safety, indolence and sloth. I&#39;m mighty &quot;fulfilled&quot; just as I am. As fulfilled as I want to be.</p>
<p>I do not yearn to explore the depths of the Marianas trench in a submersible -- nor even go down a few hundred feet to view a shipwreck. I prefer the surface of the wine-dark sea, or better still, a quiet pond where, even if I&#39;m a daring distance from the edge, my feet can still touch bottom.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>I do not want to take up diving into shallow rivers from rocky precipices. I&#39;m not interested in being death-defying or picturesque. I can defy death just perfectly while lying on my couch. Also, no bungee-jumping, or, even more lunatic, jumping out of airplanes with a fickle parachute on my back. No thank you.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>I have no desire to smuggle weapons or drugs across the border or into Singapore or Iran. In fact, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll do any smuggling at all. I consider my career as a smuggler, never flourishing, to be absolutely <em>finito</em>.</p>
<p>I do not need to take up a late-life career as a wild-animal trainer. No lions, tigers, bears. Though I do wish that I could do something about the broccoli-eatiing groundhogs.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t wish to train for a second career as a food-taster to the mighty. I wouldn&#39;t be good at the job; I&#39;m chronically, almost terminally hypochondriacal. I would probably find poison in every forkful or sip --&#0160; and then display all sorts of bizarre symptoms. I especially don&#39;t want to be a food taster for people on Mr. Putin&#39;s shit list. No sirree.</p>
<p>I do not want to go dancing with the stars. Never, never, never, never, never (as William Shakespeare wrote in a slightly different context).&#0160; No televised tangos in my future.</p>
<p>I am not going to sign up for that trip to Mars. Or to the moon. Or anywhere that requires a pressure suit. I&#39;m comfortable in my &quot;relaxed fit&quot; jeans and shirt.</p>

                                <p>I first encountered the word &quot;provider&quot; in its positive sense as a virtual synonym for &quot;mensch&quot;: &quot;he was a good provider; he took care of his wife and his kids and his aged parents and even his employees&quot; (if he had any).</p>
<p>But nowadays the word has been stripped of its warm associations and has emerged as a cool or neutral term. I encounter the word most often when I need medical attention. A doctor is no longer a doctor; he&#39;s been renamed a &quot;provider.&quot; I believe this usage to be the invention of the nefarious insurance companies that govern and distort our medical system. &quot;Doctor&quot; and &quot;nurse&quot; are praise-words, rich in significance. &quot;Provider&quot; has no resonance. It reduces your doctor to an index or reference number and is therefore of great utility to the bureaucracy. I can&#39;t imagine that a doctor, asked what he does, would be happy to respond,&#0160; &quot;I&#39;m a provider.&quot;&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>The word &quot;teacher&quot; has, for many, a positive resonance. I was a teacher; I was not an &quot;education provider&quot; -- nor would I have embarked on a career with the aim of being considered such.&#0160;</p>
<p>I believe that nowadays the most common use of the word &quot;provider&quot; occurs in the internet phrase, &quot;content provider.&quot;&#0160; And so the word continues on its long downward path.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I suppose I fell an uncountable number of times in the days of my youth, but to these floppings I paid no mind. I started to take note during my first year in Ithaca, when, a creature of sidewalks and &quot;gutters,&quot; I fell splat on my face in the slopes and snows far above Cayuga&#39;s waters at least a score of times. Lithe and springy, I did not a whit of damage to myself.</p>
<p>Falling became a real issue in my life only when my father, at age 74 in 1978, took a header down a flight of basement stairs at 539 East 9. From that moment, his life changed rapidly for the worse. Whether his&#0160; arthritis was a consequence of the fall, as his doctors claimed (they called it &quot;traumatic arthritis&quot;) I cannot say, but from that time until his death eight years later he was crippled with pain. His once athletic body wasted and shrunk, and his lively step devolved into a sad shuffle. For me, it was a warning and a precedent. Don&#39;t fall.</p>
<p>Nowadays, even though I&#39;m older by several years than my father was when the arthritis finally took his life, and am most definitely marooned in what he liked to call &quot;extra innings,&quot; I&#39;m most aware that it is a fall that could do me in. I take precautions: not paranoid, I hope, but sensible. Some years ago I moved to a building with an elevator -- no more second floor bedrooms or basement washing machines for me. For our West Bradford summers, I&#39;ve put up rope banisters where the ground is steep or irregular. I carry a stick when I walk on the paths or in the woods. &quot;Three legs good, two legs bad.&quot; Even so, this past summer I fell twice. The first time, because a cemetery groundhog had dug a burrow next to a gravestone and grass had grown to conceal his hole. I&#39;m glad the fall was a gentle one, because I would have hated to have gone down in local lore as the guy who died when he cracked his head on an old, lichen-covered tombstone. Too much irony, too much black humor.</p>
<p>My second fall was when a rope snapped -- so not my fault at all. The ropes that we used for a banister on a steep path leading from the dike to the waterfall garden had simply rotted out. I tumbled slowly and gracefully. We&#39;ve now replaced that old rope with a new one so massive that it could secure an aircraft carrier.</p>
<p>Moreover, I&#39;ve stopped going up on ladders -- not even kitchen step ladders. If a ceiling light bulb needs to be changed, I&#39;ll hire someone or beg a favor from a young person. I&#39;m aware of the tragic story of a friend of a friend who lived in a house with a two-story entrance foyer. Though seventyish, he climbed a ladder to straighten a wall hanging and lost his balance. He lingered for a few days, but never regained consciousness.</p>
<p>Some friends of a decade or so younger than I came visiting yesterday. In the course of a lively conversation, I revealed that I shun step stools and ladders. One of the guys said, &quot;I&#39;m not ready to give up climbing on ladders.&quot; I said, &quot;Why not, it&#39;s dangerous -- you can hurt yourself.&quot;&#0160; He said, &quot;I&#39;m too young. It&#39;s a matter of self-respect.&quot; To which I responded, &quot;Fuck self-respect.&quot;</p>
<p>I asked my cardiologist what was going to kill me. She said, at your age, and with your state of health, the most likely cause is either an infection or a fall. Which I take to be good news of a kind. I can be vigilant about infections and I can be very cautious about where I set my feet. Especially so if I remember my &quot;mature&quot; vulnerability and if I keep in mind my father&#39;s history.&#0160;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I&#39;m beginning to feel that I may not be immortal.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>We were sitting on a metal bench in front of the Boulder Public Library, resting up for the half mile walk home. It was unusually peaceful; families in and out, borrowing or returning their bags of books. Once in a while, there&#39;s a discordant note: a homeless, drugged, or deranged person, muttering or sometimes shouting incoherently, dragging a dirty blanket or wheeling a stolen supermarket cart or bicycle. But yesterday there was an event. A large young man, 40ish, had lost his child. He asked us, &quot;have you seen a boy with a red hat.&quot; No we hadn&#39;t, but we said we&#39;d pay attention. The poor distressed guy ran from place to place in the park and in the adjacent parking lot, shouting &quot;Zack.&quot;&#0160; As he became increasingly agitated, so did I. Is there a worse feeling of powerlessness than when you&#39;ve lost contact with your child. As he became more and more frantic, I remembered Florence Dombey and Mrs. Brown, and Etan Patz, and Leiby Kletzky. After a few moments, I said to LERM, &quot;if the boy with the red hat had come out of the library alone, we would have seen and noticed him. He&#39;s got to be inside the library and I&#39;m going to find him.&quot; I walked into the building and almost immediately heard some high-pitched crying from somewhere in the stacks. In a few seconds I located the boy (four-years-old, I would guess). I said to him, &quot;I know exactly where your father is and I&#39;m going to take you to him.&quot; I took the boy&#39;s hand and walked out of the library -- almost immediately to encounter the crazed parent coming our way. I released the child and in a second he was in his father&#39;s arms. Father and son consoled each other. I sat back down on our bench, knowing that I had done a good deed. It was a very satisfying, human feeling. After a brief while, we walked home uneventfully.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>My first visit in four months to the new acquisitions shelf of the Boulder Public Library turned out to be fruitful, for I discovered J. H. Stiehm&#39;s 2023 biography of Janet Reno: <em>Janet Reno, A Life</em> (Gainesville, Fl). Janet was a classmate (&#39;60) at Cornell and also proceeded with me to Harvard, where she was one of 16 women in her law school class, and I was a undistinguished graduate student in GSAS. I knew her slightly at Cornell; she &quot;sat desk&quot; at Sage Hall, where I was a frequent caller. Our relationship never advanced beyond superficial chat and I was surprised as all get out when she re-emerged in 1993, having been appointed Attorney-General by President Clinton. She served in that position for eight years and made quite a mark.&#0160;</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been on a project of reading the memoirs of members of my age-cohort, especially of those with whom I&#39;ve crossed paths, even if ever so slightly.&#0160; I think that so far, Janet Reno is the only one of my acquaintances who&#39;s earned not just an autobiography, but a biography of her own.</p>
<p>I was particularly interested in the paragraphs about Janet&#39;s Cornell and Harvard years, but I&#39;m sorry to report that those sections are notably thin and superficial. Stiehm&#39;s account make Cornell seem archaic and primitive -- out of a 1930s movie. It is news to me that &quot;freshman wore beanies, sophomores had Cornell sweaters, juniors had blazers, and seniors had straw hats.&quot; Mere mythology. It&#39;s true, though, that there was considerable drinking at fraternity and apartment parties, but for what college was that not true?</p>
<p>Careless errors: Janet did not live at Dickinson Hall, she lived at Clara Dickson Hall. She did not study political theory with non-existent Professor Mario Anatti, but no doubt she did take classes with the distinguished scholar-politician Mario Einaudi.</p>
<p>Stiehm passes over in silence the most egregious moment in Janet&#39;s career -- when she was suckered into allowing villainous Ken Starr to expand his probe into Bill Clinton&#39;s sexual adventures. Either an apology or an explanation should surely have been in order.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I was at the old-age home (sorry, &quot;retirement community&quot;) last week -- a place that gives me the creeps even though many of my friends and former colleagues seem to live there happily. (I&#39;m on the waiting list but I hope that I&#39;ll never be constrained to move in.)&#0160; I was there to share lunch with a 90-year-old friend. At the next table over (in the rather luxurious dining room) was a woman whom I knew slightly fifty years ago -- as a neighbor and as the mother of a Flatirons Elementary School tudent. She&#39;s 89, a widow, and still healthy, still attractive.</p>
<p>She (let&#39;s call her Ms. GK) initiated the conversation with this question. &quot;Is your wife still alive?&quot;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>It wasn&#39;t the inquiry itself that took me aback. It was the casual way in which it was asked, with no more emotional resonance than, say, &quot;do you want raisins in your cereal?&quot; or, &quot;is it raining outside?&quot;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Which made me realize that Ms. GK --&#0160; and all her fellow denizens of the facility -- live in a world of &quot;sole-survivors&quot; where the deaths of spouses &quot;<em>were as plentie as&#0160;Blackberries.&quot; </em>Therefore, there is nothing noteworthy or remarkable for her to inquire about the status of a long time companion, especially when more than half of husbands and wives have already kicked the old bucket.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the lack of emotion, the cold bloodedness, the absence of euphemism, of Ms. GK&#39;s question produced in me a &quot;take stock&quot; moment. Whether we are in or out of the institution, we are in the same ninth-decade world.</p>
<p>But I do hope that I myself do not become quite so matter-of-fact about the death of friends and family.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>As a youth, I spent many a happy hour in the Brooklyn Botanic Garden. One of the plantings that I remember vividly was what I conceived of as a &quot;wall&quot; of bottlebrush buckeyes. It&#39;s been many a year, but what stands in my memory is roughly 40 or 50 linear feet of 20-foot-tall decorative shrubs in full flower.</p>
<p>So naturally, when I came to West Bradford, I tried to reproduce the effect. I just happened to have a perfect spot for a wall of buckeyes -- a fertile slope of the proper size and shape. In 1980 (plus or minus a year or so) I purchased two such plants from White Flower Farm in Connecticut and set them 30 feet apart, optimistically hoping that over the course of the years they would expand to fill in the allotted space.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>It did not happen. One of the plants lingered for a year or so before giving up the ghost; the other stood still -- grew a bit, then died back over the winter. Our Zone 3 Vermont weather proved to be too harsh for a plant that had thrived in Zone 6 Brooklyn. I resigned my self to the fact that my experiment with the bottlebrush buckeye was a failure.</p>
<p>But then perhaps 10 years ago, after decades of stagnancy, the plant began to increase in size. Global warming?&#0160; Wetter summers? Maturity? I can&#39;t say. And then this past summer, after forty-plus years of doing virtually nothing, the bottlebrush buckeye produced some flowers. And there they are -- long awaited and very welcome!</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef02c8d39993ee200c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="IMG_1453" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef02c8d39993ee200c img-responsive" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef02c8d39993ee200c-320wi" title="IMG_1453" /></a></p>
<p>(The purplish plant in the background is Joe Pye weed, <em>eutrochium purpureum</em>, which thrives and multiplies without the least bit of assistance from me. And also a 20-year-old weeping willow and young Eastern cottonwood, which I set in place about 5 years ago.)</p>
<p>This past summer, dazzled that the buckeye produced its extravagant flowers at last, I gave it a few hours of care. Weeded it, pruned away the dead growth,&#0160; and gave it a small optimisitc dose of 10-10-10 fertilizer. I&#39;m very curious to see what happens next summer. Could it be that my 40-year old experiment will succeed at last?</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>&quot;And you&#39;re still at home,&quot; observed Mr. Henry, who had arrived to repair our on-the-fritz propane-powered clothes dryer. (Mr. Henry has been curating our appliances for a generation; he can diagnose a problem by a glance from several yards away, or perhaps he does it by magic. He&#39;s a kind of stove and refrigerator genius).&#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;At home?&quot; Mr. Henry had inquired about my age and I had confessed my longevity. &quot;Confessed&quot; is not exactly the right word. &quot;Bragged,&quot; perhaps. I&#39;ve reached the age when I don&#39;t mind if people ask about my years. I&#39;m proud, I think, to have reached 84 and 5/12s still able to do a day&#39;s work -- when many of my friends and former colleagues have plummeted off the cliff or have moved to a &quot;senior living&quot; (formerly called &quot;old age&quot;) residence.</p>
<p>But Mr. Henry&#39;s comment took me aback -- took me a few seconds to grasp. &quot;Still at home?&quot; Where else would I be? Ah, in an institution.&#0160;</p>
<p>I wonder about the difference between the 84-year-old person that Mr. Henry perceived and the 84 that I experience, internally, every day. To myself, I&#39;m certainly not the geezer that I catch sight of in the mirror. Gray, paunchy, a trifle stooped. A bit unsteady on his feet. Even on my best days, I&#39;m not as vigorous, even middle-age vigorous, as I once was. I tire easily and rest often. Work a bit, nap a bit. I no longer perform feats of strength, not only because my muscles have shrunk, but because I&#39;m afraid of injuring my always-vulnerable back.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>I don&#39;t feel seventeen, but I feel myself to be myself. I&#39;m competent. My brain, thanks be to all the gods and goddesses in the various pantheons, is still functioning well, though I&#39;m troubled by &quot;noun loss.&quot;&#0160; I know which plant is a delphinium and which a hyssop, but there are days when those nouns just disappear and can&#39;t be recalled. Same with the names of people. The recall system is as fragile as the dryer, but the storage system is working just fine (if I&#39;m patient).&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>I find that sometimes people who look only at my outside underestimate my abilities and give me credit and even praise for actions that I think of as routine. I find this phenomenon to be mildly insulting. It&#39;s no fun to exceed expectations when the expectations are so low.&#0160; At the same time, I know that the task that I can easily dispatch today, might be one that I won&#39;t be able to perform tomorrow. And yet I don&#39;t want to allow myself to be patronized or applauded for putting my pants on correctly,&#0160;</p>
<p>I no longer feel immortal. In fact, I feel mortality pressing in on me. I don&#39;t fear death, but I&#39;m not ready for it. I&#39;m enjoying life far too much. How I would feel if my various twinges and aches turned into chronic pains I cannot say. But for today the watchword is, <em>press on</em>!</p>

                                <p>It&#39;s the end of August 2023, and what an unusual summer so far. It&#39;s all about the rain -- constant, unremitting, monsoony.&#0160; Record-setting.&#0160; Last week we had three dry days in a row -- first time this entire summer. I&#39;ve not once seen the stars. One of the great pleasures here is the shiny distinct Milky Way on a clear night -- but there has not been a single cloudless night in months. The pond, therefore, has been gloriously filled and the waterfall, characteristically only a trickle at this season, is still a veritable picturesque and noisy Niagara. We had a great blueberry crop this year, but not a single edible plum, perhaps because of the late frost. The vegetables have done well, especially the tomatoes and cucumbers. I don&#39;t know why I haven&#39;t seen a single cabbage butterfly this summer -- but I&#39;m glad they&#39;ve shunned us. Ditto the tomato hornworm. Is it the rain? We&#39;ve had more tomatoes than we can eat even after giving away bagsful. LERM and I have had a great time, weather permitting, with the various flower gardens. Delphiniums and phlox have had especially good years -- and we&#39;ve planted some new shrubs --hydrangeas and weigelas -- and extended the day lily borders. Mowing has been a challenge, because the grass grows so rapidly and there are so few days when it&#39;s dry enough to cut. As a result, when I do find an opportunity, the grass comes out of the machine in wet clumps and plugs. Unsightly, to say the least. NGP has not been impeded by the weather or by the surgery. He&#39;s out there every day tending to the forest and expanding his course. Not many guests (my friends are becoming too old to travel). BHP and his family were here for almost three weeks -a great pleasure -- but the daughter never appeared,.</p>
<p>And to think that last summer was so droughty that the well went dry.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve done some reading but no writing -- not even on this blague.&#0160;&#0160;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef02b68533db17200d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Screen Shot 2023-04-18 at 8.54.24 AM" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef02b68533db17200d image-full img-responsive" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef02b68533db17200d-800wi" title="Screen Shot 2023-04-18 at 8.54.24 AM" /></a></p>
<p>This is a picture of my maternal grandparents, my mother&#39;s parents, Sonia and Joseph Green. I imagine that it was the work of a professional photographer. I guess that the image dates from when he was about thirty years old and she twenty-five -- so 1910 or thereabouts. I have no idea why the photograph has faded to blue-purple; it used to be ordinary black-and-white. I believe that the costumes that the formal young couple wear were hired for the occasion, as was the habit in those days; I doubt that their wallets would have permitted such fashionable dress.</p>
<p>They&#39;re a handsome young couple, are they not?&#0160; She very feminine, even delicate, prominently displaying her wedding ring; he sporting a slightly rakish mustache and a full head of youthful hair. When I knew him, forty years later, his hair was white and very sparse.</p>
<p>Sonia Chafetz and Joseph Usilewski arrived at Ellis Island in August of 1904, traveling steerage from Rotterdam. I&#39;ve written about my grandmother Sonia <a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2006/01/sonia_green.html" ping="/url?sa=i&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=0CDcQw7AJahcKEwigkaGR2rP-AhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQAw&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.drmetablog.com%2F2006%2F01%2Fsonia_green.html&amp;psig=AOvVaw3w6Cq0W74eRbbi5xok6_4j&amp;ust=1681916530074621" rel="noopener" tabindex="0" target="_blank">here.</a>&#0160;</p>
<p>I know very little about my grandfather, Joseph Usilewski, later Green. I was thirteen when he died, in 1952, from the last of his five heart attacks. Although my grandparents lived just around the corner on Coney Island Avenue, and I found myself in their presence very often, we had little to say to each other -- mostly because I spoke only English and his English was halting at best. We sometimes played 500 rummy and fan-tan, and I can remember him saying, &quot;Now I&#39;m in a predicament&quot; before discarding, but that&#39;s about the most intimate we became. He was aloof and unsmiling --not in any sense &quot;fun.&quot; But why should he be? His life had not been easy. He was from Minsk in present-day Belarus and was trained to be a pharmacist, but he had been drafted into the Russian army for the usual twenty-year term. His pay, he told me, was &quot;a ruble every other month, when we got it.&quot; So he did the sensible thing -- deserted and ran off to America with Sonia. The family story, which I heard from my mother, was that both Joseph and Sonia were engaged to other people when they met and eloped. My mother also said that when they arrived New York they had just one pair of shoes between them and that Sonia would wait at home until Joseph came home from work before she could leave the house. My mother also told me that when she herself was born (June 14, 1905), her father was not allowed to visit Sonia in the hospital because he could not prove that he was her husband (no ring, no papers). Whether my grandparents were ever legally married, I do not know; nor does it matter.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>My grandfather was a strict father; my mother said that he raised his children &quot;with the belt.&quot; There was a two-year period when he wouldn&#39;t speak to my then young-adult mother because he disapproved of her male friendships.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think his was a happy marriage; he was frequently absent and it has been supposed that there were &quot;other women&quot; in his life. Nor was he a great success in the new continent; he never found a home in the world of business although as far as I know he was always employed and never in debt. In his last years he worked as a messenger carrying papers and money from one downtown business to another. When I knew him, he and Sonia lived in a very modest two-room apartment (in a third-floor &quot;walkup&quot;).&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>I suppose I should mention that although born Jewish, neither Joseph nor Sonia practiced their religion. Neither of them ever attended a synagogue or even honored Rosh Hashanah or Pesach at home. Joseph was a socialist and an active member of the Workmen&#39;s Circle, in his day a mutual aid society for recent immigrants. I know nothing of his political commitments except that he had a deep loathing for the communist government of Russia. &quot;Worse than the czars.&quot;</p>
<p>Joseph had a brother, Nahum, and a sister whose name I have forgotten. Neither of his siblings had children.</p>
<p>If I had been more enterprising, I might have learned from Joseph and his family what life was like in White Russia in the nineteenth century. But I was too young, too self-centered. Too bad.</p>

                                <p>Wow, carded at this great advanced age! Not, of course, carded so as to be permitted to purchase alcoholic beverages.&#0160; Those days are long since gone, and besides, I don&#39;t drink.</p>
<p>It was yesterday, at the Denver Art Museum, when I asked for senior tickets (a big $2.00 discount). &quot;May I see your driver&#39;s license. I have to check that you&#39;re over 65?&quot; &quot;Are you kidding, I&#39;m 84!&quot;&#0160; &quot;No, I need to see it.&quot; Needed to see LERM&#39;s also, although she&#39;s 79. Frankly, we were both a bit flattered, even if it was all because of bureaucratic procedure rather than guess-your-age eyeballing.</p>
<p>I remember that a score of years ago, a clerk at a some venue or other scanned my face and without the least hesitation charged me senior fare. I was then only 65 and was slightly insulted to be taken for my full actual age. Now, a similar but upside-down situation, and I&#39;m mighty amused.</p>

<div aria-level="3" class="dbg0pd" role="heading"><span class="OSrXXb">Although I regularly walk our many nearby scenic mountain trails, I&#39;m not a genuinely &quot;outdoorsy&quot; person. I don&#39;t ski, or snowboard, and I certainly don&#39;t rock climb. No climbing at all if I can help it. At this time, I have no plans to &quot;summit&quot; anything, not even my step stool.&#0160; My camping days are long over; no more sleeping outside even in a fancy modern tent. So it&#39;s not I who is the target of the two dozen outdoor gear shops that are within neighborly distance of my well-heated home and welcoming mattress.</span></div>
<div aria-level="3" class="dbg0pd" role="heading">&#0160;</div>
<div aria-level="3" class="dbg0pd" role="heading"><span class="OSrXXb"> These &quot;gear&quot; stores are ubiquitous; a guy can hardly take a few steps on the semi-famous Boulder Mall without stumbling into one or another. </span><span class="OSrXXb"><span class="OSrXXb">Perhaps you think that I exaggerate? Let&#39;s look at the facts. Right within a block or two there&#39;s Red Fox Outdoor Equipment (&quot;crafted for adventure&quot;); HIMALI (&quot;</span></span>apparel that stands up to the highest and harshest conditions on Planet Earth&quot;; Teton; Black Diamond (&quot;designed for epic outdoor adventures&quot;); Stio (&quot;built for Alpine pursuits&quot;), Burton (snowboards, boots, outerwear); Mount Inspiration Apparel; The North Face; Eddie Bauer; Arc&#39;teryx (&quot;weatherproof footwear and apparel&quot;); Fjäälraven (a Swedish outpost); Amundsen (Norwegian); Moosejaw (&quot;funky fun-loving climbing gear&quot;); Epic Mountain Gear; MontBell; Backcountry (&quot;gear up for fresh powder&quot;); REI; Neptune Mountaineering; Helly Hansen; Patagonia; Nomad (&quot;a mountain lifestyle retailer&quot;); Cotopaxi (&quot;sustainably-designed outdoor gear&quot;); Volcom &quot;skating &amp; snowboarding-inspired apparel&quot;); Norrøna Concept Store (outdoor apparel plus espresso bar); Christy Sports; Rapha &quot;world&#39;s finest cycling clothing&quot;). In addition, there are also several &quot;previously owned&quot; -- formerly called &quot;second hand&quot; -- outdoor gear shops.</div>
<div aria-level="3" class="dbg0pd" role="heading">&#0160;</div>
<div aria-level="3" class="dbg0pd" role="heading">Who buys all this stuff? Boulder doesn&#39;t contain enough bravers-of-the-elements to support so many enterprises. Perhaps it&#39;s the tourists. It&#39;s also been theorized that most of the gear business is internet-driven and that the various manufacturers like to boast a brick-and-mortar presence in prestigious Boulder. I wouldn&#39;t know; I&#39;m perpetually gearless.</div>
<div aria-level="3" class="dbg0pd" role="heading">&#0160;</div>
<div aria-level="3" class="dbg0pd" role="heading">Should a slug-a-bed like myself feel indolent and guilty in the presence of such passionate mountaineering energy?&#0160; Maybe a little, but mostly I&#39;m amused by what seems to me conspicuous equipment consumption. Life is not about &quot;gear.&quot;&#0160;</div>
<div aria-level="3" class="dbg0pd" role="heading">&#0160;</div>
<div aria-level="3" class="dbg0pd" role="heading">Question: does our Mall have more outdoor gear shops than it does marijuana outlets?&#0160; Or coffee shops? A census is warranted.&#0160;</div>
<div aria-level="3" class="dbg0pd" role="heading">&#0160;</div>
<div aria-level="3" class="dbg0pd" role="heading">What would the Boulder Mall look like if I myself were the target audience. Well, it just so happens that many years ago I designed a <a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2017/03/mallofme.html ">mall of me.</a> You can look it up.</div>

                                <p>We were invited for dinner at the place to which a number of my &quot;senior&quot; friends have retreated. The experience was cordial and civilized, but somehow troubling. I know one thing: I don&#39;t want to wind up there. I&#39;m staying put as long as I possibly can.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Too many old folks. I want to live where there are people of all ages and varieties. Babies and toddlers and tweens and teen-agers and young adults. More activity, fewer canes and crutches and walkers.</p>
<p>The place, though handsome and well-appointed, seemed to me to be inhospitable. Supervisors at every entrance. We had to check in at a fancy kiosk where some sort of electronic device took our official data and printed out a visitor badge, which I pocketed. It felt much too &quot;policed.&quot;</p>
<p>The dining room was hushed and mannerly. The food was institutional-plus, but nevertheless institutional. I much prefer my own cooking; I&#39;ve made a fetish of self-sufficiency all these years and I&#39;d like to continue so. I like to stir my own pot.</p>
<p>The apartments are splendid, but the long narrow corridors between apartments are oppressive. Too reminiscent of hospitals. Or jails.</p>
<p>My principal objection: friends who have moved there become subsumed into the society of the place. They participate in the home&#39;s &quot;activities.&quot; It&#39;s good and healthy for them, I suppose, but my friends become lost to me. Swallowed in a kindly maw. It&#39;s scary, to those of us who don&#39;t want to be swallowed.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll stay here on Walnut Street as long as I can. As in the traditional resolve, I plan to leave &quot;feet-first.&quot; But we shall see what the future brings.</p>

		<a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2023/03/boot-booty-bootless-.html">Words of My Life: Boot</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Is there another common English word that exhibits such varied meanings as &quot;boot?&quot; Or one that has shown such continual transformation during my brief years on the planet?</p>
<p>Like much of my early vocabulary, &quot;boot&quot; entered my life through the medium of <a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2006/10/radio_baseball.html">radio baseball </a>. In my mind&#39;s ear, I can hear the voice of Red Barber announcing that &quot;umpire Babe Pinelli has just given the <strong>boot</strong> to Leo Durocher.&quot; &quot;Given the boot&quot; does not make the claim that Durocher was presented with footwear; it means that he was kicked out of the game as if with a metaphorically-booted foot.</p>
<p>Nor was it only obstreperous managers who were &quot;booted.&quot; &quot;There&#39;s a two-hopper to third, but Cox boots it&quot; -- meaning that he bobbled it, even though the ball never touched his foot. In baseball, curiously, you can boot a ball with your hand, which is, logically speaking, as nonsensical as mis-gloving it with your foot.&#0160;</p>
<p>As everyone knows, a boot primarily protects the area from the shin down to the toes. But there&#39;s a second common meaning to &quot;boot&quot;: &quot;something extra,&quot; as in the phrase &quot;to boot.&quot; &quot;He&#39;s a great pitcher -- and a good hitter <strong>to boot</strong>.&quot; The shoe-ish meaning comes through old French from a Germanic source; the profit or use or something-extra meaning derives from an unrelated OE (Old English) word; moreover, in latter stages of its development &quot;boot&quot; has also been influenced by its phonological neighbors booty, and, I suspect, butt.&#0160;</p>
<p>In order to gain some historical perspective, let us consider the ways in which Shakespeare makes use of the word boot. &quot;To boot&quot; meaning &quot;in addition&quot; is employed frequently, as, for example, when Henry IV swears &quot;by my scepter and my soul <strong>to boo</strong>t,&quot; or when Macduff says to Malcolm that &quot;I would not be the villain that thou think&#39;st/ For the whole space that&#39;s in the tyrant&#39;s grasp/ And the rich east to <strong>boot</strong>.&quot; A less familiar use occurs in <em>The Winter&#39;s Tale</em>, when Hermione, accused of adultery, concedes that&#0160; &quot;it shall scarce <strong><span class="keyword1">boot</span></strong> me/ To say &#39;not guilty.&#39;&quot; Her &quot;boot&quot; means that it will not be to her advantage or profit to assert her innocence. This signification can shade over into gain or even into a coin itself, as for example when Camillo passes money to Autolycus, saying,&quot;hold thee, there&#39;s some <strong>boot</strong>.&quot; Contemplating his gain, Autolycus muses, &quot;What an exchange had this been without <strong><span class="keyword1">boot</span></strong>! What a&#0160;<strong><span class="keyword1">boot</span></strong> is here with this exchange.&quot; Just as boot is gain, so bootless means without gain or helpless, as when Henry V explains that he will be powerless to restrain a rampage: &quot;We may as<strong> <span class="keyword1">bootless</span></strong> spend our vain command/ Upon the enraged soldiers in their spoil.&quot;</p>
<p>Shakespeare gets some punning mileage out of the multiple meanings of &quot;boot.&quot; Glendower boasts that &quot;[T]hree times hath Henry Bolingbroke made head/ Against my power; thrice from the banks of Wye/ And sandy-bottom&#39;d Severn have I sent him/ <strong><span class="keyword1">Bootless</span> </strong>home and weather-beaten back. &quot;Bootless&quot; means helpless; but sardonic Hotspur, never noted for a sophisticated sense of humor, cannot resist the obvious pun: &quot;Home without boots. And in foul weather too.&quot;</p>
<p>So a boot can be a shoe, an advantage, an addition, a reward, a help. But look what&#39;s happened to the poor helpless word in more recent times. &quot;Boot Hill&quot; is a cowboy frontier cemetery.&#0160; Across the waters, a &quot;boot&quot; is the trunk of an automobile. The infamous &quot;Denver boot&quot; is a wheel clamp that immobilizes a vehicle. In the army, a boot is a recruit or rookie who is sent to &quot;boot camp.&quot;</p>
<p>But then, along came the computer, where one &quot;boots&quot; or restarts one&#39;s machine. This use, I&#39;m told, originated with the phrase, to &quot;pull oneself up by one&#39;s own bootstraps&quot; -- i.e. perform a difficult task at one&#39;s own initiative, just as a computer starts itself. There&#39;s also the <strong>warmboot</strong>, which sounds little too much like the old torture device, the <strong>Spanish boot</strong> and which can also be called a s<strong>oftboot </strong>(but not by me).&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>In Shakespeare&#39;s day,<strong> boot</strong> was not always distinguished from &quot;booty&quot; as in the case of the Archbishop of Canterbury&#39;s famous bees, which &quot;like soldiers, armed in their stings,/ Make <strong>boot&#0160;</strong>upon the summer&#39;s velvet buds,/ Which pillage they with merry march bring home.&quot; Booty as pillage survives to this day, but is, I think, obsolescent. Nowadays, booty is more likely to be used in the phrase &quot;booty call&quot; which means (and here I&#39;m relying on the invaluable <em>Urban Dictionary</em>) a &quot;telephone call made to request a sexual encounter.&quot; Who would ever have devised or imagined such an innovation?&#0160; Does this booty derive from &quot;shake your booty,&quot; meaning to move your butt or bottom in a sexually suggestive way?&#0160; Not a meaning known to Shakespeare, or at least, not one that the Shakespeare concordance acknowledges.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Am I just plain nuts to think that I live in a safe and secure world? All the evidence says &quot;perpetual vigilance&quot; and &quot;it can happen here&quot; and &quot;keep a close watch?&#0160;</p>
<p>Let&#39;s look at the situation.&#0160;</p>
<p>Our state has a violent history. In the far past: at Sand Creek in 1864, several hundred Cheyenne and Arapahos were brutally murdered. In 1914, a century or so ago, the Pinkertons, employed by the Rockefellers, killed no-one-knows-how-many miners when they shot randomly into the Ludlow tent colony.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>More recently, killing has become the work not of army or paid professionals but of heavily armed civilians. In 1999 there was the horrible Columbine High School massacre in which twelve were killed and twenty-one wounded. Just thirteen years later came the mass killing inside a Century 16 theater in Aurora, just a few miles south of where I live, in which twelve people were killed and another seventy injured. Then in 2015 there was a shooting at a Planned Parenthood clinic in which three were assassinated and nine others wounded. In March of 2021, just two years ago, in the Table Mesa King Soopers, a &quot;gunman&quot; killed ten -- customers, employees, a police officer. And last year, we had the nightclub shooting in Colorado Springs where five were murdered and twenty-five others wounded.</p>
<p>I didn&#39;t happen to be in any of these places, but I might have been. Although I wasn&#39;t at the Columbine school, I was at that very moment in a different classroom in Denver; I didn&#39;t go to the movies to see the <em>Dark Knight</em>, but I do go to theaters. It wasn&#39;t &quot;my&quot; King Soopers that was terrorized, but nevertheless I&#39;ve bought stuff at that very store many times when I&#39;ve happened to be in south Boulder; I wasn&#39;t at the Colorado Springs bar but I&#39;ve certainly patronized bars. In any one of these cases, It could just as easily have been me that was shot dead or maimed. I&#39;ve been one lucky fellow, but people much like me have not been so fortunate.</p>
<p>Two days ago, a vicious prank phone call set off a scramble and shelter-in-place warnings at two-block away Boulder High School. BHS is where AGP and our three children spent many a year. This scare turned out to be a case of &quot;swatting&quot; -- a disgusting new practice in which a nasty sociopath calls an institution to see if he can get a reaction from a SWAT team. Deliberate malice. Such false alarms are not mass killings, but they&#39;re still hair-raising, anxiety-provoking, and potentially dangerous events.</p>
<p>It&#39;s coming close to home, isn&#39;t it. Luck of the draw, so to speak, that I&#39;m still whole.</p>
<p>When I was a teacher, I was never in real danger but, like everyone else on the faculty, I had a few deranged students. I remember once that a particularly odd young lady asked to make an appointment for a conference. Wary of her, I proposed that instead of her coming to my office that we meet in the public cafeteria. l can&#39;t remember what she wanted to talk about, but I recall vividly that at one point she asked, &quot;do you think I have a gun in my purse?&quot;&#0160; I replied &quot;I don&#39;t know whether you do or not, but I know that this meeting is now over.&quot; I stood up and walked away, half convinced that I was about to be shot in the back. But I wasn&#39;t.&#0160;</p>
<p>It&#39;s a violent world; no one has ever been truly safe. But all we can do is go blithely about our business, hoping to be spared.</p>
<p>I shouldn&#39;t complain; we&#39;re not in a war zone; it&#39;s not like Ukraine, where at any moment Russian drones and shells and missiles can drop on you from the sky.&#0160;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn">
<div class="css-53u6y8">
<p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">I cannot think of a word that has undergone greater change during the course of my lifetime than the plain monosyllable &quot;hack.&quot;</p>
<p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">&quot;Hack&quot; entered my language, like much of my early vocabulary, through the medium of baseball. &quot;He took a good hack at that fastball;&quot; &quot;he&#39;s up there hacking away.&quot; A hack was a hard swing, not necessarily a successful one. [There was also Stan Hack, the great Chicago Cub third baseman whose career was just coming to an end as I was becoming conscious.]&#0160; In the days of my youth, &quot;hack&quot; was also slang for taxicab and a cab driver was a &quot;hackie.&quot; I don&#39;t believe I&#39;ve heard that particular use of the word in decades (except in 1940s movies). In seventh-grade &quot;shop&quot; class at PS 217, Mr. Kaminsky introduced me to the &quot;hacksaw.&quot; The hack in hacksaw derives from a medieval word meaning &quot;cut into pieces,&quot; but the taxi hack has an entirely dissimilar origin. It comes from hackney, a breed of horse and later the carriage itself that the horse drew -- the name of which then migrated to our big yellow taxi.</p>
<p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">When did I first hear the expression, a &quot;hacking cough&quot;?&#0160; And why hacking? Perhaps because the noise of a cough is similar to the sound of the short sharp blows when one hacks through a forest or the jungle with a machete. Maybe that&#39;s how it originated-- but I&#39;m not entirely convinced.</p>
<p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">Hack has another older meaning -- mediocre or failing, or not good at one&#39;s trade, as in a &quot;hack writer,&quot; or a &quot;political hack.&quot; This usage is probably a shortened version of &quot;hackneyed,&quot; meaning trite or overused. When you waste time, you&#39;re just &quot;hacking around.&quot; In such cases,&quot;hack&quot; denoted incompetence.</p>
<p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">Nowadays &quot;hack&quot; has come up in the world. To hack into a computer implies not laziness but skill. In this usage, &quot;hack&quot; is also malicious. Hackers may be smart but they&#39;re also dangerous; they can cause crashes when they illegally intrude to alter a program.&#0160;</p>
<p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">The most common contemporary use of &quot;hack,&quot; if I&#39;m reading the data correctly, occurs in the recent coinage &quot;lifehack,&quot; which is defined as &quot;a strategy or technique adopted in order to manage one&#39;s time and daily activities in a more efficient way.&quot; I can&#39;t be the only person whose junk mail folder is regularly inundated with recommended lifehacks, most of which seem mighty silly or simplistic.&#0160;</p>
<p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">And then there&#39;s an even more specialized use. Here&#39;s one that&#39;s new to me: &quot;scientists announced that they had genetically hacked tobacco plants to photosynthesize more efficiently.&quot; This usage seems to retain something of the older meaning of cut or slash although it is a stretch to envision a genome being attacked by a sword or a snickersnee.&#0160;</p>
<p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">Goodness gracious, it&#39;s a long road from waving at an inshoot with the old hickory to inserting bits of DNA in the tobacco genome. But here we are.</p>

                                <p>In this one, I was lying in restless sleep in my own bed, when a figure, a man, came at me. He tried to get under my covers, and I cried out, &quot;You can&#39;t get into bed with me. I&#39;m a married woman!&quot;&#0160; Very theatrical -- and strange enough, but the details are even more peculiar.&#0160; Of course I&#39;m not a woman -- I&#39;m an octogenarian man -- but not in the dream. Secondly the man who was trying to attack me, though identifiably male, had the face of a stereotypical witch -- long crooked nose, verrucose almost echinulate skin, etc.&#0160; In addition, my bedmate, who in real life is a woman, was, in the dream, male. That&#39;s a heck of a lot of gender confusion for one dream fragment.</p>
<p>What is most memorable, however, is my plaintive cry -- &quot;you can&#39;t get into my bed.&#0160; I&#39;m a married woman.&quot;&#0160; How to interpret this sentence?&#0160; I can invent any number of bizarre &quot;&#39;Freudian&quot; theories, but in fact I have no idea, except for the opinion that I&#39;ve expressed before on this blog, that I&#39;m a mighty dull, conventional fellow from 7am to 11pm, but from 11pm until morning, I&#39;m crazy imaginative, unconventional, and possibly even interesting.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>In the course of my lifetime, the telephone has gone from relatively rare to ubiquitous, from wall to pocket, and from rotary dial to cell. From no intelligence whatsoever to smart and then to very smart. Revolutionary changes.</p>
<p>When I was growing up in Flatbush, our family was prosperous enough to have a telephone (not everyone did), but the device was only employed for local calls, never for &quot;long distance.&quot; Non-local calls were prohibitively expensive and were only for deaths. To be called to the phone by long-distance was ominous.</p>
<p>Before the innovation of seven-digit dialing, we were Windsor 6-2077. Sometime after WWII, our exchange was altered from WI 6 to GEdney 6. To me, this was an early indication that the world was unstable and would be filled with ups and downs. One day we were a Windsor, a royal house, and the next day we were a Gedney, a brand of dill pickle.&#0160;</p>
<p>Every telephone in existence looked exactly like this one.&#0160; The idea that they would ever look otherwise was inconceivable.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef02b7516fe99d200b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Screen Shot 2023-02-08 at 9.55.22 AM" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef02b7516fe99d200b image-full img-responsive" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef02b7516fe99d200b-800wi" title="Screen Shot 2023-02-08 at 9.55.22 AM" /></a></p>
<p>For a month of so in the late 1950s, I had a job operating an old-fashioned switchboard at the Sears warehouse on Utica Avenue -- definitely my most satisfying telephone-related experience, lifetime. Ah that lovely click when the plug fully entered its receptacle! A delight!&#0160; The one I sat at looked almost exactly like this:</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef02b751944807200c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Screen Shot 2023-02-08 at 3.58.27 PM" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef02b751944807200c image-full img-responsive" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef02b751944807200c-800wi" title="Screen Shot 2023-02-08 at 3.58.27 PM" /></a></p>
<p>In my short time at the console, I became quite a proficient operator, only cutting off important calls a handful of times. It&#39;s hard to believe that such an antiquated-looking machine was still in use when I was a lad.</p>
<p>We must also recall the almost extinct telephone booth -- often out of order, because someone wielded a crowbar to make off with nickels and dimes. And smelly. Plus, one never had the right change when needing it most.&#0160; I do not mourn the passing of the phone booth.</p>
<p>When we moved to Vermont in 1968, the Topsham Telephone Company had not yet switched to seven digit dialing. Our home number was high-prestige 21, but we were jealous of the family whose number was 9. Ours was a four-party line -- also a thing of the past. I wonder whether my grandchildren have ever heard the phrase &quot;party-line.&quot;&#0160; Or &quot;rotary dial,&quot; for that matter.</p>
<p>When AT&amp;T was deregulated and the market was thrown open to innovation, there came a great explosion of telephone styles. Phones blossomed into many odd colors and configurations. For a while, we owned one of these:</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef02b7516fec5a200b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Screen Shot 2023-02-08 at 11.12.49 AM" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef02b7516fec5a200b image-full img-responsive" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef02b7516fec5a200b-800wi" title="Screen Shot 2023-02-08 at 11.12.49 AM" /></a></p>
<p>The Simpson phone was not my initiative but that of one of the younger members of the family.</p>
<p>But more change was in the works. The prediction that there would be pocket phones in the future seemed fantastical science fiction-y.&#0160; All phones had to be connected with wires -- otherwise how could the sound get out of the wall and into the handset. I scoffed.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef02b685273136200d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Screen Shot 2023-02-08 at 11.06.28 AM" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef02b685273136200d image-full img-responsive" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef02b685273136200d-800wi" title="Screen Shot 2023-02-08 at 11.06.28 AM" /></a></p>
<p>Nowadays, everyone carries a cell phone. But it&#39;s not just a phone -- it&#39;s a computer. It does everything -- perhaps too much. There is substance to the frequently heard complaint that some individuals, especially young &#39;uns, relate more readily to their cell than to the person sitting next to them. It&#39;s a paradox: with more potential communication comes more loneliness. I myself must admit that there&#39;s a fascination to the cell phone that is disarming.&#0160; I&#39;m trying not be allow myself to be addicted. But there is something wonderful about a machine that lets you not only speak with but to actually see your daughter, who is a thousand miles away. Not a trick that a rotary phone could perform.</p>
<p>Not to be an alarmist or a Luddite, there&#39;s a serious downside to the cell. It seems as though the machine&#0160; might be reorganizing youthful brains-- with unknown consequences,</p>
<p>Scenes like this one have become scarily familiar:</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef02b685273d6d200d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Screen Shot 2023-01-31 at 9.31.38 AM" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef02b685273d6d200d image-full img-responsive" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef02b685273d6d200d-800wi" title="Screen Shot 2023-01-31 at 9.31.38 AM" /></a><br /><br />Look up, children, look up! Please look up!</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>This will be a very short essay, because automobiles have never been a big part of my life. Unlike many of my friends, I&#39;ve never been one to have a romantic relationship with a vehicle.&#0160;</p>
<p>My parents did not own an automobile and neither of them ever learned to drive. I was a most provincial city boy, happy with my bicycle and my subway token and wanting no more. I did not learn to drive a car until after I was married and left Brooklyn behind.&#0160; Nevertheless, over the course of a lifetime I&#39;ve owned a number of cars. The first one was identical to the Nash Rambler depicted in this stock photo:&#0160;</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef02af1c9910bb200d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Screen Shot 2023-01-24 at 9.19.39 AM" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef02af1c9910bb200d image-full img-responsive" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef02af1c9910bb200d-800wi" title="Screen Shot 2023-01-24 at 9.19.39 AM" /></a></p>
<p>The Nash was the car I drove to California and back in the summer of 1963 (the first time I was west of New York). I&#39;ve since owned an Oldsmobile &#39;88, a Renault Dauphine (a dog), an underpowered Dodge station wagon, an uncomfortable but sturdy Corolla, a Saab, a Camry, and a Volvo that lasted for twenty-one years and which I only surrendered&#0160; because it was hard on my aching back. I&#39;ve driven perhaps a hundred other automobiles and an occasional truck, mostly rented, but I&#39;ve never felt anything like affection for a single one of them-- they take you from one place to another and I&#39;m grateful for the mobility. I&#39;m a cautious driver, but I&#39;ve made some bad mistakes behind the wheel and I am lucky to have gone through life without being mangled or killed, so far.</p>
<p>I confess that at various times in my life I&#39;ve experienced the glamor of the open road. I&#39;m a happy fellow when I&#39;m driving a two-lane at dawn or twilight in southern Missouri or rural South Dakota. I have a soft spot for Iowa&#39;s Jesse James Cafe and for the Crete Diner in Oneonta, New York. A stop at Grandma&#39;s Cafe in some faded downtown is to me a peak experience, however weak the coffee or gluey the cherry pie. I treasure those glorious small-town attractions: among many others, the corn cob palace, Carhenge, the Donna Reed Museum in Denison, Iowa, the Jell-o Museum, the Purple Martin Tower in Griggsville, Illinois, the world&#39;s largest ball of twine in Cawker, City, Kansas.&#0160;</p>
<p>I don&#39;t drive long distances any more. In fact, in the last twenty years I&#39;ve probably spent more time on the John Deere &quot;Lawn Tractor&quot; than in any other vehicle. Maximum of five miles per hour, my kind of speed. It may not be glamorous but it gets the job done. I&#39;ve &quot;buried&quot; the machine a couple of times, but it&#39;s still in one piece and still working.&#0160;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>It&#39;s shocking, is it not, that 50% of American marriages end in divorce. &quot;Fifty per cent&quot; is not just a statistic; it&#39;s a reality that stands for tons of personal distress and suffering and remorse. Alas, the rate of divorce for second marriages is even higher -- 60%; for third marriages, according to many sources, as much as 75%. The fact that the percentage rises with age and experience at first seems counter-intuitive. Shouldn&#39;t second and subsequent marriages be happier, more peaceful?&#0160; Don&#39;t people learn and improve with experience?&#0160; Should they not know themselves better and therefore choose a mate more wisely?&#0160; Now that they are veterans, shouldn&#39;t they have grasped the art of marriage ? Learned how to solve problems? Learned to make a stronger and more sensible commitment to each other? After all, they&#39;ve voluntarily and optimistically decided to take another crack at marriage. Why not bend every effort to succeed?</p>
<p>But the numbers don&#39;t lie. Many of the people who have been divorced one time, say sociologists who study marriage and the family, bring negative attitudes to the next. Instead of assuming that marriage is a lifelong commitment, they regard it as a flexible arrangement that can be abandoned if things get tough. They&#39;ve already survived one or two divorces and are therefore less fazed by the prospect of another. And inasmuch as the taboo against divorce has already been shattered, such social inhibitions that remain are the more readily overcome.&#0160;</p>
<p>There are even simpler explanation for the failure of subsequent marriages: some people are marriageable by nature and some are marriageable-skittish. The population of the marriageable-skittish increases as the natively marriageable leave the pool. Who remains to be married among the population setting out on second or third marriages? Only those people who are not intrinsically inclined to prosper in long term relationships. As the pool shrinks to the less and less marriageable, the percentage of failures inevitably rises.&#0160;</p>
<p>Divorce and the rates of divorce have been well studied. But what about second marriages of people who are not divorced but widowed? It&#39;s curious that there seems to be no interest in how widows and widowers (w-ws) fare when they contract subsequent marriages. Are second marriages of the w-ws more or less likely to succeed? Apparently, it&#39;s not a pressing problem for sociologists. Or perhaps it&#39;s too hard to procure the data. Just who are the remarried (or &quot;re-partnered&quot;) w-ws&#39;s? Many &quot;remarried&quot; widows and widowers don&#39;t bother to inform either church or state of their new situation. They may have financial or tax reasons to avoid scrutiny. They may be separately domiciled. They&#39;re not talking but they&#39;re there. Hard to find and hard to study.</p>
<p>My suspicion, drawn from anecdotal evidence and just looking around at people of my own age cohort, is that the divorce rate among remarried w-ws is very very low. Why? Well, for one thing, because w-ws are people who are among the marriageable by nature. They&#39;ve stayed together, stayed married until death did them part. Because they succeeded at maintaining a long marriage, they very likely entered a later marriage expecting to do so again. In addition, w-ws are likely to be older and weathered. Because they&#39;re not scarred by a painful divorce, they are more likely to be sound of heart rather than wary and wounded.</p>
<p>Re-partnered w-ws have outlived many of the tensions of more youthful marriages. They&#39;re probably not obsessed or consumed by their careers or by worldly success. For better or worse, their successes and failures have been long established, long completed. If they&#39;re old enough to be retired, they may have the leisure to talk intimately with one another.</p>
<p>One of the principal causes of divorce, we&#39;re told, is tension around child-rearing, an activity in which philosophical differences between the parents can cause all kinds of difficulties and tensions and squabbles.&#0160; But most w-ws aren&#39;t going to have more children, and the ones that they have are likely to be grown and gone.</p>
<p>Nor will there going to problems with in-laws, because the in-laws are all dead.</p>
<p>And older w-ws, if they&#39;re fortunate, don&#39;t have the financial problems of earlier decades: no sudden unemployment, no need to move to a larger, more expensive house, no college tuitions. If they&#39;re not formally remarried, they most likely keep their resources separate and therefore don&#39;t need to negotiate about how money is to be spent.&#0160;</p>
<p>Older folk don&#39;t have to deal with contraceptives. While sex is probably less urgent and imperious than in earlier decades, it might be more consoling, especially because older partners should have a better grasp of their own needs and how they might be fulfilled. And they are probably more accepting of themselves and of their bodies.</p>
<p>It goes almost without saying that w-ws have experienced the deaths of their previous spouse and therefore share a most important mutual experience. A bond, a link. An important mutual consolation, one among the many experiences that older w-ws bring to the table.&#0160; They know from living many years on the planet that various things that seemed important years ago turned out not to matter at all.</p>
<p>And most important of all: older w-ws have learned over the course of many decades not only how to love but how to cherish and to respect a wife or husband.</p>

                                <p>This year&#39;s list is incomplete. During the Vermont summer, I neglected to keep good records.

<p>I&#39;ve arrived at the age in which even a momentary lapse of memory is worrisome. Have I at last begun the ineluctable descent into senility?&#0160;</p>
<p>But then there&#39;s the contrary. When I happen to dredge up some bit of buried knowledge, I experience a rush of triumph. I feel it as evidence that I&#39;ve put off the inevitable for another couple of weeks -- perhaps even months. And I preen and strut shamelessly. I become unbearable.</p>
<p>At the Phillips, yesterday, we came upon a painting by Giuseppe De Nittis called &quot;Spring&quot; (there&#39;s a pretty poor reproduction of it above). I glanced at the picture, and in a flash, without hesitation, announced, &quot;that&#39;s a trullo in the left distance.&quot;&#0160; And I was correct -- my assertion confirmed by the scholarly description on the accompanying wall plaque.</p>
<p>What is a trullo?&#0160; It&#39;s a building, obviously, a kind of drystone architecture, common in Apulia, usually whitewashed and with a conical roof, often constructed as a temporary shelter for shepherds and other agricultural workers and occasionally for long term occupancy.&#0160;</p>
<p>But how does a Flatbush yoot recognize and immediately name a trullo at first glance?&#0160; I could be coy and say something like, &quot;Oh, who doesn&#39;t know about trulli?&quot; and leave my friends baffled and dazzled by my prodigious memory.&#0160;</p>
<p>But of course that would not be the full story.</p>
<p>Some seven or eight years ago, as <em>turisti</em>, we visited an Italian village called Alberobello in Apulia in southern Italy. Here&#39;s a picture:</p>

<div class="uhHOwf BYbUcd" data-bla="">It is, obviously, all trulli -- architecture that is striking and memorable. So it&#39;s not mysterious that I would instantaneously recall the building and the name. Not mysterious, but still rather impressive, I think. And temporarily reassuring.</div>
