		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>When I was a Brooklyn schoolyard &quot;yoot&quot; (sixth or seventh grade I reckon), I impulsively bragged to a group of fellow ragamuffins, &quot;I&#39;ll bet a buck that the Dodgers win the pennant.&quot; What prompted me to make so uncharacteristically bold a claim? Way out on a limb, I was. One of the guys in the gang immediately jumped: &quot;I&#39;ll take that bet.&quot; So there I was, stuck. I backed off a bit: &quot;I meant half a dollar.&quot; Against my better judgment, it was set down as a bet, even though he and I never actually locked pinkies on the deal. Then the Dodgers lost; so did I. My antagonist badgered me continually for his money. Eventually I paid him off with a 1950 Franklin half-dollar (a mint example of which is now selling on Amazon for $3751 -- you can look it up!). Even more painful, I must confess, is that the character who beat me was the loathsome kid about whom many years ago I wrote an entire blog post called <a href=" https://www.drmetablog.com/2009/09/my-first-racist.html">My First Racist</a>. You can look that up also.</p>
<p>I am sure that that half-dollar disaster was my first and only venture into the world of chance and hazard. My lifetime losings therefore: 50Â¢ (which of course was worth a lot more in 1950 than it is now). I had been burnt once, and once was enough to teach me a lesson.&#0160;</p>
<p>I&#39;m not a risk-taker. I don&#39;t play cards, not even gin rummy for matchsticks. I don&#39;t care about the ponies and never even visited Yonkers or Belmont Park (where my ne&#39;er-do-well uncle lost scads of moolah and came close to losing his wife and family). I&#39;ve never been to Atlantic City or to Blackhawk. I don&#39;t bet on sports and have never even had a clear understanding of what it means to &quot;cover the spread.&quot; I was in Las Vegas once, in 1963. We slept in sleeping bags in the desert and rolled into town early the next morning. At one of the many palatial casinos, I came upon addicted gamblers who&#39;d been up all night playing the slots. They were dirty and tired and (is it too strong to say?) degenerate. Desperately in need of Gamblers Anonymous. It was not a glamorous scene.</p>
<p>Moreover, I&#39;ve never played the numbers. I&#39;ve never even purchased a lottery ticket.</p>
<p>My resistance to gambling isn&#39;t moral -- I don&#39;t think that gambling is inherently wrong or sinful. It&#39;s just my nature. I&#39;m a frugal guy (some say &quot;skinflint&quot;; others say &quot;cheap as dirt&quot;) who can&#39;t bear to throw money away.</p>
<p>I think there&#39;s a practical reason to resist gambling. Take, for example, the lotteries. They were illegal until a few years ago but now every state seems to sponsor one or more. The result is a huge transfer of money from people who can&#39;t afford the loss to the government. Lotteries are in effect a hidden regressive tax -- another subsidy of the rich by the poor. In addition, people who put their hopes in winning a jackpot are, I believe, less inclined to work for the progressive changes that our society needs. People who buy lottery tickets are more likely to become quiescent rather than active. They wait passively for their ship to come in. And it never will.</p>
<p>Now gambling has moved into an even more dangerous phase. Anyone who watches sports on the TV is inundated with ads that encourage gambling. They&#39;re omnipresent and unavoidable. It&#39;s another gift to us from the Supreme Court, which in <span class="ILfuVd" lang="en"><span class="hgKElc">2018, struck down the federal ban on state authorization of sports betting -- a decision that opened the doors to the flood. A peculiar inconsistency: yes, freedom to gamble, but no, no freedom to do what you want with your own womb. And we today learned that </span></span>gambling has invaded the university. In our state, in 2020, the University of Colorado made a $1.6 million deal to promote sports gambling on campus. A betting company sweetened the arrangement by offering the school an extra $30 every time a student downloaded the companyâs app and used a promotional code to place a bet.</p>
<p>To be clear, it wasn&#39;t the &quot;University&quot; that made the deal; it was the semi-autonomous Athletic Department -- or, in actuality, the football team. It&#39;s an outrageous decision. A respectable university is now in cahoots with a shady industry to promote gambling on campus, and make money off the deal. What future opportunities for corruption with the nose of that particular camel under the tent of innocence!</p>
<p>One solution would be to lessen the emphasis on football. After all, our team is 1-8 so far this year in the Pac-12, having been outscored 374 to 138.&#0160; Perhaps Colorado should drop down a notch, say to Division III. We&#39;d thrive, I think, against the lesser competition. But don&#39;t bet on it.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I seem to have plowed a path of destruction, suicide-wise, in my earlier years.&#0160;</p>
<p>In 1958, I studied &quot;intermediate algebra&quot; with a cheerful, well-regarded teacher named Ruth B. White. One Monday morning, she wrote her new name on the blackboard; she was no longer Mrs. White; she was now Mrs. White-Green. Her supportive students, I remember, applauded enthusiastically. But just as the semester ended and we pupils moved on to trigonometry, newlywed Mrs. White-Green, sadly and incomprehensibly, took her own life. What a shock and puzzle for a gawky innocent Flatbush &quot;yoot.&quot; Why, I asked myself, should re-marriage lead so suddenly to suicide (if indeed the two events were at all related)? To me, this tragic occurrence was an early indication that human psychology was a heck of a lot more mysterious than cocooned me had imagined. And then, a few years later, in the spring semester of my second year in college, I enrolled for a course in medieval history with the very distinguished Professor Theodore Maroon. Just a few months after the class concluded, Professor Maroon destroyed himself. Moreover, the very next year, I surveyed early American literature in a course taught by Professor Stephen Emerson Black, who, the following summer, attached a hose to the car exhaust, shut the garage doors, and put an end to his existence.</p>
<p>I need to reassure myself that it was only a few, not all, of my many teachers who pulled the trigger after trying to educate me. Nevertheless, something of a pattern emerged. The trajectory continued in 1960, when, two months after he officiated at our wedding, cigar-chomping Rabbi Herschel Gray walked into Lake Yahnundasis in order to drown himself. Why? I had nary a clue; still don&#39;t, in fact.&#0160;</p>
<p>Several other people with whom I&#39;ve crossed paths have also chosen to leave life behind. I remember dour Alfredo Naranja, a college acquaintance from Costa Rica or perhaps Panama. He graduated from Cornell, returned home, and immediately shot himself. I also remember handsome fair-haired Stanley Brown. He was a classmate at EHHS; the two of us studied four years of Latin in the same half-empty schoolrooms. He was not a close friend, though I clearly recall that we occasionally trudged home from school together. Stanley went on to Columbia, where, I was later informed, he graduated first in his class, which is no mean achievement. I wasn&#39;t surprised -- he was smart and extremely serious about schoolwork. Stanley then proceeded to Harvard Medical School. Cambridge was my home at that time as well and although our paths had not crossed in four or five years, Stanley telephoned me &quot;out of the blue,&quot; as they say, and engaged me in conversations that were longer than I wished. I realize now that I was not as hospitable to him as I might have been. He was lonesome, I think. And then came the news that he had killed himself. I now wish that I had been more cordial -- but how was I to know that he was in such mortal pain? The story has a coda: Stanley&#39;s grandparents owned a delicatessen on Ditmas Avenue between East 7th and East 8th. Some years after the suicide, I stopped in at the store for a salami sandwich (or something) and encountered the diminutive elderly storekeepers -- a sad, crushed couple. I knew, or thought I knew, that they were mourning the death of their promising grandchild. Was it my imagination, or was my intuition correct?</p>
<p>And then in graduate school there was Arthur Blue. Arthur was a serious poet and budding scholar. I was a close enough friend that I was invited to his Episcopal wedding in, I think, Wellesley, Massachusetts, where, for the first time in my life, ceremonious kneeling was required of me. Arthur and I kept up an intermittent correspondence after I moved to New York and he to Seattle. I remember congratulating him on the births of his two daughters. But then one December, I received an end-of-the-year card from Barbara Scarlet-Blue, which contained a most memorable sentence: &quot;Of course you have heard of Arthur&#39;s suicide.&quot; Well, no, I hadn&#39;t. I was later informed that Arthur had turned on the gas at his summer house on Vachon Island, where he had been on a solitary vacation. Barbara offered no theory to account for Arthur&#39;s act, but now, fifty years later, I suspect, without evidence, that he had sexual identity problems with which he could not cope. If so, he would be another casualty of the commonplace bigotry of that era. Arthur&#39;s death is a suicide to which I am not reconciled, and never will be.</p>
<p>And I must also remember Mary Crimson, wife of famous Shakespearean scholar Reginald Crimson, who, depressed, slit her wrists in the bath. It was an absolutely devastating act for Reg and his many friends and admirers.</p>
<p>And then there are the young people, the next generation, who made irreversible decisions when they were far too young to do so. There&#39;s the horrible story of Carol Pink, a daughter of friends, who jumped off a balcony in Lincoln Towers in Manhattan and landed, twenty stories below, on the roof of a yellow taxi. Apparently, she tried to grab her brother and pull him down with her, but thankfully she did not succeed. And Alice Magenta, daughter of Hill neighbors, who killed herself in her late teens, a disaster made more excruciating because her elder half-brother had done the same deed few years before. Their parents never recovered from the twin losses; but why should they?&#0160; Another young person was twenty-two year old Francesca Crimson, the daughter of a pair of famous artists and herself a promising photographer; another plunge from the roof of a tall building. And also, the teen son of my longtime colleague Richard Purple, who did himself in with drugs, though his religious family chose to believe, against all the evidence, that it was an accidental overdose.&#0160;</p>
<p>I respect suicides, even when I don&#39;t understand them, because I believe that everyone has a right to do what they want with their own selves. But I am saddened beyond ordinary sadness when very young people take their own lives. If an adolescent or twenty-something boy or girl told me that they had suicidal thoughts, I would say &quot;almost everyone has a few bad years; almost everyone is miserable during adolescence. But almost every one of these unhappy beings turns out to live a productive, useful and essentially happy life. Give it a few years; don&#39;t make a precipitous decision. Hold on; hang tough; trust me, it&#39;s going to get better.&quot;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Like many of my peers, I&#39;ve lately taken to reading the obituaries. When I was a youthful fellow, I took pleasure in announcements of births and weddings and anniversaries. No longer, alas; nowadays it&#39;s nothing but deaths. Reading about the departed is not a habit of which I&#39;m particularly proud. It&#39;s an unsavory fixation upon the newly dead -- and is slightly ghoulish to boot. Yet daily checking of the obits is not without a positive side: often it&#39;s exhilarating to read about those amazing folks who have survived wars, dictatorships, displacement, injury, and disease to live accomplished and joyful lives. Obituaries are confusing.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not that I search out the obits -- they intrude upon me willy-nilly, like it or not.</p>
<p>For one, there&#39;s the <em>New York Times </em>which every day memorializes a couple or a dozen famous persons -- some of them people of my exact age cohort -- who have made a mark, for good or ill, in this our shared life. How does one properly respond to such departures?&#0160; With empathy, certainly. But also, not infrequently, with a touch of reluctant (and embarrassing) survivor-superiority.</p>
<p>I must admit that I&#39;m frequently dazzled by these eminent people&#39;s list of accomplishments, even if I haven&#39;t the least clue about exactly what they have achieved. My own life has been, it would seem, so dominated by hearth and home, so narrow and provincial that I cannot always appreciate the eulogized. Often they have distinguished themselves in areas of expertise that have completely passed me by: computer technologists who have created portals and platforms that will always lie beyond my ken, physicists who have shed light (incomprehensible to me) on dark mysteries, superstar rappers, mvp&#39;s in sports that I didn&#39;t know existed, billionaire entrepreneurs with their 35,000 sq. ft. homes and their stupendous megayachts, generals and spies, etc., etc., etc. It&#39;s astonishing how little these famous folk have touched me; how little overlap there is between their worlds and mine. Clearly, I&#39;ve inhabited an impermeable bubble.</p>
<p>If so, why do I care, why do I read their obits, why do I bother to applaud or (secretly and guiltily) pooh-pooh their contributions?</p>
<p>But hey, I can&#39;t blame it all on the <em>Times</em>. Every second month, I receive an e-mail notice from the college that I attended, back there in the 50s, that lists the recent deaths of my classmates. Only a few years ago, it was a trickle, now it&#39;s a flood. While nothing forces me to open the electronic envelope, nevertheless, I do so, &quot;attracted&quot; as David Copperfield once said about Uriah Heep, &quot;in very repulsion.&quot; Nor must I read the obituaries of members of the graduate school through which I slipped, barely noticed, sixty-years ago. Do I remember these people? Rarely, even despite occasional parallels in our careers. In addition, I follow the obituaries in the local <em>Daily Camera</em>. People I know, or, given my fifty-year residence in this fair city, those to whom I am connected by a couple or three degrees of separation. Sometimes I am shocked by the death of a person whom I hadn&#39;t heard was ill, or who died suddenly in a bicycle crash or a fall from a step stool. Such revelations deeply disturb a Sunday morning. And yet, is it so horribly wrong for me to congratulate myself that it was not I but that other guy who was mowed down by a speeding truck on Canyon Boulevard? (I had just crossed at that same spot a day before, uneventfully. Luck of the draw!)</p>
<p>Does it matter that the obits that I read are not truly representative of my contemporaries? They are accounts of people who have made something of themselves, lived useful and noteworthy lives. I can&#39;t help thinking about the others: the ones who slunk off the planet quietly -- those who were drunkards or druggies, or who were seduced by some weird religious cult and disappeared into the desert, or those who gave up the struggle and took their own lives, or those who retreated. along with their six scrawny cats, to a dirty SRO on the upper West Side (except when they venture to the street to harangue passers-by with their idiosyncratic religious theories).</p>
<p>Even the obits that do come to my notice don&#39;t tell the whole story. They&#39;re <em>curricula vitae</em> that 99% of the time are entirely laudatory. The ancient tag &quot;de mortuis nihil nisi bonum&quot; is rigorously honored. The notices don&#39;t state what everyone knows -- that the dearly departed was a notorious skinflint who squeezed the last nickel from his tenants and his employees, stiffed his partners, and regularly harassed his former friends with nuisance suits. They fail to mention that an apparently upstanding citizen was also a neglectful father who eventually ran off with his peroxided mistress and a Harley, or that he was known to the neighbors as the guy who poisoned the Labrador retriever of that nice elderly couple down the street. Or who was fired because he showed up plastered once too often. Sometimes it&#39;s what&#39;s left out that&#39;s most revelatory. Obits should be read with care; I don&#39;t always remember to do so.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>But to tell truth it&#39;s not the obituaries themselves that bother me --it&#39;s my own ambivalence and confusion. Why the fascination with obits? Is it the same impulse that causes commuters to stop and stare at the wreck on the highway? Could it be that I enjoy, genuinely enjoy, reading about the deaths of my fellow creatures? And if I do so, what sort of morally defective person am I?&#0160; Do I suffer from an incurable case of schadenfreude -- a delight in the misfortunes of others? Or is it even worse -- mere undiluted gloating? For truly, I am forced to admit, there is something almost triumphant about reading an obit. &quot;He&#39;s dead, but I&#39;m alive.&quot; How pathetic and reprehensible a feeling -- and how transitory!&#0160;&#0160;When I am in a generous mood, I know that when I read an obituary, I daren&#39;t gloat, but should rather mourn the common fate of all of us poor fragile mortals. &quot;Death is certain, sayeth the Psalmist.&quot; &quot;No man is an island entire of himself.&quot; Although I might gloat today, tomorrow I too will be as dead as a doornail. Another bucket, mine, will be kicked. And yet I do not always experience the fellow-feeling that I would like to admire in myself. If I&#39;m not a bad person, I&#39;m certainly not always a good one. No question but there&#39;s a chasm between what I feel and what I am convinced that I should feel.</p>
<p>Some obituaries present special problems. For example, I am immediately put off when the the obituary begins with the foolish new age euphemism, &quot;he transitioned.... &quot;&#0160; Such a phrase hardens my heart, I&#39;m sorry to admit. Let&#39;s face it; he didn&#39;t &quot;transition.&quot; He died. But I&#39;m equally saddened by the obituary that announces that &quot;he went to live with the Lord.&quot; Such pathetic self-deception.</p>
<p>But the hardest moral problem for me occurs when I come upon the obituary of a person I genuinely disliked. There aren&#39;t many of them; I&#39;m not a hater. But still, it&#39;s very difficult for me to find genuine empathy for someone I truly loathed. It&#39;s wrong for me to rub my hands in triumphant glee because that nasty s. o. b. is gone forever? I would prefer not to be the kind of person who dances on graves.</p>

<p>Stunning, is it not? Just at the west side of our fair city, set against the first manifestations of the Front Range. Six well-tended fields, scores of players and many, many parents and grandparents (among them me, on sunny Saturday mornings). I can&#39;t imagine a more idyllic and peaceful scene.&#0160;</p>
<p>Do Luke and Caleb and Asher appreciate the glory of their situation? Why should they, after all? It&#39;s what they&#39;ve always known; they take it for granted that soccer should be played in such lovely and prosperous surroundings. Later on, they&#39;ll come to know more about the circumstances of less fortunate people.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>It&#39;s hard for me not to compare Foothills Community Park with the P S 217 schoolyard of my own childhood. Ours was a representative &quot;playground,&quot; no better or worse than would be found in any other middle-class or working class neighborhood. No grass, just solid concrete from one chain-link fence to the other. It was where we ran races, played &quot;two-hand touch,&quot; flipped baseball cards, played punchball, stickball, basketball, softball, boxball, box baseball, handball, and any other game that could be improvised with a pink spaldeen. There were, as I remember, four basketball backboards and rims, arranged as two full courts. But one of the backboards was missing, the pole having disappeared many years ago and never replaced. Another of the poles had been set in the ground at an angle of perhaps 80 degrees and never corrected. It was useless. And then the two other baskets, on the Newkirk Avenue side, were set in ground that was not level, so that the basket was 9&#39; 6&quot; or so if you shot from the left side and 10&quot; 6&quot; on the right. Maybe this was a benefit; it helped us master trigonometry.</p>
<p>The P S 217 schoolyard was crowded. Various sports overlapped and shared the fields. If you were playing basketball, you had to watch out for line drives off the bat of one of the softball players. This taught us to be alert.</p>
<p>I did not feel at all deprived or &quot;underprivileged&quot; -- it was life as I knew it -- but I&#39;m mighty glad that my grandchildren enjoy the luxury of grass and space and peace. In the words of the great Sophie Tucker, &quot;I&#39;ve been rich and I&#39;ve been poor, and, believe me, rich is better.&quot;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>The word &quot;nostalgia&quot; has a curious history. It was coined in the late 17th century by attaching Greek Î¬Î»Î³Î¿Ï (algos - pain) to Î½ÏÏÏÎ¿Ï (nostos -homecoming). Originally, nostalgia carried a strongly negative signification: &quot;intense homesickness&quot; -- &quot;the depressing symptoms...&#0160; that arise in persons when they are seized with a longing to return to their home and friends.&quot; Then, for reasons that are not on the record, sometime during the first part of the last century, the meaning of nostalgia shifted and became much more positive. It&#39;s now a good word: &quot;a wistful yearning for the past.&quot; A useful word.</p>
<p>Nostalgia is a familiar phenomena that all can recognize: the savoring of a pleasant memory from earlier in our lives. It seems that nostalgia contains within it a bias toward or even a falsification of the past. It&#39;s implicit in nostalgia that things were better &quot;back then.&quot; For example: I am a member of a Facebook group called M<em>y Flatbush House from</em> <em>Years Ago. </em>Its contributors routinely idealize their childhoods. Reading their posts, you&#39;d think that the Flatbush of our youth was if not the the classical Golden Age at least the Garden of Eden. &quot;I loved my Brooklyn childhood.&quot; &quot;I wouldnât trade my childhood for anything.&quot; &quot;I grew up in the 40s and 50s! We were so lucky to have known those days.&quot; &quot;Much simpler times, more real and human-sized.&quot; &quot;There was no fear, everybody felt safe; we played out in the streets, unsupervised, until it was suppertime.&quot; &quot;We walked to and from school in every weather.&quot; <a across="" also="" and="" anymore="" at="" breathe="" catch="" could="" cross="" days="" dir="auto" div="" do="" don="" everywhere="" fireflies="" fragrance="" get="" go="" have="" holes="" hung="" i="" in="" it="" jars="" let="" lid="" me="" miss="" nbsp="" night="" of="" on="" out="" parent-approved="" perfume="" put="" roses="" so="" stoop="" strangers="" street="" summer="" t="" the="" them="" then="" there="" they="" those="" to="" trust="" was="" we="" why="" with="" would="">&quot;Going out meant playing games in the street.&quot; &quot;</a><a across="" also="" and="" anymore="" at="" breathe="" catch="" could="" cross="" days="" dir="auto" div="" do="" don="" everywhere="" fireflies="" fragrance="" get="" go="" have="" holes="" hung="" i="" in="" it="" jars="" let="" lid="" me="" miss="" nbsp="" night="" of="" on="" out="" parent-approved="" perfume="" put="" roses="" so="" stoop="" strangers="" street="" summer="" t="" the="" them="" then="" there="" they="" those="" to="" trust="" was="" we="" why="" with="" would="">I feel so blessed to have lived such a wonderful free life.&quot; &quot;</a><a across="" also="" and="" anymore="" at="" breathe="" catch="" could="" cross="" days="" dir="auto" div="" do="" don="" everywhere="" fireflies="" fragrance="" get="" go="" have="" holes="" hung="" i="" in="" it="" jars="" let="" lid="" me="" miss="" nbsp="" night="" of="" on="" out="" parent-approved="" perfume="" put="" roses="" so="" stoop="" strangers="" street="" summer="" t="" the="" them="" then="" there="" they="" those="" to="" trust="" was="" we="" why="" with="" would="">The fragrance of roses was everywhere in July (why don&#39;t roses have perfume anymore?)&quot;</a></p>
<p>&quot;Ou sont les neiges d&#39;antan?&quot;&#0160; &quot;Those were the days, my friend,/ We thought they&#39;d never end.&quot; &quot;Rocky Top you&#39;ll always be/ Home sweet home to me.&quot;</p>
<p>Of course I also remember the good times, but I can&#39;t embrace such unalloyed, uncritical celebrations. Yes, I can savor some pleasant moments in my seventy-years-ago life. But I also recall that the 1950s was the era of &quot;juvenile delinquents&quot; and gang wars, back alley abortions, ethnic strife, &quot;broken homes,&quot; heroin, segregation, overcrowded chaotic schools, imminent nuclear holocaust and &quot;take cover&quot; drills, McCarthyism, polio, the Korean War, Stalin, and Walter O&#39;Malley.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>It&#39;s fascinating that the English language does not have a word for an antonym of nostalgia. One of my sources suggests &quot;cynicism.&quot; But I&#39;m not a cynic;&#0160; I&#39;m an intermittent and realistic anti-nostalgist.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>And why, when I lie insomniac (as is my too-frequent custom), do I not savor the odor of those ever-perfumed Coney Island Avenue hybrid tea roses but instead am tormented by nightmares of fear, humiliation, awkwardness, embarrassment and loneliness. My childhood was pretty good one, thanks to my attentive parents. So why do I obsess about the bad times? Have I gone full curmudgeon? Or am I simply more honest than my cohort of Flatbush contemporaries?</p>
<p>In <em>The Second Part of Henry the Fourth, S</em>hakespeare explores nostalgia and its opposite. Two old guys, Shallow and Silence, reminisce.&#0160;</p>
<p>SHALLOW: I was once of Clement&#39;s Inn, where I think they will talk of mad Shallow yet.</p>
<p>SILENCE: You were called &#39;lusty Shallow&quot; then, cousin...</p>
<p>SHALLOW: On that very same day did I fight with on Samson Stockfish, a fruiterer, behind Gray&#39;s Inn. Jesu, jesu, the mad days that I have spent. And to see how many of my old acquaintance are now dead.</p>
<p>SILENCE:&#0160; We shall all follow, cousin...</p>
<p>SHALLOW:&#0160; Death is certain. Is old Double of your town living yet?</p>
<p>SILENCE: Dead, sir.</p>
<p>SHALLOW: Jesu, jesu, dead. He drew a good bow; and dead. He shot a fine shot...&#0160; And is Jane Nightwork alive?...&#0160; Nay, she must be old; she cannot choose but be old; certain she&#39;s old, and had Robin Nightwork by old Nightwork before I came to Clement&#39;s Inn.</p>
<p>SILENCE:&#0160; That&#39;s fifty-five years since.</p>
<p>And then comes the correction, the anti-nostalgist.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>FALSTAFF:&#0160; Lord, lord, how subject we old men are to this vice of lying. This same starved justice hath done nothing but prate to me of the wildness of his youth, and the feats he hath done about Turnbull Street;&#0160; and every third word a lie.... He was the very genius of famine, yet lecherous as a monkey,... And now is this vice&#39;s dagger become a squire and talks as familiarly of John o&#39; Gaunt as if he had been sworn brother to him, and I&#39;ll be sworn he never saw him but once in the tilt-yard, and then he burst his head for crowding among the marshal&#39;s men.</p>
<p>And on and on, at great amusing length.</p>
<p>Shallow and Silence indulge their nostalgia;&#0160; Falstaff sees thing differently, but whether he is a realist, a cynic or a curmudgeon is open to interpretation.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>The premise of Riley Black&#39;s <em>The Last Days of the Dinosaurs</em> (New York, 2022) is a most splendid one. Imagine, she proposes, that it is 66 million years ago and dinosaurs are the monarchs of the earth. What was it like, in that era, to be alive in, say, the steamy forests where Wyoming now lies -- a world in which club-tailed ankylosaurs were tracked by tyrannosaurs while primitive mammals scuttled in the ferny underbrush. Rich and strange, certainly. And then, how was it all transformed on &quot;the worst day in the history of the planet&quot; when the Chicxulub asteroid plowed into the Yucatan? One fine day, the dinosaurs were triumphant; and then in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, the six-mile-wide asteroid crash lands and everything goes all kablooey -- the sure and firm-set earth shakes, the atmosphere turns furnace hot, and acid rain and smoke and fire and tsunamis snuff out 80 per cent of our planet&#39;s animal species.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a fabulous idea for a masterpiece of science writing, and consequently I&#39;m grieved to report that <em>The Last Days of the Dinosaurs</em> is a disappointing book. It is loose and melodramatic and outrageously padded -- a thirty page essay turned into a swollen three hundred page opus. It&#39;s much too pop; it&#39;s insufficiently serious and therefore leaves poor frustrated me craving data and detail rather than reiteration. Who could believe that the high drama of Chicxulub could become quite so tedious? I put the blame on Ms. Black&#39;s literary agent, who, I have no shadow of doubt, advised her to &quot;turn your idea into a book, and keep it easy -- not too technical -- you&#39;ll sell a lot more copies.&quot;</p>
<p>What a shame, because Black is well-informed and writes with intermittent flair. She loves her reptiles, and in particular displays genuine warmth, almost reverence, for every young person&#39;s favorite dinosaur, the <em>tyrannosaurus rex. </em>An infatuation that lingers from her childhood, I suspect. I myself, not similarly transfixed, might have supposed that T. Rex had been expelled from the Terrible Lizard Hall of Fame sometime in the 1990s, when it came to be gospel that the 60-foot tall monster was not a top-of-the-food-chain predator but merely a snuffling scavenger. Was it not revealed to us that the creature&#39;s meager brain was dwarfed by its olfactory bulbs, so that it could effortlessly detect decaying flesh over the unbounded western landscapes? And was it not also agreed that its puny forelegs were useless for pursuit or attack? Black will have nothing of such paleontological revisionism. Her T. Rex is a hunter, lurking in ambush to pounce and to crunch with one powerful bite the enormous protuberant osteoderms that protected the stegosaurus spine. To me, the idea that a beast as gigantic as a tyrannosaurus could conceal itself behind bush or boulder and sneakily lunge at its prey seems totally ludicrous.</p>
<p>Black, bless her kindly heart, firmly embraces the unrevised T. Rex. Her loyalty is transcendent. In a burst of psychological overkill, she describes her crush on the dinosaur as an example of anemoia. And what, readers rightly ask, is anemoia?&#0160; It&#39;s an unfamiliar word that describes a baffling concept. Upon investigation,&quot;anemoia&quot; turns out to be a recent coinage, a &quot;fire-new&quot; word (as WS, in LLL, calls such innovations). It&#39;s &quot;a nostalgia for a time one has never known,&quot; such as Black seems to feel about the years and days that preceded Chicxulub. And here I must once again reveal my want of imagination. Anemoia, however hard I labor to grasp the idea, is too subtle for my downright brain. Isn&#39;t it the case that &quot;nostalgia&quot; is by definition a cherishing of something in one&#39;s own personal history, as such a one as I might remember with warmth a concert or a wedding or that long ago glorious day in which I, batting leadoff, started the game with a triple to right field.</p>
<p>I can&#39;t quite fathom a nostalgia for something I&#39;ve not known in my own person. The emotion that Black describes I would call simple curiosity. I&#39;m as intrigued as the next guy about the past and I can certainly summon a yearning to have been present at some great historical event, but I wouldn&#39;t call it anemoia. For example, I might wish that I had been at Fenway on September 30, 1960, the day that Ted Williams blasted a home run on his very last time at bat -- but I wasn&#39;t there and it would be a falsehood to claim otherwise. [Full disclosure: I was in attendance, just behind third base, the previous day, September 29, and therefore missed the moment by a scant twenty-four hours.] Unlike Black, I&#39;m not anemoiac about the dinosaur-dominated world of the K-P boundary, but I have other anemoiac -- as I&#39;ve now redefined the word -- yearnings.</p>
<p>My most pressing and immediate wish would be to have joined the crowd at a performance at the Globe Theatre in London, perhaps of <em>Hamlet</em> in 1599 or <em>Macbeth</em> in 1606. Why? Because even though Shakespeare&#39;s works have been studied microscopically for more than 400 years, no one really knows how those plays originally looked or sounded. My suspicion is that they were far more foreign, more strange, less realistic and more primitive than scholars recognize. After all, the most brilliant play ever written, <em>King Lear,</em> was performed in daylight and the actors had to project their voices to a crowd of 2000 people, many of them shuffling about, gossiping, and cracking hazelnuts. No sets, no curtains, no lighting, and no scenery to speak of. I&#39;d guess that the cast employed a style of dramaturgy closer to its medieval inheritance of allegorical representation than we like to admit. Furthermore, I am convinced that if I were present there at the actual Globe, I would discover an endless series of unknown unknowns. Unimaginable unknowns, that would knock our anemoiac socks off. The past is another country; they do things a heck of a lot differently there.</p>
<p>But wait! My dormant anemoia, now aroused, yearns to experience in my own person other events in the past. Where else to indulge my wants? Certainly in Athens, at a performance of a play by Sophocles -- which I can guarantee to be a hundred times stranger than anything London could possibly offer.</p>
<p>But why only the arts?&#0160; Now that I think of it, I would love to take a gander at forested Manhattan Island when Henry Hudson&#39;s <em>Half Moon</em> made its first landfall. I could have talked to the Lenapes; tried to warn them about the dangers that were coming down the pike. And there&#39;s much more. Just prior to struggling through <em>The Last Days of the Dinosaurs,</em> I read Marie Favereau&#39;s <em>The Horde (</em>2021<em>), </em>a most fascinating history of the Mongol civilization that conquered and controlled the area from Hungary in the west to Korea in the east during the 13th century and the first half of the 14th. Favereau&#39;s depiction of the Mongols was novel and disorienting, essentially because I&#39;m accustomed to think about great empires as centered on a dominant imperial city -- Athens, Rome, London. I believe that I understand a little of what life might have been like in Rome; after all, I&#39;ve read some of the ancient historians and I know a bit about cities. I&#39;ve even toured Pompeii, for goodness sake! But the Mongols did not live in cities; they were not particularly literate, they were unabashedly polygamous, animist, and almost entirely nomadic. It&#39;s a challenge to imagine a &quot;city&quot; of a hundred thousand people in constant migratory motion. When Mongol men went to war, which they seemed to do often and always, they brought along the women and children, the cattle-drawn carts and wagons and the felt tents along with their horses, goats and sheep. To spend time with a wandering horde, an entirely unfamiliar form of civilization, and to try to understand their mental world, would certainly challenge and enlarge my (and your) conception of what it means to be a human being.</p>
<p>Favereau doesn&#39;t dwell on such speculations (she is more concerned with military history than social or psychological matters) but nevertheless the ways in which the migrants related to each other and to their environment had to be entirely foreign to us mostly urban, post Age of Reason moderns. What was it like to be a Mongol? Perhaps I feel this question personally because a recent examination of my DNA tells me that I&#39;m 1% Asian by genetic inheritance. I assume, naturally, that like approximately 16,000,000 other people, I&#39;m directly descended from Mongol leader Chinggis (formerly Genghiz) Khan through one of his seven wives or his innumerable concubines. Is it anemoia, a recognition of my kinship to Grandpa Genghiz, that has produced in me, this morning, such a wildness in the blood? Or is it the caffeine?</p>
<p>In actual fact, although I&#39;m most curious about Mongol life, I don&#39;t think that I would have made a good nomad. In the first place, I suffer from serious directional disabilities and would no doubt promptly misplace myself on the vast and featureless Eurasian steppe; and secondly, I lack enthusiasm for subsisting on <em>kumis,</em> the fermented mare&#39;s milk which was the staple of the Mongol diet.</p>
<p>Let me now admit that while I indulge some pseudo-anemoia for my distant Mongol forebears, I feel much closer to my more recent Ukrainian shtetl ancestors. If I could be plopped down in the western Ukraine, I might be able to absorb the texture of life in Staroconstantinov in 1895, just before brave Isaiah and Eta set out for America.&#0160; As things stand, I know almost nothing of any importance about the lives of my eastern European ancestors. How did these resilient folks survive centuries, millennia,&#0160; of dearth, disease and pogroms? What did they eat? Where did they sleep? What, indeed, did they do for &quot;fun,&quot; if they had any conception of fun? What did they read? How did the sexes relate to each other? How did they find privacy? And most significantly: how seriously did they embrace that narrow, all-encompassing and demanding religion?</p>
<p>A nineteenth-century shtetl seems impossibly foreign and faraway, but in the longer time frame, it&#39;s actually very recent. The most distant past that we can readily imagine is when the archeological record begins to appear -- perhaps five thousand year ago. But my and your fully human ancestors migrated from the Olduvai Gorge some 60,000 years ago, which leaves approximately 55,000 years without any data at all -- or at least nothing beyond the merest occasional trace. For these many millennia our forbears lived in world where there were no cities, no writing, no pottery, no weaving, no domesticated plants or animals, no metals, no wheels and therefore no vehicles -- only stone hand axes and later spears and much later still bows and arrows. Two thousand five hundred precarious <em>generations</em> of foraging! I would like to see for myself how our common ancestors managed to survive when the gigantic short-faced bear competed for the cave and the terrifying European lion lurked in the shadows. I suspect also that the most dangerous predator our g g g... grandfathers faced was the tribe next door -- otherwise why would we have inherited such hostility to people who look or act just slightly differently than ourselves. Wouldn&#39;t it be profoundly anemoiac to join a family of our mutual forebears for a week or two and participate with them as they went about their lives?</p>
<p>What a treasure-trove of unknown unknowns would we confront!</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Promenading last Friday on the semi-famous Boulder Mall, we stumbled upon a Certifiably Big Event.</p>
<p>Ours is a college town where the three major religions are marijuana, massage, and football. On the evening that precedes a Saturday home game, the Mall is turned over to a football rally--a gigantic and noisy one. Have any of my regular readers or stray internet pilgrims ever been to such an event?&#0160; It&#39;s quite an echt American experience: the uniformed marching band -- all epaulets and brass and drums, the perky cheerleaders, a float featuring sports heroes of yore, the hundred gladiators themselves (all much taller and thicker than ordinary human beings) along with chants and rousing speeches. Tons of school spirit and not a shred of irony.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>The next day, despite the ginned-up enthusiasm, our team was blown out by UCLA, 45-17.</p>
<p>Rallies are not my kind of event. I&#39;m constitutionally allergic to rah-rah and for the last couple of decades I&#39;ve been boycotting football.</p>
<p>Why no more football for me? In truth, football was never my passion. I hardly ever played the game -- only a little &quot;two-hand touch&quot; in the schoolyard, so I&#39;m not surrendering much by proscribing a sport that is a danger to everyone&#39;s physical well-being. There are too many dreadful injuries, especially head injuries. Too many retired players afflicted with dementia. A few days ago, surfing the channels, I accidentally glanced at a few minutes of a NFL contest. Even in that brief stretch, a cornerback was badly battered and carried by stretcher into an on-field ambulance. To me, it looked like it could be a broken neck. I&#39;m sorry that I paused to watch; it will be along time before I do so again.</p>
<p>And I&#39;ve always been resistant to Rah-Rah. Rubs me wrong; always has, right from the start.</p>
<p>The local mall rally caused me to remember my first days at Cornell, 66 years ago. I was a most naive freshman (now &quot;freshperson&quot; or &quot;first-year&quot;) and had not a glimmer of an idea about college life -- none of my family or friends ever having enjoyed such an experience. Completely at sea. My peers in the freshman dorm insisted, you have to go to the rally. I had no idea what a rally was but if going to college meant going to rallies, then why not? I knew no better and tagged along with my new acquaintances. So there it was, just like last night on the mall. The band, the cheerleaders, the athletes, the rah-rah exhortations. One after another the speakers (were they coaches?), told us how hard we were going to cheer tomorrow for dear old Cornell and victory. We sang Cornell songs, the lyrics to which were handed to us on a mimeographed sheets of paper. It was far too enthusiastic for me -- too patriotic I guess one might say. I was not true to my school. How could I love Cornell or think fondly of my alma mater. I had just arrived, for goodness sake, and hadn&#39;t even finished unpacking. The insisted-upon emotion seemed contrived and artificial and I resented the pseudo-nostalgia. I don&#39;t like being subsumed into a crowd. I respond negatively when I&#39;m exhorted to cheer or wave or sing. It all seems dangerously close to the unthinking obedience of nationalist politics.&#0160;</p>
<p>And then, next day, came the game itself. Dutifully I trudged to Schoellkopf to watch our guys encounter Princeton. I remember nothing about the contest, not even who won or lost. But I can still feel the cold September drizzle -- and I know that I caught a stiff cold. In my four years in Ithaca, it was my first and only football game.&#0160;</p>
<p>I soon learned that Cornell had much to offer beyond the rah-rah. It took a year or so, but eventually I found my people.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Ukraine has been invaded and whole cities have been obliterated by the Putin dictatorship. It&#39;s tragic. Once again, I&#39;m overwhelmingly grateful that my grandparents chose to pack up and leave the blighted Ukraine. It&#39;s a decision that has looked better and better with each passing year.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>My father&#39;s family came from a Ukrainian &quot;shtetl&quot; called Starokonstantinov, or Alt Konstantin (&quot;old Constantine&quot;). As a youth, I overheard but did not understand conversations in Yiddish about a place that my grandparents called (phonetically) Xusantine-gebernia, where the X stands for a non-English deep guttural fricative. Seventy years ago I paid little attention to my eastern European ancestry. Now I&#39;m fascinated.</p>
<p>Where is Starokonstantinov?&#0160; What is a &quot;shtetl?&quot;</p>
<p>I&#39;ve just read Yohanan Petrovsky-Shtern&#39;s new (2014) and highly pertinent history, <em>The Golden Age Shtetl (</em>an oxymoronic title if there ever was one). Y P-S defines a shtetl as &quot;an East European market town in private possession of a Polish magnate, inhabited mostly but not exclusively by Jews, and subject to Russian bureaucracy.&quot; Starokonstantinov, he claims, was a &quot;quintessential shtetl.&quot; &quot;My&quot; ancestral shtetl lies in the western part of Ukraine, about 50 miles south of a line drawn between Lviv and Kyiv. Nowadays, it has a population of about 30,000 souls.</p>
<p>I know that my grandfather&#39;s people lived in Starokonstantinov from the middle of the nineteenth century, but I have no idea when they first arrived -- it might have been years or centuries before. The town itself is not an ancient foundation. It enters history only in the late 16th century when a Polish noble named Konstanty Ostrogski built himself a castle (which still survives) and took ownership of the surrounding area. Starokonstantinov was a &quot;private town&quot; -- meaning that it was owned by the Ostrogski family for several hundred years. In its first years, Starokonstantinov was included in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In 1569 it became part of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. In 1793, and for many years, even after my ancestors had struck out for the new world, it was a possession of the Russian Empire. Now it&#39;s in the independent Ukraine, and hoping to remain so.</p>
<p>The history of Starokonstantinov is marked by a series of tragedies prior to the one now in progress. An early disaster was the Battle of Starokonstantinov in 1648, which was a key event in the Chmielnicki Massacres of 1648-49. Eastern rite Cossacks broke into the fortified town and killed all of its 130 Jewish families and as many Polish Roman Catholics as they could find. During the early part of the 18th century, the Haidamack massacre of Uman by Cossacks spilled over into other Ukrainian shtetls, including &quot;mine.&quot; And then beginning in 1881 came the series of pogroms -- anti-Jewish peasant riots provoked and tacitly supported by the Russian officialdom. In Starokonstantinov, there were 6611 Jews in 1847 and 9212 (61% of the total population) in 1897. (There would have been two more if my grandparents hadn&#39;t seen the light in 1895). During the Nazi occupation in 1942, virtually all the remaining Jewish population (6731 in 1939) was murdered. It&#39;s a troubled, tragic history.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not sure what it means to say that a town was wholly owned by Polish nobility. Did the Ostrogskis own all the land, or the land and some of the buildings? Did they administer the public works? The churches? Did they possess the surrounding farms?&#0160; Did they own, until they were freed in 1861, the serfs?&#0160; Most likely, each shtetl had its own particular form of ownership (the late medieval world was anything but standardized). Y P-S does not explain; perhaps he assumes it&#39;s common knowledge.</p>
<p>Starokonstantinov occasionally makes an appearance in <em>The Golden Age Shtetl</em>.</p>
<p>I had not realized how active my ancestors might have been in the vodka trade. &quot;In Starokonstantinov, the possession of Countess Rzewuska, about fifty [Jewish-owned] inns and taverns yielded 67 percent of the town revenues.&quot; (Query: how and when did the shtetl pass from the Ostrogskis to the Rzewuskis, who were a very prominent and wealthy Polish family)? As far as I can tell, the &quot;town revenues&quot; went directly into the hands of the Polish overlords. In 1827, &quot;Starokonstantinov Jews realized the that their efforts to prevent the draft of men for twenty to twenty five year terms in the Russian army [had failed], and the Jewish populace turned against their own kahal elders and attacked their houses.&quot; &quot;Local police had to summon an additional army unit to suppress the outburst.&quot; (The &quot;kahal&quot; was a committee of prominent Jewish citizens who were the nominal governors [under Polish supervision] of the Jewish population.) In the first half of the nineteenth century, the divorce rate among Jewish couples in Starokonstantinov, was 16 percent. In larger cities, it was even higher (in Letichev it was 47 percent). Y P-S attributes the surprisingly high rate of failed marriages to the relative freedom of Jewish women and to the breakdown of traditional constraints as the Jewish population became increasingly urbanized. A major fire in Starokonstantinov in 1835 hastened the shtetl&#39;s decline. Russian travelers found Starokonstantinov and especially its roads deplorable. &quot;A Russian army officer observed that Starokonstantinov is dirty beyond any measure: but &#39;if we bother ourselves to learn the reasons for this situation, we would perhaps find out that even the Jews, whom are usually blamed, have nothing to do with it.... To drive through the streets of the town is a real challenge, as there is no pavement. Stones once paving the road have long sunk into the soils. When it is raining, they do nothing but prevent movement.&#39;&quot; Mud season in Starokonstantinov must have been an annual challenge. Nevertheless, Starokonstantinovites were readers: a merchant estimated that in the shtetl there were &quot;about 20,000 books, mostly prayer books, bible and bible commentaries, tractates on the Talmud and the Kabbalah.&quot; Y P-S thinks that this number must be a great exaggeration. But it&#39;s on the record that a merchant named Pinhas Yosef Bromberg from Starokonstantinov brought twenty Hebrew books with him while traveling on business to St Petersburg.&#0160;</p>
<p>My great-grandfather was a participant in the commerce of Starokonstantinov. According to my father, he was a &quot;factor.&quot;&#0160; A &quot;faktor&quot; (Yiddish from German) was essentially a middleman. My ancestor had a horse and a wagon (perhaps, I allow myself to fantasize in a moment of self-aggrandizement, two horses and two wagons). According to tradition, he mostly dealt in grain, but factors such as he bought and sold whatever was available: wood, coal, ribbons, calico, mirrors, bolts and screws, vodka and wine. They did much of their business at fairs and Starokonstantinov was famous for its very prominent fair.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I read <em>Imagining Robert, My Brother, Madness, and Survival</em> by Jay Neugeboren for neighborhood and neighborly reasons. Its author is a 1955 graduate of fabled Erasmus Hall High School (I was class of 1956). Much of the story takes place in the area of Brooklyn now called Lefferts Gardens. Walkable, or at least bicyclable, from East 9 Street.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a sad tale. Younger brother Robert went seriously off the psychological rails in his late teen years. Older brother Jay relentlessly chronicles his brother&#39;s lifetime of struggles. It becomes clear that modern medicine does not offer any remedy or hope to people with Robert&#39;s illnesses. The system relies on&#0160; ineffective drugs and ineffective therapies and what amounts to involuntary imprisonment. It&#39;s a painful, discouraging history.</p>
<p>And it&#39;s also a good and moving book. Very sincere and very emotional. I confess to dropping an occasional tear.</p>
<p>And yet I don&#39;t know whether it&#39;s right to expose a loved one to such public scrutiny. I myself wouldn&#39;t have made that choice. But I empathize with Neugeboren&#39;s tale, inasmuch as I know from personal experience that therapies for some forms of mental decay are no better now than they were during the Darkest Ages.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Young &#39;uns, I don&#39;t know that you entirely grasp the glamor and mystery of maturity (which in some jaded circles is called &quot;old age.&quot;)&#0160; Let me tell you, the <br />golden years are just chockablock full of sensual romance of a kind that you might not now appreciate.&#0160;</p>
<p>Just the other day, for example, we were both instructed to make another visit to the phlebotomist (it seems hardly a month goes by that some specialist or other doesn&#39;t need to inspect a sample of our personal sanguineous fluids).&#0160;</p>
<p>Being economical people, we scheduled our appointments for the same time, same place.</p>
<p>Her blood draw was in anticipation of a knee replacement; mine for routine monitoring of my half-a-dozen annoying senior conditions.</p>
<p>So there we were, side by side, in adjacent cubicles, stripping our sleeves for the venipuncture.</p>
<p>I ask you, is there anything on earth more romantic than a senior couple experiencing simultaneous blood draws. Rapture, rapture! Joy and jollity!</p>
<p>In a merrier world, the instant of venipuncture would have been accompanied with an orchestra of swelling music, perhaps Brahms. And there would have been candles; next time this happens, we&#39;ll surround ourselves with a whole Liberace of candelabras. Dozens of long stem red roses. Beakers of Veuve Cliquot &#39;42.&#0160; An applauding audience of family and friends.&#0160;</p>
<p>It would have been even more thrilling if my technician hadn&#39;t taken three tries to hit the mark. &quot;Your vein rolled,&quot; she said accusingly, compromising ever so slightly the transcendent moment.</p>

		<a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2022/03/eleanor-roosevelt-brooklyn-539east9.html">When Eleanor Roosevelt Visited 539 East 9 Street</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>It should be remembered and recorded that in October of 1960, Eleanor Roosevelt herself visited the home of my parents --my childhood home (539 East 9 Street in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn).</p>
<p>I myself missed the occasion, alas. I was then living in Massachusetts, undergoing the first disorienting days of graduate school. But I know the story.&#0160;</p>
<p>During the 1960 presidential campaign (John F. Kennedy versus &quot;Tricky Dick&quot; Nixon), JFK&#39;s Catholicism emerged as a divisive issue. It&#39;s hard to believe what a fuss was made about his religion, especially nowadays, when no one bothers themselves that Joseph Biden is not only a Roman Catholic, but a serious one at that (JFK&#39;s personal commitment to his religion was, let&#39;s say, nominal).</p>
<p>Among Jewish voters, some of whom had grown up in Brownsville or Williamsburg or the Lower East side where Jewish-Irish conflict was a fact of life, there was a great deal of resistance to voting for JFK. And other Jewish voters, harking back to the old country, remembered Catholics as their antagonists and were hard put to vote for a candidate of that persuasion.</p>
<p>It fell to the task of Mrs. Roosevelt to persuade these reluctant voters that they could and should cast a ballot for Kennedy. At the time, there was no one in America who had more credibility with Jewish populations than she. It was well known that Mrs. Roosevelt had lobbied her hesitant husband for more lenient policies toward &quot;displaced&quot; Jews</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know how it came about that our living room was chosen as a site for Mrs. Roosevelt to meet with voters. I suspect that it was through my mother&#39;s extensive contacts with members of the League of Women Voters, an organization of which she was a stalwart volunteer. I know that my mother assembled 50 or so voters, almost all Jewish women, and seated or stood them in our very crowded second floor living room. Mrs. Roosevelt arrived, and as my father said to me later, she &quot;dragged her ass&quot; up two flights of stairs, spoke for 20 minutes, presumably in that upper-class nasal twang for which she was famous, answered a couple of respectful questions, and then limped back down to her car. And went on to the next venue. And the next. (She was 76 at the time, and not in great health.) Apparently she followed this same arduous routine for months.</p>
<p>That&#39;s how elections are won.</p>
<p>Eleanor Roosevelt died two years later, in 1962.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Another long troubled night, another astonishing dream. This time, I found myself lurking in a primitive cabin inhabited, it seemed, by a big happy family. There were a bunch of kids and a cheerful be-aproned matriarch cooking on an old wood stove what looked to me like a cauldron of soup. Immediately, the scene shifted to a hall or a church basement. There were eight or ten long tables at which a couple of dozen unfamiliar but clearly delineated folks were seated, waiting for their dinner. But first, some singing. An unidentifiable patriotic song, and then, a hymn. I recognized it as a hymn because it included the line, &quot;He died in vain.&quot; Still in the midst of the dream, I said to myself, I have to remember this verse, so I took out pen and paper, and wrote down these words: &quot;he died in vain.&quot; As I did so, a large, bearded, slightly threatening man accused me of &quot;making fun&quot; of the proceedings. He demanded to inspect what I had written. I showed him my writing and explained to him that I thought &quot;he died in vain&quot; was theologically wrong, because according to the usual Christian interpretation, Jesus did not die &quot;in vain.&quot;</p>
<p>End of dream.</p>
<p>In the morning, awake, I did some research to see if &quot;he died in vain&quot; appears in any familiar or remote hymn. Just as I anticipate, no soap. However, I discovered that the most frequently cited use of the phrase comes not from a hymn or from the Bible but from the Gettysburg Address: that &quot;we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain.&quot; Why should my dreamatorium think to quote Abraham Lincoln? But why not, especially since there&#39;s been a lot of Lincoln talk in our household this last while what with Lynn reading a biography and also <em>Team of Rivals</em>. Then I wondered, could the cabin in the first part of the dream be a reference to Kentucky log cabin in which Lincoln was reputedly born. A long shot, but not impossible. Anyway, it&#39;s my dream; I can interpret it as I want.</p>
<p>These mysterious dreams inspire in me an idea for a stunning new technology. I think it would be very helpful if someone would devise a recording device for dreams -- so that they could be saved and then played back on the TV screen. It would be fascinating, I think, to see not only the fragments that one remembers but the whole multi-hour experience laid out there in full color and stereophonic sound. What a boon to mankind! What a convenience for psychoanalysts!</p>
<p>I imagine something like an applewatch with an app for recording a month or so of all-nighters. I know I&#39;d buy one.&#0160;</p>
<p>Impossible, you say?&#0160; Well, did they not laugh at the Wright brothers?</p>
<p>I think I need to present this idea to Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos. Bill Gates. Someone with imagination and a history of achievement. Someone who would know how to monetize so brilliant a conception. I myself am willing to invest my entire income tax refund, however large it turns out to be.</p>

		<a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2022/02/kazin-walker-in-the-city.html">Love</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Some years ago, I wrote about meetings of the E &amp; L Chafetz Family Circle, a biennial gathering of my immigrant grandmother&#39;s family and also of her many cousins, spouses and descendants. I recalled that Youthful Me objected to being dragooned into attending these sessions. I also confessed that I hadn&#39;t a glimmer of understanding of what those meetings meant. Here&#39;s what I wrote:&#0160;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What I didn&#39;t know, and is so obvious to me now, was that I was much more important to them than they were to me. That I was &quot;doing well in school&quot; were words that they dearly wanted to hear. It was for my generation and for me that they had braved the Cossacks, sold the farm, deserted from the Russian army, left backward White Russia&#0160; or the Ukraine behind, endured the miseries of steerage, slept four to a bed for years and half-acclimated themselves to a new and utterly foreign world. For me. They had sacrificed themselves to invest in me. So that I could &quot;do well in school,&quot; get an education, live a better life. I was their emissary to America, to the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is still painful to admit how little I had appreciated these diminutive and ancient but very brave people.</p>
<p>As it happens, I was not the only person to come to the same conclusion.</p>
<p>In <em>A Walker in the City</em> (the city is the Brownsville section of Brooklyn), the distinguished man of letters Alfred Kazin had long ago (1951)made the identical point:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My [immigrant] father and mother worked in a rage to put us above their level; they had married to make us possible. We were the only conceivable end to all their striving; we were their America.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Kazin proceeded to analyze his parents&#39; marriage (he&#39;s a generation older than I so his words are relevant not to my parents, but to my grandparents and those of their Chafetz generation). &quot;Love&quot; became his subject. As I type his words, I think of Joseph and Sonia, Isaiah and Etta:&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our parents, whatever affection might offhandedly be expressed between them, always had the look of being committed to something deeper than mere love. Their marriages were neither happy nor unhappy.; they were arrangements.&#0160;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Powerful words, I think. Their marriages were &quot;arrangements&quot; -- certainly not the touches of sweet harmony.</p>
<p>Not &quot;love.&quot; Love was not for such as his parents (or, to continue the argument, my grandparents).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am perfectly sure that in my parents&#39; mind, love was something exotic and not wholly legitimate, reserved for &quot;educated&quot; people like their children, who were the sole end of their existence. So far as I knew, love was not an element admissible in my parents&#39; experience. Any open talk of it between themselves would have seemed ridiculous. It would have suggested a wicked self-indulgence, a preposterous attention to one&#39;s own feelings.... They looked on themselves only as instruments toward the ideal &quot;American&quot; future that would be lived by their children.&#0160;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have the same sense about my forebears. I never heard any of them use the word &quot;love&quot; and I don&#39;t think it would have been a comprehensible value for them. To fall in love, to be in love, was not their expectation. Their aim was more elemental: simply, to survive.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Moreover, not only did they not recognize romantic love, they also, as far as I can remember, attached little importance to &quot;happiness.&quot;</p>
<p>What an oddity!&#0160; They had left the dark backward of eastern Europe, lands of dearth and pogroms and cholera, and traveled to a country in which the &quot;pursuit of happiness&quot; was inscribed in its founding documents. But their aim, I am absolutely sure, was not to achieve ephemeral happiness; their aim was to put a roof over their heads and put food on the family table.</p>
<p>Life and liberty, yes; the pursuit of happiness -- an utterly alien concept.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>My bedmate informed that last night, in the wee hours, I uttered the strange words, &quot;fear of clowns.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Thanks to her I then remembered doing so (I had forgotten). But why those words? I had no context. Was I in the throes of some sort of clownish nightmare?</p>
<p>Or was it merely a vocabulary exercise?&#0160; Perhaps, in my dream, I searched for the English word for &quot;fear of clowns.&quot; I know there is such a word, and in the morning, I tried to recall it, but without success. I then tried to re-invent a word, but the best I could do was &quot;bozophobia,&quot; which is clearly an undignified and inadequate invention. The existing and correct word, I soon discovered, is <em>coulrophobia,&#0160;</em>a curious modern coinage, dating only to the 1990s. Coulrophobia is, for some mysterious reason, derived from the Greek word for &quot;stilt-walker.&quot; (There&#39;s a modern Greek word for clown, <em>ÎºÎ»ÏÎ¿ÏÎ½</em>, transliterated as klÃ³oun, which I suspect to be a recent borrowing from American English.)&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Coulrophobia can be a serious affliction. According to the Cleveland Clinic, coulrophobia can lead to hyperhidrosis. I myself am neither coulrophobic nor hyperhidrosic.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>The nighttime mystery remains. Why in the world would a semi-normal guy blurt out the words &quot;fear of clowns&quot; at 2 am in the morning. In the long history of human sleeping and dreaming, has such a thing ever happened before? Or will it again?</p>
<p>Truly, I am a fascinating individual. Especially during the night. During the waking hours, not so much.</p>

		<a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2022/01/paula-fox.html">Novels Set in Brooklyn:  Desperate Characters (1970)</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Paula Fox&#39;s <em>Desperate Characters </em>feels to me less like a novel than a short story, or perhaps a set of short stories sutured together. It&#39;s comprised of a series of incidents that concern a married couple and like many fictions in the short story genre, resists closure or resolution. Though it&#39;s a miniature of a novel, it&#39;s still a gem.</p>
<p>The principal characters, Otto and Sophie, come to the end of the story just about where they started -- not miserable but not happy either. They are immigrants to an incompletely gentrified, downtown Brooklyn neighborhood. Their house -- all pocket doors, cedar floors, highly polished Victorian furniture even a Meissen cat dish -- as well as the houses of their neighbors are vulnerable to violation. Otto and Sophie, and their friends, are attacked by the sort of intrusions that are familiar from horror films -- the bite of a stray cat, a threatening phone call, a stone thrown through a window, unwanted visitors, vicious inexplicable vandalism, mysterious goings-on in the house next door. These attacks on the home are intermittent but unending; in fact, the last image in the book is of a self-inflicted wound -- an interior wall splotched and stained by the black ink of a thrown inkwell. Stasis, not progress.</p>
<p>Should I have been surprised that the Brooklyn novels that I have now read are so concerned with the acquisition, improvement, integrity, and preservation of the homestead?</p>
<p>To tell truth, I have been a bit startled -- but I should not have been. Brooklyn has always been the most mutable and fluid of cities. Outsiders -- Irish, Italians and Jews in my part of Flatbush, as well as southern Blacks searching for the warmth of other suns, West Indians, Russians, Hispanics from central and south Americas, Asians of all varieties, and nowadays midWesterners -- arrive and alter the neighborhood. For the worse, according to the prior inhabitants, and for the better, according to the new arrivals. It&#39;s a repeated and perpetual dance -- and certainly one that was a feature of my own family history.</p>
<p>My immigrant grandparents never had the resources even to imagine the purchase of a home. They were renters of a cold-water sixth-floor walkup in Williamsburg. Nor had they owned property in the old country, where they were even poorer. I imagine that when my parents purchased the house in which I was raised (in 1936, for $4500) they were the first in my ancestry dating back to the spear and atalatl eons ever to own a piece of real estate.&#0160;</p>
<p>Re-reading these Brooklyn books has reminded me how important that home on East 9 Street in heart of&#0160; Flatbush was to my parents. And why my father, in his last years, solitary, crippled by arthritis, but intransigent refused to leave it though it would have been much more sensible and convenient to live elsewhere. He was determined to die in his own precious home, and he did so.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a picture of 539 East 9 Street, a big old undistinguished Victorian, taken sometime around the 1939, the year of my birth. The second and third stories were rented; we lived on the ground floor. The house, long since demolished, lives on in my memory.&#0160;</p>
<p>Especially in my nightmares, where at least once a month, I defend myself against the savage bows and arrows, the cavalry rifles, and wild dogs that attack the property.&#0160; And wake up in a sweaty terror.</p>

		<a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2021/12/betty-smith-brooklyn.html">Novels Set in Brooklyn:  A Tree Grows in Brooklyn</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>My new reading project: novels set in Brooklyn. There are, I&#39;ve already discovered, tons of them. I wonder how long I will last at this endeavor. Will it be a sterile or a fruitful exercise?</p>
<p>How is it that I never read, until this very week, <em>A Tree Grows in Brookly</em>n?&#0160; It&#39;s certainly the best known novel with the noun &quot;Brooklyn&quot; in its title. I&#39;ve known about it all my life and just never got around to looking at a single page. Did my parents, always tentative about sex, warn me off because the novel has a few frank passages. Or was it anti-Brooklyn snobbery?&#0160; As a young person, I wanted to read about far off places -- Pitcairn Island, nomadic central Asia, and the Africa of Rider Haggard, -- certainly not familiar grimy Brooklyn. At the McDonald Avenue branch of the public library, there were many well-worn copies of of <em>A Tree Grows in Brooklyn </em>sitting on the shelf -- which I ignored and, if I remember correctly, disdained.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>What did I miss?&#0160; <em>Tree</em> is not much in the way of a fiction. There&#39;s nothing like a plot, only a series of loosely-related episodes, and except for the central figure, not much character development. It&#39;s a barely-disguised autobiography. Francie Nolan, tracked from birth through her escape to, believe it or not, Michigan!!, comes from a grindingly poor family (&quot;food insecure&quot; before the term was invented). Much of the first few hundred pages is the barebones account of the struggle for sustenance (and lodging). There is so much emphasis on overcoming lack that <em>Tree</em> almost seems to fetishize or celebrate poverty.&#0160;</p>
<p>So much scrabbling for the next meal is hard to bear, painful to read. It&#39;s especially painful for me, because Betty Smith, born in 1896 in Williamsburg, preceded my father, also a native of Williamsburg (born in 1904) by only a few years. He came from an immigrant family as poor as poor can be, and some of the stories that he told me about the impoverishment of his youth echo and sometimes exceed Smith&#39;s. The essence, therefore, of this &quot;novel,&quot; is familiar to me, perhaps entirely too familiar.</p>
<p>One blot upon the novel is its casual bigotry. Irish characters sometimes go to &quot;Jewtown&quot; for clothes or food. Jewish characters are gross stereotypes. But what can be expected from a popular novel of the 1940s, when the radio offered us, day after day,&#0160; large doses of <em>Amos and Andy, Life with Luigi, The Goldbergs.&#0160;</em>How we guffawed at ethnic &quot;humor&quot; in those unenlightened days!&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Nor was I happy about the novel&#39;s Brooklyn chauvinism. For example:&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">&quot;&quot;There&#39;s no other place like it,&quot; Francie said.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">&quot;Like what?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">&quot;Brooklyn. It&#39;s a magic city.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">&quot;It&#39;s just like any other place.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">&quot;It isn&#39;t. It&#39;s mysterious here in Brooklyn. It&#39;s like -- yes -- a dream. The houses and streets don&#39;t seem real. Neither do the people.&quot;</span></p>
<p>I wish the novel offered some corroboration for the claim of Brooklyn&#39;s magic and mystery. If it was there, I didn&#39;t find it in this grim novel, nor at the corner of Newkirk and Coney Island Avenues where I first came to awareness.</p>
<p>The &quot;tree that grows in Brooklyn&quot; is the so-called &#39;tree of heaven,&quot; <em>ailanthus altissima. </em>Smith has chosen it as a symbol of resilience, for the tree of heaven can thrive under the most inauspicious circumstances. I, for one, can remember playing on the roof of one of those six story apartment houses so common in our neighborhood, and noticing an ailanthus growing right out of the asphalt. I was astonished. But I wish that Betty Smith had chosen a different tree to invest with meaning, because the ailanthus is, frankly, a &quot;trash tree.&quot;&#0160; It&#39;s generally considered a noxious weed, an invasive species. It grows rapidly but is short-lived. Its wood is soft and useless. It suckers vigorously and eternally, pours forth strong alleopathic chemicals upon its neighbors, invades subterranean sewers and pipes, is extremely fecund, and stinks. It is known to gardeners and foresters not as the &quot;tree of heaven&quot; but as the &quot;tree of hell.&quot; It&#39;s not a tree that often finds itself celebrated in fiction. Nor in pastoral. Brooklyn, my Brooklyn, was a city of magnificent oaks, maples, sycamores and elms. My people, my fellow Brooklynites, deserve a more distinguished avatar than the tree of of so-called heaven.</p>
<p>Some will remember that T. S. Eliot once referred to the tree that grows in Brooklyn as the &quot;rank ailanthus.&quot;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I was in the midst of the usual noir &quot;can&#39;t-find-my-way&quot; dream when all at once, without warning, the scene and the genre changed. Suddenly I was in technicolor John Ford territory, holding on for dear life to the cow-catcher of an 1880s railroad engine. Three central-casting bad guys -- all whiskers and black hats --were shooting at me with their pistols. Familiar with what&#39;s expected such films, I responded by drawing my own Colt 45-- and plugged two of them. But the third kept coming, zombie-style, even though I nailed him several times. I was scared.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Apparently I was rattling around, because just as I decided that I&#39;d better shoot him between the eyes and be done with it, my faithful bedmate woke me up.&#0160; End of dream; what a relief.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>I must be watching too many Westerns.</p>
<p>It&#39;s fascinating that the material of this dream is not drawn from the events of my &quot;real life,&quot; but rather from fiction (in this case, the movies). Have I incorporated such fictions into the deepest layers of my unconscious, from which dreams are supposedly drawn?&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>On the other hand, my watching and absorbing a film is a &quot;real life&quot; event.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>I can&#39;t remember any film in which a character clings to the cow-catcher. Did I invent such an event?&#0160; Or just extrapolate it from various western films?</p>
<p>I should mention that I experienced the dream not in ordinary colors but in the brilliant artificial color of old-fashioned garish Technicolor.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I first heard the word &quot;spatchcock&quot; at a Thanksgiving celebration some four or five years ago. The turkey, I was told, had been &quot;spatchcocked.&quot; To be absolutely honest, I thought someone was pulling my leg. To my pure and undefiled ears, the word &quot;spatchcock&quot; sounded more than a little obscene. Certainly not something that a civilized person would do to a turkey. Or even to a fellow human being. I admit that I was puzzled: what sort of perverse activity is implied by &quot;spatchcock.&quot; And just who would be the spatchcocker and who the spatchcockee?</p>
<p>But further investigation revealed that &quot;spatchcock&quot; is not a dirty joke nor even a slangy neologism. The word has an eighteenth-century origin and it&#39;s not sexual but culinary: &quot;to cut poultry along the spine and spread the halves apart for more even cooking when grilled.&quot; Moreover, the word &quot;spatchcock,&quot; believe it or not, has a sibling of its own: &quot;spitchcock&quot;: &quot;to split an eel along the back and then broil it.&quot; So spatchcock and spitchcock, yet as far as I know, no &quot;spotchcock&quot; or &quot;sputchcock&quot;-- but why not?&#0160; Lots of other land and sea beasts out there to de-spine and roast over an open fire. Spatchcocking, the process, probably dates back to the neolithic, after the taming of fire and long before anyone thought to call it by such a silly name.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>Etymology?&#0160; Though there are theories, I&#39;m going to stick with &quot;origin unknown.&quot; The common answer is that the word is <span class="ILfuVd"><span class="hgKElc">&quot;shorthand&#0160; for &#39;dispatching the cock.&#39;&quot; An undocumented, out-of-left-field guess, in my opinion. If I were to propose a theory, I would </span></span><span class="ILfuVd"><span class="hgKElc">say that the &quot;cock&quot; must be a version of&#0160; &quot;cook.&quot; I&#39;m not prepared to venture a guess about the spatch. A mystery, unrecoverable. Perhaps a humorous coinage?</span></span></p>
<p><span class="ILfuVd"><span class="hgKElc">I&#39;d hypothesize that &quot;cock&quot; might be related to the second part of common surnames such as Hancock, Adcock, Babcock, Hitchcock or Wilcox. Some say that the cock in these names is a hypocoristic suffix &quot;applied to a young lad who strutted proudly like a cock.&quot; I&#39;m skeptical. More credible, once again, is &quot;cook.&quot; Hancock is Johan the cook, Adcock is Adam the cook, Hitchcock is Richard (Rich, Hich) the cook, and so on.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="ILfuVd"><span class="hgKElc">The ever-unpredictable Urban Dictionary provides another meaning for &quot;spatchcock&quot;: &quot;w</span></span>hen you intentionally rub your backpack on a nearby stranger&#39;s genitals in an effort to sexually arouse them.&quot; What can I say?&#0160; Only that I&#39;ve lived a long life and have never given a single thought to the erotic potential of the backpack. Nor have I ever been spatchcocked either in the traditional culinary nor the speculative contemporary sexual sense of the word (thanks be to all the gods in the pantheon!)</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Max had a long love affair with New Orleans, and he loved to initiate his friends into the city&#39;s splendors and secrets. We were beneficiaries of his generosity. It was because of &quot;mad Max&quot; that we enjoyed a series of winter visits to the crescent city. He was a splendid enthusiastic guide as well as a great character, with a touch of Falstaff about him: charm, flaws, girth.</p>
<p>For me, it was a late-onset friendship, but Lynn had known Max from the 60s, from her Baltimore days, when Max was a doctoral student in biology at Hopkins. The two of them reconnected five years ago when Max invited Lynn (and me) to stay for a month in an apartment in his rental house in the Garden District. How could we decline such an offer? His house, alas, turned out to be virtually uninhabitable, with holes in the walls and floors that let in the light, the wind and rain, and the critters. There was a pungent smell of decay and a tilted bathroom that seemed about to plunge deep into the earth. Lynn was not fazed: &quot;I lived in Africa.&quot;&#0160; Max was only mildly apologetic. We made do.</p>
<p>In subsequent trips to New Orleans we took the precaution of renting a BNB.</p>
<p>But we often visited Max at his place in an apartment house on St. Charles. Max owned two adjacent apartments. He connected them by busting through the wallboard with a sledge hammer. Two kitchens, therefore, both, shall we say, far from immaculate.</p>
<p>A serious and knowledgeable cinephile, Max sponsored a monthly film series in his home. His screen had to be angled sharply to find a place amidst the clutter, distributed among which was an exquisite collection of contemporary American pottery. (Max was a widower; his sometime ladyfriend was a very accomplished potter).&#0160;</p>
<p>Max squired us about town, introducing us to both famous and out-of-the-way restaurants. He was quite a sight, squeezing his 5&#39; 4&quot; and 300 pound frame into a small sports car. He loved Adolfo&#39;s, right across the street from Snug, because the food was excellent and the portions were enormous.</p>
<p>As much as he loved his dinner, he also loved the south Louisiana vegetation; a walk with Max was a learned lecture on the local plant life.</p>
<p>Would we have discovered either Angelo Brocato&#39;s or the Creole Creamery without his guidance?&#0160;</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know what eventually killed him last August.&#0160; It could have been any one of his many ailments; he was not healthy and was often in pain. We&#39;ll miss him.</p>
<p>Max and I shared a birthday; he was exactly one year older than I. So his death is another <em>memento mori. </em>As if I needed another reminder.</p>

                                <p>Disease, dying and death, I&#39;m afraid. During the last month or so, the cohort of friends with whom I&#39;ve gone through life has been suffering major losses. BD, a friend of more than forty years standing, has just breathed his last. AM, whom I know from the PS 217 schoolyard, is suffering from cancer of the esophagus, now described as terminal. M has ALS and can no longer move or speak. LW suffered a bad stroke some while ago and is now in &quot;assisted living.&quot; JP has gone from robust to frail in a few months and has been moved to a &quot;memory care&quot; unit. And others.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve taken to reading the obits. Every week the name of a former colleague or a friend of a friend shows up. Inevitable, you say. But distressing nevertheless.</p>
<p>I&#39;m healthy, but I&#39;m old, long past my expiration date. I know that one of these days it will be my turn with the doctors and the hospitals. Too bad, because after some difficult years, I&#39;m enjoying life to the full once again.</p>
<p>My grandmother, then in her upper 80s, said to youthful me, &quot;I don&#39;t like being old. But what are my choices?&quot;</p>

<div class="entry-body">
<p>I grew up in a baseball-saturated world. The radio voices of Red Barber and Connie Desmond were the water in which I and my family and my neighbors swum. It was therefore natural that I early absorbed the vocabulary of baseball and that many words carried baseball meaning to me long before I recognized their alternative and larger existence.</p>
<p>For example, as a boy, I encountered the word &quot;mound.&quot; It signified, and signified only, a pitcher&#39;s mound -- the ten inches of sand and clay from which a pitcher throws a ball. I had no idea that mounds could exist in nature or indeed, could exist anywhere outside of a stadium, there being no mounds on Coney Island Avenue, or, at least, none that I recognized as such.</p>
<p>And then there was the word &quot;pitcher.&quot; If someone had said to me, in the 1940s, that &quot;little pitchers had big ears,&quot; I might have thought of Preacher Roe, but I would have had no idea that there was such an object as a pitcher for water or other liquid. A pitcher was not jug, ewer, or crock -- it was a man standing on a rubber fooling a batter with a slow curve.</p>
<p>Standing on a &quot;rubber?&quot; Yet another word that had a specific baseball meaning, years before it became an eraser or a galosh or a condom.</p>
<p>Similarly, a &quot;streak&quot; was not a gash of color until many years after it was a winning streak or a losing streak or batting streak. A &quot;dugout&quot; was not a canoe, not in my corner of the universe.&#0160; Nor was a &quot;rally&quot; a political meeting or protest. A rally would never have led to a &quot;strike&quot; -- a word which I knew only as one of the allotted three. &quot;Battery?&quot; A team of pitcher and catcher, not something of military or electrical storage interest.</p>
<p>And then there were the plethora, the fountain of lovely words peculiar to baseball, like &quot;shortstop&quot; and &quot;blooper.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>Inning was exclusively a baseballism. Not so &quot;outing&quot; which was in my childhood a pitcher&#39;s stint on the mound, and which only later became a picnic (or, even later, an involuntary revelation of someone&#39;s sexual inclinations).&#0160;</p>
<p>October 24:&#0160; How could I fail to include &quot;pennant.&quot; When did I learn that a pennant was a kind of triangular flag?&#0160; Not in the 1940s (or even 50s).</p>

                                <p>I read a story in an &quot;art of gardening&quot; book many years ago that I will repeat here. A famous Japanese gardener, a &quot;national treasure,&quot; was asked, &quot;What&#39;s the secret of making a garden as beautiful as yours?&quot; He didn&#39;t answer in words but lifted his arms and made a shearing or lopping motion.&#0160;</p>
<p>Many years ago, I asked Roy Huse, who had a most wonderful vegetable garden at the foot of South Road how he did it.&#0160; He said, and I quote verbatim, &quot;you really got to put the shit to it.&quot;</p>
<p>And from my father: &quot;it&#39;s all about preparing the bed before you plant.&quot;</p>
<p>So, don&#39;t skimp on getting the bed ready, add plenty of manure, and be ruthless about cutting things out.</p>
<p>And o yes, you&#39;ll need sun and water.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I entered a gloomy, dark, building, perhaps a derelict church. An older woman was sitting there, not exactly in a pew but in a large wooden chair. She said to me, &quot;We help dying people.&quot;&#0160; Was she a nurse or a nun&#0160; of some sort?&#0160; I said, &quot;Like hospice.&quot; She was adamant. &quot;No, not at all like hospice.&quot; I said, &quot;Can you help me?&quot; When I said those words I realized that I had frightened her. &quot;Do you plan to murder me,&quot; she askewd.&#0160; I assured her that I was not a murderer. To make her more comfortable, I said, &quot;Why don&#39;t we go outside where you will feel safer.&quot; But just as we opened the heavy wooden door, a very large, threatening man appeared. I strangled him without a weapon, with my bare hands. So I was a murderer after all. The woman whom I was trying to protect, said, &quot;Now I know you&#39;re planning to murder me.&quot; I objected: &quot;I&#39;ll prove to you I&#39;m not a habitual murderer. Go directly to your car and get in it and drive away. She did so (it was a blue Ford Focus). That&#39;s when the dream ended.</p>
<p>In real life, I&#39;m a peaceful person. In my dream world, I&#39;m occasionally (not often, but often enough) a killer. Why?&#0160; Is it some deeply suppressed inner anger that works its way to the surface during the night?&#0160; Or I am simply a member of a species (<em>homo sapiens</em>) that has a million year habit of violence?</p>
<p>Or perhaps the dreams are meaningless? Just the flotsam of badly-wired synapses? If so, I wish they&#39;d give it a rest.</p>

                                <p>When we arrived here 54 years ago, the land was heavily forested but with a limited pallet of northern conifers and deciduous trees. In the first category were pines both red and white, three kinds of spruce, balsam fir, larch and hemlock. Among the hardwoods were sugar maples and red maples, ash, beech, red oak, black cherry, white, yellow and gray birch, quaking and big tooth aspen, and alas butternut and elms, which have both now succumbed to plagues. Common in the area but absent from our particular property were red cedar, cottonwood, basswood, walnut, and black locust. In the 70s of the last millennium, I planted cedars and cottonwoods; they are now mature and replicating themselves. The walnut that I planted fifteen years ago is now 25 feet tall and very handsome. I have only one basswood, which I found as a seedling and transplanted to to a prominent place;&#0160; I&#39;ve been waiting all these years for its descendants. The black locusts that I grew from seeds harvested in Colorado are now starting to make an impression on the landscape. I&#39;ve also added some trees that might be able to survive our warmer winters: a hickory (growing very nicely), a swamp white oak, a bur oak (and its lone offspring) and a sycamore (which has survived two winters).&#0160; I&#39;ve also experimented and failed with some trees that grow just a bit south of us: catalpa, horse chestnut, &quot;Crimson King&quot; maple, little-leaved linden, and ginkgo. Perhaps I&#39;ll try again now that the weather has warmed. One of my neighbors has successfully reared a metasequoia; it&#39;s tempting to try but I think on the whole I&#39;d rather stay with north American trees. On the other hand, we&#39;ll need some new trees to take the place of the ash, which are soon to be decimated.&#0160;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Our stand of magnificent trees is composed of red pines, <em>pinus resinosa</em>.</p>
<p>Each tree is between 60 and 65 feet tall and they are all exactly 51 years old. How can I be so sure about height and age?&#0160;</p>
<p>Height is easy to determine with the Calloway 300 Pro Laser Range Finder. Age?&#0160; Here&#39;s the history. In 1970, some friend or acquaintance, I can&#39;t remember exactly who, acquired a hundred red pine seedlings for a forestry project. He couldn&#39;t make use of all of them and so he gave us ten -- each one perhaps 4-6 inches long and the sum of their stems no thicker than a #2 pencil. I didn&#39;t know exactly what to do with these treasures, so i planted them in a row in the vegetable garden. Which is where they sat until 1972, when I decided to plant them on the dike of the newly constructed pond, where they remain.</p>
<p>In doing so i acted in defiance of the local wisdom, which is, never plant a tree on the dike. Why? Because the tree will eventually die, and the &quot;water will follow the roots&quot; and weaken the dam. I judged this reasoning to be faulty. In the first place, red pines, like all conifers, are shallow-rooted. The surface of the dike is fifteen feet above the level of the water in the pond, so when the pine eventually dies, its rootball will still be above water level. Moreover, red pines are reported to live for centuries (some say three hundred years), and I just can&#39;t bring myself to worry about what&#39;s going to happen to a dike in the far distant future when, no doubt, the pond will long since have reverted to the thick swamp that it was before we dug it out.</p>
<p>But why red pines rather than the white (<em>pinus strobus</em>) which is generally considered to be the much superior species? Because a), I owned these red pine seedlings and b) because at that time many of the white pines in our neighborhood were suffering from a insect-borne disease that killed the leader shoot and therefore deformed the tree (leader shoot disease seems to be a thing of the past and now our young white pines are again growing up tall and straight).&#0160; And red pines as consistently healthy.</p>
<p>For their first decade, the red pines made scarcely any impression on the landscape. Now they dominate. When I sit in their shade, I am pleased to recall their entire history, which allows me to tell them, proudly, &quot;I knew you when you were just a sprout!&quot; <a class="asset-img-link" href="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef02788034f5cc200d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Screen Shot 2021-06-22 at 5.47.32 PM" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef02788034f5cc200d image-full img-responsive" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef02788034f5cc200d-800wi" title="Screen Shot 2021-06-22 at 5.47.32 PM" /></a></p>

<p>It may not be immediately obvious or dramatic, but the large tree in the middle of the picture is a white birch. It towers over the red maple and the beeches that are to its left. White birches do not often attain such size, nor are they long-lived, at least in our part of the world. This particular white birch is old and imposing and thriving and healthy.&#0160;</p>
<p>Yet a few years ago this birch appeared to be at death&#39;s door. It sported only a handful of yellow leaves on its thin senescent crown.&#0160;</p>
<p>Inasmuch as it was an old tree (as measured in white-birch years) we all assumed that it had come to the end of its natural days. There was a vigorous family debate on whether it should be submitted to the chain saw before it fell over -- perhaps dangerously -- of its own accord. The consensus was to give it another year. It was a good decision -- as can be plainly seen.</p>
<p>I have no idea why the birch sprang from its hospital bed. Was it a victim of some nameless illness that it had overcome? Had it been merely listless and depressed? Had its local environment altered?&#0160; Perhaps some noxious insect pest had arrived, gone for a kill, failed,&#0160; and then decamped. I have no theory -- it&#39;s a total mystery, as is so much in life. Nevertheless, I&#39;m happy to welcome the birch back into our community. May it have many more happy years.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, just steps away, was a young vigorous yellow birch. Yellow birches are not as striking or famous as their white-barked cousins, but to my mind they are by far the better tree. They are, at least in our neck of the woods, larger, better shaped, longer-lived, and their wood is superior for either furniture or flooring or fuel. Their bark is a splendid glistening yellow gold. A tree to prize.</p>
<p>But, alas, not this particular yellow birch. Last summer it was a burgeoning adolescent, adding more than 18 inches of growth a season. This year, I&#39;m sorry to report, dead as a doornail.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef0282e10a2d56200b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Screen Shot 2021-06-21 at 9.14.47 AM" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef0282e10a2d56200b img-responsive" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef0282e10a2d56200b-800wi" title="Screen Shot 2021-06-21 at 9.14.47 AM" /></a></p>
<p>Not a single leaf. Not the slightest sign of life. This is an ex tree.</p>
<p>The yellow birch was in a perfect position and was one that I had counted on to live for at least a hundred years, perhaps two hundred.&#0160; A tree that should have lasted centuries and been an ornament to the property and a delight to grandchildren and great-grandchildren -- under whose spreading boughs picnics and&#0160; other rural pleasures would have been enacted far into the future.</p>
<p>But that&#39;s the inconstancy of life on earth. One tree, supposedly a short-lived one, springs to life while another, with a grand future, suddenly and inexplicably succumbs to the fate that awaits us all.</p>
<p>Mutability, they used to call it. Precarious, I&#39;d say. &quot;All is flux.&quot;</p>
<p>We are grateful that we had the yellow birch for as long as it lasted, and grateful also that the white birch has decided to stick around -- perhaps for another couple of decades.</p>

                                <p>For many years, we&#39;ve had to make do with this inferior fly-swatter:</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef026bded52529200c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Screen Shot 2021-05-30 at 4.20.44 PM" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef026bded52529200c image-full img-responsive" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef026bded52529200c-800wi" title="Screen Shot 2021-05-30 at 4.20.44 PM" /></a></p>
<p>It&#39;s made of molded plastic and extruded metal wire. It&#39;s not handsome -- a ghastly inappropriate pink-purple color for the flapper and a small gauge white-coated wire for the handle. Is there a name for this&#0160; styleless style, other than dime-store cheap. Mid-century modern in its least attractive manifestation. Not only unbeautiful, it leaves much to be desired in function. The flapper is inflexible and rigid, which makes it difficult to kill the fly without splattering it. Moreover, the wire handle lacks integrity and offers an uncomfortable grip.</p>
<p>Now feast your eyes on this newly-acquired fly-swatter. It&#39;s a thing of beauty.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef0278802d1ac9200d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Screen Shot 2021-05-30 at 5.37.20 PM" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef0278802d1ac9200d image-full img-responsive" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef0278802d1ac9200d-800wi" title="Screen Shot 2021-05-30 at 5.37.20 PM" /></a></p>
<p>Notice the turned hardwood handle (maple, I believe, or possibly birch), perfectly suited to the human hand. The heavy gauge shaft leading to a genuine metal screen flapper. It&#39;s a fly-swatter to savor;&#0160; a classic. Many a graceful swat in it.</p>
<p>An anniversary or a birthday in the offing? Nothing says &quot;I love you&quot; more than a fly-swatter of distinction. It&#39;s also unsurpassed as a wedding present. If you&#39;re in a generous mood, &quot;his&quot; and &quot;hers&quot; fly swatters will get that marriage off to a great start.</p>
