		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>We visited Beardstown, in southwestern Illinois, because it was the birthplace, in 1845, of one of Lynn&#39;s maternal great-grandmothers, Mary St. John DeHaven. Even though it is Lincoln country, we had no idea what to expect, the AAA entry being so scant, but we soon discovered that Beardstown is a place that had its moment of glory sometime in the nineteenth century, but which has allowed history to pass it by. While it&#39;s not entirely derelict, it&#39;s not even slightly prosperous -- nor has it achieved quaintness. The industry of note nowadays is the JBS meat-packing plant out on the Arenzville Road; most of its employees come from south of the border, which is why the only indication that Beardstown might someday be rejuvenated is the dozen or so new downtown taquerias and iglesias.</p>
<p>Our first stop in Beardstown was a decaying, rather pathetic 200-foot long peeling boardwalk along the sandy Illinois River, a waterway which in the years before the Civil War had been a thriving commercial thoroughfare. There we watched a solitary tug struggle to free a barge that had somehow run itself aground. Perhaps the boardwalk had once welcomed visitors and tourists, but during our stay the only spectator beside ourselves was a very frayed out-of-work fellow who arrived on a beaten-up bicycle, and who seemed entirely out of his depth when we asked if there was a place in Beardstown to purchase a cup of coffee. To me, he seemed addled; I suspected meth or opioids.</p>
<p>After gazing at the sluggish river for half an hour (remembering Abraham Lincoln&#39;s enthusiasm for river transport), we toured the few blocks of the old downtown, in which fewer storefronts were occupied than were vacant. We looked in at an antique store -- actually less &quot;antique&quot; than &quot;junque&quot; (unless a flashy bejewelled Elvis Presley doll was a revered artifact of a prior civilization). Lynn purchased an owl-decorated piece of blue porcelain for $5.00. We inquired of the proprietor, Mrs. White, if there were a coffee shop in Beardstown. Patricia White, we soon learned, was a recently retired public school music teacher and a lively lady knowledgeable about all things Beardstownian. I asked her about the intriguing storefront adjacent to hers, which proclaimed itself to be a Grand Opera House. I was skeptical that any sort of grandeur could be found in such dreary town, but I was wrong. Mrs. White generously offered us a tour of the old theater. She warned us that it was in deep disrepair but she said that she and others, led by the local chiropractor, were working diligently towards its restoration. So up a flight of dark stairs we went, and there, lo and behold, was revealed to us the picturesque ruins of what had once been a remarkable structure. Here&#39;s a photograph of the remains of its ornate frescoed ceiling and 20-foot-high windows:</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef0282e103974f200b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Screen Shot 2021-05-22 at 1.24.00 PM" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef0282e103974f200b image-full img-responsive" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef0282e103974f200b-800wi" title="Screen Shot 2021-05-22 at 1.24.00 PM" /></a></p>
<p>The theatre had a well-proportioned stage and had once (before the balcony was pulled down) been able to seat several hundred people. In the littered backstage were the remnants of nineteenth-century traveling shows, including a large painted backdrop of Venetian gondolas, left behind by a company from St. Louis. But the building, though its bones were good, was a wreck: leaks in the roof had caused the ceiling to deteriorate. The auditorium itself had served as a storage area for the overflow merchandise of decades of store owners. It would take a dozen roll-offs and weeks of work just to remove the trash and find the floor. Nevertheless, the Grand Opera House offered us an insight into what Beardstown had been when it was a thriving community. I was so impressed by the theater that I decided to donate my bit to its reconstruction. I had determined on $100 until I noticed that Mrs. White had donned a red white and blue Trump 2020 face mask. And so arose a moral dilemma: I want to support the arts, and I would love to help return the Grand Opera House to its former glory. Opera and music should be beyond politics -- but yet I was deeply repelled by Mrs. White&#39;s Trumpism. So I split the difference and donated $60 to the cause. A sensible compromise to a vexing problem?? I don&#39;t know. But it&#39;s what I did. I wanted to ask Mrs. White what Donald Trump&#39;s ignorance, bigotry, authoritarian predilections and corrupt, vacant life had to offer to a cheerful retired teacher in a decaying midwestern town, but I saw no reason to provoke a controversy.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Afterward, we found some lunch up the street at Sally&#39;s Bistro. The bistro did not live up to &quot;bistro&quot; expectations, and could more honestly be called Sally&#39;s Diner, but it did make a good BLT and almost-decent coffee. We did not try the &quot;alligator bits&quot; for which it is famous, even though Sally assured us that the bits were much better than the usual alligator tail. (Beardstown has an alligator farm but we didn&#39;t tour it.)</p>
<p>Mrs. White had also told us about the &quot;old cemetery&quot; so on a lark we went off to investigate. We wandered about, not expecting much, until we stumbled upon a gravestone which revealed that the late Henry Foster married the late Mary McKeever DeHaven. Lynn doesn&#39;t know precisely who these people are, but there are so many of her family names on the marker -- that of her grandfather, George Foster Massey, her uncle, McKeever Massey, her second cousin, Katherine DeHaven Milligan -- that they must&#0160; be long-departed members of her extended ancestry. Certainly cousins of some degree. <a class="asset-img-link" href="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef026bded33419200c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Screen Shot 2021-05-22 at 6.08.21 AM" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef026bded33419200c image-full img-responsive" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef026bded33419200c-800wi" title="Screen Shot 2021-05-22 at 6.08.21 AM" /></a></p>
<p>We googled Henry T. (for True) Foster and found that he was a pillar of the frontier community of Beardstown. He had immigrated from Maine; Mary from Philadelphia. We were gratified by this unexpected find.&#0160;</p>
<p>On the return trip from Beardstown to Jacksonville, we stopped at Griggsville, which, we were astonished to discover, is the &quot;purple martin capitol of the nation&quot; and the location of the world&#39;s largest purple martin skyscraper. Skeptical?&#0160; Here&#39;s the proof:</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef026bded3959f200c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Screen Shot 2021-05-24 at 5.01.59 AM" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef026bded3959f200c image-full img-responsive" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef026bded3959f200c-800wi" title="Screen Shot 2021-05-24 at 5.01.59 AM" /></a><br />So altogether a most rewarding day.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>From our part of Vermont comes some ghastly news. In a paranoid fit, James Perry Jr. shot and killed Karina, his 38-year-old daughter.</p>
<p>According to the <em>Vermont Digger</em>, our internet newspaper, Perry had been holing up in his home, convinced that &quot;bad guys with guns&quot; were after him. Here&#39;s part of the newspaper account: &quot;Perry said he shot his daughter... as she stood on a landing outside his residence. He told police he was concerned that unknown people were playing &#39;gun games&#39; with him and he asked his daughter not to come to his residence.... He was concerned Karina was being used as a “ploy” by unknown individuals.... For the past couple weeks he has been unable to sleep.... He was sitting on his couch when he saw his daughter at the door. He picked up his 12-gauge shotgun, and could see Karina holding cookies, waving, and trying to open the locked door. ‘I’m just so nervous… and I didn’t want her to come in, and I didn’t want the cookies. I ordered her to stop, and I just, I guess I, pulled the trigger. And then I pulled it more, and then I cut her neck.&#39;&quot; Perry said he believed he used a pocket knife to stab her.</p>
<p>Could there be a more horrific tragedy? A man goes crazy and kills his own daughter.</p>
<p>But yet there&#39;s worse -- in the details that don&#39;t appear in the newspaper. Karina, Jim&#39;s older daughter by his second wife, Phyllis, is divorced and is the mother of four children, who are now left motherless. And Phyllis, Karina&#39;s mother, is ill with a very bad cancer -- so she had to learn, in this last phase of her life, that her ex-husband shot and killed one of their children.&#0160;</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a picture of James Perry Jr. as it appeared in the <em>Digger</em>. He looks like a guy who&#39;s just been cast as a maniac in a chainsaw massacre movie.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef0263e9a2c43b200b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Screen Shot 2021-05-06 at 9.21.42 AM" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef0263e9a2c43b200b img-responsive" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef0263e9a2c43b200b-800wi" title="Screen Shot 2021-05-06 at 9.21.42 AM" /></a></p>
<p>He certainly does not look at all like the Jimmy Perry whom I&#39;ve known for 45 years. Except for the bright blue eyes, he&#39;s unrecognizable.</p>
<p>I remember Jim when he was in his twenties -- a normal guy. Actually he was quite handsome, strong, energetic, well-liked, already skilled with wood and bricks and stones. He built the chimney in our new house and he was a more-than-competent carpenter.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>How could the Jimmy Perry that I knew and admired in the 1970s turn into a man who shoots and kills his own daughter?</p>
<p>Even back then, he drank too much. And used too much marijuana. Sometime in the 1980s, he worked in Wyoming as a roustabout on oil rigs. One day he fell into a vat of what he called &quot;mud&quot; but was a container for the strong chemicals used in the oil drilling process. He was burned neck to ankle and spent close to a year, if I remember correctly, in a hospital -- in severe pain for much of the time. I don&#39;t think he ever fully recovered. His body was a mass of scars. I&#39;m sure that the beer and the drugs and the pain, and possibly the isolation caused by the pandemic, contributed to his derangement. But nothing explains what is fundamentally inexplicable.</p>
<p>I didn&#39;t see much of Jim in the last few years. I&#39;d run into him in Hannaford&#39;s occasionally. He appeared to be many years older than his true age. He was emaciated, sickly-looking. Clearly someone who&#39;d had a hard life. He told me that he didn&#39;t know how long he could continue &quot;crawling on roofs.&quot; The last time I caught sight of him, I confess, I avoided him. I could see even from a distance that he was &quot;off&quot; and I didn&#39;t want to engage with him.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>I don&#39;t mean to excuse Jim. What he did was the worst. I wish that he hadn&#39;t had a shotgun in the house. If he had to be armed, I would have preferred that he shot himself. That would have been bad enough. I hope that he doesn&#39;t regain his sanity, because if he does so, he&#39;ll have to reckon with what he&#39;s done. The guilt will kill him twenty times over.</p>
<p>Jim was an ordinary man, not an evil one. The picture above doesn&#39;t tell the whole story. He was unlucky, and crazed, and something went horribly wrong in his brain. Those of us who are lucky and sane should thank our good fortune, because all of us are vulnerable.</p>
<p>Jim did a lot of work for me in 1978. In the summer of 1979, he came to visit and said that he had gone over his books and discovered that I had overpaid him for about a week of work. News to me -- I had no idea. He said that he couldn&#39;t reimburse the money he owed me, but he would take a few days and build me a nice stone wall -- even then, he was famous for his classy stonework. So together and with the help of my kids we poached a dozen truckloads of stone from some of our many crumbling walls. We picked out a site and he built us about fifty feet of handsome drystone. It&#39;s still there, an ornament to the property. The maker of that wall is the Jimmy Perry, an honest craftsman and a reliable friend, that I prefer to remember, even while I mourn the death of his daughter and regret the abysmal woe that he caused his family.&#0160;&#0160;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Here&#39;s a a handsome old double-weave Jacquard coverlet in all its flowery glory, right there on our very own bed. Extraordinarily decorative, is it not?&#0160; Cotton and wool, and generous with the well-saturated indigo dye. State-of-the-art hand weaving.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef026bdecf6da3200c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Screen Shot 2021-05-03 at 10.07.17 AM" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef026bdecf6da3200c image-full img-responsive" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef026bdecf6da3200c-800wi" title="Screen Shot 2021-05-03 at 10.07.17 AM" /></a></p>
<p>I especially prize this particular coverlet because of its history. It was woven for Charity Maria Laws in 1835, as is plainly evident from the inscription on its &quot;summer&quot; side. I wish the weaver had identified himself as well as his client, but he hasn&#39;t.&#0160;</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef0263e9a21fc1200b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Screen Shot 2021-05-03 at 10.16.38 AM" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef0263e9a21fc1200b image-full img-responsive" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef0263e9a21fc1200b-800wi" title="Screen Shot 2021-05-03 at 10.16.38 AM" /></a></p>
<p>Who is Charity Maria Laws?&#0160; She was a native of a part of Long Island (New York) with which I&#39;m very familiar and where I spent the best three summers of my childhood. She was born in 1822 in Ridge and died in Northport in 1894. Makamah Beach, home to as much fair seed-time for the soul as I experienced, is located within the Northport precincts. Charity Maria was presented with this coverlet when she was thirteen years old -- to keep her warm a&#39; nights, no doubt, but also, as was the custom, to serve as the centerpiece of her trousseau. The coverlet worked its magic because in 1848 Charity Maria was wooed and won by John Gardiner Lewis of neighboring Crab Meadow and bore five children, all of them born in Northport or adjacent Huntington. I have no idea where the coverlet hid out between Maria&#39;s death until it made its re-appearance on ebay last year, but I&#39;m happy to say that it was treated&#0160; very well during that time -- it&#39;s in splendid shape for a textile that&#39;s pushing two hundred.&#0160;</p>
<p>Imagine my surprise, when, a few days ago, a Jacquard coverlet in an identical style appeared on ebay. When I glanced at the pictures, I said, out loud but to no one in particular, I bet that one also hails from my part of Suffolk. It didn&#39;t take an S. Holmes to confirm my speculation.The evidence is as plain as the nose on your face: the exact same lettering, but this time, it&#39;s Harriet Sophia Overton.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef02788026345f200d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Screen Shot 2021-04-27 at 3.33.57 PM" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef02788026345f200d image-full img-responsive" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef02788026345f200d-800wi" title="Screen Shot 2021-04-27 at 3.33.57 PM" /></a></p>
<p>This coverlet is not only inscribed -- It&#39;s dated, too. December 1, 1845. Harriet Sophia Overton herself is not easy to identify. There was a Harriet Sophia in the village or hamlet of Coram, in Suffolk, just a few miles from Northport, but she was born in 1815 and died in 1821 and therefore can&#39;t possibly be the recipient of a coverlet woven in 1845. There must be a second Harriet Sophia. And truly, so there is. The first Harriet Sophia had an older brother, Sheldon Roe Overton, who fathered a girl named after the departed six-year-old. Harriet Sophia Overton II was born in 1850 and died, unmarried, in 1868. Another dead end, alas, because HSO the second was born five years after the coverlet was woven.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>I am forced to speculate that there was still a third Harriet Sophia Overton who was born on December 1, 1845 and didn&#39;t live long enough to get a mention in the story or even earn a gravestone. Harriet Sophia Overton was an unlucky name. Hardly compensated for by the long-lived coverlet.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Despite my love of Northport and environs -- of course I mean the Northport of my memory, the Northport of the 1940s -- I didn&#39;t bid on the Overton coverlet. But I would love to know its story, which I suspect to be one of great sadness.&#0160;</p>

<p>Pictured is a variety of daylily called the Charles Johnston. Looks good, doesn&#39;t it?&#0160; First introduced by Gates in 1981, it won an award of merit 1988 from the American daylily society. I ordered a couple from a nursery in Tennessee because they are VE (very early), tetraploid, fragrant, and reputed to be accomplished re-bloomers (although daylillies that rebloom in the upper south don&#39;t always do so in Vermont). It&#39;s the VE part that interests me because I don&#39;t have any early reds. &quot;Rich burgundy blooms.&quot;&#0160; Sounds delicious. I think I&#39;ll put them in the vegetable garden temporarily, where the soil is, as LERM says, &quot;like chocolate cake&quot; and plant them out in the perfect place, yet to be determined. Somewhere where the large VE blooms can make a statement.</p>
<p>I wonder how my gardens survived my Covid 2020 absence. We&#39;ll find out in three weeks.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Interviewing ten candidate a day for a couple of days can make a guy a little crazy. On the one hand, you owe each candidate your thoughtful attention, because careers are at stake. But conducting interviews is a tedious process and everyone who has ever done it knows that faces and voices and attitudes tend to blur into an indistinguishable lumpy mass. So much earnestness! So much contrived presentation of self!&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>I remember one such endless day in a featureless room in a high floor of a pretentious modern hotel in Chicago, or Atlanta, or perhaps Houston. We were making an appointment to our budding &quot;Writing Program&quot; -- an academic innovation that I now believe to have been a total disaster. Writing Programs hired &quot;writing specialists&quot; -- experimentalist social scientists who believe in &quot;theory&quot; and who generally can&#39;t themselves write a lick. Or half a lick.</p>
<p>I remember one candidate with whom I had this remarkable exchange:&#0160;</p>
<p>Me:&#0160; &quot;Could you remind me about the subject of your dissertation.&quot;</p>
<p>He:&#0160; &quot;I worked with the Brown Corpus.&quot;</p>
<p>Me (astonished): &quot;What the heck is the Brown Corpus.&quot;</p>
<p>He:&#0160; &quot;It&#39;s a computer file of one million edited words drawn from magazines and newspapers. It was compiled at Brown University. The idea is to study the English language as it actually written.&quot;</p>
<p>(I interrupt this conversation to say that &quot;Brown Corpus&quot; may be the most injudiciously-named academic enterprise in history. To me, &quot;brown corpus&quot; might have something to do with decayed corpuscles, or a fecal mass, or someone or something a-mouldering in its grave. Not a phrase with much poetry to it. But let us proceed.)</p>
<p>Me: &quot;That seems interesting. What exactly did you study in this corpus.&quot;</p>
<p>He: &quot;I studied the use of the comma.&quot;</p>
<p>Me: &quot;The comma. You studied the comma.&quot; (More astonishment). &quot;What in the world did you learn about the comma?</p>
<p>He:&#0160; &quot;I learned that the comma is used to link a sequence of nouns, or phrases, in a series.&quot;</p>
<p>I was already giddy and aghast when I heard this news and I had a sudden revelation, a flash. I saw myself picking up the candidate and throwing him through the plate glass window and watching as he plummeted painfully to the street below. But I controlled myself and thanked the candidate and, I believe, ended the interview politely. I didn&#39;t even indulge myself with something snarky, like, &quot;do you intend to do any follow-up work on a more challenging mark of punctuation, as for example the exclamation point?&quot;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I can remember five near misses -- five times when through inattentive or incompetent driving I put my own and others&#39; lives at risk. I give thanks that I avoided killing or mangling myself or the innocent victims of my failings. What wondrous life is this I lead -- how fortunate I have been!</p>
<p>The first: it was 1963. I was an inexperienced, overconfident driver, traveling westward, somewhere in southern Illinois. My first cross-country trip. A two-lane highway, a downpour, very wet pavement. I saw, or thought i saw, an oncoming car in my lane. There would have been plenty of time for him to pass and dive back, but I panicked and braked hard. My vehicle, an old Rambler, not a great handler in the best of times, swerved into the oncoming lane, then spun out of control and landed backward in a ditch on the right side of the road. We sat there, stunned, relieved, because I had been in the left oncoming lane long enough to have killed ourselves self and others. (Within a minute, a man pulled up in a truck, attached a chain to our car and winched us out. I&#39;m perpetually grateful to this Samaritan.)</p>
<p>A second instance: an icy winter day in Boulder, early 1970s. Driving the old yellow Saab with my sister Phyllis (legally, sister-in-law) in the &quot;death seat&quot; east on Arapahoe, I hit a slick of black ice and made a bad situation worse by applying the brakes. The car spun out of control and eventually halted facing backwards in the oncoming lane. Once again, no one injured or even inconvenienced.</p>
<p>Another: driving across the USA alone in the clunky blue Camry, doing 80 in a 55 zone, I didn&#39;t quite fall asleep at the wheel but certainly lost focus, and didn&#39;t see a car stopped in the parking lane until I was just adjacent to it. If I had been a bit to the right or if there had been someone fixing a tire, I would have crippled myself and murdered an innocent. Here&#39;s another one, probably the most idiotic. Driving alone through Chicago in heavy traffic, on one of those horrible highways where there are eight lanes east and another eight west, I found myself in the third lane from the right and needed to exit right. Instead of playing it safe, and continuing on, I impulsively dove across two lanes and made it to the exit. Angry horns to the right of me, horns to the left of me. Why did I take such a risk? I don&#39;t know but I thank the drivers around me for being alert. What arrogance, what stupidity! The most recent event, and most inexcusable, happened just a few years ago. I was returning home from a very disturbing visit to the &quot;memory care&quot; facility. Somehow, in my grief, I ignored a prominent red light and sailed right through a busy intersection -- a gross violation of sense and law. But there was no crash and no police and I proceeded blithely on my way -- only, after a few moments, realizing with shock and horror that I had put my own life and that of others at completely unnecessary danger.</p>
<p>When people two hundred years from now look back on our &quot;civilization&quot; -- assuming that there will be people on this planet two hundred years from now, which is not a certainty -- they will wonder how was it possible that those people in our century were able to survive. Dashing 70 or 80 miles an hour in a tin can just six feet from a line of onrushing tin cans? Weaving among giant tandem trucks and buses and cement mixers -- and expecting to survive. What sort of brave or foolhardy individuals were these strange, death-defying people?</p>
<p>For myself, I&#39;m astonished at the dumb luck that&#39;s allowed me to preserve my life and mobility to this advanced age. So far, that is. It&#39;s not over until it&#39;s over.&#0160;&#0160;</p>

                                <p>Although both my parents were dependent on their morning coffee <a class="asset-img-link" href="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef026bdec8f66a200c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Screen Shot 2021-04-04 at 11.35.39 AM" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef026bdec8f66a200c image-full img-responsive" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef026bdec8f66a200c-800wi" title="Screen Shot 2021-04-04 at 11.35.39 AM" /></a></p>
<p>percolated out of a can like this one, I myself never touched the stuff until my first year at college. In the 1950s, coffee was 10 cents a cup and I drank gallons of it, morning, noon and night. It became essential to my well-being. Black, no sugar or milk, but in truth, not black but barely brown, weak by present standards. In the early 60s my hipper than I -- not much of a leap --&#0160; friend SDS introduced me to the coffee shop. Figaro in Greenwich Village, mighty sophisticated for a boy from Flatbush. I became addicted to coffee shops as well as coffee itself for many a year. I couldn&#39;t handle any routine paperwork, or indeed grade a tedious set of papers without infusions of caffeine. With the Starbuck&#39;s revolution, coffee became tastier and more luxurious. But, conservative as I was, I never succumbed to fancy drinks but kept to what had come to be known simply and condescendingly as &quot;Americano.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>During these thirty-five or so years of pleasant coffee dependence, atrial fibrillation became an annoying feature of my life. Frequent bouts, longer and longer. Debilitating, possibly dangerous -- there&#39;s a strong association of fibrillation with strokes. Finally, a doctor suggested that I might consider giving up caffeine. So I stopped on a dime. It took six weeks to get the caffeine out of my blood and put an end to the longing for coffee -- but the atrial fibrillation came to a total halt. Ceased. Not a single episode these last two and a half decades. Astonishing. I had been poisoning myself -- or at least, compromising my well being.</p>
<p>Do I miss coffee? Yes, I&#39;m afraid so, every morning. I still love the odor (which was always better than the taste). More than that, I miss the society of coffee cup and conversation. In those days, I loved to sit with a book in a nook, warming my palm with a bottomless cup. Once, only once, about two years ago, I did venture to order a medium Americano -- but I couldn&#39;t stomach more than a couple of sips. Coffee&#39;s an acquired taste, and one that I had I de-acquired.&#0160;</p>
<p>Tea? I haven&#39;t found one that is more than barely tolerable. Hot chocolate? Feels juvenile. Acceptable for breakfast but not for Peet&#39;s or Ozo or Starbuck&#39;s or the Trident.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>On the other hand, a heart that keeps to a regular rhythm and doesn&#39;t go creatively syncopated several times a week is also a pleasure.</p>

                                <p>Sometime during the hippie period, say the early 1970s, I&#0160; was driving the big green Dodge station wagon solo from who knows where to somewhere else, and as was my custom in those turbulent days, I picked up a hitchhiker -- a mighty scrawny young guy. He seemed to be in bad shape -- underfed and dirty. I suspected &quot;speed.&quot; Compassionately, I offered him a piece of my sandwich. He turned me down, saying, &quot;I don&#39;t <em>use w</em>hite bread.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>What an effective sentence! In a mere five words,&#0160; he managed to claim complete moral superiority over me. I was now dismissed as a &quot;user&quot; of white bread. and therefore clearly an unenlightened conformist bourgeois -- probably a rabid supporter of the carpet bombing of Cambodia. He, on the other hand, was a butterfly, free and liberated and a dissenter from the Loathed Establishment.</p>
<p>But I don&#39;t think I would remember this incident if it weren&#39;t for his deployment of the word &quot;use.&quot; &quot;Use&quot; asserts an equivalence between two habits -- between whatever cocktail of drugs that he might be injecting or snorting or dropping, and the white bread that I was consuming. It was also implied that my addiction was the worser one. My emaciated pal was, in his own mind, doing me a favor, enlightening me about the depravity of my bread habit.&#0160;</p>
<p>But let me say a word in defense of the bread -- I don&#39;t &quot;use&quot; white bread in the sense of Silvercup or Wonder Bread -- at least not since I left Flatbush neighborhood of origin. The slices of bread in question might not have been made of steelcut handmilled wheat berries enhanced with millet and quinoa and baked in a hickory-fired furnace, but it would have been a perfectly respectable bread and one that should not have been denigrated by a skinny tie-dyed trust fund baby soon to shave his scraggly beard and rejoin his father&#39;s insurance business.</p>
<p>But I sure do admire his use of the verb &quot;use.&quot;</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a more recent incident. On the semi-famous Boulder Mall, not long ago, a panhandler carrying a sign that said, &quot;Anything Helps&quot; held out his hand.&#0160; Compassionately, I gave him a quarter.&#0160; He returned it to me, announcing, &quot;I don&#39;t <em>take </em>coins.&quot;</p>
<p>Well, everybody has to have standards.&#0160;</p>
<p>Once again, I&#39;ve been put in my place by a verb. &quot;I don&#39;t&#0160;<em>take&#0160;</em>coins.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>A third instance: I was in Boston and I wandered into a ragged antique store that sold old and truly ancient Chinese art. The place is a mess but I notice that the goods are museum-quality -- sculptures, mostly, but paintings and even a few bronze pieces -- Neolithic for all I know.&#0160; Way out of the range of my wallet or checkbook. Trying to appear knowledgeable, I ask the proprietor if he has any Green Fitzhugh. Peering over lunettes, he says, with aggrieved condescension, &quot;I don&#39;t <em>do&#0160;</em>export.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Floored again. Put in my place by Mr. Hippie, Mr. Panhandler, and Mr. Antique Dealer -- all of them master practitioners who know how to make a simple monosyllabic verb do a heck of a lot of snobbish work.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>(This entry is written for my grandchildren and any subsequent descendants, should there by any, who might like to know how and where their brain anomalies originated. Whether they will revere or curse me for what I&#39;ve bequeathed them, I&#39;ll never know. Just as well. The further they are removed from me, the less they have to worry, for I&#39;m only a one-fourth donor to my grandchildren, only an eighth to the greats. With progressive diminishment they have less and less reason to be concerned. But they&#39;ll never arrive at zero --there&#39;s no escape from me or from a genetic Zeno&#39;s Paradox.]</p>
<p>I&#39;ve lived with this brain for 80-plus years now and have a pretty good idea of its strengths and weaknesses and peculiarities. I&#39;ll try be candid about the poor pink mass.</p>
<p>I have a very good memory but little capacity for synthesis or organization. I imagine that the contents of my brain look like the last scene of <em>Citizen Kan</em>e. A warehouse of stuff strewn in heaps, nothing organized, everything disorderly and random. A great twisted miscellany of jumbled information. Nothing where it should be, everything a mess. I &quot;know&quot; lots of facts and data, but I&#39;ve never had the capacity to make sense of them. When I read, for example, a well-organized book of history, I&#39;m regularly dazzled by authors who are able to discover and explain patterns of change or to compare one century or one civilization with another. My brain can&#39;t do such things -- or anything remotely similar, even at a much lower order of achievement .&#0160;</p>
<p>I have almost no imagination or creativity. Over the year I&#39;ve tried to write stories and poetry, but the stuff that emerges from my brain is piss poor. I&#39;m only comfortable dealing with facts and evidence. When I&#39;m asked to invent stuff, to make things up, I falter badly. I&#39;m reminded that when I was a youth in college, many of my friends enrolled for courses in &quot;Creative Writing.&quot; I couldn&#39;t take such a risk -- creative writing terrified me. I was conscious, even then, of my total want of invention or artistry. On the other hand, I&#39;m quite a good detective. I can follow clues. I&#39;m a good researcher. Strange to say, though I&#39;m without imagination in real life, I experience spectacularly fanciful dreams. There&#39;s hardly a night goes by that I&#39;m not transported to some vividly brilliant alternative world. Why can&#39;t I access my nighttime imagination during the waking hours?&#0160; I could have been a pillar of neo-surrealism.&#0160;</p>
<p>I&#39;m good at arithmetic but a total bust at mathematics. I can do mental arithmetic much better than most -- add, subtract, multiply, or divide quickly and accurately without pen or paper. But once things become even the slightest bit abstract, I go blank. When there is something to count, I&#39;m your man; when there&#39;s something to extrapolate or imagine, no go.&#0160;</p>
<p>I have a strong aesthetic sense, especially about visual beauty. Museums or gardens can move me almost to a swoon. I&#39;ve even experienced Stendhal syndrome a few times. Majestic mountains and spacious landscapes move me less than a well-designed garden. Yet my delight in human artistic achievement does not cross over into anything that might be called spirituality (as it does for many people). I entirely lack what Charlotte Bronte called the &quot;organ of veneration.&quot;</p>
<p>I have a woeful disabling case of directional dyslexia -- worse than anyone I&#39;ve ever known except my younger brother. I can&#39;t follow directions and I get lost even in familiar territory. I believe that my inability with left right east west (I&#39;m brilliant with up and down!) has contributed to my general lack of daring. Inasmuch as I&#39;ve always been afraid to go a step too far in space, I became too cautious to strike out intellectually. Perhaps my inability with directions is also tied up with my sometimes disabling shyness -- but that&#39;s a guess. I do know that it&#39;s the reason that I am regularly bested a jigsaw puzzles by five-year-olds -- I can&#39;t deduce the relationship between pieces.&#0160;</p>
<p>I&#39;m not prone to guilt but I&#39;m devastated by shame. I suppose I would feel guilt if I killed or harmed someone, but I&#39;ve never done much in the pure villainy line. Though largely guilt-free, I suffer dreadfully from embarrassment. I think that I&#39;ve retained in my memory every foolish fatuous pretentious thing I&#39;ve ever said or done. I live with a highly punishing shame superego -- which is good, because it limits the number of times in which I might make an egregious fool of myself, but it&#39;s bad because it&#39;s kept me from taking risks that might have been productive or liberating or just simply pleasurable.</p>
<p>I have a good sense of humor. I can occasionally be witty. I also appreciate the wit of others. I&#39;ve learned, over the years, not to be witty at others&#39; expense. I&#39;m articulate and occasionally, but rarely, eloquent.</p>
<p>I&#39;m observant. When I walk in the woods, or walk down the street, I see and interpret more clearly than most people. Sherlock said, &quot;You see but you do not observe.&quot; I&#39;m no Holmes, but I do observe. Perhaps it&#39;s false pride but I think that I &quot;read&quot; people pretty well. And I read relationships well. I&#39;m curious about people and about things, which is why I am happier reading non-fiction rather than fiction. I&#39;m more interested in the facts than in &quot;make-believe.&quot;&#0160; An odd admission for a person who spent a lifetime teaching and studying literature.</p>
<p>I&#39;m a good listener.</p>
<p>I love music but I have as inadequate a sense of rhythm as anyone on earth. My dancing is pathetic and ludicrous. My sense of rhythm is so bad that as a youth I could never learn to pump a swing -- even though in bat and ball games I was a passable schoolyard athlete.&#0160;</p>
<p>I&#39;m impatient, easily bored. If I don&#39;t get it quickly, I&#39;m liable to give up. But there have been times in my life when I worked with admirable perseverance and diligence. Not often enough.</p>
<p>I&#39;m fascinated by language and know more than most people about the way languages are structured and how they work. I read foreign languages pretty well. At the same time, I have no ear for sound. My hearing is now very bad, except when I turn the apparatus up to 11, but even in my youth I didn&#39;t easily distinguish &quot;t&quot; from &quot;d&quot; or &quot;v&quot; from &quot;b.&quot; I seem to have to see the word in my head before I can understand or translate it. I was good at the ancient languages because they made no demand on ear or tongue. French was a trial because the sounds were so distant from their spelling. In English, I&#39;m an excellent speller.</p>
<p>At this point in my life I&#39;m more conscious of the deficiencies of my brain than of its strengths. I feel fortunate that I had a strong memory, a feel for language, and a decent prose style, and that those few traits were enough to let me live a respectable life and make a decent living. But I also know that many people perform a multitude of tasks without strain that are a torment and a struggle for me. Which has kept me appropriately modest.&#0160;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef0263e9902577200b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Screen Shot 2021-02-14 at 5.23.04 PM" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef0263e9902577200b image-full img-responsive" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef0263e9902577200b-800wi" title="Screen Shot 2021-02-14 at 5.23.04 PM" /></a></p>
<p>A coverlet is not a small cover. The &quot;let&quot; is not a diminutive -- it&#39;s let as in copire lectum (L) or &quot;cuivre lit&quot; (Fr).&#0160; A bedcover. Neither a blanket nor a bedspread, but both -- a decorative but warm item of bedclothes.</p>
<p>&quot;Jacquard&quot; refers to the Jacquard attachment, which was a series of punchcards (the ancestor of the IBM cards) that controlled the weaving and allowed a skilled workman to produce complicated patterns relatively inexpensively. Jacquard coverlets were produced in large quantities (about 700 craftsmen are known) in villages and small towns in the US between about 1820 and the coming of the Civil War. Weavers were mostly immigrants from the old country whose skills had already been rendered obsolete by factory-based manufacture. Weaving was a cottage industry -- many weavers wove in the winter, farmed in the summer.</p>
<p>This coverlet was woven by Benjamin Hausman of Allentown, Pennsylvania, in 1842 -- it says so in the &quot;corner block.&quot; It&#39;s in amazingly good shape for a weaving that&#39;s 180 years old. The colors, especially the madder red and indigo blue wool, are still vivid. The coverlet is impressive and beautiful and keeps us mighty toasty at night.&#0160;</p>

<p>From August 1976 to summer 1977, we lived at this odd, modernistic house at 1 Leycroft Close in Canterbury, Kent. The small tree, something in the prunus line, wasn&#39;t there at the time so the house was more visible. The house wasn&#39;t suitable for a family of five, but we made it work, barely. Two blocks away was St. Stephen Protomartyr School, which the kids attended for a year. The boys learned to play soccer and the daughter learned how to speak with an English accent, which she forsook after two weeks back in the USA. The abandoned railroad embankment behind the house, loaded with blackberries and wild plums, afforded the kids much amusement.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Until this last week, when I read Patrik Svensson&#39;s<em> Book of Eels</em> (2019), I had never encountered either of these lovely and mysterious adjectives. I&#39;m delighted to add &quot;anadromous&quot; and <br />&quot;catadromous,&quot; along with their cousin &quot;diadromous&quot; to my vocabulary, though when I&#39;ll be able to drop any of these words into my quotidian or even hebdomadal discourse is not immediately obvious, especially inasmuch as I&#39;m not all that confident about their accentuation. Moreover, I rarely get into heart-to-hearts about icthyic migration.&#0160;</p>
<p>Anadromous fishes hatch and spend their first months in freshwater streams and rivers but then they migrate to the vasty deep, where they grow and mature. When they feel ready, they return to the streams in which they were spawned to deposit and fertilize their eggs. Salmons are famously anadromous (as well as romantic and celebrated), but equally so are less-heralded smelt, herring, and shad. Eels, on the other hand, are catadromous. They are hatched deep in the ocean and then drift and wander to freshwater streams and rivers. European eels may spend, according to Svensson, as many as fifteen years in the shallows until they get the urge for going. No one knows what calls to them, but they plain have to go. Then they set out for the dangerous Sargasso Sea in the mid-Atlantic. Eel reproduction has entirely evaded the eyes of human investigators.&#0160; Nor has a single eel egg ever been identified. Eels are modest, private, discreet. No one&#0160; knows if or how eels select their mates. Do they enact elaborate courtship rituals, or do the females simply lay their putative eggs amidst a cloud of eelish milt?</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef027880153e06200d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Screen Shot 2021-02-14 at 9.13.13 AM" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef027880153e06200d image-full img-responsive" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef027880153e06200d-800wi" title="Screen Shot 2021-02-14 at 9.13.13 AM" /></a></p>
<p>Eels are not kosher, but not because they are catadromous. The rules, as set out in <em>Leviticus,</em> are very clear: &quot;<em>Everything in the waters that has fins and scales, whether in the seas or in the rivers, you may eat. But anything in the seas or the rivers that has not fins and scales is detestable to you.&quot;&#0160;</em> Why the Lord of Hosts set His face against shrimp and clams is unknowable -- but it worked, in the sense that the religion survived and, some say, prospered for lo these three thousand years. Food taboos are a common feature of religions -- they help to separate<em> us</em> from <em>them. </em>But shouldn&#39;t taboos be minimally consistent?&#0160; If the author or authors of <em>Leviticus&#0160;</em>had said, don&#39;t eat eels, they&#39;re slimy, ugly and tasteless to boot -- well that would be a religious prohibition I could honor. But the scales thing, I don&#39;t know, because it&#39;s now clear that eels do have scales (as well as fins). Eel scales are very small. They are embedded in the skin, and they are smothered with eel slime. They are difficult to find, but they&#39;re definitely, unquestionably present. Yet the authorities continue to deride eels as <em>treyf </em>and have added the distinctly unBiblical gloss that the fish&#39;s scales must be visible and detachable without harming the skin. Unjust to eels, I say. I think they deserve a retrospective pass and a full rabbinical apology.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>My reasons for not eating eels are plain and sincere: eels are hideous beasts. Even Svensson, who loves eels and eel-fishing, admits that they are loathsome to any sensible palate.&#0160;</p>
<p>Query: my daughter was born and lived here in her home town until she was eighteen years old. Then she left for California, where she birthed and raised her two fine children. Now she&#39;s returned home to her native streams at last. So is she catadromous or anadromous?</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>In September of 2014 I wrote about a horrible tragedy that is commemorated in our cemetery -- the old West Bradford cemetery on Hackett Hill Road. Inasmuch as I&#39;ve lived adjacent to it these last 52 years, I feel a strange proprietary connection to the people it houses. I&#39;ve wandered in it, tended it, studied it, and cleaned up the trash left behind by visitors. I know that old burial ground very well.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s what I wrote seven years ago:&#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;The old West Bradford cemetery, which is carved out of our land, is peopled by the Worthleys, Hacketts, Kidders, and Sleepers who first settled this part of Vermont. Some of them were long lived, some wandered through this thoroughfare of woe only briefly. There are o-so-many of those sad stone lozenges at the foot of a grave that represent infants who died too young to be christened.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Our most disturbing gravestone, in my opinion, is the the one for Stanley Franklin Dwinell, M.D., born in 1920 and who died along with James Scott Dwinell (age 7), Peter Dewey Dwinell (age 6), and Jonathan Dwinell (age 2) all on the same day, December 11, 1952.&#0160;&#0160;What a horror, I thought -- a man and his three young sons all gone at once. A tragedy. But what sort?&#0160; A plane crash?&#0160; A boating accident? House fire?&#0160; Perhaps even an infectious disease.&#0160;</p>
<p>An internet search came up empty-handed, so I enquired of our longer-tenured neighbors. Here&#39;s the local legend as it was reported to me. &quot;Oh yes, the vet,&quot; I was told (although the tombstone distinctly says M. D., rather than D. V. M). &#0160;&quot;He was driving along Route 5 in Fairlee one winter morning and it was an icy road and foggy and he went out of control and all four of them died instantly. His wife was at home drinking a cup of coffee when she got the phone call. She left the coffee half-finished on the kitchen table, left the house without a word, and was never seen again. Didn&#39;t even take her clothes. Just disappeared.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>It&#39;s a dramatic, heartbreaking story that sounds like the plot of a short story by Alice Munro -- but I don&#39;t believe it, not a word of it. The same gravestone that records the four simultaneous deaths also asserts that Constance S. Dwinell, wife of Doctor Stanley Franklin Dwinell, died January 25, 1985, at age 65.&#0160;</p>
<p>I&#39;m trying to imagine the remainder of poor Constance&#39;s&#0160;life. It&#39;s hard to construct a scenario that isn&#39;t completely dreadful.&#0160;Most likely, Constance returned, shattered, to the small town in New Hampshire, let us say, where she must have been born.&#0160;She moved back into her parents&#39; house and took a job as a town librarian, her life blighted by the&#0160;tragedy.&#0160;She never remarried.</p>
<p>But I prefer to imagine that after a period of intense mourning, she moved to Paris (she had majored in French at Wellesley, I&#39;m guessing,) and never told a soul about her first family. There she was wooed and won by Baron Guy de Condorcet de Noialles but could never conceive a child. It was a long happy marriage. After Guy died, crashing his motorcycle on a winding Riviera road, she returned to the States a rich woman, and lived out her life in a Park Avenue apartment in New York. Friends and neighbors who had no idea of her first life were shocked when they read the will which specified that she be buried, along side Stanley and the children, right here in West Bradford.&#0160;</p>
<p>That&#39;s my story and I&#39;m sticking with it though I would very much like to know the truth.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Then a year later, I was contacted by Larry Coffin, president of the Bradford Historical Society. My local informant, it turns out, was all wrong about the circumstances of the accident. Mr Coffin wrote this: &quot;I would like to correct your information on Dr. Stanley Dwinell. He and his three sons were killed in a collision with a train on a crossing in Newbury, VT as he was going to treat a patient at Woodsville (NH) Cottage Hospital. His father Dr. Franklin Dwinell was in a car following.&quot;&#0160; Mr. Coffin did not comment on the half-finished coffee cup.</p>
<p>[February 11, 2021.&#0160; I&#39;ve now received the following communication from a correspondent who calls him/herself &quot;R&quot;. He or she is a &quot;descendant of Stanley&#39;s brother&quot; and has sent me the link to this article In the <em>Rutland Daily Herald.&#0160;&#0160;</em>How could I have missed it?</p>

<p>So that&#39;s a slightly different version of the horrible story. The details are different, but it&#39;s the same story in essence.</p>
<p>&quot;R&quot; also refers me to a letter in the <em>Bradford Opinion</em> by attorney Bud Otterman of Otterman and Allen. It offers other details from the prior accounts but it&#39;s no less tragic. &quot;Franklin Dwinell was a a longtime doctor in Bradford when I opened my law office in 1951. His son, Dr. Stanley Dwinell, had come home from World War II and joined his father&#39;s practice.Their patients went to the old Cottage Hospital near the railroad tracks in Woodsville. One of the doctors would visit their patients each morning. When Stanley went, he would often take his three pre-school sons with him. They would play in the waiting room while their dad made his rounds. The morning of December 11, 1952 was overcast with cold rain and snow in the air. About 11:30 am Dr Franklin Dwinell was called to an accident at the grade crossing south of Newbury Village. When he arrived, he found his son and his three grandson dead as a result of a collision with a southbound train. There were no warning lights at the crossing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;R&quot; also says that Constance (Stanley&#39;s wife and the mother of Dwinell children) &quot;wasn&#39;t alone after Stanley and the boys passed. They had an older daughter who was 7 and in school at the time of the accident. She&#39;s moved away from the area and is reportedly somewhere out west now.&quot;</p>
<p>The older daughter, Hannah Dwinell, would therefore be 76 years old, as I write this, if she is still alive. I feel for her. She had to overcome the loss of her father and three younger brothers. Such an event would leave an irremediable scar. I hope Hannah has had a good life. I wonder if she has ever returned to West Bradford. It would be most painful for her to do so.&#0160;</p>
<p>[I&#39;ve also written about &quot;my&quot; cemetery <a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2009/09/plastic-flowers.html">here</a>.]</p>

                                <p>What an excellent invention! Imagine life without the blanket. At night, we&#39;d still be keeping warm with hay and leaves. Yeesh, defective insulation. Hay and hayseeds in our noses and mouths. Leaves, leaflets, thick main ribs and petioles poking and imprinting our skin. Constant renewal problems: &quot;Have remembered to fetch the hay for tonight yet?&quot; Cleanliness problems -- small insects in the hay and leaves, however carefully processed. And then frequent trips to &quot;Hay and Leaves&quot; -- the chain of stores that dominates the market. &quot;Do you know what they&#39;re asking this year for a half bale of leaves?&quot;</p>
<p>When we pull that luxurious blanket over our shoulders, do we remember to thank the inventor or inventors of the cotton or woolen blanket?&#0160; Are we sufficiently appreciative of the luxury in which we live?</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I was on a rubber raft in the middle of an ocean.&#0160; Three or four swordfish surrounded me. They were about to spear my raft and drown me -- because they wanted my pension.</p>
<p>I wondered how I was to transfer my wealth to them -- could they take it out in small, edible fish?</p>
<p>And so my dreamatorium continues to exceed expectations.</p>
<p>[February 13.&#0160; Still another &quot;I am lost&quot; dream, but this one with an unusual feature. I am at a subway kiosk, trying to get a token or change for a $20 bill so I can board the train, and the attendant says to me, &quot;do you want your change in money or in spaghetti?&quot; Honest to Pete, that&#39;s what she said. I say, of course, &quot;I&#39;ll have it in money, please,&quot; but nevertheless she hands me a pound of dry spaghetti, wrapped in cellophane or plastic, but already falling apart. I walk away with the pound of spaghetti and try to get rid of it by placing it on a window ledge, but a passer-by retrieves it and hands it back to me. &quot;You forgot your spaghetti,&quot; he says. Soon after I find a garbage can and stow the spaghetti, and the dream continues in predictable channels.<br /><br /></p>
<p>I think the question, &quot;Do you want your change in money or in spaghetti?&quot; is one of the best sentences my dreamatorium has ever generated.]</p>

Keep your eye on the ball.&quot;&#0160; &quot;Never be embarrassed to accept a favor from a friend.

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>The coronavirus has been sorely inhibiting. It&#39;s no fun for me to keep a distance from members of my family with whom I&#39;m not podded up. But there&#39;s a benefit, because for a year now I haven&#39;t had a single anxiety attack over what a European acquaintance calls &quot;the dreaded American hug.&quot;&#0160; My needs for acknowledging friends and acquaintances have been well satisfied by an occasional and discreet elbow bump.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>I&#39;m not a hugger either by nature or by training -- my family of origin was, well, whatever is the diametrical opposite of &quot;touchy?&quot;</p>
<p>When did the hug creep into our lives? I suspect it had its origins in late 60s early 70s counter-culture. At least in my social circles -- that is. For all I know, the Brewsters might have regularly hugged the Bradfords back there in Mayflower days. Although not without massive attacks of disabling guilt.</p>
<p>When males want to hug me, I tend to shrink backwards. I don&#39;t want to give offense, so I offer as much hug as my hug-averse nature can tolerate. With women it&#39;s much more difficult -- because of the bosom problem. Too quick an embrace and you&#39;re unsociable, but one that lasts a second too long and you&#39;re a pervert. The best solution, I&#39;ve found, is the sideways hug -- just throw an arm around the lady&#39;s shoulder and briefly touch your right ribcase to her left. And then beat a retreat.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s bring back the straight-on traditional handshake. It&#39;s sensible and proven. And for goodness sake, no kissing each other&#39;s cheeks &quot;like them foreigners do.&quot;</p>

                                <p>It&#39;s been a rough year what with the madman president and the covid pandemic. And also deaths and diseases among my close friends. I have at least ten male friends who&#39;ve lost their wives after long marriages. Some have bounced back, some will never get over the grief. At the beginning of 2020, I made a joke:&#0160; &quot;it&#39;s going to be the year of the ophthalmologist.&quot; It turned out to be the year of the thanatologist.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I can honestly say that my dominant mood is one of gratitude.</p>
<p>Grateful that I&#39;ve lived a long life, mostly healthily, and that my children and grandchildren are thriving. I&#39;m not rich, but I&#39;ve never missed a meal for want of cash.&#0160;</p>
<p>When my father was my age, he was crippled with arthritis and he was widowed, living a sad solitary life. I take long walks in the mountains and have a new love in my life.</p>
<p>As of today, 1.1 million Americans have been vaccinated against the virus. There will be errors and disruptions and scandals, but in a few months we&#39;ll be mostly back to normal. And I believe and hope that our wonderful country will survive this accidental lunatic presidency.</p>

                                <p>Once again, I was lost, this time in a strange city -- apparently, I was trying to drive from somewhere down south all the way to Vermont.&#0160; We park the car and my companion (a guy totally unknown to me, by the way) asks a traffic cop the name of the city at which we&#39;ve arrived. The policeman says to my friend, &quot;ay, ya&quot; and my friend says to me, and I quote this lunatic absurdity absolutely <em>verbatim</em>, no embroidery whatsoever, &#39;He says we&#39;re in&#0160; ay-ya, which is West Indian for New Brunswick, New Jersey.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <div>Along with everyone of my generation, I&#39;ve been worrying about my deteriorating memory. There are these horrible moments. I stand in front of the open refrigerator, wondering what I&#39;m doing there and for what I&#39;m searching. Or I go the market and then forget to bring the groceries in from the car -- that sort of thing. Is it normal deterioration or is it pathological?</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>So I&#39;m happy to bring some good news -- no, remarkable news from the memory front.</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>A couple of nights ago, Miss Reynolds and I watched the worst movie we&#39;ve seen in many a year. It&#39;s called <em>Johnny Guitar,</em> a it&#39;s a &quot;western&quot; perpetrated in 1954. It&#39;s an unholy mess of pretentious but incoherent plot, absurd characters, goofy dialogue and atrocious acting. We watched it right to the end because it was so bad bad bad that it became amusing. The film is so beyond crappy that it has been praised as authentically American by both Godard and Truffaut.</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>About three-quarters of the way through, I said to Miss Reynolds that the actor who played the villainous &quot;Dancin&#39; Kid&quot; -- his name, no joke, and he actually performs a few steps with Mercedes McCambridge, who if overacting were a crime, would have served a life sentence in a supermax facility -- that the actor, billed as &quot;Scott Brady&quot; looked a lot like Lawrence Tierney, a no-longer-remembered &quot;heavy&quot; who had starred in &quot;Born to Kill&quot; (1947), which we had watched a couple of months ago.</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>Let me burnish this feat. I proposed that so-called &quot;Scott Brady&quot; resembled Lawrence Tierney. What a remarkable and daring assertion!&#0160;</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>So after <em>Johnny Guitar&#0160;</em>came to its ludicrous conclusion, bullets flying everywhere, I looked up so-called &quot;Scott Brady,&quot; the &quot;Dancin&#39; Kid,&quot; on Wikipedia&#0160; and discovered that his birth name was Gerard Tierney and that he was indeed the younger brother of Lawrence Tierney.&#0160;</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>I got to say I spent a few minutes crowing. I mean, really, noticing the resemblance and recalling the name of an obscure actor whom we had hardly noticed months ago -- what a coup! What a feat! I could hear the hallelujahs ring throughout our valley.</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>I didn&#39;t think that Miss Reynolds was sufficiently effusive in praise of my achievement -- although she did her best -- so I went to the window, opened it and shouted into the street, very loud, these words: &quot;In <em>Johnny Guitar</em>, Scott Brady is Lawrence Tierney&#39;s younger brother Gerard.&quot; No doubt putting the Governor&#39;s security detail on Code Red alert.</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>After a few minutes, I wanted to do it again, but Miss R. talked me down.</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>The next day, I bragged to my children and their spouses about my achievement. One of my daughters-in-law, CKNC, wrote back that on reading my news, she went to her front door, opened it, and shouted, &quot;My father-in-law knew that in J<em>ohnny Guitar</em>, the actor Scott Brady is Lawrence Tierney&#39;s younger brother Gerard.&quot;&#0160; An entirely appropriate and measured response on her part, in my opinion.</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>My point is that a guy who can identify Lawrence Tierney&#39;s brother shouldn&#39;t worry about brain decay for at least a month or two.&#0160;</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>I don&#39;t know in what part of the brain information about Lawrence Tierney is stored. Certainly not the part that doesn&#39;t let you know why you&#39;re peering into the open refrigerator.&#0160;&#0160;</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>I should also point out that I&#39;ve recently received confirmation of the excellence of my amygdalae:&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;<a data-auth="Verified" href="https://eur06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.drmetablog.com%2F2020%2F11%2Fspider.html&amp;data=04%7C01%7C%7C23831fbd5f454461583208d8962998c6%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C637424452683952235%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;sdata=ytKrDlFAcpqG%2BIApTLB2EdxexCse%2FzjmakkW6NpiJy0%3D&amp;reserved=0" id="x_x_gmail-m_-7905439514175650523gmail-m_6139049933401859278m_220720323628700977LPlnk" originalsrc="https://www.drmetablog.com/2020/11/spider.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" shash="i4sbXs2NRhWiCwdbFfHoSRsS4gi1lk9OSj805BTHyfiLrEp6p4NKCMCLdkshaA4UUekW3+HGMd0/w7sD3+1XNNSIeNzDN5v955g4HCsnhhVtyhKw8g4Hlek9fBd261KrPvVSZUTpYdWfwVr246lWI4UIt7awqObX2exNZHoDj9o=" target="_blank" title="Protected by Outlook: https://www.drmetablog.com/2020/11/spider.html.

<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>So there&#39;s hope.</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>[December 18:&#0160; Last night we watched, on TCM of course, a movie called <em>Passion Flower&#0160;</em>(1930), an interesting tale of love and marriage and adultery and reconciliation and compromise. Definitely pre-Code. At one point, there&#39;s a party scene.&#0160; A very young man says his good-byes.&#0160; Both Ms. R and I immediately said, &quot;that&#39;s a familiar face. Who is he?&quot; And I said, &quot;his voice sounds a lot like Ray Milland&#39;s.&quot; Later that evening we look it up on Wiki. Here&#39;s the news: &quot;first screen appearance of Ray Milland, uncredited.&quot;&#0160;</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>Another astonishing feat -- this time of voice recognition. The old guy still has it, some of the time.]</div>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Last night, I was lying in bed comfortably reading Michael Kulikowski&#39;s excellent new book on the last years of the Roman Empire. I was concentrating very hard, because it&#39;s difficult for me to retain the decisions made at Nicaea in 325. I can read a paragraph about the Arian or some other &quot;heresy&quot; and five minutes later I can&#39;t remember who was on what side, or why it matters, except that those on the wrong side were liable to be burnt alive. What part of the brain is supposed to retain this stuff?&#0160; In any case, I was lost in the book, quite content, comfortable -- supportive mattress, soft pillow and all that -- while, unbeknownst to me, a spider was making its way up the backside of the book cover. Why? Where did it come from?&#0160; All I know is that it rounded the bend, so to speak, nonchalantly strolling into view at the very top of the verso page.</p>
<p>Immediately the most primitive part of my brain was activated, I elevated out of the bed like some sort of 1950s cartoon character, hovered for a second or two, and then found myself on the floor, frantically flapping the sheets and blankets, searching for the offending arachnid. Get him before he gets me!</p>
<p>If I understand what happened, the amygdala, the part of the brain that&#39;s in charge of fear, governed my actions. The amygdala has been producing fear and flight responses long before it came to be incorporated into <em>homo sapiens</em>.&#0160;</p>
<p>After a few minutes we (I had called in auxiliaries) located the offending guy, and he&#39;s now sitting on my desk in a tightly sealed Bonne Maman jam jar.</p>
<p><img alt="what does the brown recluse spider look like?" class="alignright size-full wp-image-3089" height="200" src="https://plunketts.net/uploads/blog/0492d312-f84a-439a-8595-179a442556e1/brown-recluse-look.jpg" width="300" /></p>
<p>I think it&#39;s a brown recluse. It sure looks like one. The color and shape are right out of the official catalog. According to the authorities, the only foolproof way to ascertain if it&#39;s a brown recluse is to count its eyes -- six rather than the usual spidery eight. But anyone who thinks that I&#39;m going to get close enough to this spider to count its eyes has another think coming. Brown recluses are rare in our part of the world, but they&#39;re not unknown. My book came via interlibrary loan from Laramie, Wyoming; perhaps the spider came along for the ride.</p>
<p>Why be frightened of a brown recluse the size of a quarter, legs extended?&#0160; &quot;Brown recluse bites can inflict significant or even life-threatening damage. Bites may cause severe pain, ulcers, fever, chills, nausea, joint pain, or even seizures.&quot;&#0160; Also, necrosis. Scars from necrotic flesh can last a lifetime. A friend of a friend lost a few months of his life and a hunk of gluteus maximus to a bite on the butt.&#0160;</p>
<p>The spider is quite active now in its new home -- the jam jar. It&#39;s a beautifully engineered little creature and very industrious, unceasing in its determination to find the way out. I admire it, behind glass, and I probably share a lot of DNA with it -- though it&#39;s hard to feel a close kinship.&#0160;</p>
<p>The &quot;take-away&quot;: even though some parts of my brain have deteriorated, my amygdalae are in splendid working order.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>What factors led a city boy, age 28, to purchase a rural property where he has now passed fifty glorious summers? Where he is as happy as a lark with a packet of seeds and a pruner, rake, and hoe.</p>
<p>It all began with my father&#39;s love for his backyard garden. &quot;Have you ever seen a more perfect flower than this?&quot; he would ask, pointing me to one of his splendid hybrid teas. During the growing season, he&#39;d come home from work at 6:00 p.m. on the dot, hurry through supper, change out of his lawyer suit into his old clothes, and get to work. I never saw him more contented. He cultivated his 30&#39; by 40&#39; plot with the assiduity of a Javanese terrace farmer. I watched him carefully and participated when he would let me. I studied, with the concentrated attention of childhood, the growth habits of snapdragons, sweet peas, and marigolds. Then one year I was allotted a square foot of space, right next to the dwarf peach, in which to plant seeds of my choice.&#0160; I chose a pumpkin, a vine that did not recognize boundaries, and produced two astonishingly large fruits. The die was cast.</p>
<p>There was also my maternal grandmother Sonia, originally a country girl, who never bought an orange or a grapefruit but that she planted its seeds on the window sill -- in one of those old wooden Philadelphia cream cheese boxes. Her tiny apartment had a pleasant hothouse-y odor. She loved her seedlings.</p>
<p>And then there were the three summers (&#39;47, &#39;48, &#39;49) which my family spent on Makamah Beach near Northport on the Long Island Sound. It was my original rural experience, and the earliest hint that there were places other than concrete and chain-link-fence Flatbush. It was the first time in my life that I felt at ease in the landscape.</p>
<p>I must not forget the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, where I spent many a happy hour. I remember in particular its famous Japanese garden. There was also a bank of colorful bottlebrush buckeyes that caught my youthful fancy. Many years later, I tried to reproduce that bloom in my Vermont garden. The curve and slope of the land were ideal, but the plant itself was not for our subarctic winters. The buckeye has survived, barely, for forty years now and has never produced a single flower, nor ever will.</p>
<p>It was at the BBG that I learned that gardening was not just about growing the biggest pumpkin -- it was about aesthetics and design. I started to read about the history of gardens and whenever I traveled I detoured to visit the great examples: the Huntington, Dunbarton Oaks, the Winterthur in Delaware. And scores more, all intimidating because they were created with the help of enormous fortunes, huge spaces, and unlimited supplies of labor. Good thing I had my father&#39;s example of &quot;much in little.&quot;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>In the mid 1980s, thirty-five years ago, I was &#39;in residence&#39; for a week at the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, D.C., researching an article on one of the lesser English Renaissance dramatists -- a pleasure as well as a condition of employment. The article that I completed turned out to be not a bad piece of academic prose, if I do say so myself, but not something for the ages either. It was a mere twenty years since I had completed my degree in &quot;English and American Language and Literature&quot; at a Large Eastern University, specifically Harvard. I was not drawn to the Folger for professional reasons only. It was a delight and a great privilege to hold in my very own hands and to read dozens and scores of four-hundred-year-old ephemeral books that -- more than the canonical literature -- helped me to understand the age of Shakespeare. Sermons by the wagonload, biblical commentaries, almanacs, political pamphlets, poems by minor and unknown versifiers, broadsides, medical textbooks, collections of jokes, how-to-write-a-letter-in-Latin trots, schoolbooks. The library possessed inexhaustible troves of such material. The Folger&#39;s plenty licensed my dilettante brain to follow its own naturally wayward inclinations.</p>
<p>While doing my duty and also having some fun, I fell in with a fellow Folgerite named Boyd Berry who was visiting from Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, Virginia. Over cups of coffee, Boyd and I discussed some of the less well-known writers of the period in whom we shared a mutual interest. I remember that we also talked about the teacher&#39;s perennial frustration at engaging the interest of our sometimes less-than-enthusiastic students. I do not remember what prompted me to ask Boyd this question: &quot;what was the worst course that you ever took either as an undergraduate or graduate student.&quot; He replied, without hesitation, &quot;Douglas Bush&#39;s lecture course on Milton at Harvard in 1961.&quot; I was flabbergasted, in part because I hadn&#39;t guessed that Boyd had been at Harvard during my years there, but more because I had enrolled in exactly the same course -- same time same station same year -- and because Douglas Bush&#39;s Milton course was also my own nominee for the worst course ever. Parallel lines had accidentally and miraculously met, so to speak. Although Boyd and I were the same age, he was one year behind me and had taken the course as a senior undergraduate while I had been a first-year graduate student. It seemed an astonishing coincidence, but then, the universe of students of English Renaissance literature is a small one. Nevertheless, the fact that we shared the same opinion about Professor Bush&#39;s course was comforting and, as they say, &quot;validating.&quot; Boyd said out loud words that I had only speculated upon <em>in petto</em>. Perhaps I wasn&#39;t the only outlier.</p>
<p>Why were we in such accord? The obvious answer is that Professor Bush, then in the tail end of his much-celebrated career (he had uttered his infant cries during Grover Cleveland&#39;s second presidency), was tired and bored by his teaching and put little heart into the work. In brief, he droned, unconscionably. Not only did he drone, but it seemed as though there was an invisible shield between his podium and our seats. He didn&#39;t speak to us -- he addressed the empyrean. His lectures consisted of a superficial running commentary on Milton&#39;s poems. &quot;There&#39;s a particularly lovely passage starting on line 695,&quot; -- as if a challenging idea would be beyond our collective capacity. If a student broke into the drone to hazard a question, Professor Bush&#39;s characteristic answer was, &quot;Well, that seems self-explanatory.&quot; But Bush&#39;s classroom style was not the only reason for my unhappiness; I had more substantive concerns.&#0160;</p>
<p>Let me interject a few words about Professor John Nash Douglas Bush. Although almost forgotten today, Bush was by all odds the most formidable and learned literary scholar of his generation. He knew everything there was to know about English, Romance, and classical literature and had written a dozen comprehensive critical and historical books. If the gossip can be trusted, he greeted the dawn of each new day by reading two hundred lines of Latin poetry and a hundred of Greek. I am sure that he knew more about John Milton than Milton knew about himself. He had edited the volume of Milton&#39;s complete poetry (English, Latin, Greek, and Italian) and, astonishingly, had memorized the entire twelve books of <em>Paradise Lost.</em> He was an exacting scholar and a stylish and witty writer. Moreover, he was a kindly, gentle man, cordial and generous to his students -- even to me. If he had flaws of character, I didn&#39;t know of them. To my mind, he was an unimpeachably excellent person and scholar -- and at the same time a teacher from whom I learned just about nothing.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>I was once invited -- along with a clutch of my ambitious graduate-school classmates -- to some sort of reception at Professor Bush&#39;s Cambridge residence. His home was exactly as it should have been -- that is to say, if one were making a movie about a distinguished Harvard professor, one&#39;s location scout would not rest until he discovered the Bush quarters. It was a spacious and civilized home presided over by gracious Mrs. Bush, who was also exactly as she should have been. I remember that the giant main room in the house -- which must once have been two or more large rooms that had been sutured together, was Professor Bush&#39;s enormous study. It was more like an institutional library than something to be found in a private home. Just as one would expect, the study was lined floor to ceiling with handsome wooden bookcases chock full of an enviable display of publications in many languages, some of which I could identify. I remember being served sherry, I think, and also something preternaturally green and fishy on an unfamiliar but I&#39;m sure very elite kind of cracker. This dream of an academic utopia filled me with envy. It also scared the living blazes out of me. Why? Because for all Professor Bush&#39;s elegance and his library, and his lovely deferential wife, his movie-set home struck me as soft, fey, self-satisfied, and bloodless. I was dazzled and intimidated by its splendors but at the same time wary and resistant. Only five years beyond crowded Erasmus Hall High School in darkest Brooklyn, I knew myself well enough to know that, however seductive, his style of life was not for me. I would have to find a more appropriate path.&#0160;</p>
<p>Now I want to step further back and report on two cases in which I was in conflict with Professor Douglas Bush. Actually, the conflicts were only on my side; Professor Bush, Olympian and serene, did not notice -- nor should he have, frankly. These incidents continue to haunt me to this day, sixty years after the fact. Both occurred not in the Milton course, but in an &quot;advanced&quot; seminar called &quot;Science and Humanism in the Seventeenth Century.&quot; I must explain that the word &quot;humanism&quot; did not carry the meaning that it does today, as in the phrase &quot;secular humanism&quot; -- an approach to the natural world that is allied with agnosticism and which sometimes resolves into pure atheism. Professor Bush&#39;s humanism was the altogether different &quot;Christian humanism.&quot; It was, in brief, the noble but ultimately unsuccessful Renaissance attempt to fuse the &quot;inspired&quot; and &quot;revealed&quot; truths of Christianity with the thoughtful, upstanding but unfortunately &quot;natural&quot; morality of the Greeks and Romans. If &quot;Christian Humanism&quot; could be distilled to a sentence, it would be Desiderius Erasmus&#39; daring speculation -- that he would like someday to be able to say, &quot;Sancte Socrates, ora pro nobis&quot;, or &quot;Saint Socrates, pray for us.&quot;</p>
<p>I was a humanist of the secular variety -- by birth, inclination, education and because in my brain there was no place, not even a lone neuron, where &quot;faith&quot; or &quot;prayer&#39; or &quot;worship&quot; might in more standard heads be lodged. Bush, on the other hand, was not just a scholar of Christian Humanism, he was an honest-to-god trapped-in-amber Christian Humanist -- and a devout one, deeply rooted and entirely comfortable in late medieval/early renaissance thinking. In his seminar on Science and Humanism, humanism was right and just, and science, its antagonist, was, if not altogether bad, at a minimum a very dangerous alternative. Did not both Bacon and Descartes assert that &quot;nature&quot; -- the real world -- could be studied directly, on its own terms, rather than as an entity infused with god&#39;s being and majesty. That we mortals might study nature not to reaffirm the goodness and omnipotence of god, but to accumulate objective knowledge and to reap practical material benefits. It&#39;s a fact that the separation of nature from the &quot;truth&quot; of religion has over the centuries unquestionably led to the marginalizing of Christian thinking and therefore, according to Bush&#39;s view of the world, to the steep decline of civilization. The world, no longer driven by revelation, has been going to hell in a heathen hand basket, as Professor Bush said or implied every Tuesday at 4:00 pm.</p>
<p>Regular readers of this blague as well as Dr. Metablog&#39;s family and friends will recognize that Youthful Me did not accept Bush&#39;s premises. In fact, in those days, I was probably even less open to religious ideas than I am now. And therefore, each Tuesday was a day of discomfort.</p>
<p>And then, one afternoon, Professor Bush began the allotted two hours by launching a surprise assault on the then-new and controversial Third Edition of the Merriam-Webster dictionary. The Third had shocked traditionalists. Until 1962, dictionaries had been &quot;prescriptive &quot;-- that is, they explained how language &quot;should&quot; be used and they stigmatized as <em>colloq</em>. or <em>subst. </em>[substandard] those words or expressions that fell beneath the bar. The Third forsook tradition and was not prescriptive but descriptive. It aimed to record the language as it was really used. The Third therefore included many words hitherto banned as slang or vulgar and it was loose and permissive with regard to &quot;shall&quot; and &quot;will&quot;, and &quot;imply&quot; and &quot;infer,&quot; etc. For Professor Bush, the Third was a plunge into darkness -- another example of the collapse of Western Civilization as we know it, or should know it. So he excoriated the new dictionary and its editors and its supporters. The tirade having been completed, he turned mildly to the class and asked if anyone present had a different opinion. Now I had learned a little about modern linguistics at Cornell, and I was a descriptivist both by education and democratic instinct, and I knew that Bush was completely out of step with contemporary thought. I was astonished to discover that I knew more about this particular field of knowledge than he. But, alas, I was totally intimidated and did not open my mouth. What abject cowardice on my part! Nary a word did I say, and so the class segued to a discussion of the Cambridge Platonists and their vain attempt to tame and assimilate Descartes and Spinoza. I still wonder if any of the other 2G&#39;s around the table were aware of my shame. Probably not -- did my peers, the late Arthur Oberg, the late Jake Mills, the late Brian Hepworth, the late Terry Logan, the late Bill Godshalk, and others whose names I have forgotten, notice my moral collapse? I suppose that it&#39;s too late to worry. Nevertheless, my failure to raise my hand and voice still humiliates me, still rankles.&#0160;</p>
<p>Another Tuesday, another surrender. In 1961, William Empson published his innovative study, <em>Milton&#39;s God</em>. While Empson was not as learned as Professor Bush (no one was) he was a much more imaginative and challenging reader. Some say that after Johnson and Hazlitt, Sir William has been English literature&#39;s most insightful critic. Empson was an intellectual and social dissenter (he had been banished from Magdalen College, Cambridge when a condom [horrors!] was discovered among his possessions). He had written two highly influential critical books that every serious mid-century student of literature studied -- the first on ambiguity, the second on pastoral. Empson read <em>Paradise Lost</em> through a very different lens than Bush. He was not a Christian; in fact, he confessed himself anti-Christian because he judged there to be a serious moral flaw at the heart of the religion -- that the sacrifice of Jesus was a highly elaborated form a scapegoating. About <em>Paradise Lost,&#0160;</em>he concluded that God (that is, the character God in the epic) was confused and contradictory, repeatedly tying himself into logical and rhetorical knots in order to justify the unjustifiable. He also argued that irrespective of Milton&#39;s intention, the character God became more complex and interesting when he became less ideological and more dramatic; more, so to speak, human. He revered <em>Paradise Lost</em>, but for his own, not Bush&#39;s, reasons. <em>Milton&#39;s God</em> was trashed by Professor Bush, who dismissed Empson as a simple &quot;village atheist.&quot; I was stunned. True enough that Empson was an atheist, but true also that he was a powerful thinker, not someone to be given the back of the hand with a flippant <em>ad hominem</em>. Bush&#39;s review came out in <em>The New York Times</em> on a Sunday; the following Tuesday, our teacher was lauded by my fellow seminarians. He basked in their admiration. Did my young colleagues genuinely agree with Bush, or were they egregious sycophantic toadies? I don&#39;t know and will never know. And then, after the celebration, Bush asked, as if he were open-minded, &quot;Does anyone here have a different opinion?&quot; If Empson had been summarily dispatched, what chance had I? So once again, I fled the field, remained mute -- and slunk deeper into my expensive leather chair.&#0160;</p>
<div class="text parbase text-56 section">So there they were, my two abject failures of nerve.</div>
<div class="text parbase text-56 section">&#0160;</div>
<div class="text parbase text-56 section">Have I flagellated myself sufficiently?&#0160;</div>
<div class="text parbase text-56 section">&#0160;</div>
<div class="text parbase text-56 section">But now I also remember a third Science and Humanism event -- the Tuesday that Professor Bush fell asleep.</div>
<div class="text parbase text-56 section">&#0160;</div>
<div class="text parbase text-56 section">The class routine was for members of the seminar to offer a ten-minute presentation on the topic of the day, after which Professor Bush would initiate discussion with the unfocussed inquiry, &quot;Any questions, or comments? &quot; At which point I would yearn for my Cloak of Invisibility. One fatal day, the student in question was John Knott, a fine and intelligent youth but not a ball of fire, oratorically speaking. When he brought his effort to a close, there at the head of the table sat Professor Bush, eyes closed, breathing rhythmically, his large round head bobbling on his small round body, lost in blissful slumber. A few seconds went by, then some more seconds, a minute, a minute and a half. Thanks be to all the gods in the pantheon that he did not snore! And yet there we all were, arrayed around that splendid dark mahogany table, frozen. No one moved or even twitched, no one spoke, no one made eye contact with a fellow sufferer. No one breathed. It was unbearable. At last, after another twenty or so ticks of the clock, I had endured all I could endure, and I raised my <em>Complete Poetry of John Milton</em> into the air and was just about to let it slam, when Professor Bush opened his eyes, and without the slightest acknowledgement that something unusual had occurred, intoned the familiar words: &quot;Any questions, or comments?&quot;&#0160;</div>
<div class="text parbase text-56 section">&#0160;</div>
<div class="text parbase text-56 section">I do not recall this event in order to nip at Professor Bush&#39;s revered heels. Every teacher is entitled, occasionally in a long career, to lose focus while a beginning graduate student discourses on a volume such as Henry More&#39;s <em>Explanation of the Grand Mystery of Godliness </em>(an important-in-its-own-day [1660] monograph eloquent in support of rational providentialism and the preexistence of the soul). For all I know, Professor Bush may have been exhausted because he had been up past the midnight hour Monday night, possibly contributing more to scholarship in an evening than I did in an entire career. In hindsight, it was not the sleep itself that distressed me -- it was the passivity and silence of my fellows -- and the fact that when I remained silent I&#0160; honored the charade, the falsehood, that Bush was not asleep. Faced with an emperor&#39;s-new-clothes opportunity, I punted.&#0160;</div>
<div class="text parbase text-56 section">&#0160;</div>
<div class="text parbase text-56 section">Just as I had failed to defend modern linguistics, had failed to defend the &quot;village atheist,&quot; so I failed to bang my book on the board -- an act which would have been forthright and honest and true to myself. The first two events were disgraces of an intellectual kind; the third was one of manners and, I think, of social class. The alliance of Bush and Harvard had overwhelmed me, taken from me my natural freedom of action. Let me confess that it was a secret guilty pleasure to have been accepted into Harvard&#39;s kind embrace. I feared banishment. Would I have still been welcome, would I have been worthy, would I have been a gentleman if I had noisily ended the nightmare. I felt, and I feel to this day, that all of us around the table were in an implicit, unacknowledged conspiracy not to notice the obvious so that we could protect the reverend professor and therefore defend the institutions that he exemplified. We contrived not to notice Bush&#39;s well-earned snooze because to do so would have punctured the balloon. It would been bad manners, barbaric manners, and to exhibit bad manners in a wood-paneled seminar room would mean that we were not genteel, not civilized, unworthy of Harvard and of the privileges it bestowed on us.&#0160;</div>
<div class="text parbase text-56 section">&#0160;</div>
<div class="text parbase text-56 section">On the other hand, I myself had only twenty-two years on my scrawny back, and was just five years out of rambunctious Erasmus Hall High School in Flatbush, where if a teacher were to fall asleep in class, he would within seconds have been met with derisive catcalls and a squadron of paper airplanes. And I admit that, although I conformed myself superficially to the ways of my &quot;betters,&quot; I had enough of a residual catcall-and-paper-airplane soul that I have regretted my inaction now these sixty years.&#0160;</div>
<div class="text parbase text-56 section">&#0160;</div>
<div class="text parbase text-56 section">Family, friends and stray internet pilgrims: perhaps you think that I&#39;m making too much of these trivial long-ago-and-far-away events. Far too fraught, too melodramatic. Are you not, readers, skeptical of the idea that he (that is, me) honestly believes that the essence of his being was threatened by a seminar in seventeenth-century European humanism? Possibly you also think that I exaggerate the gap between Harvardity and Brooklynity. So let us return to early 1960s and re-examine the historical context of these events.</div>
<div class="text parbase text-56 section">&#0160;</div>
<div class="text parbase text-56 section">I have reported on Douglas Bush&#39;s theological convictions; let us now turn to his retrograde views on education.</div>
<div class="text parbase text-56 section">&#0160;</div>
<div class="text parbase text-56 section">Bush was, without question, an unapologetic elitist. I don&#39;t mean &quot;elitist&quot; as the word is now popularly used -- as an all-purpose insult to those who are presumed to think that they are better than we because they are wealthy or have studied to a prestigious college. I mean elitist as in &quot;snob.&quot; Bush was an elitist because he felt that education was only for the elect. Once you admit ordinary, common folk, by golly, the end is near. He was blunt: &quot;education for all, however fine in theory, in practice ultimately leads to education for none.&quot; He deplored the ungenteel idea that &quot;students [would] come to college out of a desire for economic or social advantage.&quot; Let them stay in the places to which they were born! In a still shocking moment of undiluted social and racial snobbery, he pronounced that &quot;the rising flood of students is very much like the barbarian invasions of the early Middle Ages.&quot; &quot;Barbarian invasions&quot;? His metaphor is &quot;self-explanatory,&quot; is it not?&#0160; Bush presented himself as a guardian at the gate, protecting Christian Europe from the wild-eyed, uncivilized incursions of Lombards and Visigoths. And how was I to understand the analogy?&#0160; Did it not apply to me? Was I a civilized European or was I a violent Vandal? In theory, once I was admitted to Harvard&#39;s sacred precincts, I became an insider. But in reality, in my heart, I could identify only with the migratory hordes. Although I was camouflaged by my thrift-store jacket and tie, and I did not bring my seax to class, did not subsist on mare&#39;s milk, and felt no urge to sack Harvard, I knew myself to be, in essence, an interloper -- an abominable Avar, or brutal Bulgar, or horrible Hun. Or, in my particular case, a member of the tribe of anxious Ashkenazim.&#0160;</div>
<div class="text parbase text-56 section">&#0160;</div>
<div class="text parbase text-56 section">So now let us circle back to the beginning. Why was &quot;Douglas Bush&#39;s Milton course&quot; the worst class ever? For me, it was not just because Bush regularly lulled his classes to sleep. It was also because in his illiberal hands, John Milton, my John Milton, was diluted and distorted. I was, <em>ante</em> Bush, an admirer of Milton&#39;s courage and I was infatuated with his poetry. Milton is the only poet in the language, I believe, who ever equalled Shakespeare. <em>Lycidas (</em>written in 1636, the year of Harvard&#39;s founding) is in my opinion the world&#39;s single best poem. In tribute, I had memorized its 193 glorious lines. Moreover, Milton was a truly admirable human being. He was the furthest left, the most radical figure in the whole of English literature and perhaps in western literature. Did he not defend the execution of Charles I and the end of monarchy?&#0160; Did he not argue that marriage should be based not on dynastic alliances, but on love and sexual compatibility? Did he not authorize every individual to interpret the Bible in his own way, without the interference of a church or its priests and ministers -- the &quot;priesthood of all believers?&quot; And was it not true that he composed the Areopagitica, a seminal, essential contribution to freedom of thought?&#0160; But for Bush, I regret to say, Milton&#39;s impassioned advocacy of human dignity distracted from his poetry. He daydreamed in class about the poems Milton might have written if he hadn&#39;t allowed himself to be waylaid and distracted by politics. My Milton, on the other hand, was as much a public man as a poet. He had willingly given twenty years of his life and his precious eyesight to work for the radical transformation of society and for human freedom. Bush&#39;s judgment was in my opinion a major error, a disabling error, and it meant that the professor, however knowledgeable, was so blinkered by his conservative ideology that he missed the defining points of Milton&#39;s life. Just as I could not fully embrace Bush&#39;s Milton, he could not or would not ever fully grasp the greatness, the importance of my Milton. It therefore irked me to sit and listen every day, while Milton&#39;s contribution to world history was neglected, discounted, or dismissed. It hurt.&#0160;</div>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>The 2020 World Series is over, and I&#39;m in a royal snit.</p>
<p>It&#39;s Game 6, the Dodgers are ahead 3-2, and Tampa Bay has a chance to win and make the series go to seven, which is what I&#39;m rooting for (I don&#39;t have a dog in the hunt, because I disapprove of both teams: the Dodgers, are the despised simulacrum of the organization that abandoned Brooklyn 50+ years ago and Tampa Bay is from Florida, the Nowhere State -- plus it&#39;s an American League team, but that doesn&#39;t matter this year because for some phoney-baloney covid-related reason both leagues are using the DH. Tampa Bay is ahead 1-0 on a first-inning home run by Randy Arozarena, who has a great short powerful swing and is either the second coming of Henry Aaron and the centerpiece of the best trade in history (the worst for St. Louis) or the most spectacular flash-in-the-pan in major league history. It&#39;s the fifth inning, and Blake Snell has been pitching a masterpiece. Nine strikeouts and not a ball hit solidly. He&#39;s throwing 95 to the corners and his sinking curve is keeping the Dodger hitters completely off balance. He&#39;s looking almost like Koufax, for goodness sake. So what does Kevin Cash, Tampa Bay&#39;s manager do?&#0160; He takes out Snell and brings in Nick Anderson and two batters later, it&#39;s 2-1 Dodgers and the game is over and the Series is over. Removing Snell is the worst decision in baseball history, perhaps in sports history, perhaps the worst of any human decision since the emergence of <em>homo sapiens.</em></p>
<p>Why was Snell relieved? Because of some bullshit trumpery statistics about pitchers being less effective going through the lineup the third time. Not applicable in this case; Snell had lost nothing off his fastball, he was still hitting his spots, and he was still demoralizing the Dodgers, who looked like dejected losers. Until -- that is, they were invigorated by the prospect of not having to hit against Snell any longer.</p>
<p>Is there a word &quot;overmanaging?&quot;&#0160; There ought to be. Both teams were over-managed. Too many pitching changes, too many absurd fielding shifts -- even putting four men in the outfield--, too many pinch hitters. Baseball used to be a players&#39; game, and the job of the manager was to put his nine best players on the field and let them do their jobs, perhaps calling for a sacrifice or a steal or an intentional pass, or replacing a tired pitcher with some ex-starter or never-was from the bullpen. But now, baseball has turned into a manager&#39;s game, like (gasp) football. And when it backfires, as it did last night, what a disaster! What does Kevin Cash deserve, besides firing. If I were a Tampa Bay fan, I&#39;d be outraged. I&#39;d want revenge or his scalp, perhaps both.</p>
<p>I&#39;m a baseball fan, and I&#39;m outraged, livid, angry. I wanted to see what Blake Snell could do with the Dodger hitters, third time through. More reliance on his slider, more on the slow stuff? Could he keep getting them to swing and miss at his fastball at the top of the zone, or just above the zone?&#0160;</p>
<p>I&#39;m a fan;&#0160; baseball should try to please me and the 90% of the spectators in America who knew that Cash was making a major blunder to pull Snell. I didn&#39;t watch the end of the game. Left the room. Boycotted.</p>
<p>Baseball is not as exciting as it was in the days of my youth. The players themselves are bigger, faster, stronger, and better trained, so it&#39;s not their fault. But because the hitters are so powerful, there are too many home runs. Home runs are only exciting when a batter catches all of it and blasts one 440 feet into the upper deck or 40 rows back into the lower.&#0160; There&#39;s nothing more boring than a muscular guy swinging under it and popping one up 340 feet onto the short porch. A travesty home run. The fences should be moved back 20 feet and raised to a mandatory 10 or 12 feet. A triple is much more exciting to watch than a Texas League homer. When was the last inside-the-park homer with a relayed throw to the plate, just a hair too late?&#0160;</p>
<p>And let&#39;s put the statisticians in their place. Tampa Bay is the only team in the league with a professional statistician on the bench -- one who never advanced past T-ball. Is he responsible for the manager&#39;s monumental gaffe?&#0160; And for goodness sake, let&#39;s get rid of the DH. When the pitcher is in the batting order, there&#39;s strategy in the game. It becomes a test of intelligence, not just a home run hitting contest. I want to admire a well-executed sacrifice bunt.&#0160;</p>
<p>My father had been a catcher in his younger days and had the busted fingers to prove it.&#0160; When he was dying, I went to visit him in the hospital. He was watching the Dodgers on the TV.&#0160; The next day, when I returned, he wasn&#39;t watching. I said, &quot;Dad, there&#39;s a Yankee game on the TV; you could watch it.&quot;&#0160; He said, &quot;Yankees. American League. DH rule. Not baseball.&quot;&#0160; He died soon after.&#0160;</p>
<p>I&#39;m scared that baseball, greatest of all games, has become &quot;not baseball.&quot;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>The yips have been big news this week because Jose Altuve, Houston&#39;s golden-glove second baseman has made three throwing errors in two games. Glaring, costly errors. He&#39;s bounced balls to first base and to second base -- throws of twenty or forty feet which he has made successfully thousands of times in his outstanding career.</p>
<p>The &quot;yips&quot; is sports jargon for the sudden, inexplicable inability to make an ordinary or routine play. It&#39;s commonly used by golfers when they start missing short putts --but baseball has its famous yippers -- Steve Saxe, Chuck Knoblauch (both of them second baseman who have the shortest, easiest throws)&#0160; and now, possibly Altuve. Sometimes a good pitcher will lose his control and start to miss badly; the retired pitcher at the microphone will say, &quot;he&#39;s lost his release point,&quot; which is a yippish diagnosis without using the word. Athletes think that the problem is psychological but it&#39;s possible that the condition is merely neurological - a &quot;focal dystonia&quot; or muscle spasm in the wrist. Basketball yips? Yes, sometimes a good foul shooter will miss four or five in a row.&#0160;</p>
<p>I suspect that the yips may not be a sports-only syndrome.</p>
<p>Once, a decade or two ago, I was driving across the country on a four-lane and needed to brake. For some reason, my feet (I was driving a standard transmission so both feet and the clutch pedal were involved) couldn&#39;t remember which was the brake pedal. I flailed with both feet and was utterly panicked for about five long seconds. Then I came to my senses, put the correct foot on the correct pedal, and continued on in normal fashion. Life continued. But if I had crashed the car and killed myself, which was certainly a possibility, investigators would have thought that I had fallen asleep at the switch. They&#39;d have been wrong; it was just the yips -- a failure to perform a task that should have been entirely routine.</p>
<p>I wonder how many road disasters are caused by undiagnosed yippishness.</p>
<p>Do actors get the yips? Do musicians? Dentists?&#0160; Airline pilots? Surgeons (&quot;You know, I&#39;ve done that back surgery hundreds of times but three out of the last four, I&#39;ve sliced entirely through the guy&#39;s spinal cord&quot;).</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>There is no author with whom I feel greater kinship than with Michel de Montaigne and there&#39;s none with whom I&#39;ve passed more hours and days, except for Shakespeare. For many years, Montaigne&#39;s <em>Essais </em>has been my bedside companion, first in the old Everyman Library edition as translated by John Florio, a book which I early discovered among my father&#39;s small collection, and latterly in the 1958 version by Donald Frame. Of the two writers, Shakespeare is the greater, but he is unknowable and certainly not a comrade. &quot;Negative capability&quot; -- and all that. Shakespeare, the human being, lies hidden behind a profusion of characters and borrowed stories. Sometimes I think I can catch a glimpse of the man himself in recurring images or in a repeated motif, but how can I be sure? It&#39;s all guesswork and supposition. Shakespeare is an <em>auctor absconditus. </em>He can be admired, even revered, but he&#39;s too mysterious ever to be a pal. Montaigne, on the other hand, is insistently present. He talks directly to me, guy to guy, teaches me, argues with me. Even though there&#39;s a universe of differences between me and this astonishingly erudite sixteenth-century French Catholic skeptic, I feel that we are good friends.</p>
<p>Why the kinship? Montaigne is so various, so mutable, so inconsistent, that he&#39;s difficult to define, but nevertheless exhibits traits with which I l am in deep sympathy. Of all the important thinkers, he&#39;s the least systematic -- which is a benefit, at least for me. I can&#39;t make heads or tails of his near-contemporaries Spinoza or Descartes because both are too orderly and logical for my unsubtle head. But Montaigne works differently -- he advances an idea, modifies it, retracts it, illustrates it with a dozen anecdotes, and then announces that he can&#39;t come to a definitive conclusion -- which is the way my mind works, although obviously at a much lower order. And then Montaigne&#39;s brain is a hodgepodge, a gallimaufry of formidable learning strewn in heaps, like the last scene of C<em>itizen Kane</em>. So is mine, although it&#39;s a cramped attic compared to Montaigne&#39;s warehouse. And of course, Montaigne writes almost exclusively about himself, as I do in these fragmentary blague entries.</p>
<p>Moreover, we both seem to be at least in part writing for the same purpose. I compose these essaylets for what I conceive of, pretentiously, as dynastic reasons. Because I I so much wish that I had some artifacts or writing of my grandparents or great-grandparents, who left nothing behind, no scrap remaining, I want my descendants to have something of mine. Montaigne agrees: &quot;What a satisfaction it would be to me to hear someone tell me of the habits, the face, the expression, the favorite remarks, and the fortunes of my ancestors. How attentive I would be. Truly it would spring from a bad nature to be scornful of even the portraits of our friends and predecessors, the form of their clothes and their armor.&quot; [Montaigne came from a family with a strong military tradition, unlike mine, which is epitomized by grandfather&#39;s desertion from the Russian army.] &quot;I keep their handwriting, their seal, the breviary and a peculiar sword that they used, and I have not banished from my study some long sticks that my father ordinarily carried in his hand.&quot; I have no &quot;sticks,&quot; but as I sit here pecking at the word processor, I see out of the corner of my eye my father&#39;s library ladder, used for retrieving just the right law book.</p>
<p>Montaigne is not done with the topic. He continues by exploring an idea about which I also have ruminated. For whom do I devote these hours, if not for myself?&#0160; He is eloquent upon the subject.</p>
<p>&quot;If no one reads me, have I wasted my time, entertaining myself for so many idle hours with such useful and agreeable thoughts. In modeling this figure upon myself, I have had to fashion and compose myself so often to bring myself out, that the model itself has to some extent grown firm and taken shape. Painting myself for others, I have painted my inward self with colors clearer than my original ones. I have no more made my book that my book has made me -- a book consubstantial with its author, concerned with my own self, an integral part of my life....&#0160; Have I wasted my time by taking stock of myself so continually, so carefully. For those who go over themselves only in their minds and occasionally in speech do not penetrate to essentials in their examination as does a man who makes that his study, his work, and his trade, who binds himself to keep an enduring account, with all his faults, with all his strengths.&quot;</p>
<p>I wish I could say that I&#39;m as honest as Montaigne; I&#39;m not. I recognize that the &quot;me&quot; that appears here is to some degree different from the me that is me. Although I do not lie about myself, I conceal some of my most flagrant deficiencies. Nor do I blow my own small trumpet. As a result, the portrait that has emerged is solider and also less troubled than the true-to-life person. Don&#39;t say I didn&#39;t give you notice, unwary descendants.&#0160;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>It&#39;s unlikely that I will be killed by a tsunami. I just don&#39;t get to the seashore very often -- the last time was five years ago -- and I happen to reside most of the year at an altitude of 5300 feet. It would have to be one heck of a tsunami that would find me here -- 1200 miles inland. An ordinary rainfall-caused flood is a more likely cause of death. We have a big one every decade or so. But still, I live on the second floor of a concrete and steel-I beam building and even a thousand-year event wouldn&#39;t touch me. I might be in danger if I happened to be hiking in one of our many narrow canyons, where you see signs that say &quot;in case of sudden flood, climb to safety.&quot; But I&#39;m not much worried about a narrow canyon situation because I like to stay home and in bed when it starts to rain or even when there&#39;s a threat of rain. For the same reason, I&#39;m not afeard of dying in an avalanche. I don&#39;t ski and I don&#39;t climb mountains, especially in the winter. In fact, I tend to stay at home, sipping hot cider, on cold days because I&#39;m afraid of slipping on the ice and busting an arm or a leg or a hip. A volcano, then? Not likely. There are no active volcanoes nearby and those hotspots under the geysers in Yellowstone aren&#39;t scheduled to explode for a few hundred thousand years. I just can&#39;t see myself racing ahead of a pyroclastic flow. A forest fire? Always a danger because they&#39;ve become more frequent with global warming. Nevertheless, I don&#39;t think a forest fire is likely to kill me because even though I live less than a mile from the mountains, there&#39;s enough buffer between my home and the forest that it&#39;s pretty impossible for a fire to cross into my zone. (A house fire is even more unlikely, especially because of the up-to-date built-in sprinkler system and the cinderblock-enclosed staircase). I suppose I could be killed by a lightning strike but I&#39;m not likely to be outside dancing during a sudden storm. A hurricane -- well, we don&#39;t have any here and although I spend a significant amount of time in New Orleans, I limit my visits to the late winter or early spring, so I&#39;m not in residence during&#0160; the bad season. A tornado is a remote possibility. Once again, I&#39;d have to go far to find one, because they don&#39;t seem to come into my city. I once identified a funnel cloud out to the east, but it didn&#39;t touch ground. A blizzard? Well, I&#39;ve certainly experienced blizzards and once I was caught in one, but frankly, unless I should happen to drive the Subaru into snowbank and freeze to death, or go out for a long walk in the open space in the midst of a storm, I&#39;m not likely to perish. Then there are earthquakes, which would be a real possibility if I lived in California or along a fault, but not here in the stable Rockies. So on the whole, I don&#39;t think I&#39;m going to die in some natural disaster.&#0160;</p>
<p>Wait, what about a meteorite falling from the sky and bopping me on the head?</p>
<p>Actually, that sounds like a good way to go. No long period of fear and anxiety waiting to drown or burn or be buried, just instant death while strolling in the park on a sunny afternoon. A perfect ending.</p>
<p>Which reminds me of the death of Aeschylus, who, according to the story, while walking on a beach, was killed when an eagle picked up a turtle, and trying to break its shell, dropped it on him, thinking that his bald head was a large rock.</p>
<p>Death by falling turtle -- ridiculous. Death by meteorite -- glamorous and romantic. A story for latter generations to savor.</p>
<p>Oh, oh. I just thought of another natural disaster. Sinkholes. I don&#39;t want to be swallowed by a sinkhole. Not at all glamorous. Memorable, yes. Glamorous, no.&#0160; &#0160;</p>

<p>This standing stone might look like an ordinary piece of granite, but it has a rich history. If you look very closely, you can almost see the two deep holes that have been drilled into it. Though it&#39;s now merely a garden ornament, decorating a perennial border, it was once a working fence post. Hinges would have been hammered into the holes.</p>
<p>We found this post up on the hill, deep in the second-growth forest, very close to the remains of what was either a well or a cesspool and beneath the giant senescent maple that must date from pre-Colonial times.</p>
<p>There&#39;s also a second megalith, also drilled but not visible in this picture, that now guards a parallel perennial border. Long ago, the two posts flanked an old farm road but the wooden gate that once stood between them had already rotted and disappeared fifty years ago when I first happened upon the posts.</p>
<p>The area where the post stood is surrounded by numerous substantial stone walls that once delineated the boundaries of various fields. Tom Roberts, who farmed the property from 1926 to 1967, told me that he grew apples and potatoes on the hill. There&#39;s no need for a gate for potatoes, so the posts must date from a previous era when the land was used to pasture sheep.</p>
<p>We decided to honor the posts by placing them in a more prominent position, so one day we loaded them into the bucket of the Deere tractor and brought them down. We dug a hole about a third the length of the post, chained it to the bucket, and lowered it into place. NGP is getting to be mighty skillful at maneuvering the tractor. The posts are handsome in their new situations. Robins like them too, as places to perch.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I just completed another long stroll through <em>Bleak House. </em>It&#39;s either my fifth or sixth time through -- or almost once a decade since 1958. During this reading, which will no doubt be my last, I felt that I was imprisoned by the novel, hogtied; that I couldn&#39;t do anything or read anything else until I made it to the end of entire 900 pages. Dickens took over my life, and not for the first time. It was a struggle, perhaps made worse because my eyes are not as good as they once were and because the print in my Oxford Classics edition seems to be growing tinier and grayer.</p>
<p>It was a willing surrender and I was a willing captive. How can I not be dazzled and impressed by the profusion of Dickens&#39; imagination and by his genius at keeping a dozen plot-balls in the air.&#0160;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I don&#39;t ever remember being quite so angry and impatient at Mr. Dickens.&#0160; &quot;Let &#39;em wait.&quot; Well, I waited for five days, which as fast as i can trot nowadays.&#0160;</p>
<p>The good parts of <em>Bleak Hous</em>e are as good as anything in the language. The death of Jo the crossing sweeper (&quot;And dying thus around us every day&quot;) remains the single greatest paragraph in the long history of the English novel. &quot;Dead, your Majesty.&quot; The encounter of Sir Leicester and Rouncewell was much better than I remembered it. Mr. Chadband, the oleaginous preacher, was, this time, remarkably pertinent. Mr. Bucket is a triumph. Lady Dedlock&#39;s long repressed love for Captain Hawley was more poignant.</p>
<p>But I&#39;ve lost my admiration for some other parts of the novel. I could hardly bear Esther Summerson&#39;s goody-goodiness; and, this time, I have to say that Esther&#39;s relationship with her dear darling Ada seemed suspect. Far too sentimentalized. Ada herself, still in mourning seven years after the death of her misguided weak husband -- unbearable.&#0160; The Jellyby and Pardiggle satires seemed misguided, excessive.&#0160; I was not amused by Mrs. Snagsby&#39;s jealousy or by the relentless pillorying of poor Mr. Guppy. Harold Skimpole&#39;s infantile nattering has lost its charm.</p>
<p>There&#39;s never been a novelist with more heart or less intellect than Dickens. He is the best of novelists, the worst of novelists.&#0160;</p>
