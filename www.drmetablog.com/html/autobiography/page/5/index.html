		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>The house was surrounded by bears. They were, I must admit, not very convincing bears -- my dreamatorium didn&#39;t seem to be able to generate realistic grizzlies. Instead, these bears looked like actors in bear costumes. Even though they were silent, they were menacing and I was frightened. I remained inside the house trying to protect some children who may or may not have been my own offspring. I thought, if I just fire my pistol into the air a few times, I should be able to scare the bears and drive them away. So I started to look around for my pistol, but no luck. I searched the drawers, several of them, and also looked through my luggage. No weapon. Then I had a revelation. I remembered that it&#39;s not in this dream that I have a pistol -- that was in an earlier dream, a few days or a few weeks ago. If there&#39;s no pistol, how do I deal with the bears?&#0160; I was out of ideas, but just then a woman, not someone known to me,&#0160; but middle-aged and blonde, appeared, and inquired, do you want me to get rid of the bears? What is your plan, I asked, and she responded, with the &quot;performance.&quot; A &quot;performance&quot;? She added that it would cost me a bit of money but that we would settle about the payment later. I agreed with the plan and told her to go ahead with the performance. Which she did -- she gathered a number of people, including some very young children, who formed themselves into a circle and sang a song (more like a chant) and danced. The performance chased the bears away, so I woke up. I never did settle with her about the fee.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>It wasn&#39;t my best dream -- but it&#39;s not entirely without interest. I&#39;d give it a B-plus at most. I admire the details about the wrong-dream pistol and about the &quot;performance.&quot;&#0160; By the way, I&#39;ve never owned a pistol and haven&#39;t had a weapon in my hands since ROTC in college, and I have no idea why my dreamatorium is so convinced that I did so.</p>
<p>I continue to be amazed that my nighttime life is so much more inventive than my daytime. In actuality, I&#39;m not at all an imaginative person. When I set out to write fiction or poetry, which I have done at various times in my life, it&#39;s a disaster. The truth is that I have nothing to say. No plots, no situations, no dialogue, no wit, no insights. And yet, night after night, I find myself in crazy, bizarre but also imaginative situations. I wake myself out of dreams, like this one, that refer back to past dreams -- as if Tuesday&#39;s dream, were a continuation of Monday&#39;s and Monday&#39;s a piece of a continuing narrative -- as if my dreams were chapters of a long novel or perhaps episodes in a TV serial.</p>
<p>My dreams are almost always nightmares. I&#39;m lost in a strange city, can&#39;t find my way back home. Surrounded, defenseless and alone, among enemies. Infinite variations on themes of helplessness and hopelessness.</p>
<p>The pleasant dreams are very few but they can be inventive and fun. Once I dreamed that I could swim like a fish, not by flailing my arms but rather by swiveling my entire body. I was as as quick as a pickerel. And several times, I had gravity-defying dreams in which I compete in the long jump, but don&#39;t come down, just skim along the surface of the earth like a Greek goddess. A very liberating fantasy.&#0160;</p>
<p>It wouldn&#39;t be difficult to interpret the bear-pistol-performance dream. Life is dangerous (the bears), there are possible remedies (the pistol), but community support (the performance) is more effective than individual action. If I were feeling Jungian, I could find all sorts of bear or half-bear archetypes in the folklore. I&#39;m absolutely positive that sometime during the long haul from the Olduvai Gorge to Ellis Island, one or more of my ancestors, living in a cave or a daub-and-wattle hovel, faced off against carnivorous creatures. Perhaps the dream emerges from some atavistic portion of my brain or is embedded in my DNA.</p>
<p>But I don&#39;t believe it. I attach little meaning to dreams. Surely, they reflect one&#39;s anxieties, but they don&#39;t predict the future or explain the deeper mysteries of life. I think that they&#39;re nothing more than the chemical circuits of the brain going haywire. It takes a lot of effort to keep the synapses under control, and when we sleep, those controls are compromised. We become unhinged. Didn&#39;t WS say something like lunatics and dreamers are of imagination all compact?&#0160; Or did he?&#0160; Well, lunacy and dream and imagination are closely related, whether he said it or not.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef026bde8e90d3200c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="IMG_0500" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef026bde8e90d3200c image-full img-responsive" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef026bde8e90d3200c-800wi" title="IMG_0500" /></a><br />These very pretty pieces of china mean nothing to the world at large but they have great importance to me.</p>
<p>When I was a boy, the only holiday that was celebrated at 539 East 9 Street was Thanksgiving. Why was it not forbidden along with all the others? The reason, I suspect, is that it was the holiday least tainted by religion.</p>
<p>My parents were not sociable people and Thanksgiving was the only time of year that our house ever saw a guest or that I experienced conviviality -- which is why this particular china pattern of became important to me. My parents owned a broken set -- perhaps a dozen or so pieces. I don&#39;t know how or when they were acquired, or why, but I do know that they appeared, annually, in November. To me they said, and still say, not only turkey and sweet potatoes, but friendship and laughter.</p>
<p>I&#39;m still surprised that they owned such handsome pieces -- far too fancy and decorated for our modest utilitarian household.</p>
<p>I inherited these remnants because neither of my brothers expressed any interest in them. For the record, they are Charles Field Haviland, commissioned by Macy&#39;s, and originally manufactured in 1938, so they would have been newish when acquired by my parents. I once knew the name of the particular pattern, but I&#39;ve forgotten it. In the catalogue they&#39;re listed as &quot;Head 174&quot;.They are terribly respectable and have &quot;establishment&quot; written on their faces, but they have almost no monetary value. Less than nothing, in fact -- you&#39;d have to hire a couple of guys to cart them away.</p>
<p>One day, on ebay, I found on auction a full set of of what I had come to think of as &quot;my family pattern.&quot;&#0160; A hundred or so pieces -- three different size plates, soup bowls, cups and saucers, serving dishes, sugar and creamer, a butter dish -- the works. Needless to say, it was not difficult to outbid the competition. I &quot;won&quot; the auction -- a small triumph which I choose to regard as tribute to my heritage.</p>
<p>Now, whenever we have guests, which is a lot more frequently, believe me, than it was in my family of origin, out come the Charles Field Haviland dishes. Especially at ceremonies and Thanksgivings.</p>
<p>I&#39;m sad that my children show not the least interest in this chinaware. But why should they? They were not a mysterious feature of their childhoods.</p>
<p>Perhaps, some day, one of the seven grandchildren will be intrigued. But I&#39;m doubtful.&#0160;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef0263e9600994200b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="IMG_20200824_192811" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef0263e9600994200b image-full img-responsive" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef0263e9600994200b-800wi" title="IMG_20200824_192811" /></a></p>
<p>It&#39;s a lawn mower, or as the John Deere people like to call it, a lawn tractor. We call it a &quot;riding mower.&quot; I&#39;ve spent a thousand hours upon it and upon its used-to-death predecessor. Keeping up the lawns take just about three hours -- twice a week in May and June, bi-weekly come a dry September. It&#39;s a useful machine -- uncomplicated, rarely out of service, finely engineered. With its wide cutting deck, I can maintain the lawns with minimum of fuss. It&#39;s a royal pain when it does break dow. You can read such a failure <a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2007/09/why-i-hate-mach-1.html ">here.&#0160;</a></p>
<p>But it&#39;s not the mower but the #10 cart that has changed my life for the better. I came into possession of the cart twenty years ago, and have used it, hard, every summer since. Sometimes it develops a flat tire, but otherwise, it&#39;s perfect.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>In the pre-cart days, from 1968 to 2000, I possessed only a battered old wheelbarrow. If you want to move manure from the pile to the garden, you can fill a wheelbarrow with about two cubic feet of material. Then you use your own personal arms and legs to haul the wheelbarrow to its target, always uphill, and dump it. But if you&#0160; use the cart to move manure, you can fill it with a full cubic yard or perhaps more of the &quot;well-dried.&quot; Then you hop gracefully onto the lawn tractor and let the mower pull the cart to your garden. The machine does the hard work and your back doesn&#39;t &quot;go out.&quot; (The rear panel of the cart is&#0160; removable and with not much effort the front of the cart can be raised to dump stuff out the back). You drive away a few feet and the cart empties itself.</p>
<p>Same thing with brush. If you&#39;ve accumulated a couple of hours worth of brush and weeds, and you want to move it to the brush pile -- why then, a trip&#39;s worth is only what you can carry in your arms. But with the cart, you can stack and compress the stuff and move ten times as much, especially if you&#39;ve learned how to make use of bungee cords. And again, you don&#39;t have to carry or drag; you let the machine do the hard work. Some decry the gasoline engine, but I&#39;m all gratitude.</p>
<p>The cart allows me to do many times the amount of work as a wheelbarrow, and at much less cost to my aging body. It&#39;s a gol durn miracle.&#0160;</p>
<p>(Those are NGP&#39;s miniature donkeys, Big Joe and Little Joe, in the background. They may not be aware of it, but they&#39;ve also made important contributions to garden fertility.&#0160;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>We settled on University Hill by lucky accident. Shortly after accepting a teaching position, I received a letter from my then-chairman Harold Kelling, urging me to write immediately to Professor J. D. A. Ogilvy, who had a house to rent near the University. I jumped to follow instructions and in August, 1969, the four of us (ages 30, 29, 4 and 2) took up residence in a small and lovely jewel of a Craftsman bungalow at 9th and College. It was not only a splendid home in which to start life in Boulder but it was also conveniently located: walking distance to Norlin Library, to the bus to Denver and to the Boulder Public Library, as well as just a block and a half from Highland Elementary School. We lived in that fine house contentedly until January of 1973, when (we were now 5, Eve having joined us in June of 1970) it became clear that we needed room to grow. The boys, Nathaniel and Ben, were adamant that we must remain in the Flatirons school district (Highland had been closed and abandoned -- a significant loss to the community). The children had good instincts; Flatirons Elementary was a wonderful school. It was led by Robert Rea, the finest principal I&#39;ve ever known. During the winter of &#39;73, we migrated from 9th all the way to a 10th street house that had, as they say, &quot;good bones&quot; but which had been &quot;modernized&quot; -- actually brutalized -- by a succession of owners who had trashed almost all of its Arts and Crafts splendors in favor of oversized mirrors, bright green shag rugs, beaded curtains, flocked wallpaper, and plate glass (replacing stained glass) windows. But heck, it was spacious for a family of five even though fabulously expensive ($46,500). We felt fortunate. There was a bonus: when Althea returned to work after a seven-year interval of pregnancy, birthing, and nursing, she was able to walk back and forth to Boulder High School, where she taught mathematics for many years. With the purchase of the house, our commitment to the Hill strengthened.</p>
<p>10th street was our home for 35 years. Over the course of the decades, we restored our abused home to the extent that our resources permitted. We added insulation (its first) and a modern kitchen, refinished the oak floors and stripped the paint from the warm fir woodwork, replaced the wallpaper and allowed the ornate brass registers to glow once again -- and moreover, transformed a backyard wasteland into a pleasing peony-iris-daylily garden. I&#39;m proud to say that we left the house in much better shape than we found it. Meanwhile the neighborhood, sad to say, did not improve along with us but spiraled downward. In 1973, when we arrived, three quarters of the 24 houses on our street were owner-occupied; when we departed in 2009, only four or five houses remained in family hands and the rest had devolved into rentals -- occupied and often over-occupied by CU students. Our block was representative of developments that took place on the Hill during our years of residence. While the Hill had once been an essentially peaceful place, with only a rare disturbance, by the turn of the century, it had deteriorated into a combat zone where we and our adult neighbors engaged in constant struggle with graffiti, overflowing trash bins, weedy untended lawns, noisy late night and early morning sleep-obliterating parties, neglected barking dogs, gratuitous intermittent fireworks (explosions, actually!), thefts, vandalism, as well as fraught face-to-face encounters with rude entitled young malefactors.</p>
<p>What had happened between 1969 and 2009? What caused the decline from a thriving pacific neighborhood to a disorderly student ghetto? There were a host of factors, a few of which I can enumerate. Probably most important is that the University added at least 10,000 students during those years and did not provide housing for a single soul. The Hill, just across Broadway, was easy pickings for enterprising landlords, many of them decent but some unscrupulous, who bought advantageously, and (inasmuch as rental licensing codes were largely ignored and unenforced), maximized their income by dividing dignified, solid old Victorian or Arts and Crafts homes into rabbit-warrens. Many of the new occupants were first-time-from-home students who came from far away, spent a semester or two boozed up and hung over, failed out, and left behind their tuition money, their damage, and their trash. What might have been profitable for CU was disastrous for the neighborhood. Along with the increase in the absolute number of students came a resurgence of fraternities. During the late 60s and early 70s, when many students opposed the Vietnam war and conceived themselves to be anti-establishment, fraternities were among the institutions that were disfavored. Membership in the frat clubs declined significantly, but then recovered with the coming of the more conservative, less troubled Reagan era. I need not dwell on the fact that the burgeoning fraternities, flaunting an ethic that was anti-intellectual and pro-alcohol, were a major cause of increased neighborhood disruption. Along with these factors, came the replacement of marijuana, the drug of choice during the antiwar era, with beer. Marijuana, at least in the mild varieties of the 70s, is a contemplative drug while beer is a noisy one.The turn to alcohol had the effect of increasing the number of bars at 13th and College; while there had only been a couple of drinking establishments when I arrived (Boulder had been &quot;dry&quot; until 1967), by the time I left, there were more than twenty such, and the area had become a drinking &quot;destination&quot; that attracted outsiders to the street and inevitably also to Hill fraternity and house parties. And then sometime during the 70s or perhaps early 80s, the University moved many classes from a Monday-Wednesday-Friday to a Monday-Wednesday schedule, which meant that the weekend, and weekend drinking, now began on Thursday night and continued until Monday morning. It was sometime during this period that a couple of national magazines proclaimed CU as the nation&#39;s Number One Party School, which I must assume negatively impacted its pool of applicants. In addition, the welcome liberation of women from oppressive social restrictions had an unintended consequence: it led to much more alcohol consumption by female students. What had once been a rarity -- a drunken woman -- became, I&#39;m sorry to say, commonplace. (I had become accustomed to male revelers untrussing and pissing on my roses, but I was genuinely flabbergasted to see young women pull down their panties to squat on my front lawn). Still another factor was the advent of the cell phone, which made it easy for small nomadic bands of young people to find each other and rapidly coalesce into sprawling alcoholic hullabaloos. Both the city government and the university, two institutions that should have noticed these developments, remained supine and indifferent.</p>
<p>Then came the riots. In 1971 there had been a protest, which turned violent, against Nixon&#39;s secret bombing of Cambodia. But the scary riots of the 80s lacked a political or social agenda -- as far I or anyone else could tell, they were meaningless expressions of anomie, anarchy, and vandalism. Asked for justification, students claimed that &quot;there&#39;s nothing to do in Boulder but drink&quot; -- an unpersuasive argument about one of the most prosperous small cities in the nation, one in which gymnasiums, theaters, libraries, hiking and climbing trails, swimming pools, and other recreational opportunities abound. The Hill experienced four riots in three years -- associated, if I remember correctly, with Hallowe&#39;en or homecoming. Sloppy, reeling revelers crammed the streets, overturned vehicles, and hauled couches off porches to set dangerous street-corner fires. I remember one instance in which rioters on the prowl for fuel appropriated a substantial section of the wooden fence at the alley side of my lot. At last, the city took notice. A commission was empaneled to study and make recommendations. I attended a few of these meetings and was impressed by the seriousness with which the panel took its responsibilities. Members from the Hill neighborhood were Terry Rodrigue and Annie Fox. A report was issue and recommendations were made, but to no perceptible effect, and the deterioration continued.&#0160;</p>
<p>The riots led to the re-founding of the University Hill Neighborhood Association by the late Jane Stoyva, Rosemary Crowley, Steven Walsh, Lisa Spaulding, and&#0160; Eleanor DePuy, among many others. With my children now departed for college, I was able to become a contributing participant. Simply put, the Association was divided into two camps, which I thought of as the &quot;enforcers&quot; and the &quot;socializers.&quot; The enforcers (among them Terry Rodgers, Gregg deBoever, and Ken Wilson) patrolled the neighborhood on Friday and Saturday nights, calling in violations to the police. The &quot;socializers&quot; (myself and many others) tried every which way to integrate the students into the community. In retrospect, neither the one nor the other technique had much of an impact.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the effort to socialize the young folk had very beneficial social side-effects, at least for me. For example, I was a member of a small group (with Kathy Tucker, Terry Rodrigue, and LeRoy Leach) that established the annual Beach Park Party (does it still exist?). Not only did these neighbors, who had been until then no more than faces to me, become my friends, but I had the delightful experience, several years in succession, of dishing out free ice cream to both adults and children. It was my best job, ever. On 10th Street, Althea and I initiated an annual block party, where, for many successive Septembers, we explained to new arrivals over hamburgers and beans that they were welcome to the neighborhood but that they should respect the people with jobs and young children who also lived on the street. For three or four years I was part of a group that met monthly at The Academy, trying to figure out how to make use of that institution&#39;s resources to benefit the community. I made a lasting friend with one of the participants, Ron Roschke, then pastor of Grace Lutheran. I edited an upbeat, cheerful bi-monthly newsletter that was distributed throughout the hill to permanent and new residents alike. In addition, I represented aggrieved neighbors at restorative justice hearings, where young scamps were counseled by their practiced attorneys that to clear their records and escape punishment, all they needed to do was to grovel a bit and feign remorse. I attended and spoke at many City Council meetings. I made many friends by patrolling our street on Sunday mornings with a black plastic bag, picking up beer and soda cans, empty cigarette packs, those ubiquitous red beer cups, and various pieces of discarded clothing. (If there&#39;s a good reason why a bra should lie in the gutter on a weekend morning, I can&#39;t imagine what it might be.) I made my best Hill friend, Vin Scarelli, when we met at 2 AM, both of us on the hunt for &quot;trumpet man&quot; -- a student who like to pop out of his house in the wee hours, blow his trumpet (it might have been a bugle) as loud as possible, and then scurry inside before anyone could nab him. The reward for these activities was that I became member of a vibrant community -- and there&#39;s nothing like a common enemy to bring people together</p>
<p>I left the Hill in 2009 in part because I was exhausted by the fight but also because Althea&#39;s illness had progressed to the point that we needed to live on one floor, with an elevator.</p>
<p>I reside now in an age-appropriate downtown condo, but I regret that I can no longer walk around the block and enjoy a brief &quot;how are you&quot; with neighbors with whom I&#39;ve collaborated on one project or another. I miss the society of the Hill, but not its disorder. Among its other virtues, there could have been no better place to raise children.</p>
<p>One might succumb to nostalgia -- except that when I sit on my Walnut Street balcony on a summer evening, I can hear distant booms coming from up there on the Hill, and I remember that they were exceedingly jarring and disturbing. The far off blasts remind me why I relocated and they cancel out any longing to return. But let me confess that if I were to come back to the Hill, I would return as a committed &quot;enforcer.&quot;</p>
<p>Can the Hill be saved, or is it doomed to further decline?&#0160; There&#39;s no better location -- everything is at your doorstep -- schools, libraries, Chautauqua, foothills, all the diverse riches of a large University. It&#39;s a neighborhood of great architectural integrity -- an outdoor museum of 1900-1920 American design, almost as interesting as antebellum New Orleans or Art Nouveau Riga. Its housing stock is unparalleled in Boulder; in a better world, it would be a tourist destination. UHNA does a wonderful job of advocacy, but it&#39;s in an unequal contest with powerful political and business forces. I think it was during the 90s that a few of us, the late Neil King most prominently, tried to engage the university in an improve-the-Hill project. We proposed that the neighbors and the university (we hoped also for grant support) pitch in to create an entity that would buy houses on the Hill and rent them to, say, newly-arriving professors or staff who would otherwise be forced to commute from Lafayette -- nowadays, Erie or Ft Lupton. And by doing so little by little to undo and reverse the tipping point and rebalance the ratio of adults to students. Although Neil was persuasive and influential (he had once been city attorney), he could not develop any traction with either the city or CU. I am not sure if our plan was workable, but I learned that to save the Hill will not be easy and will require big money, big thinking, and the coordination of many disparate groups.&#0160;</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, the struggle between the&#0160; enforcers and the socializers continues. Should police educate or should they arrest and ticket our student hooligans?&#0160; Let&#39;s do both. If a new first year student arrives in Boulder on a Thursday, misbehaves during the weekend, and the following Monday forwards to his mommy and daddy the news of a $5000 fine -- well, that will certainly be educational, will it not?</p>

The George Szell -- Cleveland Orchestra recording of Dvorak&#39;s New World Symphony, which I purchased sometime about 1952, was the first &quot;long playing&quot; album that I ever owned. The record jacket illustrated above is not, I&#39;m sorry to say, the correct one. I couldn&#39;t locate the proper image on the internet, and my own copy of the recording failed to make the cut when we moved to smaller quarters in 2009. The design of the jacket is, however, imprinted on my memory: a water color of a rural landscape against a neutral blue-gray background. The Symphony was No.5 in those days but the reissue uses the renumbered system which became conventional in the 80s, I believe, and caused the New World to be demoted, or promoted, to No.9. Whatever the number, whatever the jacket, I listened to that recording hundreds, many hundreds of times, and I know every note.
<div class="a-row" id="altImages">
<p>Although my mother loved classical music and listened daily to WQXR, our family did not own a phonograph. Eventually, sometime around 1953 or 1954, a record player appeared courtesy of my older brother Eugene, who set it up in his bedroom and also bought a few albums. His collection consisted of a few Broadway musicals and some pop standards (Sinatra and the Mills Brothers for sure). He allowed me to use his machine when he wasn&#39;t at home. What an opportunity! I memorized <em>Oklahoma</em> and <em>Guys and Dolls,&#0160;</em>among others.</p>
<p>When I was eleven or twelve years old, I was home from school of a week. Was it whooping cough? The radio became my constant companion (no TV in those years). Every day for a week, I listened to a &quot;dramatization&quot; of a novel by Dumas. I believe it was <em>Twenty Years After</em>, but I can&#39;t be positive. The story was not memorable, nor were the performances, but the &quot;background music&quot; was to my ears astonishingly beautiful. On Friday, when the story came to conclusion, it was announced that the music that had entranced me was the New World Symphony.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>After I gained access to Eugene&#39;s record player, I saved my nickels and for $1.98, the standard price of LPs at that time, I bought a copy of the Symphony. It was an expenditure of significance, even for someone who was pulling down $.75 an hour shelving books at the local public library.</p>
<p>Having discovered that one could buy and own recorded music, I little-by-little added to my collection. By the time I graduated from college, I owned ten or a dozen recordings. I remember Dennis Brain&#39;s performance of Mozart&#39;s Horn Concertos, Paul Kletzki&#39;s version of Mahler&#39;s Symphony #1, an Angel recording of Bach&#39;s Magnificat, and a Prokoviev Lieutenant Kije Suite. There were a few others that I can no longer remember. But none of them were as important as the Szell Dvorak, which was my gateway to the classics.</p>
<p>I&#39;m listening to it now. Via Alexa.</p>

<p>This is the most unusual and perhaps the most beautiful object I&#39;ve ever owned. It&#39;s a rawhide or leather puppet used in traditional Siamese theatrical performances. On the reverse, it&#39;s dated 4 IX 85, or September 4, 1885,&#0160; which I presume is the day the puppet was acquired (or &quot;collected&quot;). I purchased it from an antique store in Denver in the early 1970s. The dealer explained that he bought from the estate of a local man who had been a foreign service officer in Thailand in the last part of the nineteenth century. I had never seen anything like it, didn&#39;t know anything about it, but fell for it in a big way, and have enjoyed it ever since.</p>
<p>It&#39;s called a Nang Yai puppet, and I&#39;ve written a bit about it <a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2018/03/nang-yai.html">here.</a></p>
<p>She&#39;s a musician who plays a mandolin-like instrument. She wears an elaborately decorated outfit with long sleeves and pants. For many years, she hung in a north-facing window (our fierce Colorado sun would destroy her in a summer if she faced south). Now she has a light box all her own, and when she&#39;s lit, she dominates the room, but only in a benign way. She&#39;s harmoniously proportioned, graceful and not without a touch of majesty. To my eyes, she&#39;s radiant. She ennobles her surroundings.&#0160;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef026be40a7a7f200d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="IMG_0486" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef026be40a7a7f200d image-full img-responsive" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef026be40a7a7f200d-800wi" title="IMG_0486" /></a></p>
<p>This woebegone object was once a plump and thriving stuffed animal -- a bear, in fact, though for some reason my children always called him &quot;Puppy.&quot; Their only other stuffed animal, a snake, was named &quot;Snakey.&quot; Pedestrian nicknames to be sure. I admit that our family wasn&#39;t very imaginative about naming our mascots.</p>
<p>Even though Puppy is past his prime, he&#39;s still a most treasured critter. If the house broke into flames, and I could only rescue one item, I&#39;d have to grab Puppy and leave to their fates the jeweled goblets, the ancient diamond tiara, the Stradivarius, the Vermeers, and the First Folios. Puppy is more valuable.</p>
<p>Puppy looks as though he was abused, but it&#39;s not so. He was only loved to death. Because he was our only bear, the three children struggled for ownership. Poor Puppy was a field of combat. He was pulled, stretched, thrown, dunked, employed as a soccer ball, and in at least one memorable instance, voluminously vomited upon. Over the course of the decades, the sad fellow lost almost all his fur, his corneas, his entire snout, two-thirds of his stuffing, and both of his original ears. I myself attached two prosthetic leather ears, only one of which survives -- and also sewed on his asymmetrical leather mouth. In addition, early in Puppy&#39;s career, I performed a delicate musicboxectomy.&#0160;</p>
<p>Why only one stuffed bear to be struggled over? Why not three -- one apiece -- as would be sensible in families that hope to avoid sibling strife? Why the paucity of stuffed animals? Because both Althea and I came from families that were ideologically opposed to such indulgences. Grandma Anne, Althea&#39;s mother, wouldn&#39;t allow stuffed animals in her home because they were &quot;unsanitary.&quot; My parents didn&#39;t much believe in toys of any kind -- kids were supposed to make their own entertainment out of pots and pans. (My father came from so impoverished a family that a stuffed bear would have been an inconceivable luxury.) Therefore my brothers and I grew up deprived of warm, furry, reassuring &quot;transitional objects,&quot; which had no consequences whatsoever, for me, setting aside the periodic gloom and the vast existential void in my soul.</p>
<p>Puppy is now in my care because my children can&#39;t decide to whom he properly belongs. I hope they don&#39;t fight over him after I die -- he can&#39;t take any more pummeling. I stow Puppy in a drawer of the old Irish desk, but because of his long service to the family, he deserves much better. Rightly, Puppy should lie in state, ensconced in an illuminated lucite display case atop a stately jasper or malachite plinth.&#0160;</p>

<p>This is my favorite chair. It&#39;s made of solid oak and was constructed at the turn of the last century, possibly as early as 1880. In style, it&#39;s cross-cultural, a hybrid -- part European and part pure American. The top rail, the apron and the central splat are Gothic or Renaissance Revival, though they are not carved as they would be if authentic, but pressed. Attached to the stiles are matching extensions, the formal name of which I don&#39;t know, which are pierced with what looks like a double keyhole -- an element of medieval style. But it&#39;s a rocking chair -- and rockers are distinctly American in origin -- sometimes credited to Benjamin Franklin himself. I think it&#39;s a handsome chair, but I must admit that it&#39;s not at all graceful. It&#39;s foursquare and clunky. Tho body sits awkwardly upon the rockers. It&#39;s appropriate for me but it&#39;s not a chair for the dainty.&#0160;</p>
<p>I bought this misbegotten Gothic rocking chair at an auction, either in Fairlee or Thetford, Vermont, in 1970, for $3.75.</p>
<p>The armrests are darkened from fifty years of supporting my sweaty forearms.</p>
<p>There&#39;s been lots of good sitting in this chair.&#0160;</p>

<p>This is a picture, found on the internet, of the Underwood portable that was my dear companion for many years. I bought it for $20 in the summer of 1956 at a second-hand shop on Flatbush Avenue and I brought it with me to college. I even transported it to Vermont for many summers and depended on it until the 1980s when it was superseded by the word processor. In my mind&#39;s ear, the clickety-clack of all those letters home as well as undergraduate and graduate-school essays, and later, typed and re-typed manuscripts, still resonate. My fingertips remember the cupped, pseudo-ivory keys.</p>
<p>It was a sturdy machine, only needing repair once, when, in a moment of compositional enthusiasm, I hit the return bar so hard that I snapped i off. Many were the ribbons that I wore to a frazzle.</p>
<p>I had enrolled in a course in &quot;touch typing&quot; at Erasmus Hall HS -- asa, ada, afa, sdf, for twenty weeks. I took only the first semester of a two-semester sequence because I was interested in the letters and not the numbers. My typing has always been distinguished more by rapidity than by accuracy. I once claimed that I typed so fast that my ribbon would break into flame -- a slight hyperbole (but I admit that have always been a trifle vain about the speed of my fingers). I am a noisy power typist and to this day I bang the keyboard of my computer many times harder than is advisable or necessary. But heck, I learned my craft on an imperfectly lubricated old monster of typewriter, probably purchased by the NYC school district in the 1920s.&#0160;</p>
<p>Where is that old Underwood now? Most likely buried in a landfill somewhere. I should have reverenced it for all the hours we spent together. Given it an honorable retirement.</p>
<p>Rest in peace, partner.</p>

<p>I own no more genuine nor no more dated an artifact than these frames. I wore them during high school, college, and for a few years afterward. They were mighty conventional, but no more than I. In retrospect, I can&#39;t say that they enhanced my manly beauty. The glasses made me, like all my contemporaries, look rather like an owl. For me, the design was camouflage. I was trying to be invisible, but if I had to be seen, I wanted to look as much like everyone else as possible. The frames speak to the moment -- bland, ordinary, ugly.&#0160;</p>
<p>But a few years later, during that period in the 60s and early 70s when there were the bombings on the CCNY campus, anti-war marches and riots, and constant social upheaval, I went rimless:&#0160;</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef0263e95d9e17200b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="IMG_0468" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef0263e95d9e17200b image-full img-responsive" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef0263e95d9e17200b-800wi" title="IMG_0468" /></a></p>
<p>These were frames that I inherited from my father, so my new presentation was part an anti-establishment statement, part paternal homage.&#0160;</p>
<p>However, rimless glasses were not a good choice for a new father with three active grabby young children. They required far too much repair and attention, and so were always in and out of the shop. Eventually I was forced to switch to glasses that were less political but much sturdier&#0160; -- titanium, in fact, which is where I have remained for several decades, resisting design fads such as huge, tiny, aviator and spangled.</p>

<p>It&#39;s called a transplant shovel, and it&#39;s manufactured by Sneeboer, a company located in Holland. If you want to buy a garden tool from Sneeboer, you get on the virtual line, and then wait until your number comes up. Worth waiting.</p>
<p>I have a weakness for well-made garden tools. This one might be the best I own, my favorite, although the Felco #2 hand pruner is also a work of art.</p>
<p>Note the construction. The V-shaped blade is one piece of solid steel. It&#39;s not screwed or bolted to the ash shaft, but rivetted, twice. The &quot;D-handle&quot; itself is carved out of a single solid piece of hardwood, so it can&#39;t fall apart.</p>
<p>I use the shovel to dig plants from crowded areas of the perennial garden to transplant or to separate. It&#39;s also ideal for poaching ferns from the forest. The shovel is the only tool that lets you easily divide a woody clump of Siberian irises (or any other clumping perennial). With a standard spade, when you try to get a little purchase, you fall to left or right or to the ground, endangering your cranky old vertebrae. It&#39;s a superbly balanced tool, a pleasure to use. It&#39;s going to be around for many more years.</p>
<p>We call it the &quot;magic shovel.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s a place setting, sterling silver, &quot;Diamond&quot; pattern,&quot; manufactured by Reed &amp; Barton of Taunton, Massachusetts in 1958. I own nine such place settings as well as a few miscellaneous serving pieces. I like them now but I didn&#39;t back then.</p>
<p>In the 1950s, dear grandchildren, it was considered ideal for respectable middle-class women to marry at a young age; if possible right after university. Or even sooner -- when Althea graduated from high school, her Uncle Mendy, who was never the absolute epitome of tact, said to her, &quot;Don&#39;t worry, you&#39;ll meet someone in college.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>Despite her intelligence and experience, Althea was at heart a conventional small-town girl, and she wanted a wedding with all the trappings -- and the trappings included not just a cheese tray and a fondue pot, but a long white dress and bridesmaids and a bridal registry and china and especially silver.&#0160;</p>
<p>Althea chose &quot;Diamond.&quot; If I was consulted -- I don&#39;t remember -- it wouldn&#39;t have mattered. It was her decision. All I knew was that Althea and I were moving from Ithaca to Massachusetts, I to graduate school and she to a teaching position at Warren JHS in Newton -- and that if I wanted to wake up in the same bed as my beloved, I had to be married (remember, grandchildren, this was the retrogressive Eisenhower era, and men and women did not live together without legal sanction). Apparently, in order to get married, it was necessary to go through a series of utterly mystifying rites, all of which were arranged by Althea and her mother. I was completely indifferent and oblivious to formal wedding invitations and to seating charts and to the choice of music (a piano player I believe) and most especially to the rabbi (who drowned himself in a local lake a month after officiating at our ceremony). Honestly, I felt as though I was just an extra who was trundled onto the set to stand next to the bride and, when called upon, to say &quot;I do.&quot;</p>
<p>But I console myself by remembering that I was not alone --that I was one of an entire generation of bewildered half-grown gawky 1950s bridegrooms in tortoiseshell glasses and borrowed suits.</p>
<p>Once I got my adult legs, I could admit to Althea and to myself that I resented the &quot;Diamond&quot; silver. For 1970s me, it embodied and symbolized everything that I disliked about the conservative prudish postwar culture into which both of us had been indoctrinated. With the advent of the war in Vietnam, the civil rights movement, and the series of ghastly assassinations, the silver became, to me, an index of bourgeois conformity and pretense. It offended me, deeply. And therefore the silver utensils went into the closet and remained there for 35 or 40 years.&#0160;</p>
<p>When we shifted to this new address, in 2009, I took the silver out of its banishment. I looked with new apolitical eyes. &quot;Wow -- these things are beautiful.&quot; The utensils were not elaborate, or fancy, or pseudo-baroque like most such tableware, but clean, modest, spare, understated, and not at bit pretentious. In retrospect, Althea had astonishing judgment and extraordinary taste.</p>
<p>Upon investigation, I discovered that Diamond silverware is highly regarded and much prized. It is, in the language of enthusiasts of mid-century modernism, &quot;important.&quot; It was created by Gio Ponti, who was, one might say, the Frank Lloyd Wright of twentieth-century Italian designers. Among his other achievements, Gio Ponti was the architect of the celebrated Denver Art Museum.&#0160;</p>
<p>So now, at long last, I&#39;ve restored the Diamond silverware to a place of honor, and I enjoy setting the table with these sleek utensils. And I&#39;m as pleased as punch that none of my guests realize that when they spear that last fragment of barbecued chicken, they do so with a fork of distinction.&#0160;</p>

                                <p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef0263e95c7bd8200b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="IMG_0454" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef0263e95c7bd8200b img-responsive" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef0263e95c7bd8200b-800wi" title="IMG_0454" />I</a></p>
<p>It&#39;s not a very good picture, but then, I&#39;m not a very good photographer. It&#39;s a Tibetan rug, monochromatic and undramatic, but in my opinion, extremely handsome. Sometime during the 1970s, a store selling Tibetan antiques opened in Boulder, stayed with us for a very few months, and then closed. I fell deeply and passionately in love with this rug, all the more so because its price was greatly reduced during the closing fire-sale.&#0160;</p>
<p>The rug is supposed to be &quot;old&quot; and it certainly wasn&#39;t recently knotted. It was represented to me as being made of yak hair, but MP, our rug expert, fingered it and said, &quot;No, that&#39;s wool.&quot; MP wouldn&#39;t hazard a guess about its age, but he did enlighten me about the symbolism: the three cranes in the center panel signify longevity; the four corner figures are &quot;happy bats,&quot; and happiness is also figured by the four very small, almost unnoticeable, swastikas. So it&#39;s a joyful rug. There are also many snakes and a number of figures that MP couldn&#39;t identify. It&#39;s remotely possible that this rug was originally some sort of monastic bench cover and that each of the crane figures represented a place to sit. I doubt this theory because the sitters would have had to be very small monks with tiny tushies.</p>

                                <p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef026be40853c7200d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="IMG_0461" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef026be40853c7200d image-full img-responsive" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef026be40853c7200d-800wi" title="IMG_0461" /></a></p>
<p>When we moved to Manhattan, in 1965, for a first real job, we had hardly a stick of furniture. We thought we needed, in addition to a bed and a kitchen table, a bench for an entrance hall. Wandering around Greenwich Village (Althea was very big with child), we stumbled into an antique store, one of scores that populated the area in those pre-Ebay days. Pisces Antiques, it was called and it was owned by a young English woman named Kim Sylvester. (Isn&#39;t it astonishing that I remember these details?) This bench (properly a settle) caught our eye, not the least because it cost half as much as a functional bland modern equivalent at Macy&#39;s or Wanamaker. &quot;What is it?, I asked. Kim said, &quot;English, Jacobean, about 1650.&quot; And so it was. A surprise.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve since learned a bit about seventeenth-century English furniture and I&#39;m convinced that the large back panel is genuine. It&#39;s late medieval in style and exhibits all three of the kinds of carving that are typical of the age. The four central panels (stylized poppy on the outsides, stylized thistle on the insides) are called &quot;recessed ground.&quot; Separating the flowered panels are pieces that are &quot;gouge&quot; carved. The crosspiece at the top is &quot;incised.&quot; As for the body of the settle, I suspect it&#39;s not very ancient, but instead assembled from old wood by a furniture maker who had respect for the carved back and wanted to re-use or re-purpose it. When was this reconstruction accomplished? It might have been anytime before 1965, but most probably during the long 19th century. Possibly during the so-called gothic revival period in the 1880s and 1890s.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve admired this settle for 55 years. Nowadays It sits proudly just to the right of our entrance door. I like it that our guests pile their coats and bags on the Jacobean settle when they enter our home, not noticing that this discreet piece of furniture is old and rare and singular. No one asks about it and I don&#39;t tell. It&#39;s my secret.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef026bde8f1cc9200c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="IMG_20200902_104147 (1)" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef026bde8f1cc9200c image-full img-responsive" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef026bde8f1cc9200c-800wi" title="IMG_20200902_104147 (1)" /></a></p>
<p>This unassuming object played, and continues to play, a consequential part in my life. It&#39;s a plain brass bell, unadorned, maker and age unknown. It&#39;s not musical but when properly agitated it can make a helluva loud noise. It was given to my mother in 1947 by her mother, my grandmother, Sonia Green. How my grandmother came into possession of the bell, I don&#39;t know and can&#39;t imagine. A mystery.</p>
<p>I begged it sometime in the late 1960s and have owned it ever since,</p>
<p>My family spent the summers of 1947-48-49 at Makamah Beach on the north shore of Long Island. It was the high point of my childhood; I&#39;ve written about those glorious summers right <a class="asset-img-link" href="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef026be4084109200d-pi" style="display: inline;">here.</a> The function of the bell was to call me and my two brothers in for lunch or dinner. The clang traveled well even against the whoosh of the wind and the rhythm of the surf. There I&#39;d be, all alone, studying shells or snails somewhere along the shore or on a sandbar, hungry, and I&#39;d hear the insistent jangle and hurry home. My brother Jon says that to this day he can&#39;t hear the peculiar noise of this bell without salivating.&#0160;</p>
<p>The bell was equally useful, a generation later, when my own independent, wild children wandered freely around our Hackett Hill property. It rang, they returned. I wonder if they associate its sound with corn-on-the-cob and hamburgers. They have ample reason to do so.</p>
<p>And even now, of summers, when it&#39;s the hour for food, or just time to call the day to a close, out comes the bell, and children, grandchildren, and guests respond to its harsh but historic call.</p>

                                <p>For me, the summer and autumn of 2010 was a bad period, even though it led to the only moment of prayer and reverence in my entire life. Readers and fans of this blague know that I have more than once reported that I was born into a purely, even aggressively, atheistic family and that have remained an unquestioning atheist to this day. So what happened, you ask, in 2010 to cause me to lapse once and only once from a lifelong want of belief?</p>
<p>It began with a ruptured disc, which is, as fellow-sufferers know so well, an extremely painful condition. Surgery was recommended, but by every statistical measure, surgery works only half the time, and therefore I was reluctant and frightened to be cut, and instead figured that if I could just wait out the pain, perhaps the affliction would heal itself, as, I was assured, it usually does. So I lay on my back, crawled to the bathroom once a day, and started taking drugs. Powerful drugs: oxycodons every four hours, those big 600 mg ibuprofens several times a day, lots of valium to deal with the agitation, steroids (some by mouth and some injected directly into my back), and because of the insomnia, more ambien than was absolutely necessary along with some other miscellaneous pills and tablets, the names of which I can&#39;t quite recall. It was my fault, in part -- I had too many doctors and no one was in charge, so various medical people prescribed various pills, and because I was in such pain, I gobbled them all.&#0160;</p>
<p>After two months, I was still in acute debilitating pain and I had to face the fact that my plan wasn&#39;t working and that something had to be done. I submitted to surgery at the end of August down there at the Mary Hitchcock Hospital in Lebanon. Relief was instantaneous -- why had I waited so long? But I was now faced with the problem of drug withdrawal. Not having good medical advice, I became the coldest of turkeys.&#0160;</p>
<p>My digestive system went completely out of whack. For days, perhaps two or three weeks, I could tolerate only the blandest foods. I survived on baked potatoes and very little else. My heartbeat was very high and settled to an even 110 for six weeks. I was agitated and nervous.I suffered from dramatic night sweats -- two or three times I woke up with nightclothes soaked and dripping. Muscle cramps.</p>
<p>And also severe constipation which led to badly bleeding hemorrhoids. For six weeks, whenever I had to &quot;honor a call of nature,&quot; I&#39;d look into the pot -- bright bright red. Day after day. &quot;O no! When is this going to end?&quot; And then one blessed day -- and here at last comes the moment of pure religion -- I hesitantly inspected the bowl, and miracle of miracles-- no blood. And I cried out, spontaneously, without forethought, these words: &quot;Glory be to God.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>What god? I wasn&#39;t in a theological frame of mind, but in retrospect, it may have been Cloacina, the Roman goddess of sewers, to whom I directed my fervent thanks. Or possibly Sterquilinus, although he was more a god of manure and fertilizer than of the toilet bowl.</p>
<p>The good old Romans -- a god for all occasions! Even for me.</p>

<p>This sugar and creamer are the only objecs I own that deserve to be in a museum. They were made by Bauhaus potter Marguerite Wildenhain at her Pond Farm studio in Guerneville, California, near the Russian River, sometime around 1972. I don&#39;t think that the picture captures the strength or beauty of the workmanship. They&#39;re beautifully thrown, beautifully glazed. To eye or hand they convey almost magical power.</p>
<p>My charismatic, chaotic sister (technically sister-in-law) Phyllis brought these to us from Guerneville, where she studied pottery for three or four summers with &quot;Marguerite.&quot; We sent her some cash to buy pots by the artist but these were the only ones that we actually received. Phyllis bought many but she couldn&#39;t bear to part with them. And then one by one her treasured possessions would slip out of her hand or be knocked off the shelf by her cats or otherwise wind up as shards. For many years after Phyl&#39;s untimely death I preserved in a shoebox the shattered bits of one of Marguerite&#39;s most magnificent creations -- a landscape pot which depicted&#0160; a dozen or so cavorting animals. Where is that shoebox now?</p>
<p>I rarely use these works of art -- they&#39;re too magnificent to put at risk.&#0160;</p>
<p>On the bottom of the creamer, still visible next to the words &quot;Pond Farm,&quot; Marguerite has pencilled a price: $12.50. But it&#39;s priceless.</p>

<p>Althea bought this rug at an auction in Warren, New Hampshire in 1968 -- and it is the first rug we ever owned -- the first of many. I was startled when she bid on it because we were in the market for crockery and glasses and chairs, not for decorative objects, but she saw and appreciated its beauty. It&#39;s a rug for a wall because it&#39;s too old and fragile to be tread upon by the shod. Rug expert MP says that it&#39;s from the Caucasus -- specifically it&#39;s a Konaghend Kuba -- from the late nineteenth century. Of course we didn&#39;t have the faintest idea of its provenance but we knew that it was very appealing. In fact, I was so inattentive that I owned and admired the rug for forty years before I noticed that it was a prayer rug -- the mihrab is not much pronounced. Nor did I appreciate the abrash; the indigo blue ground disappears two thirds of the way down. It&#39;s probable that the woman who wove it ran out of wool from a particular dye lot, but it&#39;s also possible that the weaver was nomadic.&#0160;</p>
<p>When Althea lived in Washington for a year in the 1990s, she took this rug with her -- the only personal possession (aside from clothes, of course) that she brought. And then many years later when she entered the Alzheimer&#39;s institution, I hung it on the wall facing her bed. I thought it would be a comfort to her -- but alas she did not remember or recognize it. When she died I&#0160; brought it back home where it belongs.</p>

<p>This appealing pitcher and vase set were thrown by Ben Owen II, a potter who lived and worked in Seagrove, North Carolina. In September of 1966, we visited Tom and Margaret in Chapel Hill and they took us on an excursion to Seagrove, where we bought these fine works of art. Ben Owen was very much a traditionalist, sticking closely to tried-and-true shapes and glazes. He was &quot;old-fashioned,&quot; and I am equally so. Lots of weird things have been done with clay during the last sixty years, but these shapes are more pleasing to my eye than modernistic distortions and abstractions.</p>
<p>The glaze is called &quot;frogspit&quot; but &quot;frogskin&quot; would make more sense.</p>
<p>When I moved to a new home in 2009, the Ben Owen pots disappeared. I thought they had been lost in the move, but after a couple of years of searching, I located them. In fact, I had packed them so carefully and securely that they were virtually buried. But I persevered.</p>
<p>These splendid objects have now (except when they went AWOL) been on prominent display wherever I&#39;ve lived for more than half a century. It&#39;s curious, and a fact, that not one guest has ever asked a single question about them. They&#39;ve not been noticed. Are my friends unobservant?</p>
<p>I think that the pitcher and the vase are so discreetly beautiful that they don&#39;t demand attention, a fact which makes me love them all the more.&#0160;</p>

<p>I bought these water glasses (sometimes called tumblers) about 35 years at a long defunct antique shop in Lafayette, Colorado. They fall into the large category known as Depression Glass in the trade and they were probably manufactured in the 1940&#39;s or 50&#39;s -- but that&#39;s just an unsupported speculation on my part. I don&#39;t know the name of the manufacturer so they are works of art without provenance. I love the clean lines -- straight at the base and then slightly flared at the top -- and also the way the glasses fit so elegantly into the human hand. The tumblers are entirely unadorned and if they have a style other than vernacular I suppose they might be called Art Deco. I once had a few more of these tumblers -- perhaps as many as eight, but because they are in constant use there have been losses. There&#39;s no saying how long these beauties will survive -- the rims are a bit fragile and vulnerable in the dishwasher. Although they have no monetary value, they are in my opinion both classy and classic.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p><em>Mogambo</em> (1953), directed by John Ford, is an eternal-triangle story in which earthy Ava Gardner and prim Grace Kelly compete for white hunter Clark Gable. Unfortunately, it&#39;s less engaging as a romance than as a travelogue -- it offers spectacular footage of African megafauna (hippos, giraffes, lions, gorillas, etc.).</p>
<p>Whenever I watch classic films set in &quot;the colonies,&quot; I&#39;m fearful that the native people will be exoticized and orientalized and trivialized, but I&#39;m happy to report that <em>Mogambo</em> is less offensively Tarzanish than most -- setting aside a couple of embarrassing &quot;fakelore&quot; episodes. I would have been even happier if the Africans weren&#39;t just animated wallpaper -- bearers or rowers or dancers or spear-throwers -- and that they weren&#39;t depicted as entirely subservient to their white overlords. <em>Mogambo</em> is based on Victor Fleming&#39;s pre-Code <em>Red Dus</em>t (1931) -- a much more sensual film than <em>Mogambo</em> and one which allowed Jean Harlow lots of room to wink and flirt. It&#39;s most odd that the glamorous sexy hunter in both <em>Red Dust&#0160;</em>and <em>Mogambo&#0160;</em>is played by Clark Gable - a rare example of filmic auto-reprising. He&#39;s hyper-masculine, at age 30, in <em>Red Dust</em> but in <em>Mogambo</em> it&#39;s too too obvious that his hair has been dyed a shiny black. When he pounces on Ava and Grace and mashes their mouths with unpersuasive 50s kisses, it is taken for granted that both ladies will immediately grow weak in the knees.&#0160;</p>
<p>I grew even less Gable-dazzled when I discovered a weird anecdote in Donald Sinden&#39;s recollection of the filming of <em>Mogambo</em>. (Sinden played the part of Grace Kelly&#39;s spineless, intellectual, oblivious husband). Sinden reports that (prepare yourself to be stunned and disillusioned):&#0160;</p>
<p><em>before leaving camp on the first morning [of shooting] I had been told to report to the hair-dressing department&#39;s tent, where I found the make-up men armed with electric clippers: &#39;I have to remove the hair from your chest.&#39; &#39;Whatever for?&#39; I asked, &#39;Orders.&#39; It transpired that Clark [Gable], whose chest was completely devoid of hair, had always insisted that no other actor should appear on film exposing a hirsute breast. This included any member of the crew not wearing a shirt as well. He considered it a slight on his masculinity.</em></p>
<p>Surely, this is one of the most bizarre anecdotes in movie history. The King of Hollywood, the legend whose mere presence famously set roomfuls of maidens all a-quiver, was so sexually insecure that he required mass depilation of cast and crew! Follicular fragility! Big-time nuttiness?&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>Question: was it in Clark&#39;s contract that he had the right to dictate the degree of chest shagginess of cast and crew -- or was he just throwing his weight around?&#0160; Suppose Sinden or some sweaty best boy had refused the electric clippers. Would the production have ground to a halt?&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>It&#39;s well known that since the time of Samson and probably before, male hair has been associated with strength, but even Delilah didn&#39;t set out to defoliate every man in Gaza.</p>
<p>But Clark Gable&#39;s chest hair insecurity is only Donald Sinden&#39;s second most curious anecdote. Even more astonishing, at least to me, is that Sinden suffered from &quot;negative buoyancy.&quot; Negative buoyancy is a condition in which a person is unable to float in water. In Sinden&#39;s case, negative buoyancy was discovered, he says, while filming a shipwreck scene in <em>The Cruel Sea (</em>1953<em>).</em>&#0160;Sinden started to sink and was rescued from drowning by his co-star Jack Hawkins.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-memoirs_49-1"></sup></p>
<p>Almost all human beings float. Bob like corks. I don&#39;t, and neither did my father nor my male descendants. As a family, we&#39;re sinkers. I don&#39;t know why, except that perhaps we have an eccentric specific gravity or because our swim bladders go on the fritz, like sick fish. We regularly and uniformly plunge to the bottom, like a stone or a heavy lump of lead.&#0160;</p>
<p>How wonderful to know that there is a dignified name for our peculiar family trait: &quot;negative buoyancy.&quot;</p>
<p>And now we can be consoled that we&#39;re not alone.&#0160;</p>
<p>There&#39;s got to be a support group for the negatively buoyant out there, somewhere.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I stand, like most in my cohort who have lived ordinary, conventional lives, at the midpoint of a continuum stretching from grandparents to grandchildren -- at an imaginary apex looking backward and forward, Janus-like. I remember my grandparents, though only at the end of their long lives, and I know my grandchildren, though only at the beginnings of theirs. Two generations back, two generations forward and with 81-year-old me at the fulcrum.</p>
<p>It&#39;s been a long eventful tramp from there to here. My grandfather Isaiah was born in 1863, a hundred and sixty seven long years ago, and my youngest grandchildren, the twins Caleb and Asher, joined us just five years ago, in 2015. Although it was only an instant in geological terms, nevertheless, the interval from my grandfather&#39;s birth to this moment has seen glaciers melt, rivers change their course, cities arise, plants and animals go extinct, governments and empires grow and decline, wars and epidemics rattle the planet. He lived in a world of serfs and rabbis and pogroms; the grandchildren live in a world of nuclear proliferation, global warming, threats to democracy.</p>
<p>There have also been tectonic shifts in the microcosm of my own family. My Ukrainian-born grandparents would not recognize my third-generation American-born grandchildren, and my grandchildren would have an even more impossible task to understand or appreciate the lives of the great-great-grandparents. It&#39;s a long leap from StaryConstantine, old Constantine, in the nineteenth century, where my family originated in backward village Ukraine to Washington DC or northern California or Boulder Colorado in the twenty-first. Rural to urban, agricultural to technical, provincial to worldly, religious to secular, inbred to genetically various. My grandparents were born into a world of carts and horses; my grandchildren play with computers in their cribs. Yet here we are.</p>
<p>We&#39;re the same, but different. According to family legend, my grandfather Isaiah left StaryConstantine and his family of origin because of a dispute about religion. They, his father and family, were devout but he was a non-believer. In this regard, Isaiah was a true patriarch, because he established an enduring family template. Over the generations, we remain hostile or sometimes only indifferent to religion -- and in its place we embrace the evidence of the senses and the primacy of reason. Looking backward and forward from my pinnacle, I cannot identify a single lapsed atheist or backslider in the family landscape. I know that my father never attended a house of worship except for a rare funeral or wedding. For him, the sabbath was sacred only to his roses and azaleas. I once asked him if his father, Isaiah, had ever visited a synagogue. He said, &quot;I can&#39;t swear about what happened in the Ukraine, but I know that once he got here he never did.&quot; For Isaiah, atheism would have been a revolutionary fracturing; for subsequent generations, not even slightly stressful. The <a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2019/01/the-precious-gift-of-atheism.html">precious gift of atheism</a> I once called it.</p>
<p>What has replaced religion? Our extended family remains a people of the book. Among my grandfather&#39;s forty-seven direct descendant, thirty-five of whom are alive, six have written books, another is a journalist, and five others have earned law degrees, where not unlike the older generations of Talmudists, they can engage in disputations over nice sharp quillets of the law. There are no rabbis, but I can count at least ten teachers of one secular subject or another. My grandfather had no official schooling, but every one of his great grandchildren is a college graduate and many of them have post-graduate degrees.</p>
<p>There are some families that can boast of painters or violinists or actors in their old world heritage; not ours. Nor have we become creative or imaginative in the new world. I count no poets, no musicians, no actors, and except for my outlier brother who once wrote a novel and now makes bricolage sculptures, no artists. If we make anything, it&#39;s useful. Furniture or pottery -- not paintings. But then, no criminals or alcoholics or wastrels either. We&#39;re substantial reliable citizens -- firmly nouveau bourgeois. We may be conventional and dull, but we are what my father used to call, without irony and with great pride, solid, tax-paying citizens.&#0160;</p>

                                <p>The last time, a decade ago, that I needed a rug pad, I went hunting at various malls and shops that might stock such an item. After a few exhausting hours, I located an appropriate-size rug pad at one of those large import stores -- it may have been Pier 1 or WorldMarket. The quality wasn&#39;t quite right, and the pad was too large and too costly, but it was there --&#0160; and I do possess a utility knife with a very sharp blade. So I bought it, struggled with it, but -- it worked, and it&#39;s still there, doing its job, padding the Heriz.&#0160;</p>
<p>This time, covid-time, I&#39;m not allowed to search around town, and I don&#39;t want to, so instead I did some internet sleuthing for &quot;rug pad.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#39;s a revelation -- there are many, many vendors very anxious to satisfy my rug pad needs: RugPad <span style="color: #ff0000;">U<span style="color: #0000ff;">S<span style="color: #d0d0d0;">A</span></span></span>, Mr.RugPad, RugPads &#39;R Us, Rugpad-orama, eSaleRugPads, RugPadStock, RugPadHome, RugPadSolutions, Dr. Pad, RugPad World, Royal-T RugPads, Underfoot-Inc, and My Rug Pad, among others. Costco sells a &quot;Mohawk&quot; rug pad made of &quot;100% post industrial recycled synthetic fibers with all natural rubber with SBR latex backing,&quot; whatever that is, not cut to exact size, and you have to buy a shrink-wrapped package of four.</p>
<p>I choose RugPad<span style="color: #ff0000;">U<span style="color: #0000ff;">S<span style="color: #d0d0d0;">A </span></span></span>not only for patriotic reasons but because its site featured a lengthy explanatory essay on the potential disasters, hazards and glories of various species of rug pads. Are you not shocked to learn that that some inferior rug pad manufacturers pad out their fiber with clay?&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>RugPad <span style="color: #ff0000;">U<span style="color: #0000ff;">S<span style="color: #d0d0d0;">A </span></span></span>is a company that takes its rug pads very seriously. I am now up to snuff on Grip, Cushion, Longevity, Sustainability, Safety, and Made-in-America-ness. And also on materials: rubber, jute, felt, Pure Wool, hemp, and memory foam, in their various forms and combinations (and prices).</p>
<p>I went with an &quot;eco friendly Nature&#39;s Grip 100% natural rubber and plant jute.&quot; It arrived in four days, cut to exact measure. Perfect. This rug pad is so beautiful, let me tell you, that I&#39;m thinking of laying it on top and putting the old tribal Turkish Varamin tent rug underneath. Well, maybe I&#39;m getting too enthusiastic about my glorious new rug pad.</p>
<p>Advantages to internet shopping: it lets your fingers do the walking, there are an infinity of choices, and after a while the item appears miraculously outside your door. Disadvantages: you can&#39;t see or feel the product before making a decision; it&#39;s a pain to return mistakes; your cash goes to an absentee merchant (RugPad <span style="color: #ff0000;">U<span style="color: #0000ff;">S<span style="color: #d0d0d0;">A </span></span></span>is located in Connecticut); local shops suffer, and also, slightly delayed gratification. But the electronic mall is definitely the way we shop now.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>When I was a boy in the 1940s and &#39;50s, I was -- yearly or semi-yearly -- hauled off to gatherings of the E &amp; L Chafetz Family Circle. &quot;Chafetz&quot; was the maiden name of my maternal grandmother, Sonia Green. &quot;E&quot; and &quot;L&quot; were Sonia&#39;s parents, but the names that the initials abbreviated are gone for good. At the Family Circle, twenty or thirty or sometimes even forty Chafetz siblings, cousins, and spouses would share snacks, schnapps, and gossip. No question but that, selfish and un-empathetic lad that I was, I very much resented being scrubbed and fancied up to attend these meetings -- especially on a summer Sunday afternoon when the Brooklyn Dodgers might be playing a double-header. Why would a young scamp want to miss out on Red Barber and Connie Desmond in order to hang from a subway strap for an hour and a half while the stifling IRT rattled to some obscure corner of the Bronx -- just to while away the afternoon with a bunch of old folks?</p>
<p>The Chafetz relatives were all immigrants from Belarus and thereabouts, born, like my grandparents, in the 1870s or 1880s. They were small people -- tiny really -- the men topping out at or 5&#39;3&quot; or&#0160; 5&#39;4&quot;, the women at 5&#39;0&quot; or somewhat less -- their stature a consequence of their impoverished &quot;old country&quot; childhoods. They spoke Yiddish or Russian to each other and very rudimentary English to me. They smelled peculiarly -- of chicken soup overlaid with moth balls, their &quot;good clothes&quot; having been retrieved from the storage closet for this annual adventure. They assembled, if I remember correctly, at the second-floor apartment over someone&#39;s store. (It seemed as though they were all keepers of small shops -- newspaper kiosks or vegetable markets or candy stores or perhaps a delicatessen or an &quot;appetizer.&quot; One enterprising Chafetz cousin was a glazier.) They seemed to be mostly childless -- or, at least I can&#39;t remember encountering any other youths at these events.</p>
<p>Who were these people? Why were they so asymmetrical? Bent and twisted, most of them, their faces marred by blackheads and lumps and swellings. Their mouths were dental nightmares. Must I admit that my ten-year-old self was repelled and disgusted, unconscious that their distorted bodies were a testament to their arduous troubled lives?</p>
<p>Who was Uncle Joe Pessin? How was he related to me? What was his livelihood? I remember only a small dark bald man with a grating voice. Did he have a family?&#0160; And who were indistinguishable Lifscha and Leah? Were they twins or sisters or sisters-in-law? Why did Uncle Usher smell so pungently? Was he in the pickle or sauerkraut business? I know only that he had a great expanse of face and outsized shoulders and that he longed to visit his brothers and sisters in Winnipeg.&#0160;</p>
<p>At these gatherings, I was put on display. My mother (my father refused to attend) would take me around the room and introduce me to the various cousins and uncles and aunts. It was a torment, frankly. &quot;This is your uncle Nahum.&quot; Uncle Nahum would shake my hand. I had nothing to say to him, but Uncle Nahum asked the question that was every uncle&#39;s question. &quot;How are you doing? You doing well in school?&quot;&#0160; &quot;Yes, I&#39;m doing well in school.&quot; And so this uncle would smile beneficently upon me. And then on to the next one.&#0160;</p>
<p>Because of what I perceived as their limited communication skills (though English might have been Uncle Nahum&#39;s fourth or fifth language), I definitely felt superior and condescending -- an acute embarrassment to me now. In my heart, I silently patronized these strange people.</p>
<p>What I didn&#39;t know, and is so obvious now, was that I was much more important to them than they were to me. That I was &quot;doing well in school&quot; were words that they dearly wanted to hear. It was for my generation and for me that they had braved the Cossacks, sold the farm, deserted from the Russian army, left backward Belarus or Ukraine behind, endured the miseries of steerage, slept four to a bed for years and half-acclimated themselves to a new world utterly foreign to them. For me. They had sacrificed themselves to invest in me. So that I could &quot;do well in school,&quot; go to college, live a better life. I was their emissary to America, to the future.</p>
<p>What could a ten-year-old have possibly known?&#0160; It&#39;s too late to regret that I didn&#39;t learn their language and learn their stories. That world of theirs, that universe represented by E and L Chafetz --- it&#39;s all gone now, vanished, present no where else but in my failing memory.&#0160;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Famous literary doppelgangers include Mr. Hyde, William Wilson, the picture in Dorian Grey&#39;s attic, Leggatt, and Golyadkin Jr. In film, there are the sisters, or twins, Kate and Patricia Bosworth, both played by Bette Davis and no doubt many more that I don&#39;t know or remember that professional movie historians could add. Doubles abound in the world of make-believe, but also occur in &quot;real life.&quot; I&#39;ve had two doppelgangers of my very own. They are not official or clinical doubles but they definitely manifest or &quot;outer&quot; fears that are embedded in the less accessible parts of my brain -- they&#39;re my own personal Sir Smiles. They have haunted me because they embodied the terror of what I might have been or what might have happened to me if I dropped my guard. I never spoke to either of these individuals -- only observed them at a fearful distance.</p>
<p>Many decades ago, when I was a graduate student, there was a rumor in circulation among my peers that 50% of the students who finished their classwork and comprehensive exams never completed their dissertations. Naturally, I was afraid that I that I might fall into that ABD black hole. In those days, I haunted Widener Library&#39;s vast reading room and there it was that I encountered my first dreaded doppelganger. He was a bespectacled gloomy fellow, not unlike me, but taller, ganglier, and, I think, homelier. The story was that he had been working on his dissertation for 17 years. After I would sit I down to work in a morning, he&#39;d wander in, choose a place, open his briefcase, spread out his books and papers on the table, sharpen his pencils and then, after a quarter of an hour, get up and walk out and come back a few minutes later with a copy of <em>The New York Times</em>. He&#39;d read the paper in a leisurely manner, then put it aside and turn to his dissertation. After a while, he would check his watch and then go out for a cup of coffee. Shortly afterward, it was lunchtime; then it was time for tea, and then came the hour to pack up and go home. Did he do an hour&#39;s work during the day; not much more, maybe less.</p>
<p>Of course I feared that I could turn into this fellow. I suspect that it was good for me to be presented with such a scary doppelganger. His negative example forced me to keep my nose to the grindstone. Without Sir Procrastination, who knows, I might be sitting at that library table to this day, pretending to write that damn dissertation.</p>
<p>My second doppelganger is equally frightening but more contemporary. He&#39;s a pathetic guy who lives right here in Boulder -- somewhere nearby, because he frequently passes my window on his way to the mall, where he hits people up for spare change. He looks alarmingly like me -- same size, same shape, roughly of my age, though grayer and balder and dirtier. I could have been him if a single one of my genes on a single chromosome had failed. There I would be, living alone in a small room stacked to the gills with newspapers and magazines, living off welfare and emerging only to shout leftist slogans at passers-by. Doppelganger #2 is a crazy defective version of myself; a secret sharer who embodies my deepest fears.&#0160;</p>
<p>I confess that I hate these two guys, not for themselves but because I know that I could have been them if I hadn&#39;t been lucky.</p>

                                <p>I think it was Oscar Wilde who said that the most terrifying words in the English language were, &quot;I want to tell you about my dream.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I persist.</p>
<p>Last night, I came out of a train station in Berlin (a city I&#39;ve never visited in my daytime life) but instead of a valise or luggage I had only a banjo case, with a banjo inside and room for a couple of pair of socks at most. But I thought, I have cash and I can buy clothes. Then I looked in my wallet and found only a couple of one-dollar bills. I thought, now I&#39;m in trouble. Nevertheless, I persisted, and set out for my hotel. Then it started to rain, pour actually, and I realized that I wasn&#39;t wearing proper shoes, just flimsy slippers. Next I came to understand that I had no idea where to find my hotel.&#0160;</p>
<p>So there I am with a banjo on my knee but nowhere to go, no cash, no proper clothes, no hotel, in an unfamiliar strange city.</p>
<p>But now comes the &quot;agency&quot; part. I announce, to no one in particular, &quot;I don&#39;t want to be in this dream.&quot; And I woke up.</p>
<p>I&#39;m very proud of myself for taking charge. A good precedent for tomorrow&#39;s nightmare.</p>

Shortcuts generally take me the long way around. Does a firewall keep them out or me in? Kibibytes are things you would feed to a pooch. A logic gate is beyond my capacity of reasoning. My netiquette is primitive and when I have nodes I take them to the surgeon. Do I have a KVM switch?&#0160; Dunno. My firmware, frankly, is not what it used to be. My warmboot is frayed; my virtualization illusory.</p>
<p>I may not speak or understand the language of the present generation, but like most members of my age cohort I can identify the skate key, &quot;the cheese stands alone,&quot; the alligator pear, a mustard plaster, &quot;you owe your crowning glory to,/ your something something shampoo,&quot; &quot;L-A-V-A,&quot; &quot;and away-y-y we go,&quot; House Jameson, cod liver oil, Adrien Baillargeon the Canadian strongman, J.

<p>Alas for a youthful population who imagines that the Pontiac 13 was a group of anti-government demonstrators or that Apples Kudelka was a middle European dessert. And doesn&#39;t know the difference between Sparkle Plenty and Good &#39;n Plenty.</p>

                                <p>I&#39;m a movie lover, but I&#39;m not indiscriminate. Here follows a list of common movie occurrences that compel me either to seek out nineteenth-century novels or force me to bury my head under the blankets.&#0160;</p>
<p>1. Cute puppies, especially when the boy and the girl kiss for the first time, and the director, unfazed by cliche or rank sentimentality, cuts to the pooch&#39;s just darling head-tilt. Even worse when the doggie covers his cute eyes with his cute paw. Aaargh.</p>
<p>2. Child actors, with rare exceptions. Some few gifted children know how to be natural, but most just make me cringe.&#0160;</p>
<p>3. Gratuitous killing of &quot;redskins,&quot; especially when aestheticized. How gracefully, when shot by the cavalry marksmen, do the Comanches plummet from the face of the cliff or tumble down the scree. In Western after Western, they take huge losses -- presenting themselves as targets while they ride crazily around the circled wagons -- a strategy that is cinematic but nonsensical. And also: all the retrogressive, antediluvian blackface and yellowface and brownface stereotypes that make us gasp with horror at our racist forebears.</p>
<p>4. Those far too frequent scenes, where the guy, pursued either by the police or the husband, goes out the 16th story window of his hotel and works his way across a narrow ledge to another window (always unlocked). Such scenes give me the willies.</p>
<p>5. Car chases. Boring, boring, boring. I&#39;ve discussed this <a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2008/02/car-chases.html ">in the past. </a></p>
<p>6. Montage dating scenes: boy and girl meet cute. After the mandatory misunderstanding, they reconcile, and then we see five seconds of them sitting in a restaurant, smiling; next they&#39;re rowing in a boat in the park; then they&#39;re on a ferry, or at a picnic etc. etc. From this we are supposed to deduce that they&#39;re in love. Predictable cut to the predictable soft-focus bedroom. Romance, which ought to be thrilling, becomes, through repetition and want of originality, almost as boring as a car chase.</p>
<p>7. Funny drunks. They&#39;re not funny. Alcoholism is a destructive disease.&#0160;</p>
<p>8. The scene in which the stoic hero has taken a bullet in the shoulder and it&#39;s going to be extracted by an amateur. No anesthetics. &quot;Here, bite on this.&quot; Even worse, if possible, when it&#39;s not a bullet but an arrow.</p>
<p>9. Background music that dictates the emotions we are supposed to feel. Worse still, the background noise that is currently so fashionable. Not music, just a loud drone, which sometimes drowns the dialogue.</p>
<p>10. Zachary Scott</p>
<p>Also, movies adapted from cartoons: Batman, Superman, etc. Horror films, designed to scare the pants off you. I can&#39;t bear to watch them (I&#39;ve never recovered from <em>Abbott and Costello Meet</em> <em>Frankenstein</em> [1948]). Action films, especially ones in which a retired CIA agent or detective or whatever is called back to duty for one last assignment. And finally, anything with zombies, cyborgs, extraterrestrials, robots, demonic children who vomit blood, or tentacles.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>This entry is written at the specific instruction of my daughter, who says, &quot;your grandchildren will want to know about your birth. It&#39;s their history too.&quot; The following paragraphs are for them and for their descendants.</p>
<p>My older sister, Susan, died of pneumonia at the age of nine months on March 15, 1938. If she had lived, I wouldn&#39;t exist, nor would my ten descendants, and no one would notice.</p>
<p>I was born on March 11, 1939, just one year minus four days after Susan died. It seems obvious that I was purposely conceived as a substitute for the dead child -- and it therefore follows that I was delivered into a disrupted, stressed family. Was I to be treasured as a compensation for past grief or to be resented as an imperfect interloper? Or both, simultaneously? To raise the ante, it is also a fact that during that fatal March of 1938 when Susan lay dying, my older brother Eugene, then just shy of three years of age, was gravely ill of the same disease that killed his younger sister, and that although he was at death&#39;s door, he managed to pull through.</p>
<p>So let us consider the situation of my parents, Manny and Lil, in June of 1938, the month of my conception. Poor Susan lay a-mouldering in her tiny grave for just three months. The Great Depression was still going strong and Hitler&#39;s Nuremberg Laws had been in force since 1935. Father Coughlin, celebrity Jew-hater, was agitating thirty million American radio listeners a week. Kristallnacht was just five months away and most everyone knew that war was imminent. Residing on East 9th Street in Flatbush were my grief-stricken young parents, who had helplessly watched one child die and had come within a hairbreadth of losing another. We must imagine them reeling, tearful, clinging to one another, dealing as best they might with heartbreaking anxiety and pain. Yet despite public and personal disasters, they made the courageous choice to throw the dice again, and out of their anguish to bring forth another child -- and to run the real risk, in those pre-antibiotic days, of offering still another sacrifice to pneumonia or some other dread incurable illness.</p>
<p>If my parents were still alive, I&#39;d congratulate them, celebrate them, not because their resilience produced me, but because to beget a substitute child in chaotic, dangerous 1938 seems to me, now, looking back from the perspective of 2020, to be an act of unfathomable courage.</p>
<p>Or so I would like to think. It&#39;s also possible that I&#39;m here not because of their heroism but because of a failure of contraception. I&#39;ll never know. I didn&#39;t ask; they never said, and the facts are unrecoverable. Lil and Manny wouldn&#39;t dream of speaking aloud about anything so intimate as sex or reproduction, certainly not with their children and, who knows, perhaps not even with one another. In that regard, they were typical of their generation. Personal matters were kept close to the vest.&#0160;</p>
<p>When Lil was five months pregnant, Hitler annexed the Sudetenland. Exactly three weeks before I landed on this planet, 20,000 Nazi supporters rallied, complete with Fascist salutes, at the old Madison Square Garden on 49th Street. Four days after I arrived, on the anniversary --the yahrzeit -- of the death of little Susan, while my mother was regaining her strength in Manhattan&#39;s Park East hospital on East 83rd Street, German tanks rolled into Czechoslovakia. For Lil, for Manny, personal and public crises intersected. Nazis foreign and domestic were at the gates, and inside the hospital, my mother was still mourning the loss of the little girl whom my Uncle Dan, my mother&#39;s brother, remembered as an &quot;exceptionally beautiful child.&quot; And lying beside Lil in her bed was the newborn, who was welcomed with joy, I&#39;m sure, but with ambivalence also. Not an eternally glowing-in-memory girl child but me --an undistinguished chap, to put it in the most favorable light. Not &quot;trailing clouds of glory&quot; but instead enveloped in a fog of danger and possibly regret.</p>
<p>My parents, as I have said, kept their emotions tightly buttoned, so while Susan was not mourned or even mentioned within the family, she was never forgotten. In fact, throughout my childhood she remained a mysterious ghostly presence. In my parents&#39; bedroom was a simple display -- a child-size wood-and-wicker chair and above it, on the wall, a gold-framed picture of a very pretty infant. The shrine fascinated me, and I would sneak into my parent&#39;s bedroom to study it. Sneak? Yes, because their bedroom was a consecrated place not to be defiled by Eugene or Jonathan or me. Off limits. It was the sin of all childhood sins to violate the taboo and cross into the forbidden zone. My mother made an unholy fuss about this rule. &quot;You are not to go into our bedroom. Ever.&quot; Which I did, regularly, when no one was looking --- but it felt like a midnight intrusion into a deep dark country graveyard. Very creepy. Who is that infant in the picture? And why is she not allowed to rest in peace? I knew better than to ask.</p>
<p>I never thought, then, to wonder how Manny and Lil, contemplating the gilded idol morn and eve, could fail to compare their frozen-in-time lost infant to her scruffy successor? Of course I was aware that my &quot;difficult&quot; mother was a deeply troubled woman. But never, trust me, did I have the least glimmer that the shade of the dead infant haunted our family -- and myself in particular. No child, certainly not me, would have been so insightful. It&#39;s transparent now, but it was anything but obvious then. Nor could anyone possibly have predicted that there was to be an area of study within the discipline of psychology called &quot;The Replacement Child Syndrome&quot; (RCS). And that I was unequivocally a textbook case of such.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>RCS lay dormant. Forty years later, and forty years ago, when I was in midlife, not having thought for decades about my dead sister or her shrine or my long-departed parents, I experienced something of a revelation. It came about indirectly, but dramatically.</p>
<p>I was teaching classes on Shakespeare&#39;s plays. and I found myself paying much more heed to <em>Romeo and Julie</em>t than that immature early tragedy warrants. I was especially intrigued by Shakespeare&#39;s invention of the character of young Juliet -- which is far more subtle than is necessary for the plot. With Juliet, Shakespeare attempted something utterly unprecedented in any previous work of literature. He cleverly situated his young heroine in a complicated family in which Juliet had, in effect, two mothers -- a birth mother, <em>Capulet wife</em>, who is cold, distant and aloof, and a metaphorical and therefore real mother, Nurse Angelica, who is undisciplined but sensual and sexual. The two mothers, carefully differentiated, precipitate or echo or explain the conflict within Juliet between propriety and passion. One mother embraces and promulgates Verona&#39;s rigid mores, while the other is impulsive, emotional, and anarchic. In addition -- and now it all was starting to become extremely personal for me -- Shakespeare provided Juliet with a backstory (unusual because his characters rarely have prior histories). It comes to light that the Nurse&#39;s own natural daughter had died in infancy, that the bereaved mother was engaged to suckle Juliet -- and that Angelica has been Juliet&#39;s surrogate mother and companion for almost fourteen years. So Juliet is, for the Nurse, clearly and obviously a replacement child. How curiously relevant! How provocative!</p>
<p>I then remembered that William Shakespeare himself was such a child. According to the Trinity Church records, John and Mary Shakespeare had suffered two tragedies before April 23, 1564 when William was born. Their first child, a daughter named Joan, had been baptized four years earlier, in 1560, but lived only for two months. A second daughter, Margaret, was baptized in 1562 and lived for just under one year. A full year! and then the grave! How horrible for all concerned! Young Will therefore entered the world as the boy child who replaced not one but two older sisters. Even in an age of staggering infant mortality, two such premature deaths must surely have weighed on both John and Mary and on William himself. Is it an accident that Juliet is the only certified replacement child in early modern English literature (at least, the only one that I can recall at this moment)?</p>
<p>Mulling these matters, I soon discovered that I had failed to register some additional facts about the Capulet family that by rights ought to have set my heart all aflutter. Listen to the Nurse nattering on about her surrogate daughter Juliet.</p>
<p><em>Even or odd, of all days in the year,</em></p>
<p><em>Come Lamass Eve at night shall she be fourteen,.</em></p>
<p><em>Susan and she -- God rest all Christian souls--</em></p>
<p><em>Were of an age.&#0160; Well, Susan is with God.</em></p>
<p><em>She was too good for me.</em></p>
<p>How could I have missed it?&#0160; Right at the heart of the Capulet family dynamics, and therefore at the heart of the play, is not just a dead infant and a dead daughter, but a dead Susan.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>I have to say that this discovery put my brain into quite an epiphanic tizzy. How could I not have recognized the parallels between the Capulet family and my own?&#0160; And also, given my near-compulsive interest in the bonds and affiliations among <em>Capulet wife</em> and Nurse Angelica and Juliet -- how could my conscious mind have ignored information that had so vexed my unconscious?&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Alerted by this 1595 play to my own personal being, I set out to learn about the Replacement Child Syndrome (RCS) in what is charitably called the &quot;literature&quot; of psychoanalysis. While almost everything I read was either obtuse or so encrusted with obscurantist jargon as to be indecipherable, it was not hard to distill the gist. According to the experts, a replacement is always vulnerable and at hazard, especially so if the deceased infant has not been properly mourned, or-- as they say -- if there has not been &quot;closure.&quot; Such a lad or lass goes through childhood constantly judged to be inferior to the idealized dead child. At worst, the love that is owed to the living child may be withdrawn and the replacement resented --&#0160; less loved, or even unloved; tolerated but undervalued.</p>
<p>Had she lived, the dead girl, let us call her Susan, of infinite and golden potential, would certainly have grown up to be an exceedingly dutiful daughter as well as a concert cellist and a world-class figure-skater who when just two years out of Yale would have created a state-of-the-art gynecological clinic in an underserved village in Moldova. The other, the replacement -- me -- bawls and pukes, bites a neighbor child on the cheek, throws a colossal shitfit over a missing puzzle piece, shatters an heirloom lamp, steals comic books from the local candy store, wastes weeks moping in his bedroom, totals the DeSoto, and fails trigonometry. No wonder he&#39;s a disappointment.</p>
<p>Well, maybe I&#39;m laying it on with a trowel, but that&#39;s the general idea.&#0160;</p>
<p>Now (this is still forty years ago) reconstituted as a Syndrome, I entered into my &quot;poor poor pitiful me&quot; period. I wasted kilowatts of energy and eons of precious time conceptualizing myself as a case of &quot;wrongful birth.&quot; I shifted the blame for all my emotional foibles onto my parents, especially, to be honest, onto my mother. Right at her doorstep I laid low self-esteem, intermittent depression, fear of success, disabling shyness and even (this was a bit of stretch) procrastination. But it didn&#39;t wash and it didn&#39;t last. I&#39;m ashamed and embarrassed that I allowed myself to attribute my personal problems to my willing but helpless mother. Not that there wasn&#39;t a smidgeon of truth to the RCS analysis. Freud says that &quot;a man who has won the love of his mother is always a hero in his own eyes&quot;; well, that kind of heroism wasn&#39;t going to be my lot. Of course I would have preferred to have enjoyed intimacy with a smiling supportive mother. Not what happened. But it was selfish and wrong of me to dwell on slights which were trivial compared to the traumas undergone by my parents.They, not me, were and are the heroes of this story.</p>
<p>The bedrock is that the RCS, though real, was only of middling significance to me. It was devastating for Juliet, because it led directly to her suicide, and it may have served as a spur to Shakespeare, who became Shakespeare and, incidentally, fathered a daughter named Susannah. For me -- well, it was it only important for the moment. I was a wounded child -- no, not wounded, scratched --but not a disabled one. I was healthy enough to pursue if not a distinguished, certainly a respectable career, to become a reliable father, to meet my obligations to my extended family and community and to form a long-lasting marriage -- and when that first marriage was cut short by disease and death, to achieve in old age a second mature and satisfying relationship. My parents must have done a great deal right, for I became what my father used to praise, without a shred of irony, as a &quot;proper, tax-paying citizen.&quot; At this point in my octogenarian life, there&#39;s no room for that old self-pitying me; instead, there&#39;s great admiration and regard for both Lil and Manny, who endured. And who, in the successes of their grandchildren and great-grandchildren, continue to thrive and prosper.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>An addendum: in the psychological &quot;literature&quot;, I found no mention, neither jot nor tittle, of the family configuration in which a male child replaces a female. No doubt such situations have by now been thoroughly researched by trained analysts, but not back then, when such a discussion might have been useful to me. The case of Juliet, where one girl replaces another, has been explored, but not Shakespeare&#39;s situation, or mine. I wonder sometimes whether the case of a boy succeeding a girl might lead to gender confusion, or as they now say, &quot;fluidity&quot; (if, for example, the parents unconsciously favor female traits in their son). I don&#39;t mean sexual practice, because I myself have never been (or wanted to be) anything other than a vanilla heterosexual. But I&#39;m not even slightly macho; I am strongly domestic, comfortable with roles that have been traditionally reserved for women. I&#39;m a gatherer, not a hunter; not the kind of person who goes to the fights with the guys or plays rugby and eventually, shunning the entrapment of wife or family, rides off on his horse into the sunset. I am much more likely to clean the bathroom, weed the garden, make some bad rhymes, play casino with the grandkids, and whip up a beef stew for dinner.&#0160;</p>
<p>Another addendum: I always wondered why Lil and Manny decided to give me an awkward obscure Biblical name. They had no interest in anything remotely smacking of religion. So why choose the name of one of Job&#39;s false comforters?&#0160; What were they thinking?&#0160; During my pitiful period, I imagined that they chose the name because they were disappointed with me. We can&#39;t name him Susan, said their joint unconscious, so let&#39;s give him an ugly name the diminutive of which is female. That was my theory, but now I have another idea. Perhaps, in March of 1939, to resurrect an obscure biblical name was to give the middle finger to Hitler. If so, it was an act of defiance. I hope I&#39;m right.</p>
<p>And finally: my younger brother Jonathan, who was as equally improbable a replacement as I, was born in July of 1942, seven month after the Day of Infamy. He too entered in troubling times. Jon was an extremely handsome youth, regularly gushed over by friends and family -- and slightly envied by me. One of his shaping childhood experiences is of my mother holding his head in her hands and saying, &quot;You would have made a very beautiful girl.&quot;</p>
<p>Jon too is a gatherer rather than a hunter, and when I&#39;m in the kitchen slicing the potatoes and carrots for a big pot of beef stew, it&#39;s his excellent recipe that I follow.</p>

                                <p>In this one, I see two deer (it&#39;s not clear whether they&#39;re mule or white tail) lolling on the ridge line. They&#39;re semi-anthropomorphic -- they look like deer, but they&#39;re sprawled on the ground as if in a reading position, each supporting his head with one hand (or hoof). I climb to where they are lying and join them, but the terrain is very steep and I tumble backward&#0160; head over heel a hundred or so feet into a swampy thicket. The deer follow me gingerly. There&#39;s a fadeout. Next thing I know, I&#39;m lying on the back of one of the deer just like in the westerns when a dead man is carried back to town&#0160; horseback.&#0160; The deer take me home -- to a log cabin, unfamiliar to me, in the woods. My friends unload me, and one of them says, &quot;We should do something for the deer.&quot; I say, &quot;OK, let&#39;s not shoot them.&quot;&#0160; End of dream.&#0160;</p>
<p>Once again, my nighttime life is orders of magnitude more imaginative that my daytime existence.</p>
