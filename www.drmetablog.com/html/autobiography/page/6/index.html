		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Early in September of 1956, I found my way from Flatbush to Hoboken and there boarded the old Lehigh Valley Railroad (the &#39;Leaky V&#39;) for the eight-hour ride to Ithaca. Surely I was the most naive and callow lad ever to set foot on the grounds of Cornell University. I was ignorant and provincial and I had never so much as visited a college campus. Although I lived a bicycle ride&#39;s distance from Brooklyn College, I had never been either enterprising or curious enough to ride by and take a gander. What I knew of higher education was what I had gleaned from 1940s black-and-white movies in which mature-looking but prankish fellows in raccoon coats smoked pipes and harmonized and made fun of the &#39;prexy&#39; and of the bespectacled &#39;profs&#39; and who were unworthy of the attractive coeds they pursued until just before the final fadeout when they reformed themselves enough to earn a kiss and a wink. Nor did I have the slightest idea what was signified by the wink.&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>I arrived at Cornell a few days before classes began. During those first days I had three separate mind-shattering experiences.</p>
<p>The first: one morning, I took my newly-purchased map and set out on a long walk (probably to avoid one of those atavistic rah-rah events which Cornell favored and to which I was constitutionally averse). Sometime during the day&#39;s wandering I came across a road sign that read &quot;CITY LIMITS.&quot; It was as if I had been struck by lightning. Until the moment that I encountered that sign, I had no idea that a city could have limits. Regular readers of this blague know that I spent my first seventeen years in the interior regions of darkest Brooklyn, a large borough in an even larger city from which there was no exit and certainly no &quot;limit&quot; -- especially not while on foot. My family, my family of origin, was automobile-free and I myself had left the neighborhood precincts only a handful of times. Although unworldly, I was nevertheless capable of extrapolation. If it was possible to pass beyond the city limits, then perhaps it was also possible to re-negotiate other limitations that I had assumed were eternal or unalterable. I walked past the sign and transcended the city of Ithaca. I couldn&#39;t go very far because my map went blank, so after a hundred or so feet I hustled back -- but for the first time in my life I had stepped over the line.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>The next day: <em>terra incognita</em> of an entirely different order. I wandered into the McGraw Library and found myself in the periodical room. Until the moment that I entered that space, I was acquainted only with magazines that would be found in a barbershop or in a dentist&#39;s office -- <em>Life </em>and <em>Look </em>and <em>Collier&#39;s </em>and <em>The Saturday Evening Post</em> and, for profound intellectual stimulation, the <em>National Geographic. </em>And yet here was a room with an apparently limitless number of periodicals: <em>Journal of Physical Chemistry, Journal of Theology, Journal of Metaphysics, Journal of Medieval Studies, Journal of Biblical Archeology. </em>I had no idea that there were such periodicals nor did I know that there were such areas of knowledge. Was there in truth a subject called anthropology?&#0160; and various shades of anthropology -- cultural, physical, linguistic? To say that I was wide-eyed does not do justice to width of my eyes. I spent hours leafing through these publications. I didn&#39;t understand much of what I read, but I did realize that there were things going on in the world for which P. S. 217 and EHHS and Flatbush had not prepared me.&#0160;</p>
<p>A third and most miraculous occurrence. My assigned roommate arrived. His name was Harry Wallace Blair II. He was delivered to campus by his parents and his grandparents. I was introduced to his family, and, wonder of wonders, his grandparents spoke English. Coming from immigrant Brooklyn, I had never encountered grandparents who spoke English. Or imagined that there could be any such. Italian, yes. Polish, certainly. Yiddish, of course. But English, never. I was totally flabbergasted. I wonder whether Harry&#39;s grandparents noticed my repeated gasps.</p>
<p>Oh, yes, I forgot one other event of the first Cornell week. Classes began. I enrolled for introductory chemistry -- a big mistake. Chem, I quickly discovered, was not where my talents lay. It was a large lecture class -- possibly 300 or 400 students. We all sat for a math screening test. Quite in error, I was assigned to a special advanced section of twenty students supposedly talented in mathematics. In the class were nineteen men and one woman. Can you guess, grandchildren and regular readers, who was that woman?</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>&quot;Now for my life,&quot; the doctor* boasted, &quot;it is a miracle of [eighty] years, which to relate, were not a history but a piece of poetry.&quot; Sir Thomas didn&#39;t know the half of it; if his life was a miracle, then mine is a hundred times more so. Yesterday the miracles started first thing in the morning when I drove (I own a horseless carriage -- a circumstance Sir T. couldn&#39;t possibly have imagined) to our spanking new hospital to have my innards inspected. The MRI doughnut deployed a couple of teslas worth of magnetism to spin my protons into images, a process which, though incomprehensible to me, is a heck of a lot less agonizing than extracting the information from my personal body with scalpel and stand-by sponge, and is significantly more informative than inspecting my urine, which is what a seventeenth-century doctor like Browne would have done. Later, I took a short walk to the local bank to take care of business and moved some, well, not exactly money but virtual or magic money from one account to another. Back home, I conversed by cell to NGP who was on the road to Virginia in a horseless carriage of his own. Inasmuch as he was behind the wheel, we skipped the face time feature. Nevertheless the long-distance mobile communication experience was plenty miraculous. The climax of my day was a walk to a neighborhood theater where Angela Hewitt blessed us with an exquisitely rendered performance of Bach&#39;s <em>Goldberg Variations.</em> She was in a zone; I was riveted. Is it more wondrous that Bach composed the <em>Variations</em>, that Ms. Hewitt performed them with such delicate power, or that the concert took place right around the corner, almost at my doorstep?&#0160; After the Bach, the day being now almost over, along came still another miraculous moment when I watched, supine in my own bed, in real time, the last minutes of an NBA game beamed in from Boston, Massachusetts, two thousand miles to the east, and almost at the Atlantic Ocean. It was an excellent game -- a stunning win for the Brooklyn Nets, and an equally remarkable triumph for my pixel-rich widescreen TV. It was a long day and a varied one, and I was beat, so while snuggling a-bed with the lady friend (an intimacy that is not only a miracle but a piece of poetry to boot), I instructed Alexa to give us a little opera. Alexa complied and chose WQXR in NYC, and for a drowsy hour we were grateful operavores.</p>
<p>No question but that my day was comprised of a series of miracles, each one more incredible than the other.</p>
<p>Nor do I even bother to tally daily miracles so commonplace that we cease to notice them: water in (both cold and hot) and waste out, electricity, central heating and A/C, refrigeration, natural gas to cook by, big bright cheerful windows, etc.</p>
<p>&quot;What wondrous life is this I lead.&quot;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt;">*Sir Thomas Browne, <em>Religio Medici,</em> first published 1644.</span></p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I must be watching too many 1940-50s film noirs. They&#39;re infiltrating my dreams.&#0160;</p>
<p>Last night, in my very own bedroom, I hosted a noir festival. Fragments of a more intricate dream are all I can remember now, but the bits my memory retained were mighty vivid. The dream featured an attractive young couple. He&#39;s handsome in a Barry Sullivan way but unidentifiable; she&#39;s delicate, like Coleen Gray in <em>Kiss of Death</em> (1947) or possibly like fragile young Janet Leigh in <em>Touch of Evil (1957)</em>. Some &quot;mugs&quot; want these young folks iced (the dream didn&#39;t say why) and they want it done in the most painful possible manner. The scene then cut to a rickety wood-framed house which replicated the building in the dude ranch run by Mercedes McCambridge in <em>Lightning Strikes Twice</em> (1951).The goons break in and sadistically slash the guy&#39;s throat and handcuff the girl to a post, then set the house on fire (which copied the ending of <em>Kiss Me, Deadl</em>y [1955]). Next thing I knew, the young lady was alive (the dream didn&#39;t say how she escaped the flames) and was being recruited and disguised by a trio of FBI or police officers. Not plastic surgery, just makeup and a change of costume. The plan was for her to go underground to identify and expose the hoodlums (a plot device common to numberless noirs).</p>
<p>When I awoke, I was impressed by the imaginative work of my dreamatorium. &quot;Not a bad plot,&quot; I said to myself. &quot;Not brilliant, but original enough to serve. Add a car chase, a blonde songstress, a natty but corrupt district attorney, a crusading newspaperman, some heavies (Moroni Olsen and Mike Mazurki, perhaps), a heist gone bad, a skinny stoolie with a toothpick in his mouth, and a little amnesia, and you&#39;ve got yourself a movie.&quot;</p>
<p>I should add that this dream came to me in high contrast black-and-white. Excellent camera work. Well-directed. Think Phil Karlson or Ida Lupino. With gowns by Orry-Kelly.</p>

		<a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2020/02/public-library-reisner-etc.html">McDonald Avenue Branch of the Brooklyn Public Library, 1953-1956</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>For all its fabled color, life in 40s and 50s Flatbush was extraordinarily provincial. In terms of sophistication, it might just has well been central Nebraska or U. P. Michigan. First generation working-class Brooklynites were simply too busy making ends meet to acknowledge that there was a great world outside. Although &quot;The City&quot; -- i.e. flush upscale Manhattan -- was just a 30 minute subway ride away, trust me, no tourists ever made it to our isolated grimy neighborhood.</p>
<p>In the middle 50s, when I was a pupil at Flatbush&#39;s semi-famous Erasmus Hall High School, I worked after school shelving books in the McDonald Avenue branch of the Brooklyn Public Library. I worked two or three days a week from 3 pm to 6 pm and earned seventy-five cents large an hour. A frugal young fellow (cheap as dirt, some say), I saved every penny, and I was proud to be able to pay my first year&#39;s Cornell tuition ($900). It was a good job for me; I handled a lot of books and because I was an omnivorous reader and an autodidact by nature, I borrowed and chewed over many a volume that I wouldn&#39;t otherwise have encountered. Plus I was able to sneak peeks at the contents of the 612.6 shelves.</p>
<p>It was at the McDonald library, which was barely more than a storefront, that I experienced the first glimmer of an idea that there might be a world elsewhere.&#0160;</p>
<p>The library staff was organized hierarchically. At the very bottom were the part-time shelvers like myself. Masters of the Dewey Decimal System, we had no greater qualification than the ability to remember the order of the letters in the alphabet. A long step up were the clerks, who checked books out and in, issued library cards, and collected fines. Clerks, like shelvers, were native to the neighborhood. But then there was the &quot;professional staff&quot; -- five people with degrees in &quot;library science&quot; who answered inquiries at the reference desk, advised borrowers, and purchased books. The &quot;pros&quot; were not from the neighborhood; they lived across the river In Manhattan and took the elevated Culver Line to the stop at Ditmas, and they intrigued me.</p>
<p>Miss Owen -- Alice Owen -- head librarian, imbued with gloom, was an extremely small, thin, clipped, austere woman with an unBrooklynish Maine or northern New England accent. Archetype of the proper maiden lady -- sexless in my view, but then, as I learned later, who can ever tell?&#0160; Miss Owen was, how shall I say this respectfully, detail-oriented. There was Miss Warren, from South Dakota, a fan of Senator McCarthy, who explained to me that the world&#39;s brown and black people had benefited enormously from colonialism. Exotic Mr. O&#39;Shea, obviously gay (but of course I didn&#39;t recognized it at the time) from North Carolina, a young man with more hip sway than Miss America and who actually -- hard to believe -- referred to our borrowers of color as &quot;jungle bunnies.&quot; I was stunned and horrified. Miss Kyvelos, whose parents were Greek fishermen and who was as round and warm as Miss Owen wasn&#39;t.</p>
<p>And then, another kettle of fish entirely, Bob Reisner, a 30ish bearded Greenwich Village writer (not an entirely successful one, or he wouldn&#39;t have been working at the library) who hung with jazz musicians and who was writing a biography of Charlie Parker. He was a type entirely new to me -- skeptical, disrespectful, &quot;anti-establishment.&quot; Borderline hipster. In strong contrast to the McDonald convention, his demeanor and language were lecherous, and he was more frank about his desires than anyone I knew, though whether his lusts and triumphs were real or imaginary I don&#39;t know. He was compiling a book called &quot;Show me the Good Parts&quot; -- a catalog of the sex scenes in contemporary novels. Pornographically speaking, he was way in advance of his time.&#0160;</p>
<p>On the whole, the McDonald library was quite an eye-opener for provincial me. I stayed on through the summer of 1956, then headed for Ithaca, where more surprises awaited.</p>
<p><em>February 10.&#0160;</em>Thinking over what I&#39;ve written, I can now correct my initial memory. Miss Owen wasn&#39;t the head of the library. That position was held by Miss Boies. Miss Owen was a figure of authority because she was in charge of the part-time shelvers like myself. Miss Boies was also a librarian who came to us directly from central casting by way of Ohio. At some point, she retired and was replaced by much younger Mrs. Gerstner, who contracted cancer and died only a few months after her arrival. I clearly remember her valedictory words to me, &quot;Get the most out of life.&quot;</p>
<p>And also, I wonder why Mrs. Gerstner and Bob Reisner took the time to talk to me. I had nothing to offer them. Is it possible that they saw me as a youth of promise. If so, they were over-optimistic.</p>

                                <p>The hardest part of my day is the night. Sleep does not come easy -- has never come easy. I regularly wake at 2:00 am, and stay awake for two or three hours. I use this time to fret about the state of the Earth (precarious), the state of the nation (doomed), and whether that new black spot on my left ankle will lead to agonizing death, or perhaps (best case scenario) merely to amputation at the hip. I then sleep fitfully until dawn, the last hours of the night crowded with grotesque, humiliating nightmares, worse by a long shot than anything Gregor Samsa could possibly imagine.</p>
<p>Last night, up again, I experienced a moment of clarity -- a revelation, an epiphany. Here it comes:&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>My mattress is just the right degree of firmness -- I sleep neither on the hard earth nor on a gunny sack of corn husks. My blankets are soft Egyptian cotton -- not leaves or newspapers. I rest my head on an authentic goose-down pillow. There are no rats scrabbling under my bed, no poisonous spiders descending from the ceiling, no lions roaring outside the door. No bedbugs or parasites or mosquitoes or scorpions. I&#39;m dry and warm. The temperature of my bedroom is well-regulated: forced air heat in the winter, cooling breezes or air conditioning in the summer. I&#39;m well fed, not kept awake by gnawing hunger. No noxious smells or hideous shrieks. No pains, cramps, headaches, or wounds.&#0160;</p>
<p>I know that my situation is luxurious and is certainly superior to all of my ancestors and to 99% of the human beings on the planet,</p>
<p>I am thankful that I have nothing whatever to grumble at, but I feel that I&#39;m unappreciative. To lie awake as I do, not sleeping, is to scorn society&#39;s gifts. How my forebears would have reveled in my taken-for-granted comforts!</p>
<p>No question but that I should be much more grateful.&#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;Lack of gratitude&quot; will be the principal worry during tonight&#39;s insomnia.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Of all human institutions, slavery must be the most loathsome and soul-distorting (although wars, genocides, massacres, pogroms, and wrongful executions are certainly contenders for worst of worst).&#0160;</p>
<p>It&#39;s easy to think that slavery is something ancient and foreign. Not something to concern ourselves about -- not part our life, nor my life. And yet American slavery was only eighty years into the past -- the blink of an eye -- when I was growing up in the 1940s in Flatbush. At P.S 217 or at Erasmus Hall, neither our textbooks nor our teachers made much of its recency. Slavery was not our past; not here, not in Flatbush. It was a crime of the distant South -- of Mississippi and Alabama, long ago. In the land of cotton, not the land of Coney Island and Jackie Robinson. Slavery was distant chronologically and geographically.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>What an unpleasant revelation, then, to encounter the story of Flatbush slavery in Thomas J. Campanella&#39;s painstaking and eloquent history, <em>Brooklyn, The Once and Future City&#0160;</em>(Princeton, 2019).</p>
<p>The facts: &quot;slavery was an essential element of New York life in the 17th and 18th centuries.&quot; &quot;Only Charleston, South Carolina surpassed New York (i.e. Manhattan) in the number of enslaved residents.&quot; Campanella reports that there was &quot;no place in New York that had more slaves per capita than Kings county, where one in three residents was in bonded servitude.&quot; One in three? In my neighborhood?&#0160; How could we not have known this?&#0160; How have we remained oblivious?</p>
<p>Slavery, I now learn, was especially established in &quot;Dutch towns like New Utrecht, where 75 percent of white households owned slaves.&quot; And also &quot;in Midwout [our Midwood] where African-Americans constituted 41 percent of the population in 1790.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>In 1790, the population of the town of Flatbush -- my Flatbush -- included 378 enslaved people, 12 free black people, and 551 white people – 75% of whom were slaveholders.The farmers of Brooklyn &quot;formed a Southern planter class in miniature.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>And it was the farmlands of Brooklyn -- Flatbush, Flatlands, Gravesend, and New Utrecht -- that supplied Manhattan with grain and fruits and vegetables raised with slave labor. No slaves, no Brooklyn; no Brooklyn, no Big Apple.</p>
<p>In 1799, the New York state legislature passed the Gradual Manumission Act: all children born of slave women after July 4 were to be free though they must remain indentured to their masters until the age of twenty-five for women and 28 for men. Though it seems a weak and toothless compromise, the new laws led to the rapid decline of slavery. In 1827, one hundred and ninety-three years ago, slavery was declared illegal in New York. (Vermont, to its credit, had abolished slavery two generations before, in 1777).</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a Brooklyn bill of sale for &quot;one certain neger girl called Anna&quot; to Jan Lefferts for thirty-eight pounds. Her owner, Gilleyam Cornel, was illiterate. He signed with &quot;his mark.&quot;</p>
<p><br /><a href="https://lefferts.brooklynhistory.org/slave-bill-of-sale-between-gilleyam-cornel-and-jan-lefferts/"><img alt="lefferts_billofsale_may_21_1751" class="size-medium wp-image-716 " describedby="caption-attachment-716" height="211" sizes="(max-width: 282px) 100vw, 282px" src="https://lefferts.brooklynhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2011/11/arc.145.billofsale_may_21_1751-cropped-for-slavery-page-650x489.jpg" srcset="https://lefferts.brooklynhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2011/11/arc.145.billofsale_may_21_1751-cropped-for-slavery-page-650x489.jpg 650w, https://lefferts.brooklynhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2011/11/arc.145.billofsale_may_21_1751-cropped-for-slavery-page-1024x771.jpg 1024w" title="lefferts_billofsale_may_21_1751" width="282" /></a></p>
<p>From what I&#39;ve learned in the past about the history of Brooklyn, and with these revelations, it&#39;s undeniable that the haunts of my childhood (East 9 Street, P. S. 217, St. Rose of Lima, Newkirk Station), were not very long ago farmed with slave labor. It&#39;s horrible and disillusioning, but it must be acknowledged.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>In a lifetime with pen in hand&#0160; or with fingers at the typewriter (or, latterly, at the word processor), I&#39;ve written a lot of bad sentences and a handful of good ones. But last week, I composed my absolute best sentence ever. It&#39;s pure Olympic gold; a bottom-of-the-ninth walk-off bases-loaded HR; a sensational buzzer-beater. Deathless prose.</p>
<p>Let us pause to savor this extraordinary sentence. &quot;I could have been a better prairie dog.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>Aficionados of Vivian de St. Vrain (fit audience, though few) will remember that this mellifluous sentence appeared just a few days ago, <a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2019/12/prairiedogs.html">right here</a>. You can appreciate it in context, if you will, but heck, the sentence stands alone.</p>
<p>It is beautiful in itself but one can only marvel at its delicate but meaningful irony. Moreover, (bonus) it&#39;s near-perfect iambic pentameter.</p>
<p>It&#39;s become, for me, a mantra of sorts. Whenever I start to bemoan my fate, or deplore my state, or bother myself over some missed opportunity or long-ago failure, I mumble, &quot;I could have been a better prairie dog.&quot;&#0160; And I immediately regain perspective. So it&#39;s a sentence that&#39;s <em>utile</em> as well as <em>dulce --&#0160;</em>as useful as it is sweet. Classic.&#0160;</p>
<p>I&#39;m absolutely confident that &quot;I could have been a better prairie dog&quot; will help me through episodes of middle-of-the-night self-laceration. In fact, it&#39;s working just as I write this.</p>

                                <p>An old friend reminds me that I once kept a cat as a pet. I had forgotten.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the story. There was a cat and I was overfond of her. We left the cat with a friend when we went on a three-week vacation. She refused to eat and starved to death before we returned. I&#39;ve never owned another animal since. Too much responsibility.&#0160;</p>
<p>Besides, I was a city boy who had lived a concrete and chain-link-fence childhood. No room for animals except maybe squirrels and pigeons. But because I&#39;ve owned some rural land in Vermont since the 1960s, a surprising number of critters have passed through my life, though I&#39;ve never owned a single one of them. Some have made an impression.</p>
<p>There was the pair of geese, Brady and Lady, who liked to peck at the backs of my knees and also liked to frighten the children. I once watched my older son (when he was a small boy) mount a chair and in revenge leak all over Brady, who was sunbathing. A primitive assertion of dominance. There were chickens, many of them. I enjoyed the eggs but I was repelled by chicken sexual mores. And then the ducks. I remember once saying &quot;Those ducks (there was mother and a dozen or so ducklings) are so loud they could be right in the kitchen.&quot; And they were. The heifers, July and September; I was very fond of September. I loved the way she cleaned her nostrils with her long tongue. Jackson the runaway horse. A nameless piglet, whom we boarded one summer, and whom the kids tried to teach to play soccer with his nose. Despite being assiduously tutored, he never improved. Rabbits, many of them; pets, not food. The next-door-neighbor&#39;s horses, all noble Morgans, both chestnuts and bays, all pastured on our fields: Gillian, the lead mare, Liz a wayward rule-bender; Gabe, an ex-boy, very friendly; Harmony, beautiful as a foal, who liked to look in my pockets for apples. Also in the back pasture: sheep, Scottish Blackfaces, many of them but no more than twenty at a time, with none of whom I ever established a proper one-on-one relationship. Occasionally I helped to track down a stray, but that&#39;s the extent of it. Goats, my favorites, with personality to spare -- dwarf Nigerians mostly. Excellent pets, excellent playmates for the grandchildren. The glamorous mysterious rooster who came out of the woods, adopted us, and liked to &#0160;tom-peep into our bedroom. And then these last few years, the miniature donkeys, Big Joe and Little Joe, who winter in Connecticut and whom members of the family love for their beauty and the music of their braying.&#0160;</p>

                                <p>We watched the last ten minutes of an early 30s James Cagney crime film. I don&#39;t know its title because we came in very late and didn&#39;t catch the name. The concluding bit of the film was very good: a chase scene (rather tame by modern standards) and then unrepentant Cagney in the hoosegow, facing a long stretch. A gloomy prison cell. Cagney&#39;s girlfriend (a familiar face but not one I can identify) comes for a visit. She promises, as is the custom in such films, to wait patiently for him until he&#39;s released. An empty promise? &#0160;I don&#39;t know. But Cagney perks up and delivers the film&#39;s last line: &quot;If I had the wings of an angel over these prison wall I would fly.&quot; Followed by a fade. The End. &#0160;</p>
<p>I immediately said to my companion, &quot;I know what he&#39;s quoting; &#0160;it&#39;s &quot;The Prisoner&#39;s Song&quot; by Vernon Dalhart.&quot; I looked it up and I was correct: the lines are right there in stanza 5.&#0160;</p>
<p>Now if I had wings like an angel<br />Over these prison walls I would fly<br />And I&#39;d fly to the arms of my poor darlin&#39;<br />And there I&#39;d be willin&#39; to die.</p>
<p>&quot;The Prisoner&#39;s Song&quot; (1924) was a big hit; &#0160;in fact, according to Wik, the first &quot;country&quot; song to sell a million copies. I imagine that Cagney&#39;s 1930s audience would be expected to recognize the allusion. But ninety years have passed and the lyric is pretty much forgotten today. Except, of course, by me. An amazing recall. What a guy!</p>
<p>I have to tell you, I wallowed in self-congratulation. Preened. Demanded extravagant praise. For twenty-four hours I was the cock of the memory dunghill. But how quickly glory transits.&#0160;</p>
<p>The next afternoon, I watched, with my 6-year-old grandson Luke, the re-play of an NBA basketball game. Houston versus Toronto. I had seen the game a couple of days before, so I knew it was a good one. But (and here comes the memory horror) I couldn&#39;t remember who won. True that I remembered various plays and players, but true also that I thought the game went into overtime and Toronto won. Not so; James Harden, one of my least favorite players, &quot;took over&quot; the last couple of minutes and Houston won decisively. I had simply forgotten. Blanked.</p>
<p>I was deflated, memory-wise. And scared. One day you can remember Vernon Dalhart and the wings of the angel, and the next day you can&#39;t recall James Harden and who won and who lost. &#0160;</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the fear: it&#39;s obvious that the moments of memory-triumph are going to be fewer and fewer and the moments of memory-failure are going to increase. And continue to increase. Burgeon. Yikes. Double yikes.</p>
<p>This is Vernon Dalhart.&#0160;</p>

                                <p><a class="image" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cynomys_ludovicianus_2.jpg"><img alt="" class="thumbimage" data-file-height="762" data-file-width="1147" decoding="async" height="166" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Cynomys_ludovicianus_2.jpg/250px-Cynomys_ludovicianus_2.jpg" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Cynomys_ludovicianus_2.jpg/375px-Cynomys_ludovicianus_2.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Cynomys_ludovicianus_2.jpg/500px-Cynomys_ludovicianus_2.jpg 2x" width="250" /></a></p>
<p>For twenty-two of a day&#39;s twenty-four hours, I&#39;m a contented kind of guy. Not self-satisfied by a long shot, but by and large reconciled to both my modest achievements and to my inadequacies. Yet between 2AM and 4AM, in the dark insomniac gloom, I&#39;m a different person. I struggle with &quot;what ifs,&quot; with &quot;should have&#39;s,&quot; with alternative life choices of every ilk, however trivial. Although I am well aware that (in 80&#39;s pop psychology) one shouldn&#39;t &quot;should&quot; on oneself, I &quot;should&quot; relentlessly. I become a classic second-guesser, a merciless self-critic, a shrill Monday morning quarterback of my own life.</p>
<p>So because &quot;dark is the dawn when day is nigh,&quot; with sleep or the coming of the sun, I revert to my normal, equable self.</p>
<p>A parable: yesterday we went for a walk on one of our town&#39;s many lovely open-space trails. This walk took us right through an extensive prairie dog village. It was a sunny day and the little plague-bearing rodents were outside -- cute, furry, squeaky, sitting or standing, each one asserting possession of his or her own burrow.&#0160;</p>
<p>I said to my companion, &quot;If I were a prairie dog, I&#39;d probably be saying, &#39;I should have chosen a different spot for my burrow. If I had just dug it a yard or two north, or fifty feet away next to that tree, or even over the hill, I would have led a much more productive life. Who knows, I might have had a better burrow. I might have eaten more forbs and fescue. I might have had more mates, I might have achieved more. My kits would have been more advantaged. I could have made better use of my brief time on earth. I could have been better prairie dog.&#39;&quot;</p>
<p>Don&#39;t laugh, please! This is serious stuff.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t need to underline the lesson of this tale. It&#39;s plenty obvious.</p>
<p>But will its wisdom and perspective console me tonight?</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>In the back of our fourth-grade &quot;reader&quot; at P. S. 217, there was an appendix containing proverbs and other jots of wisdom. Most of these were commonplaces: &quot;look before you leap&quot;; &quot;a stitch in time saves nine&quot;; &quot;empty barrels make the most noise.&quot;&#0160; Many of these gnomic bits mystified me. For example:</p>
<p>For all your days prepare,</p>
<p>And meet them ever alike.</p>
<p>When you are the anvil, bear.</p>
<p>When you are the hammer, strike.</p>
<p>I had no idea what an anvil was (now I own a beauty!!) but I understood that it was something to beat with a hammer. For what purpose? I had no clue? &#0160;But I was a moderately progressive youth and I couldn&#39;t grasp why we anvils were being urged to &quot;bear.&quot; It seemed like a reactionary idea then and still seems so now. Way too passive, I thought. Why shouldn&#39;t the anvils join together and form a united front against the hammers, or whatever capitalist oligarch controlled the hammers? Why did my grandparents come to America if not to free themselves from the perpetual anvilhood of sorry Ukraine?</p>
<p>Moreover, I completely missed the mark on &quot;strike,&quot; which I interpreted to mean &quot;go on strike.&quot; An easy mistake, because the only other meaning I knew of strike was the &quot;three strikes and you&#39;re out&quot; of basebalI. Even naif me knew that baseball had nothing to do with anvils and hammers or fourth-grade readers.&#0160;</p>
<p>The poem was therefore incoherent. Endure and suffer when you&#39;re an anvil, but get on the picket line when you&#39;re a hammer.</p>
<p>Why couldn&#39;t anvil and hammer unite and resist their oppressors together?&#0160;</p>
<p>I should also confess that anvil and hammer fused and mingled in my youthful brain with a Phillies shortstop of the period named Granville Hamner.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>My father had many admirable traits. He was absolutely honest -- &quot;honest to a fault&quot; even. He had a fine sense of humor. He was compassionate and though he affected stoicism, he was deeply romantic and emotional -- tears came easy to him. He was a self-effacing but diligent worker. He was a fine, graceful athlete -- basketball, tennis, baseball (a catcher!) His social views were progressive. I never detected a jot or tittle of bigotry in his conversation (in fact, words that denigrated racial or religious groups were unknown in our home. When I heard words like &quot;goy&quot; on the street, I had to do some research to find out what was meant.) He was a thoughtful man, a wise man, a realist and not an ideologue. He was an affectionate father and husband. He never provoked a soul and had no enemies. He enjoyed his life.</p>
<p>I profited immensely from observing these excellent traits in action.</p>
<p>But perhaps because of his impoverished first-generation beginnings, he was never at ease in the world. Yes, he was comfortable at home and in his backyard garden and among his circle of friends, many of whom he had known from childhood. He was comfortable walking to the BMT at Newkirk Plaza, taking the subway to Court Street in downtown Brooklyn, and practicing his profession, where he was much respected. But he did not like to step out of his milieu. He couldn&#39;t fend for himself. Here&#39;s an extreme but telling example: one day, when I was ten or so years old, as we were walking home, probably from the schoolyard, he stopped in front of the local A &amp; P and said to me, &quot;Your mother wants a quart of milk; you go in and buy the milk. I&#39;ll wait outside.&quot; Which I did, of course; I was used to running such errands. My father couldn&#39;t go into a market without stress. He could buy a newspaper at a candy store or kiosk, and he could bring home a loaf of rye bread from Ebinger&#39;s bakery, but I never once saw him in a vegetable market or a fish store or a butcher shop. When my mother died in 1978, he had to hire people to shop for him. And someone to cook, because, as the saying goes, he couldn&#39;t boil water. Because of his discomfort when out of his routine, he was a classic stick-in-the-mud. He couldn&#39;t travel. He never learned to drive a car. In his relations with others, he was totally passive. He allowed my mother to organize his social life and after she died, he became completely isolated. He hated change. Once when I visited him late in his life, when he was in serious arthritic pain, he complained about the station to which his radio was tuned. It was one of those &quot;twenty-four hours of news&quot; stations that repeated itself every few minutes. I said, &quot;Why not change the station?&quot; He said, &quot;Aw, it&#39;s already set there.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>I tried very hard not to imitate these less-than-admirable habits.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Here&#39;s a memory from my youth. Let&#39;s say it&#39;s the early &#39;50s. I&#39;m a thoughtless, self-absorbed adolescent, nominally studying at Erasmus Hall but in fact not paying much mind to schoolwork. It&#39;s a Sunday dinner, so I&#39;ve probably just come home from playing several hours of schoolyard basketball or softball. We&#39;re at the dining room table. Roast beef, possibly. There&#39;s a desultory conversation, but then my father, Emanuel, savoring the loaded table, observes, right out of left field I thought then, &quot;I don&#39;t think we could eat better food.&quot; He paused. &quot;Perhaps fancier, but not better.&quot;</p>
<p>I didn&#39;t know what has prompted his observation but it made enough impact on me that I retained it in memory for now these seventy years. I doubt that any of the five of us dissented and I suspect that we continued to stuff ourselves with meat and roasted potatoes and (inasmuch as it was the 50s), some sort of soggy canned vegetable.&#0160;But now, almost seven decades later, I think that I have a better understanding of Dad&#39;s spontaneous celebration of the roast. I also think that I know why that particular moment has stayed in my mind when so much else has long since evaporated. After all, Dad was not given to gratuitous compliments, certainly not to the food on the table.&#0160;My father was neither a gourmet nor a food critic (I&#39;ve written about his eating habits <a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2011/03/what-my-father-ate.htm">elsewhere</a>). I now know that he wasn&#39;t commenting on the preparation or the presentation of the food. He was savoring its inherent quality -- its grade A choiceness -- wait, not just its quality so much as its abundance. But even more specifically, when I think back, he was enjoying the knowledge that he was able to provide such a bountiful dinner for his family. &#0160;</p>
<p>To understand Dad&#39;s spontaneous overflow of emotion, it&#39;s necessary to recall the facts of his own childhood. From what I&#39;ve gleaned, the family in which he grew up must have been among the poorest in America, the very bottom of the economic ladder. His father worked in a factory -- which was just a large room behind a storefront -- as a roller of cigars. It&#39;s well documented that in the first part of the 20th century, cigar-rollers were one of the most exploited and most underpaid of American workers. Grandpa&#39;s wage when Dad was growing up, he told me, was $9 per week. The family, the six of them (the parents Isaiah and Eta, the children Max, Sol, Mollie, and Manny) lived in a sixth floor cold water walk-up flat -- that is, in an apartment in a tenement up six flights of stairs (no elevators), water but no hot water. I don&#39;t know how many rooms in this apartment but it didn&#39;t matter much, because, Dad said, they all spent their time in the kitchen, which was the only room they could afford to heat.&#0160;</p>
<p>Dad&#39;s mother, my grandmother Eta (she&#39;s Yetta in her naturalization papers) didn&#39;t speak much English and I can only remember one conversation with her -- just a short while before she died in 1962 at age 89. It was a struggle for her to speak my language but she managed to say two memorable sentences about her early years in America. She said, with pride, &quot;we was poor but we was clean,&quot; and (very relevant here) &quot;we always had what to eat.&quot; &#0160;That sentence of hers --&quot;we always had what to eat&quot;-- was said with almost exactly the same valence as my father&#39;s &quot;I don&#39;t think we could eat better food.&quot; For grandma, putting food on the table for six individuals was achievement enough. It was a triumph. Grandma didn&#39;t speak of her diet in the old country, but from her height (4&#39;10&quot;) and that of her husband Isaiah&#39;s (5&#39;1&quot;), I can guess that food was an issue and that dearth was common. I also suspect that the sixth floor walk-up might have been luxurious compared to the standard of living in StaryConstantin in Ukraine.</p>
<p>But to my father. He had no difficulty acknowledging the poverty of his early years. I think, looking back, that he had some pleasure in knowing that he had overcome the hardships of his youth. If he didn&#39;t have a jacket in the coldest of winters, well, he had a sweater, and that was enough. I only remember one complaint, and it wasn&#39;t about his family. During World War I, students in P. S. 122 were lined up on the side of the room and were instructed to offer their donations for the purchase of War Bonds. When they surrendered their dimes or quarters, they were allowed to sit down. &#0160;But Dad was required to remain standing because he didn&#39;t have even a nickel to donate. &quot;Wasn&#39;t that a cruel thing to do to a child,&quot; he said to me.</p>
<p>But poverty did not distort my father&#39;s personality. He was the precise opposite of the stereotype of the upwardly mobile overachiever, grasping for more and more. &#0160;He was actually rather contemptuous of such people. He said to me once, &quot;Anyone can make money if he makes it the whole business of his life to do so.&quot; And I also remember an instance when I overheard a conversation among his friends about how much their stocks had gained. After they left, my father said,&#0160;<br />&quot;When the stock market is going up, everyone&#39;s a genius.&quot; He himself never had an extra dollar to invest in stocks. But enough is as good as a feast.</p>
<p>He was the person least interested in material goods that I have met in my entire lifetime. He had no possessions and craved none. He was a real estate lawyer in a world where clients squabbled over inches, but his opinion was &quot;Nobody owns anything. Maybe you can say you have a lifetime lease, but that&#39;s all.&quot;</p>
<p>Here&#39;s another piece of wisdom that offered, and one from which I&#39;ve profited. I think I can quote this verbatim. &quot;Never omit an opportunity to do a favor for a friend. And never be embarrassed to accept a favor from a friend. People like to help each other.&quot;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef0240a48d0a0b200c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="IMG_2743" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef0240a48d0a0b200c image-full img-responsive" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef0240a48d0a0b200c-800wi" title="IMG_2743" /></a></p>
<p>It shouldn&#39;t take more than a moment, dear grandchildren, to figure out exactly what building is under construction. It&#39;s the early spring of 1978 and the house that we&#39;ve lived in these last forty or so years is rising out of the ground. It may be a little difficult, but if you scrutinize closely, you&#39;ll notice the space that has been left for the familiar sliding door (with its prominent header), and also the spaces for the front door and the kitchen windows. The workmen (is that Jimmy Perry up there?) are just starting on the second floor. There&#39;s also a large boulder which came out of the basement on the lower right, sitting where it remained for 30 years or so until it was replaced by a much more handsome piece of granite. (The boulder in the picture can now be found, part buried, at the entrance to the new waterfall garden.)</p>
<p>It&#39;s a very small house (the footprint is 20&#39; x 28&#39;) not because we were in love with small houses, but because we were working with an extremely limited budget. &#0160;Believe it or not, the house (including foundation, roof, well, electricity, and septic) cost just $33,000 --very little even in 1970s dollars. That&#39;s because we cut every corner that could conceivably be cut: unfinished lumber for framing, second-hand doors, used plumbing fixtures and appliances, plywood flooring in some rooms, etc. etc. &#0160;(Almost all these elements have been replaced and upgraded over the years as the family has become more prosperous.)</p>
<p>Also important: the house site. It might seem natural and inevitable to you, grandchildren, that the house is where it is. But in fact, there was a long serious debate about where to put it. And here you must remind yourself that in 1977 the area that now contains a house and a garage/barn and three cabins and an orchard of sorts and three or four different gardens was a blank space, a tabula rasa -- just a meadow behind the old West Bradford cemetery.</p>
<p>Four sites were under consideration and three were rejected : the first where Cabin #3 is located, the second, where the barn sits, the third in the back field (but that would have involved a prohibitive investment in a road and the undergrounding of many feet of electrical wire). I made the decision to put the house up on the knoll, with a good view of pond, forest and field, accessible to the road, and with the hope and possibility of a dry basement. The right decision, I still think. &#0160;</p>
<p>There was only one road in at the time -- the one to the south of the cemetery. The driveway we now use came the next year. &#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>There were many adventures and many anxieties in the building of the house, most of them a consequence of the limited budget. It was not an enjoyable experience, but it didn&#39;t sour me on the land or the property. I learned a lot.</p>

                                <p>In the 1940s of ancient memory, it was a rare treat when my father would bring home, on a summer evening, a pint of ice cream to be shared among the five of us. This was in the days of &quot;ice boxes&quot; and before the refrigerators that replaced them had freezer compartments -- so the ice cream had to be consumed immediately. Which it was. &#0160;</p>
<p>There was also the Good Humor truck:</p>

<div class="mVDMnf nJGrxf">&#0160;</div>
<div class="mVDMnf nJGrxf"><span style="line-height: 1.3;">An ice cream cone (single scoop) at the candy store around the corner cost 10 cents. I remember the shock when the price escalated to 11 cents. If the price of an ice cream cone could change, was there any hope for stability in our fallen universe?&#0160;</span></div>
<div class="mVDMnf nJGrxf">&#0160;</div>
<div class="mVDMnf nJGrxf"><span style="line-height: 1.3;">Then sometime in the last of the 40s or the first of the 50s the icebox was replaced with a big new refrigerator from Sears with a freezer compartment. Ice cream could now be purchased by the half-gallon and eaten not occasionally and rarely but every single day. It became an evening staple. It wasn&#39;t very good ice cream, but I didn&#39;t know it then. Pumped full of air, it was the white bread of ice creams. &#0160;</span></div>
<div class="mVDMnf nJGrxf">&#0160;</div>
<div class="mVDMnf nJGrxf">But even Meadowgold and their like were superior to the &quot;ice cream&quot; that we tasted and rejected in England in the 1970s which was made with whale blubber.&#0160;</div>
<div class="mVDMnf nJGrxf">&#0160;</div>
<div class="mVDMnf nJGrxf">Then came the revolution. Heavenly ice cream emerged from its long Dark Age. Reuben and Rose Mattus of Brooklyn Heights introduced faux Danish Haagen-dazs and Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield gave us Ben and Jerry&#39;s. A revolution and a revelation! &#0160;Following their precedent, many brands of superior ice cream and gelato emerged. But beware, because Haagen-Dasz is now owned by Nestle and Ben and Jerry&#39;s by Unilever.</div>
<div class="mVDMnf nJGrxf">&#0160;</div>
<div class="mVDMnf nJGrxf">Beware also of the various masquerade ice creams that clutter the freezer section of the supermarket. Ice cream made not of cream but of tofu, oats, soy, coconut oil, kefir -- ghastly travesties, all of them.</div>
<div class="mVDMnf nJGrxf">&#0160;</div>
<div class="mVDMnf nJGrxf">I think we&#39;re in a golden age of ice cream. I especially think so in the summer, when we drive down to the Whippi-Dip in Fairlee for some of Gifford&#39;s peach ice cream. (Is it bad or good that Gifford&#39;s, out of Skowhegan, Maine, is the &quot;Official Ice Cream of the New England Patriots?&quot;) &#0160;</div>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef0240a4d842ee200b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="IMG_2731" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef0240a4d842ee200b image-full img-responsive" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef0240a4d842ee200b-800wi" title="IMG_2731" /></a><br />This is a photograph of the buildings on the West Bradford property as they existed when we made the deal in 1967. As you know -- children, grandchildren and other interested parties -- we are no longer in possession of this part of the property. It passed to Phyllis and Bruce in 1977 and then to Bruce entirely when he and Phyllis divorced in 1984 or thereabouts. &#0160;</p>
<p>But this is how it looked to the photographer, whom I believe to be my brother Jonathan, when he stood on the near knoll looking westward. &#0160;Much remains superficially constant but everything is different.</p>
<p>Still in place: the house and barn, the Red Duchess apple tree just to the left of the house and closer to the camera; the big sugar maple on the left, near South Road. &#0160;</p>
<p>But to my eye, there&#39;s much that has changed. Hanging over the house is a very large, very dead elm. There&#39;s another infected and doomed elm to the right of the barn. Indeed, the property was sometimes called by us &quot;Dead Elm Farm&quot; when we spent our first summer there, in 1968. There&#39;s a chicken house, barely visible, to the right of the white clapboard milk house; there is also another outbuilding once used as a garage and a storeroom for wood visible between the house and barn; there&#39;s a porch of sorts at the street side of the house -- all these elements have been removed though they remain vivid in my memory.</p>
<p>But what you can&#39;t see, grandchildren, is more interesting than what is visible.</p>
<p>The property was owned for forty years by Tom Roberts, who was probably as old in 1968 as I am now. He knew that he was too tired and probably too resource-poor to maintain ownership. His wife, eight years older than he, was mortally ill, and Tom himself had only a couple of years to live. It was time for him to move on.</p>
<p>The house itself (supposedly built in part in 1856) was out of an earlier era. It lacked a septic system (it had only a cesspool, which was an open sewer into which untreated waste flowed and stunk.) &#0160;There was a 15-foot deep dug well (you can see a bit of the topmost well tile and the concrete well cover just to the right of the apple tree) from which a very old electric pump pushed water up to an open copper-lined tank on the second floor of the house. There was no water pressure (because there was no pressure tank) but only a &quot;gravity feed&quot; to the faucets and toilet. The plumbing was rusted iron (in) and lead (out). There was no heating system -- the wood stoves that had heated the place were sold at auction before we took up residence. No insulation either, except (we later discovered) the piles of hazelnut shells that generations of squirrels and chipmunks had deposited in the spaces between the split lathe-and-plaster inner walls and the outer sheathing. The sills were rotten and the house was sagging in places -- although, as you can see, the roof line was still deceptively sound.&#0160;</p>
<p>The barn was in even worse condition than the house. Its partial collapse was the reason -- the last straw -- that Tom Roberts sold out. During the previous winter, the rotted-out floor on the east side of the barn had given way, strangling three of Tom&#39;s eight cows in their stanchions. Tom was heartbroken -- he dropped more than one tear when he told us about the disaster. &quot;I hooked them one by one to the tractor and dragged them out into the field, over there, and buried them.&quot; &#0160;He pointed to a spot that would be just about the lower right hand corner of the photograph.</p>
<p>The barn, at first, was a scary place. &#0160;It took us (Bruce and me) a couple of weeks to get up the courage to enter. It was a disaster area: giant spider webs, peeling whitewash, jumbled and distorted structures for dairy use, piles of twisted lumber. It&#39;s now been repaired and remodeled -- completely transformed. But I still treasure the memory of the way it was, at least after it wasn&#39;t in danger of further collapse. I miss the majestic 16&#39; by 16&#39; hemlock beams, the spacious haylofts, the hand hewn tree that served for a ridgepole.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that the buildings were way past their prime, barely functioning, I didn&#39;t think for a second that we had made a mistake in buying the place. I never thought of reversing course and selling out. I was totally at home from the first breath. I fell in love with the buildings, and even more so with the land. &#0160;</p>
<p>When Althea took her very first walk on the property, just as we passed what we call the &quot;meander&quot; and crossed over the spill (now enclosed in a culvert) through which water from the swamp (now a pond) courses into the Baldwin Brook, she said, &quot;This is too beautiful to be in private hands.&quot; &#0160;</p>
<p>It&#39;s even more beautiful now.</p>
<p>[Addendum October 24, 2019. &#0160;I suppose I should mention that the decision to buy the property was controversial. My father in particular, ever cautious, was adamant: you don&#39;t buy a second home until you&#39;ve bought your first home. You have no idea what you&#39;re buying. The land has never been surveyed; &#0160;you don&#39;t know the boundaries.&quot; &#0160;His reasoning was perfectly correct, but all wrong. Buying the property was the best financial decision of my life.] &#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>My mother, your great-grandmother, Lillian Green, was born in New York City, probably in Harlem, on June 9, 1905.</p>
<p>Her parents, Sonia Chafetz and Joseph Usilewski, were part of the great migration to America of Eastern European Jews. According to my mother, Sonia and Joseph were both engaged to other people when they eloped, he deserting from the Russian army. They arrived at Ellis Island mid-August of 1904 without a kopeck in their pockets and only one pair of shoes between them. I used to think that my mother had been conceived aboard the ship from Rotterdam, but the dates don&#39;t bear it out. Moreover, It&#39;s a melancholy fact that passengers in steerage were segregated by sex and kept apart.&#0160;</p>
<p>My mother was born Lilly Usilewski but when she entered public school, which is where she acquired English, she was enrolled as Lily Solawisky. When her younger brother was enrolled as Daniel Oslofsky, my grandfather Joseph realized that it was time to Americanize his name. The judge before whom he appeared was named Green, so Green he became. Lilly became Lillian when she married, my father insisting that &quot;Lilly&#39;s not a name.&quot; He and everyone called her &quot;Lil&quot; but she was always &quot;Lilly&quot; to her mother Sonia.</p>
<p>Lil&#39;s upbringing, I am afraid, was impoverished and harsh. I was told that her father raised her and her younger brothers Dan and Ellis (Bub) &quot;with the belt.&quot; Her mother Sonia was chronically ill from goiter and from the consequences of her five home-made abortions, so against her wishes Lil was taken out of school six weeks into high school to run the house and to raise her brothers, a sacrifice for which she received no appreciation either from them or from her father. For her, it was a disaster and a source of bitterness.. Her life from age thirteen to age twenty-six, when she married my father, Emanuel, is almost entirely blank to me. I know that she worked in the printing industry and was a skilled proofreader. She was not at all athletic or artistic but she was musical -- she played the piano and sang. At some point in early adulthood she started to take vacations at one of those camps for young Jewish adults in the Catskills. She sang in camp musicals and it was there that she met my father, a law clerk studying for the bar. My grandfather Joseph Green disapproved of her independence and refused to speak to her for two years -- a wound from which she was still suffering when I came to know her. Lil and Manny were married on June 19, 1930 and had four children:&#0160; Eugene (1935- 2006), Susan (1937-1938), Elihu (1939 -&#0160; &#0160; ), and Jonathan (1942 -&#0160; &#0160; ).</p>
<p>Her hard early life and the death of her daughter at the age of nine months, along with a chronic, agonizing stomach ulcer left her a troubled woman. She was what used to be called &quot;difficult&quot; -- acerbic, rude, insensitive, thoughtless. She once said to me, &quot;I was a good mother until you boys were six years old; after that, I couldn&#39;t cope.&quot; I think it was honest and insightful of her to say so. Yet my very earliest memories are pleasurable. She kept us warm and fed and loved; otherwise I don&#39;t know how my brothers and I would have been able to have lived satisfying lives. But I also know that I have no memories of touching her or being touched by her, although sometimes she would demand a quick peck on the cheek. She was not at all &quot;supportive&quot; -- &quot;assaultive&quot; would be a better term. There was no praise, only incomprehension or disdain.</p>
<p>I can&#39;t remember any particular words that she said to me, but here&#39;s a sample of her language. I remember that when my two or three month old firstborn suffered noisily from colic, she proposed to my wife, &quot;Maybe your milk is poisoning him&quot; &#0160;-- which not a sentiment likely to endear her to a struggling new mother.</p>
<p>It took me into adulthood to recognize that my mother&#39;s peculiarities were not villainy but the product of her emotionally impoverished early years and of her almost constant pain.&#0160;</p>
<p>After her children were grown, she resumed her piano playing and turned herself into a stalwart of the League of Women Voters. In 1960, during JFK&#39;s presidential campaign, she gathered fifty or sixty women and welcomed Eleanor Roosevelt herself to our home on East 9 Street. A most memorable and important contribution.</p>
<p>She did not mellow with age. Yet I would have to say, that all things considered, she did well.</p>
<p>Lil died at age 74 from the consequences of her then-incurable ulcer. In the hospital, dying, &quot;intubated&quot; and incapable of speech, she scribbled on a scrap of paper, &quot;I love you all,&quot;&#0160; and I know that she meant sincerely what had always been so difficult for her to express. I retain that piece of paper as a relic.&#0160;</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a picture of Lil at her best. Me and my mom, c. 1940.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Now that I&#39;m eighty (80!) years old, it&#39;s time to think about what, if anything, &#0160;I&#39;ve learned. For many years now, I&#39;ve been waiting for wisdom to kick in, but so far, no thunderbolts or grand illuminations. Yet I seem to have accumulated a number of maxims and cliches, which leads to the dispiriting conclusion that perhaps there&#39;s no difference between ordinary commonplaces and sophisticated wisdom. On the other hand, it is undeniably the case that I am a different person now than I was twenty or forty or sixty years ago, so perhaps all these years have produced some changes in attitude and behavior. What follows is the first installment of either &quot;wisdom&quot; or &quot;commonplaces&quot; -- take your pick.</p>
<p>Although it is true that there are psychopaths and sociopaths, there are very few of them. Almost all the people I&#39;ve known over the years have been poor struggling mortals, like myself, trying to act decently and respectably. The difficult people with whom I&#39;ve had to deal are pathetic rather than villainous. They act badly because of their own inadequacies, anxieties and fear, not because they are innately vicious. A surprising number of people have endured dreadful traumas and most of them have recovered to live satisfactory lives. There are some poor souls who compensate badly. They cause pain to us, but more to themselves. It&#39;s not true that to know everything is to excuse everything, but knowing people&#39;s stories certainly helps you to become more empathetic and understanding. My younger self was much harsher and less compassionate toward difficult people than my present self.</p>
<p>Genuine understanding between individuals is difficult and misunderstanding is rife. It&#39;s hard to translate what&#39;s in your head to your friend or neighbor, and just as hard to understand what&#39;s in someone else&#39;s head by words alone. If you&#39;re going to be surprised because someone misunderstood you, then you&#39;re going to spend half your entire lifetime in a state of dreadful shock. Although irony and understatement are most useful figures of speech, beware of them. There&#39;s nothing more awkward (and sometimes dangerous) than an ironic remark that is taken seriously, or a serious remark that is understood ironically. A meaningful exchange of ideas or insights can&#39;t be brief, because it takes time for a shred or glimmer of understanding to grow and ripen. If you want to have a real friend, make the time. Understanding someone else&#39;s brain is akin to Zeno&#39;s Paradox; &#0160;you get halfway there but you never get all the way. &#0160;</p>
<p>Everyone is engaged in &quot;presentation of self.&quot; You meet someone new, and they tell you about themselves, but they&#39;re not really doing so in any profound way. They&#39;re not trying to. They&#39;re acting out the &quot;presentation&quot; that they&#39;ve devised over the years. They offer you a handful of anecdotes which they think represent themselves. But the fun and the satisfaction only begins when that first mask drops away. In order to know someone, you have to ask a question that is not truly intrusive but manages to take your new friend (or old friend, for that matter), a hair&#39;s breadth apart from their usual style of presentation. Sometimes it&#39;s not worth the effort, &#0160;but there are occasions when it can precipitate a worthwhile friendship. Too many conversations are not exchanges of information. &#0160;A says something from his repertoire of self-presentations; then B, impatiently waiting his turn to talk about himself, responds with a nugget from his own store. No genuine communication takes place. This kind of exchange is disappointing and almost useless. We all generate these forms of presentation partly as a defense against revealing too much of ourselves and becoming vulnerable, and because we all have our own follies and weaknesses. So we act a role. The further the contrived role is from the true self, the more transparent and even offensive it becomes. It&#39;s hard for people to be true to themselves; &#0160;it takes work. &#0160;</p>
<p>More wisdom (or commonplaces) coming soon. Stay tuned.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Three times in the last few weeks I&#39;ve had the opportunity to drop into other people&#39;s lives.</p>
<p>The most recent was a visit to the Mountain Men Rendezvous in Antonito, New Mexico.</p>
<p>&quot;Rendezvous,&quot; you ask? &#0160;In the 1830s, fur trappers gathered in various places in western North America to sell their furs and purchase supplies for the coming year. According to the story, they drank themselves silly, fornicated as much as possible, and played at various games and sports to pass the time while they waited for the wagons to arrive from St. Louis. Modern re-enactors dress in 1820s costumes, and, at least in Antonito, engage in knife and &quot;hawk&quot; (tomahawk) throwing contests.&#0160;</p>
<p>It was a world taken very seriously by the mountain men and their ladies. But strange, even otherworldly to me. I learned about the proper size of a hawk and how muzzle loading rifles work and I handled an elaborately beaded pouch made out of a bull&#39;s scrotum, owned by our host, whose &quot;mountain name&quot; was Long Tongue. But no liquor at this gathering. Lemonade only, I&#39;m glad to say. I wouldn&#39;t have been comfortable with all those knives and hawks whizzing around if the guys and gals had been addled with alcohol.</p>
<p>And also : a few weeks ago, in New Orleans, we shared lunch with the Lords of Leather. A scary, in-your-face name, but a more welcoming group of men I&#39;ve rarely met. Some were costumed, but most of them looked like a bunch of accountants enjoying a weekend cookout. No doubt their fellowship engaged private matters that I don&#39;t know about and wouldn&#39;t understand. Lives very different from mine.</p>
<p>Also in New Orleans, we attended a &quot;ball.&quot; &#0160;Not a ball that involves dancing -- more of a pageant, a display of elaborate costuming. It was sponsored by the Krewe of Iris, a group of women who roll their pageant wagons (floats) during Mardi Gras. We costumed ourselves for the ball -- fancy long dress and tuxedo. The members of the Krewe a) take it all very seriously, and b) know that it&#39;s silly and c) take it seriously nonetheless.</p>
<p>There must be thousands of these cultures and sub-cultures in our rich and various nation. I&#39;m happy to have participated, a bit, in these worlds.</p>
<p>And I wonder, of course, how strange and exotic my life and culture, bland and ordinary to me, might seem to some of the mountain men and leather-lords and Iris ladies.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I cooled my heels for more than an hour waiting for a &quot;blood draw.&quot; Why so long? There was no long line of people ahead of me. Was it simply that the department was understaffed? That they all went out for ice cream? Or were the blood-collectors, the vampires, gossiping and lazing about behind the curtain?&#0160;</p>
<p>I was miffed.</p>
<p>But it wasn&#39;t long before I transitioned from passive miff to active glare. Now, &quot;glaring&quot; is a powerful, if ineffective, way to deal with such inconveniences. I think that my powerglare was beginning to get the attention of the poor schlub sitting at the desk pretending to ignore me.&#0160;</p>
<p>But let me confess that there&#39;s a danger inherent in the glare, because if your lower lip quivers ever so slightly, you&#39;re no longer glaring, you&#39;re pouting. Of course I didn&#39;t want to be seen as a pouter. So I concentrated all my energy into my glare. I think I had it under control, but after a while, without making a conscious decision to do so, I escalated from glaring to seething.</p>
<p>The seethe is more difficult to express than the glare. You can glare with just your eyes, but you have to put your whole body into the seethe. For proper seething, you have to cross your arms and hunch over. And once you&#39;re in that posture, you can then begin to move from seething to simmering. But you must be careful not to be perceived as sulking.&#0160;</p>
<p>And then on to fuming. Fuming is very like seething and simmering -- the same hunched body posture -- but accompanied with heavy breathing and an occasional, intermittent through-the-teeth hiss. You&#39;ve got to make sure that your hiss is a true angry hiss and not a pathetic sniffle.</p>
<p>From fuming it was only a short step to boiling, which came at about the 55 minute mark.</p>
<p>Good thing my name was called on the hour, because I was just about to blow my top. &#0160;</p>

                                <p>When I downsized into my present residence in 2009, a few essential items disappeared, among them a venerable but excellent toaster. I did not replace it because I was distracted by more pressing matters. I went toasterless for almost five years. &#0160;</p>
<p>Later, when I entered into a tentative new relationship, toasterlessness became a matter of concern. Toast was an essential item in the diet of my new lady friend. For a while, before she began to spend nights with me, she would daily transport in bag or backpack -- along with toiletries and toothbrush and changes of undergarments -- her glamorous red enamel Cuisinart toaster. &#0160;</p>
<p>That this arrangement was comic became immediately apparent. No one can carry a toaster from one home to another day after day without feeling the irony.&#0160;</p>
<p>As our relationship solidified, it became clear that something had to be done, toasterwise. And so we came to realize that it was time to progress to a stable two-toaster situation.&#0160;</p>
<p>The Cuisinart went back to its original home and off we went to McGuckin&#39;s Hardware. There we acquired a Proctor Silex, with which we have lived until a short while ago. &#0160;</p>
<p>I don&#39;t want to badmouth the Proctor Silex, but let&#39;s face it, it&#39;s a cheap lightweight contraption with too much plastic and a tendency to leak crumbs over the counter. A paucity of knobs and controls. It&#39;s an entry-level toaster, a &quot;starter toaster.&quot; A provisional toaster that lacked the dignity that our maturing connection demanded.</p>
<p>So yesterday, at Peppercorn on the semi-famous Boulder Mall, we purchased a superior toaster -- a highly-recommended, weighty and substantial Breville two-slicer equipped with &quot;Lift and Lock&quot; and other bells and whistles (which we will no doubt some day master), the upper grill of which is inscribed with the comforting motto, &quot;BAGELS FACE INWARDS.&quot; A toaster of heft and permanence. It&#39;s sitting proudly on the counter now.</p>
<p>Moreover, we purchased it with our new joint credit card.</p>

                                <p>Actually, I didn&#39;t go TO the awards ceremony. This is what I wore to watch the Oscars on TV. Well, that&#39;s not entirely true either. I forgot to watch the Oscars. But I did wear the outfit.</p>
<p>My ensemble: plaid wool shirt by Woolrich; trousers by Lee (regular cut -- &quot;smoky quartz&quot; color); white cotton &quot;Gold Toe&quot; socks by Costco; shoes by Hoka (with orthopedic inserts by Dr. Scholl); genuine leather belt by SlideBelts; foundational undergarments by Fruit of the Loom and Carhartt; denim jacket by American Apparel. Accessories: eyeglasses by Kirkland Signature; hearing aids by Phonak. Traditional baseball cap by Otto (&quot;one size fits most&quot;).</p>
<p>Hair by Joe.</p>
<p>Once again, I&#39;d like to thank all the little people -- my fashion consultants, suppliers, and supporters -- for their imagination and hard work. I couldn&#39;t have done it without the entire team.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Among its other attractions. New Orleans (where I happen to be at this moment of writing) is a city blessed with street and avenue names that are both unusual, particular to the city, and glorious: Basin, Burgundy (accent on the gund), Calliope (three syllables), Desire, Dryades, Felicity, Frenchmen, Poydras, Prytania, Rampart, and of course Tchoupitoulas. Just a few to get the conversation started.</p>
<p>These names are elegant. No wonder I suffer from a desperate inferiority complex concerning the names of the streets on which I&#39;ve lived. East 9th Street, West 91 Street, 9th Street, 10th Street. Designations without character -- gray and boring. No resonance, no power. Bland.</p>
<p>Of course it hasn&#39;t been all bad: I once lived for a transitory summer (1961) on Snyder Hill Road -- a semi-poetic name that gestures at rurality.</p>
<p>I knew a guy who was raised on Old Oaken Bucket Road. I was initially dazzled -- until I learned that his neighbors had petitioned the city for a name change -- his street had formerly been called Third Avenue or Smith Road or something of that ilk. So it was not a real name -- it was pseudo-historical kitsch. What suburban pretension! What a comedown! I&#39;d have blushed with embarrassment if I had to admit that I lived on Old Oaken Bucket Road. It&#39;s almost as bad as Christmas Tree Drive (a real street in Boulder, Colorado, to the everlasting disgrace, nomenclature-wise, of our city).</p>
<p>But now in this latter end of my life, I&#39;ve achieved onomastic eminence. For half the year I live on Walnut Street, a name that is the epitome of small city authenticity (though it would be slightly better if there were an actual walnut tree anywhere nearby). And of summers I&#39;m at Hackett Hill Road, which is just perfectly titled, and even more perfect because there are numerous Hacketts in our local cemetery and because, fifty years ago, I met aged Edna Hackett, the last survivor of the family that gave its name to hill and road.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <div><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Approaching 80, I&#39;ve been studying the <em>Brooklyn Eagle</em> for the date of my birth, March 11, 1939. &quot;War and war&#39;s alarms&quot; dominate the news, but nevertheless day-to-day life in Brooklyn was reassuringly perennial. Here&#39;s a highlight from the Around the Town column:</span></div>
<div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
</div>
<div><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&quot;One of the features at the Montauk Club&#39;s 50th anniversary dinner tonight will be the lyrics written by Dr. J. L. McAteer. The genial dentist wrote all the lyrics for the show and they are expected to be quite something.&quot; </span></div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I have to confess that although I spent the first 17 years of my life in Brooklyn, I had never heard of the Montauk Club. But it exists! It was formed in 1890 and it&#39;s still there -- housed in a fancy Venetian Gothic building in Park Slope.</span></div>
<div>
<div aria-selected="false" class="G0fO6c" data-ved="0CAAQwNQFahcKEwjQ7-CX4_f7AhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQCA" role="gridcell" tabindex="0"><img alt="Photo" class="m7eMIc XPukcf" data-ils="3" data-imagekey="AF1QipMm98ujtMg5gNoAx9aWLonJsWvzudDUoqBTLoTA" data-v="" height="118" jsaction="rcuQ6b:trigger.M8vzZb;" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMm98ujtMg5gNoAx9aWLonJsWvzudDUoqBTLoTA=w141-h118-n-k-no-nu" width="141" /></div>
</div>
<div><img alt="Photo" class="m7eMIc XPukcf" data-ils="3" data-imagekey="AF1QipOb0a1gRQ-RuP3uL7JhmRCneZSbbF0KjejXdlce" data-v="" height="101" jsaction="rcuQ6b:trigger.M8vzZb;" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOb0a1gRQ-RuP3uL7JhmRCneZSbbF0KjejXdlce=w141-h101-n-k-no-nu" width="141" /></div>
<p>But it&#39;s not the Montauk Club that&#39;s the subject of this paragraph -- it&#39;s the &quot;genial dentist&quot; and lyricist J. T. McAteer who has quite something in store for us. &quot;Around the Town&quot; continues:&#0160;&#0160;&quot;Dr James McAteer is the dentist for the Brooklyn&#0160; Baseball Club and examines the teeth of each and every player on the club.&#0160; Seems that Business Manager Larry McPhail is fussy about it and insists on x-rays at least once each year. As far as McAteer is concerned, infielder Cookie Lavagetto has a perfect set of teeth, while good ones are owned by pitcher Van Mungo and infielder Johnny Hudson.&quot;</p>
<p>So now we know. Cookie Lavagetto had perfect teeth! What a revelation. Information that has been hidden for 80 years. Everyone knows that Lavagetto broke up Bill Bevan&#39;s 1947 World Series no-hitter with a double off the Ebbets Field scoreboard. But who knew a damn thing about his choppers?&#0160; This is neglected news of historic proportions.&#0160;</p>
<p>And it makes a guy wonder about the other players on the team (aside from those with semi-perfect teeth -- the legendary Van Lingle Mungo and unknown-to-me Johnny Hudson). Were other Dodger teeth cavity-filled, crooked, misshapen, stained with tobacco juice, busted, false, even missing. No wonder the &#39;39 Dodgers were so bad. Twenty-five players and only three to write home about, teeth-wise.</p>
<p>So here they are, the fabulous teeth of Cookie Lavagetto, bright and shiny, glistening at us over the years (I&#39;m sorry but I couldn&#39;t find a picture of Cookie&#39;s molars).</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <div class="lb-container"><a class="preview-img-cnt-holder"><span class="preview-img-cnt "><span class="preview-img-clipper portrait"><img alt="Old washboard Stock Photo" class="center-block" height="470" id="imgPopup" itemprop="image" src="https://c7.alamy.com/comp/CR7AFH/old-washboard-CR7AFH.jpg" title="Old washboard Stock Photo" width="299" /></span></span></a><br />
<div class="lb-nav">&#0160;</div>
<div class="lb-nav">This, young &#39;uns, is a picture of a washboard. It&#39;s an object that you might have happened upon in an antique store or a museum. The washboard -- this one is made of metal, like the one I remember from my childhood, but they could be made of glass or even wood -- sat in the &quot;laundry sink,&quot; which was filled with hot soapy water. You scrubbed your clothes on the washboard. It might be hard for you to believe, but when I was a youngster there was no such thing as a washing machine. It came later -- in our house, sometime in the early 50s, just a little after the refrigerator replaced the icebox. The washboard pictured above was cutting-edge technology in the 40s.</div>
<div class="lb-nav">&#0160;</div>
<div class="lb-nav">What was a &quot;laundry sink&quot;?&#0160; At 539 East 9 Street, and I think in most regular-people homes, the kitchen sink had two parts -- a shallow basin for everyday use, and a second basin, deeper and wider, for dirty clothes. In some houses, the laundry sink was made of soapstone or concrete, but ours was porcelain.</div>
<div class="lb-nav">&#0160;</div>
<div class="lb-nav">Every Thursday was &quot;wash day,&quot; which meant that my mother spent the entire day, dawn to dusk, doing the laundry, sometimes with the aid of a hired woman, but more often with the help of her mother, my grandmother, who lived just around the corner but spent wash day with us. It was a two-person job. Clothes were soaked, scrubbed on the washboard, rinsed, squeezed, then hung on the outside line to dry. Then, after a few hours, taken down and ironed. Sheets and pillowcases, if I remember correctly, were washed every week; blankets periodically.</div>
<div class="lb-nav">&#0160;</div>
<div class="lb-nav">It was a difficult task, but I don&#39;t think anyone ever recognized how arduous it was. It was just the way things were. Women, as everyone knew, &quot;did laundry.&quot; I am positive that I never thought to lift a finger to help, though I wonder, if my sister had survived, whether she would have been recruited to do so. Certainly, I never saw my father participate, not in the slightest. If my mother ever complained, she never did so in my hearing. &quot;Wash day&quot; customs were immutable, or seemed to be so. Gender relations in the world of my youth are embarrassing to recall.</div>
<div class="lb-nav">&#0160;</div>
<div class="lb-nav">Then, sometime around 1950, came the wringer-washer.</div>
<div class="lb-nav">&#0160;</div>
<div class="lb-nav"><img alt="Picture 1 of 1" src="https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/KBMAAOSwYxdbnkz-/s-l1600.jpg" /></div>
<div class="lb-nav">&#0160;</div>
<div class="lb-nav">Now no more hand squeezing. Clothes were washed in the tub, then fed through the mechanical wringer, which consisted of two rubber cylinders which were turned with a crank. The pressure squeezed out the water, eliminating the need for hand wringing. It was a great step forward. We owned a wringer-washer, portable, that had to be wheeled into place and connected to the kitchen faucets. It was a scary machine because a child had to worry that his mother&#39;s fingers would be accidentally wrung. &#0160;&#0160;</div>
<div class="lb-nav">&#0160;</div>
<div class="lb-nav">Sometime later (I can&#39;t remember exactly when) came the washing machine with a spin cycle. I remember that when I worked at the Sears Roebuck warehouse starting in 1957, that Sears sold and delivered many of them, so they must have appeared hard on the heels of the brief flowering of the wringer washer.&#0160;</div>
<div class="lb-nav">&#0160;</div>
<div class="lb-nav">In retrospect, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s an innovation that contributed more to the revolution in housework and therefore to the revolution in women&#39;s work and status than the washing machine. &#0160;</div>
<div class="lb-nav">&#0160;</div>
<div class="lb-nav">This morning I did my laundry. Two minutes to put the dirty clothes in the washing machine and another 30 seconds to transfer the clean clothes into the dryer. That&#39;s it.</div>
<div class="lb-nav">&#0160;</div>
<div class="lb-nav">Let us therefore pause to appreciate the luxury and convenience of contemporary laundering. And let us pause also to appreciate our hard-working mothers and grandmothers.</div>

                                <p>On East 9th Street, and probably in other parts of Brooklyn, a manhole cover was called a &quot;sewer.&quot; I don&#39;t know why. Ignorance, perhaps. As far as I know, manhole covers provided entrance to electrical work and other utilities, not to watercourses. Openings to the sewers that were located along the channel next to the curb were also called sewers. A sewer was also a unit of distance. &quot;He can hit a spaldeen three sewers.&quot; It was not a scientifically accurate form of measurement. &#0160;</p>
<p>A &quot;gutter&quot; is in most parts of the country a channel for water. On East 9th Street, the word &quot;gutter&quot; referred to the street&#39;s entire asphalted area, not just the area near the curb. &quot;Hey, kids, keep out of the gutter. You&#39;ll get hurt.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Stoop&quot; referred to the stairs leading up to the porch. In &quot;stoop ball,&quot; you throw your spaldeen at the stoop and catch it on the rebound. &#0160;Five points for a grounder, ten points for a fly ball, twenty points for a &quot;pointer.&quot;</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think there was a specific name for what is here called the &quot;park front area&quot;-- the space between the sidewalk and the curb. &#0160;Nor a word for &quot;curb cut.&quot; which was considered, linguistically, as a section of a driveway.</p>
<p>East 9th Street had a wonderful tree canopy. In retrospect, I can identify and recall a very large sycamore and a series of Norway maples, but the only trees that had names were a trio of huge old elms which were called &quot;Mickey&#39;s trees.&quot; I have no idea why they were so called nor do I know who was this Mickey of famous memory. The elms were cut down in the late 40s (Dutch elm disease) -- &#0160;a tremendous loss to East 9th Street.&#0160;</p>
