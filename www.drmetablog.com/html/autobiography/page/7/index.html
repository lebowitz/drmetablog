                                <p>Let&#39;s say I was thirteen, so this event would have occurred on or our about 1952. I had brought my Raleigh 3-speed to the Cortelyou Road bicycle repair shop which was between East 13th and East 14th. The shop was run by a small, fair, heavily-accented German man who was perhaps 50 years old. He was assisted by his father, an older and smaller, wizened, bald man who must have been in his 80s. Mr. Hart and Mr. Hart.The older Mr. Hart, whom in my adolescent wisdom I thought of as a gnome, was working on my bike -- replacing an inner tube or adjusting the gears (which were fragile and frequently busted). A group of three middle-aged women gathered on the sidewalk in front of the shop, chatting. Mr. Hart the elder, the gnome, didn&#39;t like it. He looked up from his work and muttered to me, &quot;A real hen-party.&quot; &#0160;A few minutes later, he said, as if he owned the sidewalk, &quot;they&#39;re still there. Hen party.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>I had never heard the expression &quot;hen party&quot; but I knew it was a slur. A piece of anti-woman bigotry. I mean, what was the problem with three women talking on a public street?&#0160;</p>
<p>But what disturbed me was that Mr. Hart took it for granted that I was on his side -- that we were linked by our maleness, our roosterness, against hens. I knew (in language that did not at that point exist), that I was being &quot;co-opted.&quot; &#0160;But although I was uneasy, I was able to offer only silent resistance. I failed. Later I learned to challenge such mini-bigotries but at this point in life I was much too young, too unsure.&#0160;</p>
<p>Of all the events that occurred in 1952, this trivial encounter is one that clings and needs to be exorcised.&#0160;</p>
<p>But it is such experiences that shape us. As David Copperfield says, &quot;Trifles make the sum of life.&quot;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I&#39;ve reached the age when, neuroscience claims, the &quot;wisdom centers&quot; of the brain (the anterior cingulate and ventromedial prefrontal cortices) are supposed to leap into action. Do they? Tell truth, I don&#39;t know. Have I, without awareness or drama, metamorphosed from a jejune larva, dull as dishwater, into a butterfly of wisdom? When did it happen? At this moment or writing, I confess that I feel less wise than tired. &#0160;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, let me offer, with maximum diffidence, a few homemade aphorisms and <em>sententiae.&#0160;</em>Whether they amount to wisdom, and whether they do credit to my anterior or prefrontal lobes, my loyal readers will have to decide. &#0160;</p>
<p>A) &quot;Nothing ever happens until it happens.&quot; This proverb is slightly gnomic, so let me gloss. If you assume that just because you&#39;ve carefully planned your trip to Tahiti or your visit to the new restaurant or even your outing to the local barbershop that it&#39;s going to happen, you might be in for disappointment. Wait until you&#39;re there before you get excited. There&#39;s many a slip twixt the cup and the lip. Rejoice appropriately -- when it&#39;s time. By doing so, you avoid elation deflation.&#0160;</p>
<p>B) &quot;No one knows what&#39;s going on between two people, even if you&#39;re one of them.&quot; &#0160;I think this proverb is eminently self-explanatory. It applies mostly to marriage but equally so to all dyadic relationships. Even between you and your dog.</p>
<p>C) &#0160;&quot;The only people who idealize the past are those that know nothing about it.&quot; &#0160;Slavery, plague, torture, injustice, famine, rapine, brutality, poverty, starvation. Etc.</p>
<p>D) &quot;You&#39;re immortal until the day you die.&quot; Of course you are and don&#39;t let the nay-sayers and &quot;realists&quot; bother you.</p>
<p>E) &#0160;&quot;Religion: my Prince of Peace can beat up your Prince of Peace.&quot; Tribalism sucks.</p>
<p>F) &#0160;&quot;Enough is as good as a feast, and often better.&quot; Figurative meaning: a modest sufficiency is all that is needed for a happy life. Literal meaning: one hamburger (or half a hamburger) lies more easily on the stomach than two or three. And hold the fries.</p>
<p>G) &#0160;&quot;The secret of life is to turn routines into rituals.&quot; &#0160;Self-explanatory, I think. Make a fuss about that glass of wine at four o&#39;clock. Savor it.</p>
<p>H) &#0160;&quot;The longer something has been believed by mankind, the less likely it is to be true.&quot; &#0160;See C above.</p>

<p>1655 Walnut Street, Boulder, Colorado. On the second floor, just to the left (as you look from the street) of the main entrance. It&#39;s not a handsome building, in my opinion, but the condos are clean and comfortable and new. I&#39;ve been here since 2009 and plan to stay. Going to go out feet first, as the cliche would have it. There&#39;s ample but not too much room and lots of sun (my living room windows are south-facing) and convenience. We&#39;re here more than half the year -- the rest of the time in Vermont (almost 5 months) and New Orleans (one month during the winter). We&#39;re one block off the semi-famous Boulder Mall, with all sorts of foody restaurants that we don&#39;t patronize as well as coffee shops and marijuana outlets. There&#39;s also an outdoor gear shop every few feet. Things could be worse.&#0160;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>From 1965 to 1969, from my 26th to 30th year, I lived at 215 West 91 Street on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, first in a 4 room apartment on the 6th floor and later in a 5 room apartment on the 5th floor. Two babies came home to this place.</p>
<div class="w_photogallery_main">
<div class="img_transition"><img onerror="this.src=&#39;https://img3.cityrealty.com/neo/i/l/missing_big.png&#39;" src="https://ds4.cityrealty.com/img/9f8641b1f55632ff5d83faaf1924577eb24a63e1+736++0+60" /></div>

<div class="img_transition">
<div class="w_photogallery_main">
<div class="img_transition"><span style="line-height: 1.3;">It&#39;s called a &quot;beaux arts&quot; building and dates from 1917. It hasn&#39;t changed much if at all in the last 50 years though it&#39;s gone from rental to coop. (I&#39;ve written about the changes to the Upper West Side <a href=" https://www.drmetablog.com/2008/02/upper-west-side.html"></a><a href=" https://www.drmetablog.com/2008/02/upper-west-side.html">elsewhere.) </a>There was nothing distinguished about the building or our two apartments but they were spacious and serviceable. I liked Riverside Park, just two blocks to the west, which was an excellent place for infants. Central Park, a few blocks to the east was off limits in the 60s because of the druggies and general violence. &#0160;</span></div>
<div class="img_transition">&#0160;</div>
<div class="img_transition"><span style="line-height: 1.3;">We made friends. We took as much advantage of the cultural amenities as our limited budget and intense schedules would allow. I wish to heck that there hadn&#39;t been an always-on-duty exhibitionist right across the air shaft from our kitchen window.&#0160;</span></div>
<div class="img_transition">&#0160;</div>
<div class="img_transition"><span style="line-height: 1.3;">I do not have very good memories of this place. I was not happy with the state of my employment. I loved the boys but they were hard work and the neighborhood was inconvenient for children. And society was in an uproar because of the foolish destructive Vietnam war. I was glad to leave this place behind. I think my happiest days were the days spent packing up, getting ready to go.&#0160; And then driving the Dodge across the country to Colorado.</span></div>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Dear Talia, Oliver, Ella, Lola, Luke, Caleb, and Asher:&#0160;</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a picture of your great grandmother, Anne Krull Goss (1912-2009) with her siblings.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef022ad3ad65eb200d-pi"><img alt="Akgsibs1" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef022ad3ad65eb200d img-responsive" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef022ad3ad65eb200d-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Akgsibs1" /></a><br />Anne is the pretty young blonde woman, second from the left. She&#39;s the oldest.</p>
<p>The picture was taken during the World War II years, &#39;42 or &#39;43. On great grandma&#39;s right is her brother Jack, whose tank was hit by cannon fire. He was the only survivor of his crew and spent many months recuperating in an army hospital. On her left is Hy, who was exempted from service, if I remember correctly, because his business was declared an essential industry. On Hy&#39;s left is your great-great aunt Frieda. Frieda&#39;s fiance (a soldier who was named Aubrey, but I don&#39;t know anything else about him) was killed in Europe. On Frieda&#39;s left is Mendy, the youngest, who was a bombardier on a B-24.</p>
<p>The war disrupted many lives, not only those who served but those who stayed at home. &#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been lucky -- too young for Korea and too old for Vietnam. I hope you are similarly lucky. &#0160;Better than that -- &#0160;I hope these endless wars in which we&#39;re engaged (in Afghanistan and Syria right now) come to an end.</p>

<p>From 1973 until 2009, this was the place. My longest stay in one location and the childhood home of my children. The house had good bones, as they say, when we arrived and was well worth the $46,500 that we paid for it. But the innards had been remodeled into oblivion. Green shag carpet covering the lovely oak floors; slick craftsman woodwork covered with white paint; stained-glass window replaced and disfigured with a beaded curtain in the style of a New Orleans whorehouse; flocked wall paper; some sort of plastic substance glued onto the pine kitchen floor; and a kitchen untouched since 1917 and hopelessly out of date. It took years to get it into shape, but by the time we left, it was looking mighty fine. I was sad to leave but the time had come to move on.</p>
<p>I still miss the colorful spring garden, stocked with peonies both herbaceous and tree, day lilies, irises, a lovely weigela, and a wall of clematis.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Although my parents were pure and perfect atheists, they did not advertise their atheism or disparage the religions of others -- at least not in my hearing. They were exactly the opposite of what is sometimes called &quot;militant atheists.&quot; To be militant would have been to give religion too much regard, too much importance -- and they wouldn&#39;t have bothered. To the best of my recollection, they were utterly indifferent. In our house, it was as if theology and worship had never been invented, practiced, or pondered. While my parents didn&#39;t enforce or evangelize their views upon their children, their unconcern, their lack of interest, was eloquence enough. Of course my brothers and I grew up to be atheists, and have remained so. Peaceful and positive atheists.</p>
<p>My parents were both readers. Every Tuesday my mother trundled over to the McDonald Avenue branch of the Brooklyn Public Library and trucked home a shopping basket full of books. There were volumes of all kinds -- mostly fiction and mysteries for my mother and, for my curiosity-driven father, politics, law, science, history, art, and of course, gardening. But I never saw a book on religion. Not a one. In their bookshelves at home, I remember only one volume that might have touched on the subject. It was a collection of essays by the Freethinker Robert Ingersoll.&#0160;</p>
<p>I was young boy, perhaps 10 or 11, when I overheard some friend or acquaintance of my mother say something to her about prayer, or putting faith in the lord, or some such platitude. She waited politely until the person departed and then turned to me and murmured, quietly, &quot;Well, I suppose some people need a crutch.&quot; &#0160;I think that&#39;s the sum of all I ever heard from her on the subject of religion. One might think that the dismissive term &quot;crutch&quot; hinted at disdain or superiority (<em>they</em> need crutches but <em>we</em> don&#39;t) but it was not so. My mother&#39;s observation was made without prejudice or judgment.&#0160;</p>
<p>Where other households might have worshiped or wondered or discussed, for us there was absolutely nothing. Religious education? &#0160;None, not a drop. In our home, there was no attendance at temple, mosque or tabernacle, no religious ceremonies, and not even a Bible. I can remember my father and me dribbling our basketball to the schoolyard to shoot some hoops. When we passed the local orthodox synagogue, my father said, &quot;Bingo.They play bingo in there.&quot; But he was not condemning the religion. It was the gambling. He disapproved of gambling (even Bingo) and the idea that a religious institution would allow gambling every Tuesday night offended him deeply.&#0160;</p>
<p>When I was a questioning adolescent, out of a spirit of curiosity and perhaps rebellion, I liberated a bible from our local public library and secreted it under my treasured collection of <em>Mad</em>&#0160;magazines. While others of my age cohort were squinting at smuggled <em>Playboys</em> or at <em style="line-height: 1.3;">The Amboy Dukes</em> <span style="line-height: 1.3;">under the blankets by flashlight, I was acquainting myself with the holy scriptures. In my ignorance, I thought of the bible as a forbidden book, one which my parents would have disapproved. But I was wrong. They wouldn&#39;t have noticed; they wouldn&#39;t have cared. Looking back, I&#39;m sure that they knew about my thirst for forbidden knowledge and probably enjoyed a giggle at my expense. Many years later, when my father was a widower, I gave him a copy of an annotated, edited Bible that I used as a textbook in one of my literature courses. Did he disapprove? &#0160;Not at all. He said, &quot;It&#39;s interesting.&quot; &#0160;But of course he read it not as an inspired text but as history and as fiction.&#0160;</span></p>
<p>To have been raised in such a household was my good fortune. My atheism was an unearned gift. I got it free, and I&#39;m perpetually grateful. Many of my friends, growing up in religious families, have struggled to achieve atheism -- often with painful inner conflicts and anger and resentments. I admire them for the strength to break free -- especially those that live with irreparable breaches to the family. I endured no such struggle.&#0160;</p>
<p>Philosophically speaking, it&#39;s been an easy life. There&#39;s a clarity about atheism. It&#39;s based in reality, not (dare I say what my parents wouldn&#39;t!) in wish and myth and superstition. Atheists, I think, are afforded a purer appreciation of human achievement and a clearer, less conflicted understanding of health, disease, and death. Reason and the evidence of the senses may not always lead to perfect understanding, but they&#39;re the best tools that we have, and we must cherish them. &#0160;&#0160;</p>

                                <p><a class="irc_mil i3597" data-noload="" data-ved="2ahUKEwj0kqeZobffAhUG2oMKHWE6AF4QjRx6BAgBEAU" href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj0kqeZobffAhUG2oMKHWE6AF4QjRx6BAgBEAU&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.alamy.com%2Fbroken-arrow-us-1950-debra-paget-date-1950-image157185277.html&amp;psig=AOvVaw1RfpO_tAp0NefTWcn7rx3-&amp;ust=1545698141557022" jsaction="mousedown:irc.rl;focus:irc.rl" rel="noopener" tabindex="0" target="_blank"><img alt="Image result for debra paget images" class="irc_mi" height="497" onload="typeof google===&#39;object&#39;&amp;&amp;google.aft&amp;&amp;google.aft(this)" src="http://c8.alamy.com/comp/K3MBBW/broken-arrow-us-1950-debra-paget-date-1950-K3MBBW.jpg" width="366" /></a></p>
<p>In 1951, when <em>Broken Arrow</em> hit the Leader Theater on Coney Island Avenue, I was just an ungrown twelve-year-old. I wasn&#39;t an assiduous movie-goer because weekends were for basketball and softball, but when I did invest my 14 cents in a matinee, it was for a Western &#0160;-- not for a soppy musical or scary crime film. Last night, for the first time in 67 years, I watched <em>Broken Arrow </em>again. I imagined that I would remember it clearly.</p>
<p>Hold on, let me be scrupulously honest here. I didn&#39;t pretend that I would remember the entirety of the film, not even the plot. I knew only that Sanseearah, the Indian Maiden &quot;Morningstar&quot; as portrayed by Debra Paget, was incised into the deep fabric of my brain. She, Debra that is, might have been my greatest crush or first true love. And why shouldn&#39;t she have been? Just direct your admiring gaze to the still above. Miss Paget was young, lovely, exotic as all get out, and yielding. I admit with chagrin that I didn&#39;t fully understand what got me so het up about her in 1951, but het up I was.</p>
<p>But all is changed, now, almost three generations later. What was &quot;hot&quot; and romantic then seems more than a little creepy now. Debra Paget (or DebraLee Griffin, of Denver, Colorado) was only sixteen years old when the film was shot. Sixteen! Moreover, she plays younger. In fact, the film devotes several long scenes to Morningstar&#39;s &#0160;puberty rites -- so perhaps she&#39;s imagined to be thirteen. (The head dress that she wears in the picture below as well as the rest of the ceremony, was, I am sure, what is now called &quot;fakelore.&quot;)</p>
<p><a class="rg_l" href="https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fi.pinimg.com%2Foriginals%2F8f%2F5a%2Fa2%2F8f5aa29bc28892e8f6e09cc0a3235853.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pinterest.com%2Fpin%2F349873464789245837%2F&amp;docid=c0VGuR-xGgYxSM&amp;tbnid=WRIZ546Ic5a86M%3A&amp;vet=10ahUKEwi2xLay37ffAhXcITQIHd-BBlAQMwhuKCQwJA..i&amp;w=400&amp;h=250&amp;bih=782&amp;biw=1600&amp;q=broken%20arrow%20film%201950%20images&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi2xLay37ffAhXcITQIHd-BBlAQMwhuKCQwJA&amp;iact=mrc&amp;uact=8" jsaction="fire.ivg_o;mouseover:str.hmov;mouseout:str.hmou" jsname="hSRGPd" rel="noopener"><img alt="Image result for broken arrow film 1950 images" class="rg_ic rg_i" data-src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQv4qJO4TzMZTxpyoIcyuwIPk2HVhc9i-X0oNrJD8FGq3_jqGILLQ" jsaction="load:str.tbn" onload="typeof google===&#39;object&#39;&amp;&amp;google.aft&amp;&amp;google.aft(this)" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQv4qJO4TzMZTxpyoIcyuwIPk2HVhc9i-X0oNrJD8FGq3_jqGILLQ" /></a></p>
<p>Look at her. The poor dear is barely out of childhood. Mr. Stewart (James Stewart, her graying white mountain-man suitor) was forty-two years old, and looks every bit of it. How can we, how did we, not notice the age difference? Why is he attracted by a child? &#0160;I tried hard to suspend disbelief, but my powers of suspension are not infinite. The film, I&#39;m sorry to say, teeters into unsavory child-molesting territory. &#0160;</p>
<p>My pre-adolescent fascination with the film has now been altered, dampened and dispatched.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a shame, too, because&#0160;<em>Broken Arrow&#0160;</em>was a self-consciously progressive film in which the Apaches were figured not as brutal savages but as human beings. It deserves high praise for its groundbreaking stance. The film was written by the leftist Albert Maltz, of Brooklyn, New York, who was one of the Hollywood Ten, and who, on the day I saw <em>Broken Arrow</em> for the first time, was in jail serving a one-year sentence for refusing to cooperate with the runaway House Un-American Activities Committee.&#0160;</p>
<p>I therefore wish that the film hadn&#39;t been compromised by the March-October love affair. And that Albert Maltz hadn&#39;t side-stepped the real difficulties of an interracial marriage in the 1880s by allowing Dear Debra to be murdered. &#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>And while I&#39;m wishing, I wish also that the authorities at Twentieth-Century Fox hadn&#39;t insisted that the two most important Apache roles be played not by Apaches but by whites. Debra Paget is the one lead, while Cochise, the Apache chief, was played in redface by Jeff Chandler, formerly Ira Grossel, a graduate of Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn, New York. It&#39;s not as though more appropriate actors weren&#39;t available. In fact, the character of Geronimo, who has one brief speech, was played by an uncredited Jay Silverheels, an accomplished actor of Cayuga and Mohawk heritage.</p>
<p>But would we, in 1951, have been able to empathize with real Apaches, genuine Apaches, rather than with familiar faces in heavy makeup? Or would such Indians have been, even for liberals, too &quot;other,&quot; too foreign?</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Two nights ago [this would be October of 2009, of course], I watched the Phillies trounce the Dodgers, 11-0. What a colossal drubbing! HDTV let me appreciate Cliff Lee&#39;s southpaw masterpiece in exquisite detail. But for me the most memorable moment of the evening wasn&#39;t Lee&#39;s artistry or 270-pound Ryan Howard&#39;s mad-dash triple to right. Instead, it was the discovery that the Phillies&#39;&#0160; lanky, awkward-but-effective scraggly-bearded right fielder Jayson Werth sports a noteworthy baseball pedigree. His grandfather was Ducky Schofield, a good-field no-hit infielder from the 1950s -- from the days, that is, of my golden youth. Holy jumping jiminy! I saw this young feller&#39;s grandpappy play!&#0160;</p>
<p>Youch!&#0160; More evidence, as if more were needed, of my long-in-the-toothedness.</p>
<p>Why should I be surprised?&#0160; I went to my first baseball game in 1946 (at Ebbets Field -- Cardinals 3, Dodgers 1). &#0160;Before there was TV. I&#39;ve been attending to the game for 63 years. Close to three generations. &#0160;[Nine more years have passed since I first wrote this; &#0160;so 72 years now.] &#0160;</p>
<p>I&#39;ve grown accustomed to father-son combos. Bobby and Barry; the Griffeys (who once played together in the same outfield); Felipe and Moises; huge&#0160;Cecil Fielder and his even more enormous son, Prince; the Hundleys, the Stottlemyres, and many, many others. Sometimes while I&#39;m watching a game I lose track of time. Eric Young, Jr. looks and runs so exactly like his father that it&#39;s easy to fall into flashback mode. I remember a game&#0160;in which&#0160;Pedro Borbon came in to relieve. Holy moly, I said to myself -- he&#39;s&#0160;a right-handed pitcher. Why the heck is he throwing&#0160;with his left hand?&#0160; Then after a few seconds of complete bafflement it came to me:&#0160;Pedro Borbon, Jr. I had simply lost twenty-five years -- a phenomenon to which your &quot;mature&quot; brain is occasionally and increasingly prone.</p>
<p>Jayson Werth isn&#39;t even the sole grandson. Aaron Boone&#39;s father was the catcher (and manager) Bob Boone and his grandfather was&#0160;the Cleveland infielder Ray Boone, whom I also saw play, but only on the TV. And then there&#39;s the Bell family:&#0160;grandsons David&#0160;and Mike, father Buddy, and grandfather Gus, a big hitter with Cincinnati during the&#0160;Ducky Schofield years. &#0160;</p>
<p>So here&#39;s the question. Will I hang around long enough to watch the great-grandsons play? Is Jayson Werth fertile? &#0160;Does he have any kids? &#0160;Are there any budding Boones or baby Bells waiting in the wings?</p>

                                <p>378 Broadway in Cambridge, Massachusetts from 1960 to early in 1962. It was a two-family frame house in which the second floor had been turned into two apartments. We were in one of them, a bedroom, a living room with a kitchen and a detached bathroom down the hall. Perfectly fine for a newlywed graduate student. The newlywed neighbors, Adi and Rutty, are still friends; their daughter, Zerlina, born in April of 1961, was the first child I held in my arms (as an adult). But there was a conflict with the puritanical small-town Irish Catholic landlady because we had allowed a friend to stay in the apartment while we were away &quot;and he brought a woman in.&quot; So we moved to a university-owned apartment house on Irving Street, between Cambridge and Kirkland, despite the fact that it raised our rent from $90 a month to $105. We bought a second or third or fourth hand bed for $25 and a rug for $10. It was a serviceable apartment that seemed like luxury after the decrepit Ithaca digs. We stayed until the summer of 1965 when we lit out for Manhattan. &#0160;</p>

                                <p>Some childhood summer residences. &#0160;</p>
<p>1944: my mother had surgery (I was never informed what sort -- such things were kept secret in those days -- but I suspect a hysterectomy) and I was sent to live with my grandmother Sonia, who rented or owned a house near Monticello, New York. It was a plain wood-shingled house and I believe that Sonia used it as an informal hotel or b&amp;b. I don&#39;t remember much at all except that she tied a long string to a light bulb over my bed and instructed me to pull it if I needed help during the night. Help? Though only 5, I considered myself quite self-sufficient.</p>
<p>1945: my parents rented a summer home on Glen Lake in the Catskills. It was a house without indoor plumbing. I have a vivid memory of the outhouse, which frightened me because you could look into the hole and see your and your parents&#39; deposits. I remember with more pleasure the pump in the kitchen through which we drew our water. Sometimes I was allowed to prime the pump by pouring a glass of water down its mouth. In August, the war ended and people who owned motor boats were zooming around the lake, shouting. I asked my father what was going on and he said, &quot;the war is over.&quot;</p>
<p>1947, 1948, 1949: the best part of my childhood. Three long idyllic summers on Makamah Beach near Northport, N.Y. I have written about this&#0160;<a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2006/03/makamah.html" ping="/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=http://www.drmetablog.com/2006/03/makamah.html&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjRxNT5vZvfAhWF6oMKHb7qBwcQFjAAegQIBRAB"></a><a href=" https://www.drmetablog.com/2006/03/makamah.html">elsewhere.</a></p>

                                <p>Between 1956 and 1961, I lived in five different places in Ithaca, New York: four bad, one good.</p>
<p>The first was a cinder-block dormitory room, less a home than a cell, which I shared with a young guy from Virginia who was a not only a smoker but a classic Southern bigot of a type that&#39;s pretty much extinct nowadays. No doubt he&#39;s changed and matured, but our paths have not crossed these last sixty years. We were both very young, but I was much too young. Childish, when I&#39;m honest with myself. The following year -- 1957-58 -- I lived in a basement apartment in a building that was known locally as the &quot;Indian Embassy&quot; because the upper three floors were all inhabited by men (no women, not a trace of them) from the subcontinent. The odor of garam masala and turmeric, much more exotic then than now, regularly drifted into my apartment. I remember that my kitchen, which I rarely used, was unheated and that it was not unusual to find in midwinter a pot or pan of water, left in the sink, frozen into a block of ice. If the city of Ithaca had any zoning laws, and enforced them, the owner of my apartment, Miss Emily, would have been exiled to Siberia. In my third year in Ithaca I lived in still another beaten-down house on College Avenue. It was also unfit for adult habitation but had a functioning kitchen -- it&#39;s there that I learned to cook my own food. In my senior year, I lived in a real apartment -- four bedrooms, three roommates, including one who has remained a lifelong friend. I should have noticed, but I didn&#39;t, that the fourth floor of an ancient building made entirely of wood, with no fire escape, was dangerous. It was a firetrap and although I survived, the building didn&#39;t, and was demolished a few years after I graduated -- and left the southern tier for good.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>My favorite residence during the Ithaca years came during the summer of 1961, when, fleeing graduate school in Cambridge and still attached to Ithaca, we (my bride and I) sublet a small (very small house -- essentially a single room that served as both living room and bedroom) -- at 148 Snyder Hill Road. It was my first experience of living in &quot;the country.&quot; There was a cow next door! When I returned to Ithaca in 1992 for my daughter&#39;s graduation from Cornell, my house had disappeared and the fields were filled with acres of rich suburban homes -- large lots, big lawns, clean, neat and prosperous.</p>
<p>Our 1961 house, though not more than a tumbledown cabin, gave us a good summer and a good memory.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>From my birth in 1939 until I left for college in 1956, I lived at 539 East 9 Street in the Flatbush (now gentrified to &quot;Kensington&quot;) section of Brooklyn. 539 was a three-story, three-family wood-frame Victorian, which my parents had acquired in 1937 for $4500 -- a depression-era fire-sale price financed by my generous &quot;maiden aunt&quot; Mollie. The house was larger and more splendid, I believe, than my father&#39;s modest income would otherwise have justified. At first we lived on the first floor and rented floors two and three. Much later, substantially more prosperous, we rented the first floor apartment and lived on the second and third floors in nine spacious rooms, only a couple of which mattered to me.</p>
<p>Most mysterious was my parents&#39; &#0160;bedroom, which was entirely off limits to me and to my brothers Eugene and Jonathan. A forbidden zone. Absolutely taboo. I remember that one time I played some sort of racing or hiding game with one of my brothers and ventured into the room and -- horror of horrors &#0160;-- rumpled my parents&#39; neat bedspread (the bed was always carefully made). It was as if I had robbed a bank or bitten Miss Bildersee, our formidable PS 217 principal. I was severely rebuked and made to swear that I would never commit such an outrageous transgression again. An overreaction by my parents, I knew even then. &#0160;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I used to sneak into the room when the parents were absent. In one corner hung a picture of my deceased infant sister Susan. Placed on the floor under the picture, was a child-size chair of wood and rush which was venerated even more than the connubial bed. A shrine. I&#39;m sure that the taboo against entering the room was linked to the shrine. Yet to me, the parents&#39; bedroom was not so much holy as it was weird and strange. &#0160;</p>
<p>After my mother died in 1978 my father moved downstairs, abandoning shrine, bed and bedroom. When I visited as an adult, my wife and I would sometimes sleep in what had formerly been the parents&#39; bed. That was mighty creepy and inhibiting. &#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>Equally important to me but much more pleasant was my father&#39;s small but intensely cultivated backyard garden. He grew roses -- hybrid teas, mostly but also a floriferous &quot;Blaze&quot; climber. An apple tree, not very prolific, a Bartlett pear, and a peach tree that was damaged by the hurricane of 1946 and finished off by borers. There was also a patch of perennial sweet peas, a weigela with picotee&#0160; leaves, and a fragrant mock orange. But the garden was dominated by Dad&#39;s&#0160; perfectly tended roses.&#0160;</p>
<p>In 1948 I was allotted a square foot of space in which I planted a single pumpkin seed. The plant transgressed its assigned borders -- &#0160;which amused me no end -- and the single pumpkin that it produced was prizeworthy huge. In subsequent years, I was allowed room to plant and study the habits of old-fashioned annuals: snapdragons, marigolds, zinnias. I saved their seeds over the winter. I now grow those same plants in their modern, much-improved versions. But I don&#39;t dare to try roses; that will always be Dad&#39;s domain. &#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>I think my life would have been very different without the garden.&#0160;</p>
<p>On the whole, 539 was very good to us. After my father died, it was torn down and replaced with an undistinguished apartment house rented by families of Hasids. My very secular father would have been appalled.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a picture of 539 as it appeared in 1940.&#0160; The kid&#39;s toy in front of the house probably belonged to my older brother.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>In 1957 (I was 18 and in my second year in college), the reverend doctor Billy Graham led the largest revival meeting in history -- an average attendance, in the old-old Madison Square Garden, of eighteen thousand people a night for three months. What was his message? &#0160;It was half jingo, half Christian fundamentalism. &quot;Let us tell the world that Americans believe in God, that we are morally and spiritually strong as well as militarily and economically. Let us tell the world that we are united and ready to march under the banner of Almighty God&quot; -- not a sentiment that would have been dear to my heart. No Almighty God in my upbringing or anywhere in my brain.&#0160;</p>
<p>Graham was a fervent anti-Communist, but of a sort that left me baffled: &quot;My own theory about Communism,&quot; he proclaimed, &quot;is that it is master-minded by Satan. I think there is no other explanation for the tremendous gains of Communism in which they seem to outwit us at every turn, unless they have supernatural power and wisdom and intelligence given to them.&quot; &#0160;Let me try two non-Satanic explanations for apparent Communist success: 1) &quot;They&quot; didn&#39;t outwit us; &#0160;in fact, they were dumber than us, overplayed their hand, and collapsed. 2) European and American imperialism had left a mess in the &quot;underdeveloped countries&quot; that was ripe for exploitation. &#0160;</p>
<p>How was a secular partially-educated young fellow supposed to understand such a paranoid, irrational &#0160;analysis of world politics?</p>
<p>With mockery, I&#39;m afraid. Sometime in the middle of the summer of 1957, along with a bunch of wise-ass PS 217 cronies, I took a break from my Sears, Roebuck warehouse job and took the subway to 49th Street to take a gander and a listen to the Crusade for Christ (it was free). What do I remember? &#0160;A chorus (probably led by George Beverly Shea but I can&#39;t swear to it), bright lights, a cheering, milling crowd. I remember that Billy spoke, but I have no recollection of what he said, though the bronze gong of a voice resounded through the hall. Did he tell us of the five ways that Americans could most effectively combat Communism? By &quot;old-fashioned Americanism&quot; -- whatever that was, by &quot;conservative and evangelical Christianity,&quot; by prayer, by &quot;spiritual revival,&quot; and by &quot;personal Christian experience.&quot; All five of which sound pretty much the same to me. And remote from my experience or desires.</p>
<p>Needless to say, I wasn&#39;t his most sympathetic or susceptible auditor. &#0160;</p>
<p>I wonder if he touched on another of his favorite topics that night: that &quot;a woman commits sin when she deliberately dresses in such a way as to entice a man&quot;; &quot;that a wife &quot;should keep herself attractive and give her husband a big kiss when he comes home from the office instead of yelling at him from the kitchen.&quot;</p>
<p>Except for the spectacle, it&#39;s all vague in my mind. I do remember, though, that when leaving that Garden I accidentally and momentarily found myself on the line of people who had made a &quot;decision for Christ&quot; and were heading to the podium. That was scary. I beat a quick retreat. &#0160;</p>
<p>I wonder how many other members of the audience were rubberneckers like me.&#0160;</p>
<p>I&#39;m reminded now of the great old gospel song by the Carter Family, &quot;Something Got a Hold of Me.&quot; &#0160;It&#39;s a parable that tells the story of a man who goes to a revival meeting to scoff. &quot;I says I&#39;ll go down, take a look at the crowd/ &#0160;It&#39;s just the weak-minded I feel.&quot; &#0160;But then there&#39;s a revelation: &quot;<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">They sing and shout and they all clasp their hands/ And they all got down on their knees./ When the fire fell from heaven it fell upon me,/&#0160;And then I fell to the floor.&quot; Because</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Something&#39;s got a hold of me.</span></p>
<p>Yes, something&#39;s got a hold of me.</p>
<p>I have a spirit I&#39;ll never forget</p>
<p>That something&#39;s got a hold of me.<br /><br />Well, nothing got a hold of me. No fire from heaven, no road to Damascus revelation. If anything, I was confirmed in my scoffery and atheism.</p>
<p>What did I learn? Not much. At the most, only that if the people who inhabit this country, my fellow Americans, are incomprehensible to me, then it is equally likely that I am incomprehensible to them.</p>
<p>And frankly, the mysteries that I encountered in Madison Square Garden in 1957 are, sixty years later, still mysterious to this day. Perhaps even more so.</p>

                                <p>My most valuable possession, lifetime, was my baseball mitt. A fielder&#39;s glove, not a catcher&#39;s or first baseman&#39;s. It was, I think, a Rawlings model, and it was inscribed with the name &quot;Monte Pearson.&quot; (Pearson had been a pitcher for the Cleveland Indians.) &#0160;I remember many hours spent oiling it. I guarantee that it was well cared for.</p>
<p>In the P. S. 217 neighborhood, to possess one&#39;s own baseball glove was a marker of class. When we played, there were never enough gloves to go around, so when our team came in to bat, those who had gloves would leave theirs on the field for someone from the other team to use. Although I never articulated it at the time, it felt downright prosperous to be a lender, not a borrower. I think a good glove cost about $15.00 in those days, so it was no trivial expense.</p>
<p>When my brother Jonathan, who was three years younger than I, was presented with his glove, he slept with it every night. &#0160;I recently asked him if he continued to do so after he was married. &#0160;He says no, but....</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think that anyone who didn&#39;t grow up in the 40s and 50s in Brooklyn, in the Jackie Robinson era, can appreciate the importance of baseball to us. &#0160;</p>
<p>I&#39;ve tried to think of another possession that ever meant as much to me -- a particular book or an automobile, for instance -- but nothing compares. Not even slightly.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Beginning at the northwest corner and preceding south -- in the first brick house, a family of notably obese immigrant Syrian women who spoke no English; there were no children that I know of and no interactions with other neighbors. The house itself was not unusual but it was fronted by a wrought iron fence and a row of ancient stubbed catalpas which we called &quot;umbrella trees.&quot; Next was the house belonging to Dr. Jerry Yurkovsky, our M.D. In retrospect, he was a kind man but a badly-trained, out-of-touch physician. He was also an immigrant -- from Poland, I believe. My father, who rarely spoke badly of anyone, thought that he was a decent sort but that Mrs. Yurkovsky was &quot;a real pill.&quot; I remember only her iridescent dyed red hair. Then came the Lampsons, Hubert and Dorothy. He was never seen in daylight but was rumored to own a &quot;yacht&quot;; she was the neighborhood grouch, known to slice in half any errant pink &quot;spaldeens&quot; that that might be punched (kids played &quot;punchball&quot; in the street) over her tall privet hedge and into her front yard. While I never questioned this neighborhood orthodoxy, I never saw a sliced spaldeen either. Then came the large Victorian house belonging until about 1950 to the Heidtmanns and then to another family whose name I can&#39;t remember but who had an impaired daughter who screamed and screamed at maximum volume at all hours day and night. Next came our immediate neighbors on the south, Mr. and Mrs. Pynn, who lived in a small old wood-shingled structure.The Pynns (did they have given names?) were extremely old, in their 90s I would guess. He was a retired Cornish seaman, believe it or not; she cultivated colorful gladioli in her small backyard garden. Their upstairs tenants were the Rhodins, Thor and Pearl. He was a tall gaunt ancient austere Norwegian whose only known activity was writing letters to local newspapers; she was almost as tall but Jewish and &quot;went to business.&quot; They had three children but they were out of the house and too old for me to know them: Thor, jr, Yammie (Hjalmar), and Margeret. Thor was a physicist at Cornell rumored to have worked on the &quot;bomb.&quot; I have written about the Rhodins <a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2006/10/an_east_9th_str.html">elsewhere.&#0160;</a>Then came our house, a three-story 1912 Victorian of which our family of five occupied the top two floors. The first floor tenants were the Burnets (formerly Bernsteins), Albert and Bessie. He was musician who had retreated to accountancy. There were two sons, the older, Leonard, was troubled, and I now realize, probably gay; he played the sax; the younger son, Henry, had a cleft palate, later corrected by surgery, I believe, and banged on his drums incessantly. To our north were the Carps, who owned a brickyard or building supply business somewhere not in the neighborhood. They were a gloomy Dickensian family. Both of the daughters were nuns who came visiting once a year in their long black robes; the son, hang-dog Eddie, had the demeanor of a jaded funeral attendant. The Carps first act on moving into the house was to erect a tall forbidding chain link fence around the perimeter of their property which annoyed my father no end. Proceeding south, the next house was occupied by the Spollens, an immigrant Irish family who seemed to produce a new child every year. My memory is hazy about the south end of the street, under grand old elms until they fell victim to the Dutch blight, except that in one of the houses dwelt two tired bony sisters, perhaps twins, who every Sunday, trudged down 9th Street and past 18th Avenue to one of our neighborhood&#39;s numerous under-attended Protestant churches. They had a splendid garden of hollyhocks. Also at that end of the street lived, Mr. Mennino, who shared his personal variety of cucumbers with my father. At the very end of the block lived the <a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2011/09/dog-faced-man.html ">dog-faced man.</a>. &#0160;</p>
<p>On the other side of the street was an Italian family named Cocito, pronounced American&#39;ly, ko-see-to. When Junior Cocito (perhaps he had a name, but everyone called him Junior) grew up and married, he bought the house next door to his father&#39;s. Then next, coming closer to us, were the Cunninghams. Mr. Cunningham was a large imposing firefighter; there was at least one daughter and two sons, Jimmy and Billy. Billy was our only celebrity; he became rich and famous as the &quot;Kangaroo Kid&quot;; he also played first base on my younger brother&#39;s baseball team. After the Cunninghams was another house of semi-mystery, occupied by an unfriendly family whose last name was Harris. I believe my mother told me that Mr. Harris was a school principal. There was a shapely daughter a year or so older than I whom I admired from a distance. She (Betty) married at 16 or 17 (&quot;shotgun,&quot; I was told), and disappeared -- as did the family. Then came the Burkes, directly across the street from us. There were two sons, Charley, a genuine dolt and high school dropout who became an armed guard for Wells Fargo, and lanky John, who was studying for the priesthood. There was also an uncle or cousin who lived with them and who spent every weekend waxing and noisily buffing his big new DeSoto. Then came the house occupied by Mr. and Mrs. Petranto along with their ancient father who spent all day every day watching the traffic from the oversize glider on the porch. There was an older daughter, Madeleine, whom I didn&#39;t know, and a son, Frankie, a bachelor, a contemporary of my older brother Eugene, who later found work in the U.S. post office and who, when I investigated a few years ago, still -- eighty years later -- lived in his childhood home. Upstairs from the Petrantos dwelt the Meinekes, Charlie and Tessie. He was a butcher; she was &quot;at home.&quot; There was a rather sad ungainly but harmless daughter just my age, Charlotte, who dropped out of school early. I hope she a good life but I wonder. Next northward was another mystery house, probably a rental; for a year it was occupied by the Tebbets family. There was an attractive mid-twenties daughter whom my older brother and his peers admired no end, and a son, Lee, whom twenty years later I encountered in Vermont where he gave me an envelope of blue corn seeds (which I never planted). And then came the Constantino household. The father was a shoemaker, I believe. There were three children, Frankie, a terrific athlete; Regina, a beauty, and Carly, who dyed his hair henna and moved to Greenwich Village. There were two or three more houses at that end of the street, but I&#39;m vague about them. Sorry, don&#39;t remember; too far away. The name Ortner comes to mind. Mystery houses.</p>
<p>Even though I lived on the street for my entire childhood and until I left for college, I never entered a single house, nor did any of the neighbors ever enter ours. It wasn&#39;t that kind of neighborhood. Or perhaps we weren&#39;t that sort of people.</p>

                                <p>If a widow and a widower form a relationship when they&#39;re both in their seventies, what is the proper and appropriate name for their relationship?</p>
<p>Legally, they&#39;re married, because here in the state of Colorado, if you live together and represent yourself as married, you&#39;re married, even if you haven&#39;t sought governmental sanction. Yet &quot;husband&quot; and &quot;wife&quot; don&#39;t come easily to the lips. They seem too doggone official. And they also seem like words out of an earlier era, especially &quot;wife,&quot; which carries irrelevant overtones of a dominant-submissive relationship. &quot;Just a housewife.&quot;</p>
<p>But &quot;companion&quot; is only slightly better. To my ear, it smacks of &quot;faithful companion Tonto.&quot; &quot;Partner&quot; is even worse; are we associates in a law firm?&#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;Girlfriend&quot; and &quot;boyfriend&quot; are clearly ludicrous and inappropriate to persons of mature years. Such words lack seriousness and heft; they trivialize a weighty relationship. So, similarly, does the naked &quot;friend,&quot; which in this context is colorless, neutral. &quot;Ladyfriend&quot; is a bit more serious. &quot;Gentleman caller&quot; was last said without irony in Peoria sometime in the middle of the nineteenth century. &quot;Mistress&quot; suggests that the friendship is merely sexual; its counterpart, &quot;gigolo,&quot; is even more specific, and seedy to boot. &quot;Lover&quot; is also one-dimensional.&#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;Old lady&quot; and &quot;old man&quot; are outmoded hippieisms. So is &quot;significant other.&quot; Other archaisms: &quot;main squeeze,&quot; &quot;stud,&quot; &quot;pal,&quot; &quot;steady lay,&quot; &quot;fancy man.&quot; &#0160;&quot;Love-slave.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;Spouse&quot;? No, too dry, too legalistic. &quot;Consort&quot;? &#0160;Disrespectful. &quot;Odalisque&quot;? &quot;Handmaiden.&quot; Sexist. &quot;Concubine?&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>It&#39;s fascinating that we&#39;ve had more trouble with nomenclature than with living, eating, working, and sleeping together.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Dear T, O, E, L, L, C, A: &#0160;This is about your great-grandmother, Anne Goss. She was born Hannah Sarah Krull in 1912 in New Jersey, but I&#39;ve forgotten which city, although I know that as a young person she lived in Bayonne, Hackensack and Paterson. Her parents, David and Katherine Meltzer Krull, were recent immigrants from eastern Europe. She was the oldest of five siblings: Anne, Jacob (Jack), Hyman, Freda, and Max (Mendy). Her father installed metal ceilings, her mother was what was then called a &quot;practical&quot; (i.e. unlicensed) nurse. The family was not wealthy. The five children shared two beds, boys in one, girls in the other, sleeping crosswise. Anne had a bout of polio at sixteen months which left her with a permanent limp and weakness in the left side of her body. Because of the effects of the illness, she endured an unusually difficult childhood -- marked by a series of surgeries on her leg which may or may not have helped. But she was quick-witted and talented, learning to play violin and viola and graduating as high school valedictorian. About the Jewish religion, important to her parents, she told me, &quot;I gave up that stuff when I was thirteen.&quot; She was intent on a college education which her parents opposed because the few dollars that she made as a dental assistant were crucial to the family economy. She won a full scholarship to Barnard College but it&#39;s sad to report that when she arrived on the first day of classes she discovered that she had to pay for room and board, which her family could not afford. She returned home but was admitted to Montclair State Teacher&#39;s College where she majored in chemistry. In a world with more advantages he would have gone on to medical school and become a distinguished physician, but such a career was not in the cards. At Montclair she played string quartets and met your great grandfather, Daniel Goss. There wasn&#39;t enough money to allow them to marry and no one lived together before marriage in those days. Anne once told me that the greatest mistake of her life was that she didn&#39;t go to bed with Dan until after they married, which didn&#39;t happen until he was 26 and she was 24. I think those premarital depression years must &#0160;have been hard and unsatisfying. And even after they married, still not so good because Dan and Anne couldn&#39;t afford a place of their own but shared an apartment with his parents (actually shared a bedroom, with a curtain between the parents&#39; &#0160;bed and theirs). Dan&#39;s parents disapproved of Anne: &quot;Why would you want to marry a cripple?&quot; Eventually Dan was hired as a teacher of mathematics at Paterson High School and then in 1946 moved to Utica College in Utica, New York. Although Ann had been told that the polio made it impossible for her to carry a child, she gave birth to three daughters (Althea -- your grandmother --in 1939; Phyllis in 1942, and Paula in 1951). She taught mathematics until she retired at the then-mandatory age of 65 but continued with her tutoring business through her seventies. Meanwhile, she had mastered the domestic arts: cooking, baking, sewing (she made all her daughters&#39; &#0160;clothes through their childhoods) and knitting. She was a hard-working woman, often to be found knitting, reading a book, and watching TV at the same time. Dan died in 1966 and so she spent many more years as widow than as a wife. Her life was filled with pain (two dozen major surgeries) but she never complained. She was independent, frugal, and adventurous. She was also strict, cool, not at all affectionate, and humorless. Not exactly humorless -- she never laughed, that I can remember, but sometimes she would respond to a joke by saying, &quot;That&#39;s funny.&quot; &#0160;She played bridge to win and not for fun and she liked a rough game of Scrabble with her grandsons. She was easy to respect but difficult to love.</p>
<p>She moved to Boulder at age 87 and lived to be 97, though much impaired. At her 90th birthday party, in 2002, &#0160;she was still functioning well but &quot;looping.&quot; &#0160;If she had died at 90 she would not have missed much. She was demented and bedridden for the last few years of her life. The last coherent statement she made to me, in her last month, was &quot;I&#39;m not afraid of this dying business.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>A good memory: Anne spent most of her early life wearing a heavy metal brace on her bad leg. But when she was in her early 90s, she acquired a brace made of a light space-age material. I took her walking in the mountains. First time. She was thrilled.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s another: she liked to help grade Althea&#39;s math exams and she liked to talk calculus with her grandsons. I remember saying to them, &quot;You have to understand something. This is unusual. Your standard run-of-the-mill grandmother does not understand calculus.&quot;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>The rooster came to our attention about a month ago. We heard him before we saw him. He was living at the edge of the forest, about one hundred yards from the house. After a few days he became bolder and we were able to catch a glimpse now and then. He&#39;s a Barred Rock, fully mature, with a bright red comb and superior wattles, but with woeful tail feathers. We don&#39;t know from where he came. We asked around but none of the neighbors is missing a rooster. We guessed: he&#39;s an escapee, or, perhaps his owner became tired of him and kicked him out of the truck, or (my favorite theory) he was in a rooster fight, lost his tail feathers and retired to the woods in shame. But in fact, we have no idea how he came to settle on our property.</p>
<p>Little by little he started to become more comfortable with us. He would spend his day in the flower garden, furtively eating insects. He was especially fond of earwigs. A good occupation, I thought. No harm except to the bugs. Eventually he came to tolerate our presence. He would sit a few yards away, studying me while I weeded. He gained our respect, because he managed to survive even though the forest is filled with foxes and fisher cats and weasels and coyotes and the air is patrolled by hawks. He liked to visit the donkeys and peck around their manure piles.&#0160; When he started to roost not in the forest but in the blueberry bushes close to the house I became concerned -- this may be more of a rooster guest than I need. And then he took up the habit of cock-a-doodle-do-ing at dawn just outside our bedroom window. And during afternoon nap time. And familiarizing himself with the vegetable garden, where he snacks on cucumbers. (He loves cucumbers.) He became ever more bold -- a few days ago he was just outside the kitchen, pecking on the glass door, hoping, I imagine, to be let inside. And when I didn&#39;t let him in, he left a large retaliatory splash of rooster dropping right at the doorway.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef0263e9a1ccdb200b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Screen Shot 2021-05-01 at 3.33.28 PM" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef0263e9a1ccdb200b img-responsive" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef0263e9a1ccdb200b-800wi" title="Screen Shot 2021-05-01 at 3.33.28 PM" /></a></p>
<p>We looked out of the small north window of our bedroom and there he was perched on the railing, peering in. A peeping-Tom rooster. (Did he catch an eyeful!!)&#0160;</p>
<p>One day a near neighbor telephoned: &quot;Your rooster is here.&quot;&#0160; &quot;He&#39;s not my rooster.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>And then he disappeared. For the first time in a month, there was no crowing at dawn.&#0160; OK, we thought, some predator got him. One of these days, we&#39;ll stumble upon a bunch of black and white feathers in the forest.</p>
<p>But then a friend who lives on Ira&#39;s Pinnacle told us that he had seen a pair of chickens on Hackett Hill Road about a half a mile up the road. He couldn&#39;t be sure, but he figured it must be &quot;your&quot; rooster and a hen.&#0160;</p>
<p>So that&#39;s where he&#39;s been!! He&#39;s a gallinaceous gallant gallivanting with the local ladies. I thought, good for him; I don&#39;t have to concern myself with him any longer. He&#39;ll go feral and start a family. He must not know about Vermont winters.</p>
<p>But not so. This morning he was back, solitary, crowing vigorously outside my window. His romance, if it were a romance, didn&#39;t work out. I can&#39;t imagine why because he&#39;s become quite a handsome bird. He personable, friendly and he&#39;s grown an an impressive new set of tail feathers. He&#39;s plump and shiny; his walk, once furtive, has become a decisive strut. There he is now, cock-a-doodling his head off in the patch of cucumbers.</p>

                                <p>I don&#39;t know why, but after 66 years I found myself thinking about my first English teacher at EHHS, Mr. Stephen Mitchell . Here&#39;s what I can recall. Mr. Mitchell was a lazy guy. I remember that on many a day he would give us busy work assignments, take up his New York Times, rest his feet in the lower drawer of his desk, and read, while the class occupied itself doing who knows what.&#0160; In retrospect, Mr. Mitchell was probably a classic burnt-out case.&#0160; Perhaps he had been young and enthusiastic at one time, but in 1952, he needed desperately to retire.&#0160;</p>
<p>I remember also that in his class we read &quot;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.&quot;&#0160; His instructional technique: he taught us some vocabulary, such as &quot;onomatopoeia&quot; and &quot;personification.&quot; Then one student after another was asked to take a stanza and search it for examples of onomatopoeia or personification or perhaps metaphor and also to identify iambic tetrameter or iambic trimeter.</p>
<p>Of the romance of the Rime, we knew nothing and learned nothing.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>All the while, Mr. Mitchell&#39;s feet never left the drawer.</p>
<p>In retrospect, I wonder whether he might not have been a WW2 veteran, not quite recovered from the trauma.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>The ol&#39; dreamatorium was working overtime last night. The protagonist, who was and who was not me was a mature, bearded gentleman, a prosperous landowner in what seemed like the antebellum South. He, or he/I, was the target of a plot by a younger cousin in league with a scuzzy lawyer to have him/me declared insane -- and therefore his/my property to be confiscated and transferred to the control of the villainous cousin. The heart of the dream was a hearing or trial in which he/I was cross examined and every of his emotions mischaracterized by the lawyer and the panel of mental health experts. For example, if he/I expressed indignation and anger, it was interpreted as paranoia; if he/I remained impassive it was understood as catatonia. Every emotion became its parodic extreme. As a result, he/I was placed in an institution; a rather bucolic one, but still a place of incarceration. However, after some while, another hearing was held, and he/I was able to convince a judge that there had been a miscarriage of justice. So he/I was set free to reclaim his property. But, he/I said to the judge, I have no money, no clothes, no means of transportation, so no one will believe me. The judge then offered to loan me/him some money, but was clear that it was a loan, not a gift. In the last scene of the dream, he/I is mounted on a horse (black and white one, like a Holstein), wearing a Confederate uniform, and carrying, believe it or not, a shiny sword. Then I woke up.</p>
<p>I cannot interpret this beaut, this honey of a dream.&#0160; It was very cinematic, very vivid, and very long. But it doesn&#39;t apply to my life in any obvious way. I&#39;ve never been accused of insanity, never lost any property, don&#39;t know any corrupt lawyers, never been institutionalized, never even been on a horse, and certainly don&#39;t carry a sword.&#0160; Moreover, it was an undreamlike dream: no fantastic elements or objects morphing into other objects. It seemed less like a dream than like a lost chapter or sub-pot to&#0160;<em>Gone with the Wind</em>. Mighty puzzling.</p>

		<a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2018/03/worship.html">Words of my Life: "Worship"</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>There are some words which one might study and parse the dictionary definition and yet still not understand -- words for which one has no intuitive or even rational conception. For example, there&#39;s the word &quot;heaven.&quot; I know that &quot;heaven&quot; can mean &quot;sky,&quot; a definition that poses no problem, but when &quot;heaven&quot; is presumed to refer to a place beyond the sky in which the souls of dead people are eternally rewarded, then I&#39;m absolutely baffled. My brain empties out. &quot;Heaven&quot; in such a sense is to me incomprehensible and meaningless nonsense.</p>
<p>Another such word is &quot;worship,&quot; a word which has always puzzled me, right from the start, when the church bells of St Rose of Lima would ring on a Sunday morning to call parishioners to mass, leaving me and my brothers to play stickball or punchball all by ourselves. I recognize that &quot;worship&quot; is a word to which communities of English speakers give assent, and I observe that people attend temples, mosques, and tabernacles to perform certain activities, such as kneeling, genuflecting, singing hymns and uttering hosannas. Nevertheless, I can&#39;t agree that such activities equal &quot;worship&quot; -- because &quot;worship&quot; presupposes that there is an entity to which these activities are directed. And that entity, like &quot;heaven&quot; in the religious sense, doesn&#39;t exist. Just as heaven is a non-existent place, so worship posits a non-existent entity. And therefore the word &quot;worship&quot; has no intelligible meaning, to me.</p>
<p>Perhaps I lack what Charlotte Bronte called an &quot;organ of veneration.&quot; Or, alternatively, worshipers are engaged in mass delusion.&#0160;</p>
<p>On the other hand, I have an excellent grasp of the word &quot;awe.&quot; In fact, I am a great practitioner of awe. I&#39;m regularly &quot;awed&quot; by both the achievements of my fellow beings in art, architecture, music, literature, mathematics and science, and also by the majesty of nature, in the form of grand canyons and in the triumphs of evolution. Moreover, I&#39;ve felt &quot;awe,&quot; in cathedrals and once, in the Church of the Rock in Helsinki -- a magnificent building that melds human ingenuity with natural beauty, -- overwhelming, transcendent awe. &#0160;And I can understand that for some people what I identify as &quot;awe&quot; might translate into &quot;worship.&quot; &#0160;But again, not me. Though I&#39;m awed by Rembrandt and Bach, but I don&#39;t worship them or their works. I&#39;ll stick with awe.</p>
<p>I may lack an &quot;organ of veneration,&quot; but I have a highly developed organ of wonderment.</p>
<p>Update on &quot;worship.&quot; &#0160;For the first time in my life, a few weeks ago, I attended a religious service. I was in New Orleans and friends suggested that I join them at Vespers at Trinity Episcopal Church on Jackson Avenue. The attraction was Ellis Marsalis, who was to play a few notes for the attendees. A priest or whatever he&#39;s called, said a few words, read a prayer, and then elderly, frail Mr. Marsalis sat down at the piano and improvised for a few minutes. It was beautiful and perhaps transcendent. I suppose it was a form of worship. And it didn&#39;t hurt a bit.&#0160;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Many a restaurant in New Orleans; and many visited by us during our latest stay.</p>
<p>Two divergent experiences. &#0160;Shaya, and Venezia.</p>
<p>Shaya:</p>
<div class="photo"><img alt="Shaya, New Orleans, LA" height="386" large-data-url="https://resizer.otstatic.com/v2/photos/large/23751171.jpg" onerror="error()" src="https://resizer.otstatic.com/v2/photos/large/23751171.jpg" title="Shaya, New Orleans, LA" width="386" /></div>
<p>Slick, elegant, ultra-modern, carefully designed. Waitpersons stylishly costumed and coiffed. Well-trained. Reservations mandatory. Customers: jacketed and tied, or on high heels. Price: whole wallet.</p>
<p>The place to go if you&#39;re looking for wood roasted Brussels sprouts with black harissa, tahini and sumac pickled onions. Or ikra made with paddlefish caviar and shallots. Or if you want your crispy halloumi with strawberries, mint and pistachio. Perhaps shakshoula made of tomato, Jerusalem artichokes, poached egg, chilies and chermoula. The roasted chicken is cooked with shawarma spices, heirloom carrots, and chickpea mujadara. Etc. Very enjoyable experience.</p>
<div class="menu-item f42dd212">
<div class="menu-item-title">Then there&#39;s Venezia. Not pronounced ven-ets-ia after the Italian style, but ven-ezh-a by local custom. Red-and-white checked tablecloths. Families, large and extended. Waitresses as wide as tall who call you &quot;honey&quot; or &quot;dearie.&quot; &#0160;Sausages, peppers, spaghetti with tomato sauce, shellfish. Excellent pizza. Sorry, no picture available on website. No website, actually. And, added bonus, Venezia is just down the street from famous historic Angelo Brocato (ice cream and pastries).</div>
<div class="menu-item-title">&#0160;</div>
<div class="menu-item-title">Guess at which restaurant I felt more at home.</div>
<div class="menu-item-title">&#0160;</div>
<div class="menu-item-title">New Orleans is a high contrast city where the Whole Foods sits directly adjacent to the Dollar General. Honest.</div>

<p>Dear Asher, Caleb, Luke, Lola, Ella, Oliver, Talia:</p>
<p>These are pictures of your great-great-great-grandparents, Leib or Louis Hessel and Tsina Voloshen Hessel. They are the parents of Eta or Yetta Hessel, who married Isaiah Pearlman, your great-great grandfather, in StaryConstantine, Ukraine, sometime around 1895. I knew Eta, who died in 1962 when I was in my early &#39;twenties, although our conversations were limited because we did not share a common language. &#0160;According to my father, these pictures are copies of drawings executed by an itinerant Ukrainian artist. Drawn when? Perhaps 1870 or thereabouts.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know much about these people. I have no idea what they did for a living or how long they lived. I see some family resemblance in Leib&#39;s small black eyes and abbreviated eyebrows, but otherwise, not much. What sort of hat is he wearing? Is Tsina wearing the wig of the orthodox or is that her real hair?&#0160;</p>
<p>He looks mild. &#0160;She looks determined.</p>
<p>I know that my grandmother Eta had a number of siblings. In my father&#39;s handwriting, I have a document that hints of two of them: a brother, Morris Hessel, who married Mary Greenberg and had a son, Paul and a grandson Merel; &#0160;and then a sister Malka, who married one Joseph Cohen and had a son, Saris, who was a high school principal in New York, and had a son Peter Cohen, a physician based in Denver. I wonder why my father kept so aloof from his aunts and uncles and cousins? Was there a story? They were not at all a part of our life. No visits, no family celebrations, nothing.</p>
<p>I once met my father&#39;s &quot;Aunt Mary,&quot; who sold tickets at the Kent Theater on Coney Island Avenue. it must have been the only time I went to a movie with my father; he said, &quot;This is my Aunt Mary.&quot; &#0160;I was perhaps 8 years old, and uncurious. That&#39;s the end of the story. I wish I had more to tell you.&#0160;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>A few days ago Vivian de St. Vrain aka Dr. Metablog began his last year as a septuagenarian. His next birthday, 80. Astonishing. Unbelievable. And kind of miraculous.</p>
<p>When I was boy, I thought that people of such an advanced age were very likely extra-terrestrials or possibly members of another species. I remember my ancient ancestors and relations as very small people, odd-smelling (chicken soup and mothballs), whose faces were covered with knobs, whelks and unsightly dark spots. As a group, they appeared to my youthful eyes as swollen, distorted, asymmetrical. &#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>But now, at this present age, I don&#39;t feel even the slightest bit extra-galactic. I feel like me. Except, of course, when I catch sight of my reflection in a shop window as I stroll the mall. Who is that white-haired guy?</p>
<p>Here&#39;s my status report at age 79. I&#39;m healthy. All my organs might work a little slower, a little grumpier about doing their jobs, but none of them has crapped out completely. My joints are relatively supple, especially my knees. I have great knees. I experience muscle pains and muscle spasms occasionally, and my back is bad, but it&#39;s better than it was a decade or two ago, thanks to the surgery. I tire more easily and recover from fatigue more slowly. My memory is not as sharp as heretofore, but it&#39;s still pretty good, better than most. I&#39;m learning a new language and I admit that I have to look up new words two or three times before they stick. Sometimes four or five times, truth be told. My capacity for abstract thinking, never strong, has definitely diminished, but my sense of humor is intact.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not taking any medicines, except for an occasional sleeping pill. The bifocals and the lens implants are working just fine. So are the hearing aids. And the tooth implant is still firmly in place. The rest of me, I&#39;m proud to say, is all original equipment.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.2em;">On the whole, I&#39;d say that I&#39;ve come through some dark times and that I&#39;m enjoying a personal renaissance. How long will it last? Impossible to predict. A day, a year, ten years? &#0160;But hey, I have love in my life. Children who are thriving. Lovely grandchildren.</span></p>
<p>I must acknowledge that at my age I could be growing something deadly and that the least little twinge could be an early sign of a fatal disease.&#0160;And although nothing of that kind has happened yet, it&#39;s inevitable that something will happen. Life is term-limited and I&#39;ve lost too many friends and relations to deny the obvious. I&#39;m acutely aware that each day is precious.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <div class="original-line">Shakespeare took a few shots at depicting a hellish afterlife.&#0160;</div>
<div class="original-line">&#0160;</div>
<div class="original-line">The most extended, if I remember correctly, belongs to Claudio in&#0160;<em>Measure for Measure</em>. &quot;To die, and go we know not where;/ To lie in cold obstruction and to rot;/ This sensible warm motion to become/ A kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit/ To bathe in fiery floods,/ Or to reside in thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice;/ To be imprisoned in the viewless winds,/ And blown with restless violence round about/ The pendent world; or to be worse than worst/ Of those that lawless and incertain thought/ Imagine howling: tis too horrible.&quot; It&#39;s a damned scary vision, and mostly easy to understand, though it helps to be reminded that sensible = having sense, &quot;delighted&quot; = darkened, &quot;thrilling&quot;= piercing, &quot;viewless&quot; = blind, and that &quot;lawless and incertain thought&quot; refers to non-Christian speculation. Shakespeare gives Claudio a number of choices for eternal suffering, each one worse than the other.&#0160;&#0160;</div>
<div class="original-line">&#0160;</div>
<div class="original-line">When Othello realizes that Desdemona was innocent after all, he foresees a one-dimensional hot hell, one in which devils will&#0160;&quot;Blow me about in winds, roast me in sulfur/&#0160;Wash me in steep-down gulfs of liquid fire.&quot; Clear enough, painful enough.</div>
<div class="original-line">&#0160;</div>
<div class="original-line">And finally, Lear imagines himself &quot;Bound upon a wheel of fire,/ That mine own tears to scald like molten lead.&quot;&#0160;</div>
<div class="original-line">&#0160;</div>
<div class="original-line">I think the whole afterlife thing is a fraud, but if there were a hell, here&#39;s what mine would be like.</div>
<div class="original-line">&#0160;</div>
<div class="original-line">I&#39;m on a commercial flight, steerage class, cramped into a seat too narrow and lacking adequate leg room. A middle seat. On my left is a very large gentleman whose massive shoulders and thighs encroach upon my territory. He stinks of tobacco. He drinks too much alcohol and tries to engage me in conversation. On my right is a similarly-proportioned lady who reeks of cheap perfume and who glares at me whenever my bony elbow makes contact with her fat forearm. I&#39;m hungry and all there is to eat are some horrid plastic pretzels in a bag that only a safecracker could open. A scruffy fourteen-year-old boy sits behind me. Rap &quot;music&quot; leaks from his earbuds and he kicks the back of my seat at irregular intervals. My only reading matter is a airline magazine that advertises expensive gimcrack novelties that no sensible human would ever dream of buying. My bladder is distended and painful but the seat-belt sign is perpetually lit. This plane never lands. Sometimes it threatens to do so, but at the last moment it&#39;s diverted to another airport.</div>
<div class="original-line">&#0160;</div>
<div class="original-line">This continues throughout all eternity.</div>
<div class="original-line">&#0160;</div>
<div class="original-line">And it is much worse than vats of liquid fire. Far worse than anything that Shakespeare could possibly have imagined.</div>
                        </div>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>It wasn&#39;t until I reached college that I discovered poetry. My comic-book, super-hero and baseball-infused brain was until then, poetry-wise, an almost complete tabula rasa; I say &quot;almost&quot; because at eight or nine eight years old I had already memorized two great classics of American literature: &quot;Casey at the Bat&quot; and also the poem by Grantland Rice about Tinkers, Evers, and Chance. In addition, I knew the ubiquitous stercoraceous distich the first line of which is &quot;Here I sit, broken-hearted&quot; and a related gnomic verse that begins, &quot;No matter how much you wiggle and dance.&quot; Then in 1956 I left Flatbush for higher education and enrolled in a course in English Literature. The rest, as they say, is history. It was love sonnets and rich luscious liquid poems by Marlowe and Keats and Hopkins that entranced me. The more intellectual poems were too taxing for my immature head. <em style="line-height: 1.2em; font-size: small;">Lycidas</em><span style="line-height: 1.2em; font-size: small;">, which I now can acknowledge to be the finest poem in&#0160;the language, was utterly impenetrable for at least a decade, although I immediately&#0160;responded to its music:&#0160;&quot;With nectar pure&#0160;his oozy locks he laves.&quot;&#0160;</span></p>
<div class="entry-content">
<div class="entry-body">
<p>One of my teachers sagely observed that certain poets and certain poems were for youth, some for maturity, and some for old age. &quot;You may no longer like then what you like now.&quot; Which has come to pass. As an example of poetry for the latter years, he adduced Tennyson&#39;s &quot;Ulysses.&quot; &quot;This poem may not mean much to you now, but it will some day, if you live long enough.&quot; I remember that I was much taken with the touchstone line &quot;Far on the ringing plains of windy Troy&quot; but I thought that &quot;Ulysses&quot; was too much about a really old guy trying to cheer himself up and I did not see it holding a place in any future that I could envision.&#0160;</p>
<p>Well, folks, I&#39;ve now arrived at the so-called golden years, or, more properly, the endgame, or extra innings (which in some sports is called&#0160;sudden death) and guess what? &#0160;&quot;Ulysses&quot; has returned,&#0160;front and center,&#0160;exactly as was predicted 50+ years ago.&#0160;It&#39;s right on target.&#0160;</p>
<p>Tennyson&#39;s Ulysses is Homer&#39;s adventurer a generation older, kinging it in Ithaca, but bored, unchallenged, and unstimulated.&#0160;&quot;It little profits that an idle king,/ By this still hearth, among these barren crags,/ Matched with an aged wife, I mete and dole/ Unequal laws unto a savage race,/ That hoard and sleep, and feed,/ And know not me.&quot;</p>
<p>To put it vulgarly, Ulysses plans to bust out of the home for old kings. He&#39;s been a warrior, a hero, and a roving explorer. He &quot;cannot rest from travel.&quot; He needs to search &quot;beyond the utmost bound of human thought.&quot; He leaves Penelope, and he resigns the government of Ithaca to his bureaucratically-minded son Telemachus. The last lines of the poem, the leave-taking, are most stirring: &#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Come, my friends</p>
<p>&quot;Tis not too late to seek a newer world.</p>
<p>Push off, and sitting well in order smite</p>
<p>The sounding furrows;&#0160;for my purpose holds</p>
<p>To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths</p>
<p>Of all the western stars, until I die.</p>
<p>It may be that the gulfs will wash us down:</p>
<p>It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles,</p>
<p>And see the great Achilles, whom we knew.</p>
<p>Though much is taken, much abides,</p>
<p>And though we are not now that strength which in old days</p>
<p>Moved earth and heaven, that&#0160;which we are, we are;</p>
<p>One equal temper of heroic hearts&#0160;</p>
<p>Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will</p>
<p>To strive to seek, to find, and not to yield.</p>
<p>Yes, I know -- the diction is a little antiquated and artificial, the urge to get away a trifle too vehement. But nevertheless, I&#39;m moved by the resilience, the perseverance. Though tear-inducing, the poem is anything but lachrymose. And it&#39;s accepting: &quot;that which we are, we are.&quot;</p>
<p>It has lately become the fashion to interpret &quot;Ulysses&quot; as a poem about capitalism and imperialism. In this reading, Ulysses is just another white male, off to conquer and colonize The Alien Other. Or to see it as a poem about male privilege: he&#39;s a bad husband, abandoning the family. Or to conceive the poem as a structure of ironies, in which Ulysses doesn&#39;t realize that he undermines his own suppositions. There&#39;s a tad of truth in these arguments, as there always is, because Tennyson was caught up in a Victorian striving that he didn&#39;t fully or consciously assimilate. But frankly, I feel sorry for readers who can&#39;t hear the verve and excitement in Ulysses&#39;s expansive view of things.&#0160;</p>
<p>Moreover, it turns out that Tennyson was absolutely correct to proclaim that there is a time in life when &quot;not to yield&quot; is an act of daily heroism.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Dear Talia, Oliver, Ella, Lola, Luke, Caleb, Asher:</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef01b7c94423d8970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Menucah Pearlman" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef01b7c94423d8970b img-responsive" height="299" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef01b7c94423d8970b-800wi" title="Menucah Pearlman" width="224" /></a></p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>This is a picture of my father&#39;s grandmother (that is, my great-grandmother and therefore your great-great-great grandmother) whom I can now identify as Menucha Sheindl Perelman (born Rabinovich) who died in 1908 at the age of 75 or thereabouts. She was born in the shtetl of Radomyshyl and married Yaakov Perelman of Old Constantine in western Ukraine. Menucha is reported to have had 18 children including many twins. Seven daughters and three sons survived to adulthood. The four daughters whose names are known were Rochel Lerner, Reizel Shposhnik, Miriam, and Chaya-Beila, who married Schmul Spector (I remember now that my father had a cousin named Julian Spector). Her sons were Isaiah or Buzya my grandfather, then Chaim, and Meshulam.</p>
<p>My father told once told me story that seems incredible. He said that he had a grandmother in the Ukraine who came from a large family. He said that she had ten children but that all of them died in a week during a cholera epidemic. Then they had five more children. Or perhaps there were five children who died in the epidemic and then they had ten more. Both stories are hard to believe. &#0160;</p>
<p>What would it be like to lose five or ten children in a week? How could anyone ever recover from the grief? &#0160;How could you live? &#0160;It&#39;s possible that this story attaches to Menucha Sheindl Perelman, who lost at least eight children. But it might also be a Hessel story (i.e. my father&#39;s mother&#39;s side of the family, not his father&#39;s).&#0160;</p>
<p>Provenance: &#0160;I have no idea how this picture came into my possession. It&#39;s a drawing, not a photograph. A copy of a drawing, to be more precise, not the original. My father told me that it was done by an itinerant Ukrainian artist (apparently a pre-photography custom). I wish that I could say more about Menucha&#39;s costume, especially the scarf. Is it traditional garb? Or about her very dark hair, which might be a <em>sheitel, </em>the wig worn by the orthodox.</p>
<p>Is it possible -- is it truly the case that the woman pictured above bore eighteen children? &#0160;And Inasmuch as your direct ancestor Isaiah was child number sixteen, if she had said to her husband Yaakov, after birthing number fifteen, &quot;I&#39;m done, Yaakov, no more children&quot; -- which would have been a perfectly understandable sentiment -- then it&#39;s obvious that none of us would exist. &#0160;</p>
<p>Other news of your old country ancestors: &#0160;<a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2018/01/constantine.html">here, </a>&#0160;<a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2017/12/lodz.html ">here,</a> and&#0160;<a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2016/01/sonia-green-with-an-addition.html ">here.</a></p>
