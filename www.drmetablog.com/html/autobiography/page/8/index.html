                                <p>Dear grandchildren:</p>
<p>I once asked my father, your great-grandfather Emanuel Pearlman, where in the Ukraine we originated. He said that he was told that it was a village called (and here he used a very deep guttural initial consonant) Xhosantin-gebernya &#0160;-- an answer that left me not much enlightened. If he knew more -- and I don&#39;t think he did -- he didn&#39;t say. Our family did not cultivate nostalgia for the old country. Nor much curiosity either. We had no reason to yearn.</p>
<p>But new information about our past has recently come to me. According to a correspondence between my late cousin Marion and a distant Israeli relative, it is now clear that our family hails from the the town of StaryConstantine -- also called Starokostiantiyniv in Ukrainian and Alt Konstantine in Yiddish. It was a small city of perhaps 30,000 people at its height, founded, as far as wikipedia and I can figure, in the sixteenth century by a noble or wealthy person named Konstanty Ostrogski who built himself a castle sometime during the 1560s. Castles are built for protection in lawless places, but then, most places were lawless in late medieval Europe. Old Constantine is in northern Ukraine at the junction of the Ikopot and Sluch rivers. Here&#39;s a picture of the Old Constantine castle across from the Sluch: &#0160;&#0160;</p>

<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>But when, you ask, did your and my ancestors settle in Old Constantine? &#0160;I remember it mentioned when I was a child that our family came to the Ukraine from &quot;the west&quot;, which I assumed to be Germany because my grandmother Eta&#39;s maiden name was Hessel (though in fact Hessel is more commonly Danish rather than German). The Jewish community in Old Constantine dates to the sixteenth century, it is reported. &quot;The town’s Jews suffered Cossack onslaughts during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. At the end of the nineteenth century, more than half of the town’s population was Jewish.&quot; That&#39;s all we know.</p>
<p>However, in the nineteenth century, there lived in Old Constantine a husband and wife named Yaakov and Menucha Sheindl Perelman. They dwelt in a house on the corner of Ragnedinshkaya and Bolshaya Vasikovshaya streets (a house which was destroyed during the second world war). Yaakov Mikolshtein Perelman was born about 1830, lived a long life, and died in about 1920. According to the story, he resided in the one house his entire life. His wife, Menucha Sheindl came from Radomyshyl, a village not far from Old Constantine that was historically a center of Jewish settlement. (In 1797 a total of 1,424 people or 80% of the total population were Jewish). Menucha Sheindl Perelman was the daughter of a sugar and wool merchant named Solomon Rabinovich, who was so rich that &quot;they changed houses for Passover&quot; -- which is a custom heretofore unknown to me. Menucha died in 1908 at age 75 or thereabouts. The family, once wealthy, lost everything in the 1917 revolution and the disorder and purges that followed. &#0160;</p>
<p>And how are Yaakov and Menucha related to you, my grandchildren? &#0160;Well, they&#39;re your great-great-great grandparents. According to the newly discovered information, they had eighteen children &quot;mostly twins,&quot; of whom only nine survived to adulthood. Seven daughters were born before your great-great grandfather Isaiah (also called Buzya or Buzzy) saw the light. Isaiah it is reported, was born &quot;the year the serfs were freed,&quot; which is 1861, but I know that he was 83 when he died in 1946, so I calculate that he was born in 1863. But perhaps Isaiah didn&#39;t know his own age which wouldn&#39;t have been unusual in an era of bad record keeping. When he was thirty-five, Isaiah emigrated to America, arriving in 1896 or thereabouts.</p>
<p>Why did he set out for the New World? &#0160;Certainly the troubled conditions in Old Constantine were reason enough. But there&#39;s also something of a story. Isaiah married (I don&#39;t know whom) but after one night of marriage he asked for a divorce. I don&#39;t know if the divorce was granted, but I do know that very soon afterward he left town with Eta (or Yetta) Hessel, also from Old Constantine. She was 23 or 24, a decade or a dozen years younger than he.&#0160;</p>
<p>Why the one-day marriage? &#0160;No one knows what happened that night, but it couldn&#39;t have been good. A sexual impediment? &#0160;An arranged marriage gone bad? &#0160;Prior misdeeds come to light?&#0160; The discovery of pregnancy?&#0160; We&#39;re free to speculate, but never to know.&#0160;</p>
<p>However, we do know that Isaiah and his father did not see the world with the same eyes. Yaakov was religious; his son Isaiah was an atheist. We don&#39;t know Yaakov&#39;s politics, but we know that Isaiah was some sort of leftist or communist. Something of a free-thinker, after the style of Moses Mendelssohn. And perhaps Karl Marx. And we can also guess that it might have been impossible to remain in Old Constantine after the marriage contretemps.&#0160;</p>
<p>In New York City, Isaiah and Yetta had four children: Max, born around 1896, Solomon, born about 1898; Mollie, born in 1900; and my father Emanuel, the youngest, born on December 22, 1904.</p>
<p>My grandfather Isaiah also had two younger brothers. There was Chaim, who followed him to America some years later and from whose daughter Rose spring the Goldberg and Chodosh lines. And also Isaiah&#39;s youngest brother, who was named Meshulam Zusi Perelman. He did not follow his older brothers, and I don&#39;t know his history, but his family left the Ukraine and it&#39;s his Israeli granddaughter Nechama Sheindl Brukman (born Perlman) through whom these facts were recovered. Nechama Brukman died in 2008 at age 86.</p>
<p>It is most melancholy to read that in 1939 there were 6,743 Jews living in Old Constantine, accounting for 31 percent of the total population, and that the entire Jewish community, some no doubt our cousins, were murdered during the first years of the war.</p>

                                <p>The person with whom I share a bed reported that last night, following some incomprehensible mutterings, I sleep talked, clear as a bell, the sentence fragment &quot;four ones, which I interpret as eleven hundred and eleven.&quot; &#0160;</p>
<p>I have absolutely no remembrance of saying these words, nor of any dream that might provide them with a context.&#0160;</p>
<p>Some observations:</p>
<p>a) I&#39;m mighty proud of myself for having a dream that was so literate. &#0160;I mean, &quot;interpret.&quot; &#0160;Not your run-of-the-mill sleep vocabulary.</p>
<p>b) What could &quot;four ones&quot; refer to? &#0160;Four aces? &#0160;Some sort of runic inscription? &#0160;Score keeping? &#0160;</p>
<p>c) &#0160;What about eleven hundred and eleven? &#0160;A late antiquity or early medieval date? &#0160;A quantity, but of what? &#0160;</p>
<p>d) &#0160;Why did some part of my brain feel obliged to &quot;interpret&quot; the phrase &quot;four ones?&quot; Did my right brain think that my left brain was communicating in code?</p>
<p>Altogether inexplicable. But fascinating. The brain seems to have &#0160;a mind of its own.&#0160;</p>

                                <p>Dear Talia, Oliver, Ella, Lola, Luke, Caleb, Asher:</p>
<p>Althea&#39;s grandfather, Solomon Goss (born Guza), who contributed 1/16 of your genetic inheritance, fled Poland after the worker&#39;s rebellion in Lodz in 1905, walked across Europe to Rotterdam where he boarded a ship and traveled steerage-class to Philadelphia. He had been a silk weaver in the old country and was able to find similar work here. In two years he saved enough money to pay for second-class passage (not the dreaded steerage) for his young bride Miriam Halpern.&#0160;</p>
<p>Solomon Goss played his part in the wave of political and social unrest that rocked the Russian Empire in the first years of the twentieth century -- uprisings that preceded and anticipated the 1917 Russian Revolution. The resistance had at its root the exploitation of workers especially in rapidly industrializing cities like Lodz (which had grown six-fold in a generation), in the state policy of enforced Russification, in czarist tyranny both cruel and arbitrary, and in heady intellectual and Marxist ferment both in universities and in informal worker self-education projects. The workers&#39; strikes and revolts in Lodz (the city, though Polish, was then incorporated into the Empire) were part of that great historical process. The Lodz Insurrection, also called the June Days, was one of the largest of these local rebellions. Following months of unrest and strikes, repressed by Russian police and soldiers, enraged workers began building barricades and assaulting police and military patrols. Additional troops, including the hated Cossacks, were called in. By June 23, the city and commerce was immobilized. Martial law was declared. But rocks proved futile against bullets and horses. By June 25, the uprising was crushed. It was officially reported that several hundred workers were killed but modern scholars estimate that between 1000 and 2000 died and many more were injured. There were arrests and imprisonments and executions. In this atmosphere Solomon Goss, who had manned the barricades, wisely decided that his time in Lodz had come to an end. &#0160;</p>
<p>I do not know how he was able to walk to the Netherlands and shipboard. A secular non-believer, he would not have been welcomed at local synagogues. Were there way-stations manned by sympathetic socialists? &#0160;How did he eat? &#0160;Where did he sleep? He never talked about his trek and if anyone ever asked him, they did not pass the information along to me.</p>
<p>When he came to America he found work in the silk mills in and around Paterson, New Jersey, which was then known as the &quot;Silk City.&quot; Weavers were skilled workers. Most were immigrants from traditional silk-weaving areas in England, Germany, and Italy but there was also a considerable influx from Lodz itself. The working day was ten hours long with a half day on Saturday and the new fifty-five hour week was considered a victory for the workers. Between 1881 and 1900 there were nearly 140 strikes. By the first decade of the 20th century, practically every mill had one or more labor organizations.&#0160;</p>
<p>Solomon Goss told me that when he would take a job in a mill, he would immediately set out to organize and radicalize his comrades. As a result, he said, he was frequently fired. But he was, he claimed, a very skilled worker, able to operate four looms at once (he looked down on American-trained workers whom he thought of as inferior and whom he derided as &quot;Columbus weavers).&quot;</p>
<p>By 1913, close to 5,000 Jewish men and women worked in the Paterson silk factories. It was in Paterson that Solomon Goss must have participated in one of the crucial events in American labor history, the Paterson silk strike. In February.&#0160;nearly 300 mills and dye houses were closed, as 24,000 men, women, and children joined in an industry-wide strike. The strikers&#39; demands were radical. They wanted an eight-hour day as well as increases in wages. Workers agreed that no one would return to work until all of the owners accepted their terms. Picket lines kept &quot;scabs&quot; and strike breakers out of the mills. More than 2,000 workers allowed themselves to be arrested, flooding the jails. But mill owners held firm and refused to meet with the workers. By the end of May, the workers&#39; solidarity cracked. English-speaking and better paid workers voted to accept settlements with individual mill owners. At the same time workers started to cross the picket lines. In July the central strike committee voted to endorse shop-by-shop settlements. The Paterson silk strike collapsed and owners conceded nothing. &quot;Your power is in your folded arms,&quot; IWW leader &quot;Big Bill&quot; Haywood had said. But the mill owners, with greater resources, outlasted the hungry workers.</p>
<p>I do not know how Solomon Goss responded to this second crushing defeat nor when he abandoned the silk trade. But in the 1940s, when Althea first knew him, he operated a &quot;candy store&quot; in Clifton Heights, New Jersey. When I met him in the late 50s, he had long ago sold the store and moved with Miriam to a tiny apartment in Utica, New York, where his son Dan and wife &quot;Grandma Anne&quot; (your great-grandma) lived. The man who had once been a proud unionist and socialist and who considered himself a follower of Daniel de Leon, founder of the Socialist Worker&#39;s Party, had drifted into conservatism, even voting for Richard Nixon in 1972. Defeat and poverty and deracination had not ennobled him. On the contrary, he was to my eyes a mean old man, given to gratuitously cruel and cutting remarks. His default stance toward me and toward the world was scorn. Miriam died in the late 60s; Solomon, having alienated his friends and relations, lived out his widowhood in a single room in a hotel in Rockaway and ultimately in the Hebrew Home for the Aged at Riverdale, where, a secularist to the end, he complained to Althea and to me about the intermittently broadcast Hebrew prayers. &#0160;</p>
<p>I find it almost impossible to reconcile the two sides of the man: the sour, sad, nasty old reactionary that he became and the heroic youthful fighter for social justice who fought the Cossacks, walked seven hundred miles from Lodz to Rotterdam and, I like to imagine, welcomed his beloved, radiant bride at the New York dock with tears in his eyes.&#0160;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>“Mucilage” is a word whose sound is wildly inappropriate to its meaning. In the world of adhesive nomenclature, “paste” is good and “glue” is even better. Trisyllabic mucilage ought to denote something far more serious -- perhaps a problem involving waste disposal (&quot;OK, we&#39;ve rescued the elephants, but what are we going to do with all that mucilage.&quot;)</p>
<p>In my life, mucilage made its mark long before glue arrived on the scene. In Brooklyn (and perhaps elsewhere) 1940s schoolchildren were issued small curvy bottles of the yellow stuff, each fitted with a red-rubber tip which was slit so that a drop or two of mucilage could be emitted when the bottle was pressed to the surface of your construction-paper or doily project. Actually, the slit regularly became caked and occluded and the hardened mucilage had to be scraped off with your fingernails. It was a lot like nose-picking. &#0160;</p>

<p>LePage’s Mucilage, I believe it was called.&#0160;We said Page as &quot;page&quot;&#0160;but surely LePage&#39;s Mucilage if pronounced&#0160;Frenchly (le pahje) would be far more euphonious.&#0160;Some claim that if you were building a model airplane, you would use mucilage on your fuselage, but I believe such an assertion to be the kind of persiflage at which I take umbrage.&#0160;</p>
<p>And yes, the word is a descendant and cousin of Latin <em>mucus</em>, meaning mucus.</p>
<p>Unbeknownst to 1940s me, mucilage has a life outside the bottle. It is a glycoprotein and exopolysaccharide found in most plants where it helps to store water and thicken membranes. I have now learned that the sticky stuff on the leaf tips of the insect-catching sundews that live at the edge of our pond&#0160;is a form of mucilage.&#0160;</p>
<p>I would be curious to know from what plants William Nelson LePage distilled the vast vats of mucilage that were diluted and parceled out to schoolchildren, who then spent the hour after &quot;Arts and Crafts&quot; removing nasty mucilage scale from their fingers. But I do now know why schools loved the stuff &#0160;-- because vegetable mucilage is, if not exactly edible, not poisonous either. No hoofs were harmed during its production.</p>
<p>Once having established the mucilage monopoly, Mr. LePage must have brought home zillions. And if his descendants were as sticky-fingered as I suspect they must have been, they will be enjoying the profits on their yachts or in their Manhattan penthouses to this day while we 1940s pupils are left with only memory-traces of mucilage&#39;s peculiar feel and odor. &#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Another Thanksgiving come and gone, and here am I in a nostalgic mood, harking back to those songs that we sang in the PS 217 <a href=" http://www.drmetablog.com/2006/12/the_p_s_217_ass.html">&quot;assembly&quot;&#0160;</a>in the 40s and 50s of the last millennium. With Miss Georgia Keiselbach at the piano, we marched, in size places, decorated in white shirts and green ties, into the school auditorium and warbled our dear little hearts out every Thursday at 10:00 am.</p>
<p>I remember very well the stirring but perplexing Thanksgiving hymn that began&#0160;</p>
<div class="poem">
<p>We gather together to ask the Lord’s blessing;<br />He chastens and hastens His will to make known.<br />The wicked oppressing now cease from distressing.<br />Sing praises to His Name; He forgets not His own.</p>
<p>Looking backward, I admit that I understood the first line of the stanza but was pretty much boggled by what came next. &quot;Chasten&quot; and &quot;hasten&quot; make a wonderful internal rhyme, but who does He hasten and how exactly does He chasten?&#0160; A syntactical mystery for sure. Were we expected to believe that the Great Signifier in the Sky &quot;chastens and hastens&quot; His own will? &#0160;Why in the world should he be asked to do so?</p>
<p>Nor did I grasp the meaning of third line, because I didn&#39;t recognize that &quot;the wicked oppressing&quot; meant &quot;the oppressing wicked&quot; or more precisely &quot;the wicked who are oppressing someone.&quot; But who were they &quot;oppressing&quot;? Apparently, the &quot;distressing&quot;, that is, the people who are distressed. And who, to be more specific, were the innocent distressed who were being oppressed. Us? &#0160;Our teachers? Let me now confess that I sang then and remember at this moment the line as &quot;now cease <em>us</em> from distressing&quot;, thinking that we, the pupils, must have been the &quot;wicked&quot; and that it was our now enlightened task to cease from oppressing the distressed. I read the line as a provocation to guilt, even though I knew that I myself, third-grader, had never oppressed anyone.</p>
<p>Nor was I the only confused 10-year-old, because BB, my PS 217 classmate and consultant on our assemblies, remembered the line as &quot;The wicked oppressing now <em>seize </em>us from distressing&quot; -- a sentence which is way beyond my parsing skills.</p>
<p>Of the last line of the quatrain, I grasped &quot;Sing praises to his name&quot; but &quot;He forgets not His own&quot; opened another can of confused worms. I construed &quot;His own&quot; to be shorthand for &quot;his own name.&quot; But what kind of Lord forgets his own name? &#0160;As BB, equally misled, says, &#39;it&#39;s god, just three letters; how hard is that?&quot;</p>
<p>The hymn goes on for another four puzzling stanzas, though to tell truth, I don&#39;t remember whether they were required of us PS 217 choristers. I for one am retrospectively pleased that we omitted the stanza that included the lines &quot;We praise thee, O God, our Redeemer, Creator,/&#0160;In grateful devotion our tribute we bring&quot; which surely seemed even then a trifle too theological.&#0160;</p>
<p>Despite the fact that I was mostly clueless, I rather enjoyed belting out the hymn&#39;s anapests. It&#39;s a joyous, rollicking piece of music. Whether it was appropriate for a public school in the heart of immigrant Brooklyn is another question. But hey, it was the 50s, before we all became so multicultural.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, out of spirit of curiosity, and because it&#39;s now so easy even for us lazybones to investigate such questions, I turned once again to wikipedia and typed in &quot;We gather together.&quot; Warning: surprise in store.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a Christian hymn (of course) written in 1597 by one Adrianus Valerius to celebrate the victory in the Battle of Turnhout, a turning point in the Dutch Protestant war of liberation against Spanish Catholic domination. It first appeared in print in a 1626 collection of Dutch folk and patriotic songs but didn&#39;t find its way to the New World until 1903 and became popular only in 1935 when it was included in the &quot;national hymnal of the Methodist-Episcopal Church.&quot; During World War II, which was entering its last phase when I was a kindergartner in PS 217, the hymn became popular because &quot;&#39;the wicked oppressing&#39; was understood to refer to Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan.&quot; Which is, I suppose, how an anti-Catholic Protestant hymn came to be included in our curriculum. After all, it was out of such strange and unpredictable meldings and divagations that Brooklyn/American culture was formed. &#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;We gather together&quot; was not our only Thanksgiving song. We also sang the entirely unobjectionable&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; Over the river, and through the wood,</p>
<p>&#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160;&#0160;To Grandmother&#39;s house we go;</p>
<p>&#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; The horse knows the way to carry the sleigh</p>
<p>&#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; Through the white and drifted snow - oh.</p>
</div>
<p>I found this song lovely but otherworldly, because my own particular grandmother lived not over the river but in a tiny third-floor walk-up on distinctly unpastoral Coney Island Avenue, where there was an occasional tired horse, pulling a vegetable wagon, but there were few sleighs.</p>
<p>But as it turns out, &quot;Over the river&quot; too has a history. &#0160;</p>

<p>That&#39;s a portrait of its author, Lydia Maria Child. She looks rather forbidding, as though she might have taught sixth grade at PS 217, but on further investigation she turns out to have been a radical and revolutionary woman to whose accomplishments I wish we had been introduced. Born in 1802, she started her writing career with the novel <em>Hobomok </em>which depicts and approves of the marriage of an Indian man and a white woman. It caused a small scandal. In 1833, she published <em>An Appeal in Favor of that Class of Americans Called Africans </em>which proposed the immediate emancipation of slaves, arguing that slavery was as harmful to slave-owners as to the enslaved. It was the first anti-slavery book printed in America. Ms. Child was also an early advocate of women&#39;s rights and spoke favorably of sexual passion. Of course she was ostracized from polite society. In 1844, she published the small innocuous poem for which she is remembered, which concludes &quot;Hurrah for the fun! Is the pudding done?/Hurrah for the pumpkin pie!&quot; -- a sentiment to which there can be no possible objection or dissent.</p>

                                <div class="noprint" id="mw-head-base">When I was for a decade the caretaker to a very ill, very disabled person, I often attended a &quot;support group&quot; along with folks who found themselves in similar situations. Not an easy task, being a full-time caretaker. At these useful gatherings, Information was exchanged, sympathy was given, hands were wrung and tissues were always at the ready. It was never an easy two hours. &#0160;</div>
<div class="noprint">&#0160;</div>
<div class="noprint">One of the recurrent themes of our discussions was escapism. Many of the caregivers wanted out. &quot;I just want to get into a car and drive somewhere, anywhere.&quot;&#0160; &quot;I want to lie on a beach in Hawaii, all by myself.&quot; &#0160;&quot;I want to move to a garret in Paris, stay there until this is over -- somewhere where I could meet new people, healthy ones.&quot; &quot;Sometimes I think of joining a pilgrimage, but I don&#39;t know to where.&quot; &quot;Nepal.&quot; &#0160;&quot;A cruise around the world.&quot; &quot;Is there another planet that I could go to?&quot;</div>
<div class="noprint">&#0160;</div>
<div class="noprint">I too had escapist fantasies, but I&#39;m embarrassed to report that they were of the blandest, most unimaginative, variety. Not Paris or Rome or Prague. For me, it was decidedly unexotic O&#39;Neill, Nebraska. If any of my constant readers need evidence that I was then and am now a monumentally pedestrian person, the proof lies in the O&#39;Neill pudding.&#0160;</div>
<div class="noprint">&#0160;</div>
<div class="noprint">When I indulged the fantasy, which I did at night, usually between 2am to 4am, I would imagine myself in a room at a slightly louche pay-by-the-week motel a couple of blocks from downtown O&#39;Neill. Crappy old stick furniture (but a good bed and mattress), low-wattage light bulbs in the ceiling fixture, big cut-glass ashtray. In this alternative world, I ate my breakfasts at Fay&#39;s Cafe a few hundred yards from the motel -- at my regular booth by the window. In the big table at the center of the diner, cheerful immense farmers gobbled their pancakes and bacon and coffee before setting off to fire up their John Deeres. They talked irrigation pipe and the price of soybeans. &#0160;</div>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>When I was a exceedingly young fellow (teens and twenties), I suffered from a great fear of death. It was not obsessive or constant, but enough to keep me lying awake at night, sometimes in a sweaty panic. It was not a fear of death itself, nor a concern about anguish in an afterlife -- hell a story which I always regarded as a pathetic fiction and fraud. No, my fear was that I would miss out on things. Children, grandchildren, springtimes, love, baseball, mountains, travel, books, knowledge, corn and hamburgers in August, the works. I wanted to live to an old age for the experiences. I well remember that in the 1960s, when I was barely out of adolescence, I would project myself forward to the distant future, as far as to the year 2000, the new millennium. I remember thinking, if I can just make it to 2000, when I&#39;ll be sixty-one, I&#39;ll have lived a full life. I&#39;ll be ready to go.</p>
<p>Well, 2000 has long ago come and gone, and here I am, pushing eighty, and in excellent, almost miraculous health. Such good health, in fact, that on good days I climb our neighboring foothills like a gazelle. (On bad days, even walking downhill seems as though I&#39;m slogging through a swamp of mucilage, but that&#39;s another matter.)</p>
<p>I no longer fear death. No matter what else happens to me, I&#39;m not going to die young, with my promises, such as they were, unfulfilled.</p>
<p>But the fear of dying young has been superseded by a new fear -- the fear of living too long. When did the transition occur?</p>
<p>I don&#39;t want to outlive my time. I don&#39;t want to outlive my friends, my family, my health. I&#39;m already the senior member, the patriarch, of my extended family -- not just the direct line from my grandparents, but of the extended cousinhood. In my family, there are no elders and only a couple of near-coevals. I don&#39;t want to become an isolate. Even more so, I don&#39;t want to lose my mobility or my mind. I don&#39;t want to find myself in a nursing home, pee on my pants, bedridden, &quot;locked-in&quot;. And I&#39;m going to do everything I can to avoid allowing myself to get into that situation. I&#39;ve seen people in that trap at close hand too many times -- and it ain&#39;t pretty. &#0160;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I&#39;m enjoying the perspective of the moment. I&#39;m glad that I managed to get to this point. From where I stand, I can remember my grandparents and I know my grandchildren. I&#39;m at the midpoint, the apex, of five generations. I marvel at the changes -- recall, will you, that my grandfather was born in darkest Ukraine in 1863, my youngest grandchildren were born in hi-tech Boulder, Colorado in 2013. Need I say more?</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Certainly in the 1940s and perhaps in later decades, first-graders all over America were taught an &quot;activity&quot; based on a song called &quot;The Farmer in the Dell.&quot; Older readers of this blague, if they are courageous enough to delve into long-forgotten and repressed pockets of the past, might dare to summon up the memory.&#0160;</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the game: &#0160;Ten young waifs, divided equally by gender, formed a circle holding hands around the Chosen One who was designated the &quot;farmer.&quot; The gamins (and gamines) sang the following song:</p>
<p>The farmer in the dell,</p>
<p>The farmer in the dell.</p>
<p>Heigh-ho the derry-o,</p>
<p>The farmer in the dell.</p>
<p>While they sang, the &quot;farmer&quot; walked around the inside of the circle and chose a partner from the circle of children. Then the tune was repeated with the key word altered:&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>The farmer takes a wife,</p>
<p>The farmer takes a wife,</p>
<p>Heigh-ho the derry-o</p>
<p>The farmer takes a wife.</p>
<p>The &quot;wife&quot; then joined him inside the circle, and the plot thickened. Now they sang: &#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;The wife takes a child,</p>
<p>The wife takes a child;</p>
<p>Heigh-ho the derry-o</p>
<p>The wife takes a child.&quot;</p>
<p>And so on down and down the great chain of being.&#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;The child takes a nurse...</p>
<p>&quot;The nurse takes a cow...</p>
<p>&quot;The cow takes a dog...</p>
<p>&quot;The dog takes a cat...</p>
<p>&quot;The cat takes a mouse...&quot;</p>
<p>And finally, when all the players have been chosen but one, the game ended on the following exclusionary note:</p>
<p>&quot;The cheese stands alone.</p>
<p>The cheese stands alone.</p>
<p>Heigh-ho the derry-o,</p>
<p>The cheese stands alone.&quot;</p>
<p>What was the point of this weird game? Why was it included in the &quot;curriculum?&quot;&#0160; Even seventy years later, it seems to be not fun but gratuitous cruelty. The most popular, the handsomest boy picks the most alluring young lady, and then choices are made in order of status. The game seems to have been devised to reinforce a hierarchical social structure. It was unAmerican, neither democratic or egalitarian. In retrospect, the game was triumphalist with regard to the farmer and his wife and harsh as all get out to the mouse and the cheese. If literary critics were to get their hands on this verse, they would be forced to notice the tragic pattern -- marriage at the outset followed by inevitable decline into isolation and soul-death.</p>
<p>Needless to say, I myself identify not with the prosperous farmer and his vivacious wife, but with the lumpish cheese. Velveeta it probably was, a big shapeless orange block of it, because no fancy aristocratic European cheeses were known to those of us who grew up in the 1940s PS 217 schoolyard. A sad cheese, inanimate, excluded from society, unchosen, least loved. Does the entire history of poetry offer a more mournful note than &quot;the cheese stands alone?&quot; Poor poor pitiful solitary neglected cheese.&#0160;</p>
<p>In recompense (it&#39;s too late for an apology) let us remember, three quarters of a century later, that cheeses have feelings too.</p>
<p>And for the curious, a &quot;dell&quot; is &quot;a small valley in a forest, tucked away from the rest of civilization.&quot; At the corner of Newkirk and Coney Island Avenue, where PS 217 was to be found, there were, trust me, no wooded dells. Concrete sidewalks, chain-link fences, yes. Dells no. Delis, but no dells. &#0160; &#0160;&#0160;</p>

                                <p>I calculate that for the last seventy-five years I&#39;ve eaten a box of raisins every month (I&#39;m a big fan of raisins and of dried fruit in general). A box of raisins is about 5 inches tall, 4 inches wide and 2 inches deep, or forty cubic inches. In a an average year, I eat 40 x 12 or 480 cubic inches of raisins. If I maintained my raisin-eating pace, it would take me four years to eat through a cubic foot of them. And it follows that in the last seventy-five years I&#39;ve eaten approximately 19 cubic feet of raisins, which amounts to a stack or block of raisins three feet long, three feet wide and two feet high. That&#39;s a heck of a lot of raisins. And that&#39;s just raisins -- &#0160;I&#39;m not even counting table grapes, also eaten plentifully over the decades. And wine.</p>
<p>I myself did not breed, plant, trim, fertilize or harvest the Thompson Seedless or Flame grapes. I did not fence the deer out of the orchard. No did I process the grapes. Nor box, ship, load, unload, or stock them in the market. Someone else made the boxes from wood that another person chainsawed to the ground. I just brought the raisins home from the market and sprinkled them on my oatmeal. Someone else, many someone elses, did all the hard work. &#0160;</p>
<p>I wonder how many people and how much accumulated skill it took to provide me with 19 lifetime cubic feet of raisins.&#0160;</p>
<p>Then there&#39;s milk. I&#39;ve drunk many many cartons of milk. I&#39;m too lazy to do the calculations, but I&#39;m going to guess that I&#39;ve consumed a hundred times more cubic feet of milk than I have of raisins. Probably a spacious roomful. And once again, I did not domesticate those fearsome wild European cattle, nor did I breed or milk them, or pasteurize &#0160;the milk, or ship it. I did not invent refrigeration, nor did I manufacture or install the refrigerators. I did not drive the milk truck (itself the creation of many hands). I hunted and gathered by walking to the market and plucking a carton (whole milk, vitamin D added) from the case. Easy as pie.</p>
<p>And what about potatoes? And pasta?</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think I need to go through any other of the commodities I consume. My point is simple: that it takes a titanic effort by society to keep me me me going. That I am borne on the shoulders of farmers, truckers, engineers, mechanics -- not to mention our neolithic ancestors who first looked at a cow and thought &quot;glass of cold milk&quot; or at a wild grape and thought &quot;those would make good raisins if we could just get the moisture content down.&quot;</p>
<p>So to all those people who think they are &quot;independent&quot; and who assert that they can fend for themselves, I say bullshit. If you eat anything at all, you&#39;re part of the great web of humanity that stretches around the earth and also extends back 65,000 years. &#0160;</p>
<p>So when you sit down to eat, and offer a prayer, don&#39;t thank god. Thank your industrious imaginative fellow humans.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>

                                <p>In Charles Dickens&#39; <em>Great Expectations</em>, it is reported that the woman who is eventually revealed to be Estella&#39;s mother was married &quot;over the broomstick (as we say), to a tramping man.&quot; Dickens offers no explanation for &quot;over the broomstick,&quot; apparently assuming that it was a concept with which his readers were familiar. There is in fact a long tradition of &#39;jumping the broom&quot; to certify informally a marriage sanctioned neither by state or church. It was practiced in west Africa where it symbolized the sweeping away of the old life and of a leap into the new world of fertility and increase. &quot;Jumping the broom&quot; was also a frequent practice in southern American slave culture where legal marriage was prohibited. The custom was a feature of ancient Celtic societies, especially among the Welsh and the Picts. As practiced by the Picts, broom jumping neither predicted nor solicited fertility. &#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I had to change the name on my Comcast -- now they call it Xfinity -- account (internet, TV, &quot;landline&quot;). In the pencil and paper days, you would just cross out the old name and put in the new. But that&#39;s not how it works nowadays. I didn&#39;t want to call the company and be put on hold for a half an hour, and then accidentally disconnected, which happens pretty regularly, so I drove over to the Xfinity storefront on Baseline. Very slick modern spacious venue. You&#39;re supposed to sign in on the computer at the front desk, but the computer was down so they just had a paper sign-up sheet -- embarrassing I would think to the employees to have to resort to something as antique as a written list. I noticed that I was tenth in line and I looked around and I saw that there were only two clerks -- they&#39;re probably called &quot;technicians&quot; or some other highfalutin&#39; name, but they&#39;re clerks. I guessed a forty-five minute wait and I wasn&#39;t far off. I had forgotten to bring my cell phone so I couldn&#39;t amuse myself with FB or the NYT or texting friends so I looked at the various items for sale and I immediately felt mighty ignorant. There were all sorts of devices that I didn&#39;t know what they did, and if I did recognize them, they were described in language that made not the slightest bit of sense to me. One cellphone, for example, offered both CDMA and GSM. Which is probably a good thing, and maybe someone could explain to me what they do and why you need both of them. And would &#0160;I want the cellphone with or without the Qi charger? That sort of thing. There were lots of connectors with fancy plugs for connecting one device to another, which is good if you know what you want to connect, and why, and if you have a solid grasp of your ports. So the forty-five minutes flew by and eventually my name was called and there I was at the counter with this young guy with a scruffy beard that looked like his lifetime growth of facial hair. I explained that I wanted to change the name on the account and he got to work. It seems that you can&#39;t just change the name but you have to cancel the one account and set up a new one so we went through the &quot;mother&#39;s maiden name&quot; thing and &quot;last four digits of your social&quot; and so on. It seemed to go on forever and every once in a while my technician would look up and say sort of mournfully to me &quot;the computer&#39;s kind of slow today.&quot; While I was with him, two old guys, older than me, brought their bills to the next technician over and said, essentially, &quot;I don&#39;t understand a thing about my bill. What am I paying for. What is this charge.&quot; Both guys went away mollified by the explanation but both said that they had to figure out how to reduce the monthly bill. And it&#39;s a fact that the monthly bill is rather complex. For example, I don&#39;t know why I pay a $6.00 monthly &quot;athletic fee&quot; but the clerk explained that it allows the company to televise high school football and small college football games which means that I&#39;d be able to see Cherry Creek play Fairview or the University of Northern Colorado play Mesa College which is something I suppose though no particular advantage to me inasmuch as I&#39;m personally boycotting all football because of the incidence of traumatic dementia. But that&#39;s not the point. It took between half and hour and forty-five minutes for my technician to make all the changes and I signed my name several times to acknowledge this and that which I didn&#39;t entirely understand and I was about to leave at last, but my fuzzy-cheeked technician gave me a piece of paper on which he highlighted a telephone number. He said, &quot;There&#39;s one more step. When you get home, you call this number and they will &quot;activate&quot; your TV and your internet and your telephone. I said, why don&#39;t you just call them, or hand me your telephone and I&#39;ll call the activator now but he said that wasn&#39;t the way it was done -- I had to call from my home. So I went home picked up the telephone, but it wasn&#39;t working. No dial tone. Of course it wasn&#39;t working -- it hadn&#39;t been &quot;activated.&quot; The message on the telephone screen was &quot;check tel line,&quot; but of course I had no idea how to do that. How did Xfinity in their wisdom and experience expect a consumer to activate an account from an inactivated telephone. A rather large glitch in the system I would think. However, I&#39;m a resourceful guy so I picked up my cell phone and called the number. I got through immediately and went through the sequence of this press 1 if that press 2 but there was no option for activating, so I said, several times, &quot;I would like to talk to a human being&quot; and after a number of iterations and going around the choices from 1 to 5 I got through to a person. I explained the situation very carefully to my new clerk or technician who sounded as though he could be in India and we did the mother&#39;s maiden name thing and the last four digits of your social and I was put on hold several times which always makes me very nervous and finally he came back and said that he was going to transfer me to the &quot;activation unit,&quot; who turned out to be a pleasant-voiced lightly-accented woman who was all business, but it took her about half an hour to activate me because Tel 2 kept lighting up on the modem before Tel 1 which is apparently not the way it&#39;s supposed to happen. But eventually it came to pass. I asked my new friend where she was physically located and she said &quot;the Philippines.&quot; So now I&#39;m back in business and it only took maybe three and a half hours at the very most to change the name on the account. Which is much longer than it took to find out why I had a $13.00 charge including a late payment fee on my Traveler&#39;s auto insurance (put on hold twice) or why I&#39;m paying for a electronic newspaper subscription but can&#39;t access the newspaper on line (on hold three times), where I eventually gave up and canceled the subscription (it had been a long day). &#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>&quot;Thank you all for coming. We appreciate it more than you can possibly imagine. We&#39;ve needed, and relied on, the support that all of you have given us.</p>
<p>It&#39;s no secret that both Lynn and I have gone through some difficult times. It&#39;s good to host a cheerful event. &#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>A number of people have asked us about our use of the word &quot;wed&quot; in the invitation that we sent to you. (We said, you remember, that we were &#39;wed&quot; on June 30). I don&#39;t want to mislead you. We didn&#39;t mean to imply that we involved either state or church in our relationship. There didn&#39;t seem to be any point for us to get married legally. People marry for the sake of children, but we&#39;ve decided that we&#39;re not going to have children.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the story. Lynn and I wanted to acknowledge in a public way the seriousness and permanence of our friendship -- for our families, and, I think, especially for our grandchildren (there are ten of them). We wanted our families to know that our relationship wasn&#39;t like some streetcar or trolley that you hop on and hop off. So we decided to invite our most nuclear&#0160;family to Lynn&#39;s backyard garden for a brief &quot;ceremony&quot; -- just my children and grandchildren, her children and grandchildren, her brother, my brother, the various spouses -- and pledge our love and fidelity. But then one of my daughters-in-law, Connie, said that we couldn&#39;t ask people to fly&#0160;in from all over the USA just for a five minute ceremony. She suggested that we at least exchange rings. It seemed like a good idea. So we walked over to Classic Facets on the Pearl Street Mall and bought two not antique but vintage rings -- because we&#39;re vintage people. Handsome rings, as you can see. And then as long as everyone was coming here a day early we decided that we should have dinner the night before. And if you&#39;re going to have a dinner you might as well have some music. So gradually the &quot;ceremony&quot; evolved and grew. But more importantly -- and here&#39;s the point -- the meaning of the event evolved as well. It became more significant, more profound, more intimate.&#0160;We never liked the phrase &quot;commitment ceremony&quot; or even the word &quot;commitment&quot; because it sounds as though you are being sent either to jail or to a mental institution, and we didn&#39;t have the vocabulary for what we intended to do. But little by little, while we planned the event, and even more so, after we performed the ceremony, we began to feel more and more married -- in all the positive senses of the word. We can now say &quot;wed&quot; and mean it. I haven&#39;t yet been able to say &quot;husband&quot; or &quot;wife&quot; but I suspect that one day in the not too distant future those words will manifest themselves. But the point is that in all the ways that matter, we are &quot;wed.&quot;</p>
<p>When my Vermont friend Bert, who&#39;s just my age, got married 18 years ago, I said to him, Bert, is it real --that you&#39;re head over heels in love at age 60? At the time, it seemed so improbable. But now, here I am, just a year and a half short of 80, and setting out on a new life. And 60 seems like dewy youth.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>So let me repeat to you now what I said to Lynn on June 30. &quot;I bring you my children and my grandchildren, my prosthetic tooth, my lens implants, my hearing aids, my non-standard but warm heart, and I take you and your children and grandchildren and your titanium hip and arthritic finger&#0160;and I say, &quot;let us make a life of it.&quot;</p>
<p>And let me just add that between us we have been married for 100 years (an average of 50 apiece). So we ought to know what we&#39;re doing.</p>
<p>And what we&#39;re going to do is to ride this old trolley right to the end of the line.&quot;</p>
                        </div>

		<a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2017/05/enoughisasgoodasafeast.html">"Enough is as Good as a Feast" or Possibly Better</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <div>&quot;Enough is as good as a feast&quot; has become my very favorite proverb.</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>It&#39;s&#0160; a warning against crass consumerism, against materialism, against the excesses of capitalist acquisitiveness. Cold water in a jelly glass, it asserts, is as good as your $500 wine in crystal. As they used to gloss the proverb, no &quot;<em>avaricious scraping together that knows no bounds</em>.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>But for a fully &quot;mature&quot; guy like me, the proverb carries not only a figurative but a plain literal instruction, i.e., &quot;do yourself a favor, eat less.&quot; Enough is as good as a feast if a feast makes your stomach swell, makes you heavy-lidded and gassy and passive, and if you feel a heck of a lot better when you haul yourself away from the Table of Plenty long before you reach satiety.</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>I can remember, as a voracious adolescent, eating <em>three </em>large, overstuffed hamburgers at a single sitting -- the roll overflowing with tomatoes, onions, relish, ketchup, etc. Along with a bottomless bowl of fries. And craving more. Then as a vigorous young man, a good portion was two hamburgers. Nowadays, I go halves with a friend. Hold the fries.</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>When my grandmother dished up those glorious blintzes of my youth, eight was my number. Now my number is -- one. And I feel the better for it.</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>Digestion is slower and, I suppose, less efficient. And then there&#39;s the embarrassing fact that hamburgers and blintzes and everything else settles right in the enlarged belly, the &quot;front porch.&quot;</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>So here&#39;s a proverb for this latter age: &quot;enough is better than a feast.&quot; Much.&#0160;</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>By the way, I first encountered the proverb, believe it or not, as the title to William Wager&#39;s 1581 morality. And then in Latin in Shakespeare&#39;s<em> Love&#39;s Labor&#39;s Lost</em>,<em><em>&#0160;</em></em>where, Sir Nathaniel and the pedant Holofernes come on stage having just completed, apparently, a more than substantial dinner. &quot;<em>Holofernes</em>: &#0160;&#39;Satis quod sufficit.&#39;&quot; Perhaps Holofernes paraphrases and simplifies&#0160;Horace:&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div><em>Multa petentibus<br />Desunt multa.<br />Bene est, cui deus obtulit<br />Parca, quod satis est manu.</em></div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>(Those who seek for much are left in want of much. Happy is he to whom God has given, with sparing hand, as much as is enough.)&#0160;</div>
                        </div>

                                <p>Insomnia once again -- a nightly affliction, a family trait. Perhaps we lack a gene that lets others sleep from dusk to dawn. Have I noted here that I want my tombstone inscribed with the motto, just beneath my name and dates, &quot;No More Insomnia, Forever.&quot;</p>
<p>During the wakeful nights, I&#39;ve taken to listening to old-time radio. My favorite: WHRO out of Norfolk, Virginia. Last night, I heard some tenor from the 1920s (perhaps John McCormack) in a scratchy recording (tuba for bass) wail or warble &quot;The Lost Chord&quot;-- quite the 3 am treat it was. A flood of memories arose, because &quot;The Lost Chord&quot; was one of the songs that we learned during the PS 217 <a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2006/12/the_p_s_217_ass.html">assembly</a> back there in Flatbush in the 1950s. I recalled with some amusement that our determined &quot;music specialist,&quot; Miss Georgia Keiselbach, a big lumbering woman with a trained contralto voice, tried gamely to inculcate an anguished mid-Victorian quasi religious parlor song into the minds of a roomful of fidgety 10-year-olds. Quite an experience. I was entranced by Sir Arthur Sullivan&#39;s melody, but I have to admit that the lyric was incomprehensible to me then and is still quite a challenge to this day.</p>
<p>So I investigated. Onto the internet, which, fortunately, works very well at 4 am.</p>
<p>The words to &quot;The Lost Chord&quot; are by Adelaide Anne Procter, after Tennyson apparently the most popular poet of her day, although I&#0160;must&#0160;confess that I had never heard of her even though I&#39;m supposed to know something about nineteenth-century English literature. &#0160;</p>
<p>Here&#39;s Ms. Procter&#39;s fervid poem:&#0160;</p>
<div class="poem">
<p>Seated one day at the organ,<br />I was weary and ill at ease,<br />And my fingers wandered idly<br />Over the noisy keys.<br /><br />I know not what I was playing,<br />Or what I was dreaming then;<br />But I struck one chord of music&#0160;<br />Like the sound of a great Amen.<br /><br />It flooded the crimson twilight,<br />Like the close of an angel&#39;s psalm,<br />And it lay on my fevered spirit<br />With a touch of infinite calm.<br /><br />It quieted pain and sorrow,<br />Like love overcoming strife;<br />It seemed the harmonious&#0160;echo<br />From our discordant life.<br /><br />It linked all perplexed&#0160;meanings<br />Into one perfect peace,<br />And trembled away into silence<br />As if it were loth to cease.<br /><br />I have sought, but I seek it vainly,<br />That one lost chord divine,<br />Which came from the soul of the organ,<br />And entered into mine.<br /><br />It may be that death&#39;s bright angel<br />Will speak in that chord again,<br />It may be that only in&#0160;Heav&#39;n<br />I shall hear that grand Amen.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll paraphrase (even though I know that paraphrase is not a nice thing to do to a poem): in a reverie at the organ the poet experiences something grand that is aesthetic, transcendent, ineffable, and fleeting. The &quot;lost chord divine&quot; -- note the Miltonic deployment of adjectives&#0160;-- stands for the hope or wish or belief that there is such a place as heaven and that it&#39;s a place where weariness, fever, pain, sorrow, perplexity, strife, and discord are superseded by the &quot;infinite calm&quot; and &quot;perfect peace&quot; of the &quot;grand Amen.&quot; &#0160;A not unusual or extraordinary nineteenth-century sentiment where the hunt for the disappearing god was frequently mediated by art -- in this particular case by the art of music.&#0160;</p>
<p>As long as I&#39;m reducing the poem to its paraphraseable meaning, I might also add that Procter, like many poets before and after her, has conflated religious and sexual longing. I&#0160;derive this meaning, inaccessible to the roomful of quavering sopranos of which I was one, and very likely unsuspected by Miss Keiselbach herself, from the vocabulary of passion in which the poem is couched: &quot;crimson,&quot; &quot;touch,&quot; &quot;lay&quot; &quot;love,&quot; &quot;trembled.&quot; &#0160;And from the sentence, &quot;It came from the soul of the organ,/ &#0160;And entered into mine,&quot; where it might be argued, slightly frivolously, that any line of poetry that contains &quot;came&quot; &quot;organ&quot; and &quot;entered&quot; has got to be about a symbolic sexual encounter. Especially when the ambiguous word &quot;mine&quot; can denote either &quot;my soul&quot; or &quot;my organ.&quot; So in this extravagant reading, in which it is once again clearly demonstrated that you can take the boy out of Brooklyn but you can&#39;t take the Brooklyn out of the boy, &quot;The Lost Chord&quot; is not only about the search for &quot;perfect peace&quot; but also for the perfect orgasm which will provide infinite calm to the poetess when she &quot;dies&quot; -- a word which is itself a Victorian euphemism for sexual climax. The lost chord is the big O (and I don&#39;t mean Oscar R.)</p>
<p>Just for fun of it let me also adduce a couple of sentences from the wikipedia article on Adelaide Anne Procter: &quot;Modern critics argue that Procter&#39;s work is significant for what it reveals about how Victorian women&#0160;otherwise repressed feelings.&quot; &quot;One critic&#0160;suggests that Procter may have been a lesbian&#0160;and in love with&#0160;Matilda Hays;&#0160;other critics have called Procter&#39;s relationship with Hays &#39;emotionally intense.&#39;&quot; &quot;Procter became engaged in 1858. The identity of Procter&#39;s fiancé remains unknown, and the proposed marriage never took place.&quot; &quot;In 1851,&#0160;Procter converted to Roman Catholicism.&quot; &quot;Procter never married. She became unhealthy, possibly due to her charity work, and died of tuberculosis&#0160;at the age of 38.&quot; I&#39;ll let my loyal readers connect the dots. &#0160;</p>
&quot;The Lost Chord&quot; is a fine song and deserves to be revived. On <em>YouTube</em>, you can listen to a remarkably accomplished version by Enrico Caruso. Which you can access to at any time, even in the midst of a long insomniac night.</div>

		<a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2017/04/sexual-dimorphism-why.html">Sexual Dimorphism -- What's the point?</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>By all rights I should have been attending to the intricate areas of my face while shaving, but I lapsed into a reverie. My obsession of the moment--the beard. Why? Why in the world do human males grow hair on their faces? What&#39;s the point? The beard is completely valueless except to Gillette and Schick and now Harry.&#0160;</p>
<p>If the beard had a genuine function and if it honestly kept a person warm in winter, then for what reason would evolution deprive the gals of equivalent protection?&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Do bearded males garner a larger share of the nubile maidens than the shaved and beardless? Or a disproportionate share of the wealth? I know of no evidence that they do so. The fact that most men shave their beards argues that beards lack power or function.&#0160;</p>
<p>It&#39;s sexual dimorphism without purpose or logic. My guess--and it&#39;s only a guess--is that the beard-gene clung to a gene with a useful male purpose a couple of hundred thousand years ago and never let go. Accidental hirsuteness.</p>
<p>I suppose that there are times when sexual dimorphism can be useful. Those magnificent manes sported by the lions of the Serengeti certainly make a formidable statement--<em>noli me tangere</em> and by the way remember to keep your paws off the the ladies in my harem. I can see that--but then, the males of the enormous extinct European lion managed without a ruff, as do Bengal tigers.&#0160;</p>
<p>The gorgeous display of the male peacock is exuberant but inessential--more subtle birds manage to signal their gender and their availability without such a prodigious waste of resources.&#0160;</p>
<p>I should be relieved that it&#39;s only the beard that I have to worry about. Imagine if by some quirk of evolution, males of my species grew a big rack of antlers. Way more inconvenient than a mere beard. What a bother!! I can easily imagine myself lodged in a narrow doorway, or lying in bed trying to find a comfortable position while the antlers scratch the headboard, put holes in the pillow, or poke the eye of the beloved.&#0160;</p>
<p>Perhaps an advanced civilization would demand that we disbud the antlers at birth? Or we might go the other route and celebrate a magnificent set. We might have evolved into a society that decorated or colored or polished the antlers. &quot;How are you wearing your antlers this winter?&quot; &quot;Natural brown, I think, this year, but with golden highlights.&quot; Chains of &quot;Mr. Antler&quot; or &quot;Antler King&quot; shops (&quot;discount on sharpening this week only&quot;). And for guys declined into the vale of years--prosthetic antlers.&#0160;</p>
<p>Better a beard than antlers. Definitely.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>On the main street of Estes Park (Gateway to Rocky Mountain National Park), a sign outside the restaurant advertised &quot;deepfried oreos.&quot; I was both flabbergasted and thunderstruck, not believing my eyes. But here&#39;s the evidence:</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef01bb09921a68970d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Oreos" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef01bb09921a68970d img-responsive" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef01bb09921a68970d-800wi" title="Oreos" /></a><br />Just above ice cream and below &quot;funnel cakes&quot; (but that&#39;s another story). Is it a hoax, or can there be such a thing? Absolutely,&#0160;there&#39;s many a google-entry on &quot;deepfried oreos.&quot; Several different recipes, one more hideous than the next. A piece of <em>cuisine americaine&#0160;</em>that had somehow escaped me all these many years.&#0160;</p>
<p>One of my waggish friends writes: &quot;I should confess that the last time my wife and I were in Paris, we sampled the deep fried Oreos at a little café on the rue de Rivoli. The sommelier suggested a hearty Cabernet to take the edge off the sweetness of the dish and the wine worked beautifully with the cookie filling, an amalgam of flavors that made our senses tingle.&quot; I of course was skeptical of his story. No knowledgeable sommelier would recommend a red wine because it was well known that deepfried oreos were best served with champagne or gatorade.</p>
<p>Is it possible that deepfried oreos could become part of the cuisine of old Europe? Will it be the case that in every Italian village, just between the <em>macelleria&#0160;</em>and the quaint&#0160;<em>pasticceria&#0160;</em>there will be an <em>oreofritteria?&#0160;</em>A mom-and-pop <em>oreofritteria </em>using recipes that have been in the family for centuries&#0160;-- but in danger of being taken over by the big American chain, a subsidiary of -- who knows what -- called Signor Oreofritto. A terrifying prospect all around. &#0160;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>What was it like in the 1940s when I was your age? &#0160;Very different. Milk was delivered daily in bottles: a milk-wagon, drawn by a tired, plodding old horse, appeared on East 9th Street three times a week before we sat down to breakfast. There were also daily visits from a horse-drawn vegetable truck. An itinerant knife-sharpener came once every couple of months. And also a very old man with a large sack thrown over his back, singing out in the loudest voice I&#39;ve ever heard, &#39;I cash clothes.&quot; There were squarish automobiles (Packards, DeSotos, Studebakers), but far fewer than today -- so few that kids would play punchball and stickball right in the middle of the street, just stepping to the side to let that occasional car whizz by. Kids also skated in the street, using clunky metal skates that attached to the shoe by turning a &quot;skate key.&quot; There was no television, but everyone listened to the radio. &quot;Portable&quot; radios were as big as bread boxes. Some people had refrigerators (much smaller than modern ones), but most had &quot;iceboxes.&quot; Every week, an ice delivery man would haul a block of ice (about a foot-and-a-half square if I remember correctly) with large tongs and set it in the icebox. Coal was delivered in barrels: men with heavy gloves would roll the barrels from the truck to the ground-level coal chute. All telephones were attached to the wall with wires. Long distance phone calls were expensive and only for emergencies. People did not communicate by e-mail or by texting, but by means of postcards and letters. A &quot;letter&quot; was a piece of paper on which whole paragraphs were written; it was inserted into an &quot;envelope&quot; and put in a &quot;mail box&quot; for delivery. Hard to believe, I know. There were no word processors. I learned to write using a &quot;straight pen.&quot; There were no dvd&#39;s or cd&#39;s or streaming. Instead, we had &quot;records,&quot; vinyl discs 12-inches in diameter which were placed on a rotating &quot;turntable&quot; on which rested a hand with a stylus, at first steel and then later diamond. It was primitive, I know, but it worked rather well. There were no credit cards. Some people had checking accounts, but 99% of commercial transactions were completed with &quot;money.&quot; When I started at P. S. 217, in 1944, I wore &quot;knickers&quot; (pants that went to just below the knee and were held in place with elastic) and long socks. You can sometimes see knickers in old illustrated books or in clothes museums. Men always wore hats: fedoras or derbies or panamas or bowlers or pork-pies, usually made of felt. Women wore hats too, some with veils, most of them godawful ugly. Young folks &quot;courted.&quot; In those days, before people became intimate, they would go through a period in which they would &quot;date&quot; and talk and get to know each other. This period could last for weeks or even months. Astonishing, I know, but trust me, it happened that way in the old days. &quot;The past is another country; they do things differently there.&quot;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I was six years old when the war ended in 1945, so my memories are few and arise in no particular order. I remember hearing news reports on the radio that were datelined &quot;Moscow&quot;-- but I conflated Moscow with Bosco, a brand of chocolate syrup popular in the 1940s. I remember that the floor of our kitchen was disfigured with an infinite number of black marks -- rubber was in short supply and the substituted soles left nasty blotches. My mother said, &quot;We&#39;ll wait until the war is over to replace the linoleum.&quot; Many commodities were in short supply: instead of butter there was a white oleomargerine into which a packet of orange food color was mashed to simulate a credible yellow. There were ration books and ration stamps for gasoline and sugar and coffee and greens. My mother was furious that Mr. Lerner, who owned the fruit and vegetable shop on 18th Avenue, sold black-market lettuces from the back of his store. A bus driver was rude to a passenger; my mother said: &quot;all the decent young men are overseas.&quot; We saved our nickels and brought money to school to buy war bonds. Following government advice, my father dug up his carefully tended lawn and planted a &quot;victory garden&quot; of vegetables. There were frequent blackouts: my father&#39;s friend Jack Patent sported a white hard hat because he was a warden. My Uncle Dan, a major in the Army Air Corps, came home from the Burma border for a thirty-day furlough and showed me his captured German Luger. We received air mail letters from him and from other soldiers with details blacked out by military censors. I complained to my mother: &quot;Mrs. Callery (my first grade teacher) isn&#39;t nice to me.&quot; My mother said, &quot;You have to forgive her; she&#39;s lost four of her boys in the war.&quot; Lost?&#0160; Four of her boys? I did not understand. On a sunny spring day in 1945, we heard on the radio that President Roosevelt was dead; my mother sat on the stoop and cried. And in August of that same year, when our family was visiting someone on a lake somewhere, all of a sudden the adults who had motor boats were zooming back and forth and shouting and laughing. I asked what was happening and my father said, &quot;the war is over.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>Uncle Jack&#39;s tank was demolished by German cannon fire and he was the crew&#39;s only survivor. He lived with shrapnel in his brain until the age of ninety-one. Cousin Saul&#39;s older brother was killed in New Guinea, but Sarah, his mother, &quot;knew&quot; that he was alive and waited for the knock on the door or the telephone call until the end of her days. Meanwhile, the poor fellow&#39;s bones lay bleaching at Buna or some other long-forgotten field of battle. Before the war, my mother told me, we used to receive mail from the old country -- from the many members of the Chafetz and Tomaszewski and Middlebank and Hessel families who had stayed behind. &quot;But after the war, nothing.&quot;</p>
<p>Can we, even now, bear to imagine what became of all those Malkas and Rifkas and Levs and Mendels?&#0160; &#0160;</p>

<div class="thumbinner">I had to go to the huge shopping mall the other day and let me&#0160;tell you,&#0160;what a colossal waste of effort! There was nothing for me. Lots of jewelry, fancy duds, shoes. There must have been ten shoe stores for the ladies and almost as many for the guys. But I&#39;ve already stocked up on shoes: I buy multiple pairs of a design that works for me, stow&#0160;them deep in the closet, and pull out a new pair when the one in use springs a leak. Same thing with pants: multiple copies of Lee Regular Fit jeans in a variety of colors, bought online or if I&#39;m in a sociable mood at a shop around the corner. The big malls, with their sun glass huts and perfume counters and candle stores and&#0160; knick-knacks, doo-dads, and tschokes interest me not all. Nor their food courts -- gag. Or their muzak music, programmed to make you want to spend, spend&#0160;and spend again.</div>
<div class="thumbinner">
<p>I can, however, imagine a shopping mall designed for my particular and personal satisfaction. It would be called &quot;The Mall of Me.&quot;</p>
<p>Anchoring one end of the Mall of Me is a large book store, carrying both new and used, but stocked with volumes of history, fine arts, crafts, popular science, biography, travel, fiction, gardening and what used to be called &quot;natural history&quot;, with lots of room to browse and sit and read. Proviso: the &quot;bookstore of me&quot; carries zero books on Spirituality, Self-Improvement, Soul Regression, Tarot, Alternative Therapies, or Healing Arts. No books written by TV pastors or repentant politicians recently released from prison or by instant millionaires. No celebrity autobiographies. At the other end of the Mall of Me, there&#39;s a shop selling music cds which&#0160; specializes in the great age of middle European music from 1685 (birth of Bach) to 1911 (death of Mahler), but also features a treasury of classic blues, bluegrass, American roots, popular song, rock and roll, and gospel of the golden age. No New Age, No Rap, no Electronic. Between my two &quot;anchors,&quot; there will be a good garden store featuring expensive, elegant, heavy-in-the-hand garden tools. No power mowers or power tools, but when appropriate to the season, racks of seeds, preferably of heirloom and antique vegetables. Next to it, a movie memorabilia and poster store, with large collections from the earliest days of cinema right through 1950, especially Shakespeare movies. And then I&#39;d like a high-end antique store displaying walls and shelves of classical and Asian works of art. Unfortunately, because of budgetary constraints, I won&#39;t be doing any purchasing in this particular shop, but I&#39;ll be pleased to browse in it, at least weekly, perhaps oftener. Also, a cafe where a guy could purchase a hot chocolate and an almond croissant. I would also like a store that specializes in 19th and early 20th century Caucasian rugs and wall-hangings though here, once again -- it would be more for appreciating than for actual buying. Subject to the same constraints, a baseball memorabilia shop -- National League only. A high end crafts store. And as for restaurants: a Jewish deli, modeled after the now defunct Second Avenue Delicatessen. An imaginative Asian fusion restaurant. A bagel bakery. No fish, and certainly no sushi. Perhaps a hole-in-the-wall one-person walk-in shop where a guy or gal could help me with computer and cell phone anomalies and failures -- someone who speaks in traditional English, not in acronyms. And then there will be buskers: at one end of the mall, a string quartet; at the other end, a bluegrass band. No fire-eaters, contortionists, or drummers banging on pots and pans. All performers personally vetted by me. No panhandlers or noble solicitors with their dread clipboards.</p>
<p>And of course, some intelligently-designed play areas for infants, new walkers and small children. And some comfortable chairs for their parents (and me) to sit and watch the kiddies frolic.</p>
<p>Yes, I think that will do it. &#0160;It&#39;s the Mall of Me.</p>
<p>Now that I think of it, everyone should have their own mall. Instead of vast mall installations, let&#39;s have targeted malls. Individually designed and executed.</p>
<p>Merchandising genius!!&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>A few years ago I posted, right <a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2011/12/birthday.html%20" target="_self">here</a>&#0160;on this blague, pictures of some handsome objects that would make good birthday presents for yours truly. But one March 11 after another March 11 has come and gone, and -- nothing. Not a single reader, acquaintance, friend, or relative has embraced the opportunity. There has not been so much as a serious inquiry, even though my suggestions were eminently sensible. &#0160;</p>
<p>I&#39;m going to try once again this year. After all, unemployment is down, the stock market is up, and there&#39;s&#0160;more loose change out there. (And perhaps more escapism.) Moreover, there won&#39;t be many more birthdays for me -- I&#39;m getting up there in years. It&#39;s now or never.</p>
<p>So -- fans of Vivian de St. Vrain, and Vrainites everywhere, seize the day.</p>
<p>OK, steady now. What about a castle in Ireland? I would really enjoy a castle. There are many on the market this year, and they&#39;re quite reasonably priced, as castles go.</p>
<p>For example, here&#39;s Ballindooley, a starter Castle in Galway.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef017ee7eeb8ed970d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Castle 1" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef017ee7eeb8ed970d" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef017ee7eeb8ed970d-800wi" title="Castle 1" /></a></p>
<p>Even though it&#39;s small, it has undeniable &quot;curb appeal.&quot; The realtor claims that it was built toward the end of the 15th century in the Norman style and probably for the DeBurgo family. The realtor also notes that there&#39;s &quot;a new stone parapet and that there have been recent repairs to the machicolations.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>Inasmuch as I wouldn&#39;t dream of owning a castle where the machicolations were all busted up, I&#39;m happy for the reassurance. The price: a bargain at a mere 950,000 euros.&#0160;</p>
<p>Though I wouldn&#39;t turn up my nose at Ballindooley, I would certainly prefer Killaghy Castle at Mullinahone in Tipperary.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p><strong><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef017d407a7f89970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Castle2" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef017d407a7f89970c" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef017d407a7f89970c-800wi" title="Castle2" /></a><br /></strong></p>
<p>It&#39;s a better value. The original castle was built, the realtor claims (I haven&#39;t seen the documentation) in the first decade of the 13th century. A &quot;long house&quot; was added during Tudor times, and two more buildings were attached during the 18th century -- so it&#39;s already been updated.&#0160;Plus there are two walled gardens with &quot;excellent mature specimen trees.&quot;&#0160; An ominous note though: &quot;price upon request.&quot;</p>
<p>So, loyal readers, it&#39;s time for you to chip in your pennies and farthings and join together for one big happy birthday celebration for me.</p>
<p>And please, don&#39;t forget that in order for me to care for your gift properly, I&#39;m going to need a bit of an endowment --&#0160; which I do not see as much of a problem. Plus furnishings.</p>
<p>And by the way, for those of you who are not &quot;in the know&quot; about castles, a &quot;machicolation&quot; is a &quot;projecting gallery at the top of a castle wall, supported by a row of corbeled arches and having openings in the floor through which stones and boiling liquids could be dropped on attackers.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>I like a castle that says, &quot;all welcome.&quot;&#0160;</p>
                        </div>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Several times a year, we attend the opera -- that is, we wander over to the Metropolitan Opera widescreen HD broadcasts at&#0160;our local movie theater. Last week, it was Dvorak&#39;s <em>Rusalka</em> --overproduced, over-costumed, a mighty silly&#0160;story,&#0160;but nevertheless glorious. Sung in Czech. Of course, I didn&#39;t understand a word, but then I never do expect to do so, even when the opera is sung in a language with which I&#39;m supposed to be on speaking terms. But it&#39;s not the libretto which we savor, it&#39;s the&#0160;music.&#0160;</p>
<p>Nevertheless at each performance there&#39;s a solemn &#0160;moment when&#0160;language moves front and center. It comes after the preliminary fol-de-rol and acknowledgements and interviews and trailers-for-next-month&#39;s performance are finally dispensed with. Now, at long last,&#0160;the camera locates the head-setted director, who sits at huge intimidating console of buttons and knobs and switches and lights. And now here they come, the words of magic and enchantment: &quot;maestro to the pit.&quot;</p>
<p>In that pithy, incantatory sentence is encapsulated all the ritual power of language.&#0160;It&#39;s a&#0160;hieratic moment.&#0160;After such a magnificent statement, everything else is anticlimax (linguistically speaking).</p>
<p>Freed by these words, the shamanic conductor heretofore invisible, steps up, turns his back to the audience and faces the orchestra, brandishes his baton, and initiates the business of the day.&#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;Maestro to the pit.&quot; &#0160;I love the idea that the generic term for conductor is &quot;maestro.&quot; I love the quasi-oxymoronic juxtaposition of &quot;maestro&quot; and &quot;pit.&quot; &#0160;In fact, I love the word &quot;pit&quot; in this context. Not a hole in the ground, nor the pit of hell, nor a place in which to chuck pieces of dismembered bodies. No, an orchestra pit, which is a&#0160;horse of an entirely different color. Good thing it&#39;s not the custom to say &quot;conductor to the podium.&quot; How flat, how banal, how unsacral.&#0160;No dignity, no grandeur, no poetry.</p>
<p>No, it&#39;s &quot;maestro to the pit.&quot;&#0160;And let it always be so.</p>
<p>And by the way, I make a pretty good barbecue sauce, and I&#39;m proud to say that my spare ribs are semi-famous. Let the word go forth, that now and forever,&#0160;whenever I&#39;m called to the grill, it&#39;s going to be &quot;maestro to the pit.&quot;</p>
                        </div>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>The most erudite man that I ever encountered&#0160;in my own person&#0160;was James Hutton, a professor of classics when I was an undergraduate at Cornell back there in the 1950s. Professor Hutton bristled with knowledge&#0160;-- nor is this my opinion only, but one that is well attested by his international reputation&#0160;and by the list of his writings. Hutton wrote two enormous books (800 pages each!!) that won him his scholarly spurs:&#0160;<em>The Greek Anthology in Italy</em> (1935) and <em>The Greek Anthology in France and</em> <em>in the Latin Writers of the Netherlands to the Year 1800</em> (1946). I encountered Professor Hutton in 1958 when, callow and poorly educated, I enrolled in a Latin course called &quot;Terence and Catullus&quot; (of which more&#0160;later). But first, for those curious readers out there in bloglandia&#0160;who are on tenterhooks, painfully stretched like new wool and are wondering what the&#0160;heck is the&#0160;&quot;Greek Anthology&quot; about which James Hutton composed his pair of <em>magna opera</em>&#0160;and around which his life centered --<em> t</em>urn we now to the pages&#0160;of the <em>Encyclopedia</em> <em>Brittanica.</em></p>
<p>In brief, the <em>Anthologia Graeca</em>&#0160;is a collection of poems, mostly epigrams, that had a complicated ancient history, but originated perhaps with an anthology complied by Meleager of Gadara&#0160;in the first century&#0160;BCE, which brought together works by many ancients including Archilochus, Alcaeus, Anacreon and Simonides&#0160;(all big names in their time). There were a series of early editions that do not survive but an authoritative version was made by Constantine Cephalas&#0160;in the 10th century. &quot;Cephalas appended a number of other collections: homoerotic verse collected by Straton of Sardis&#0160;in the 2nd century AD; a collection of &#0160;Christian&#0160;epigrams found in churches; a collection of satirical and convivial epigrams collected by Diogenianus as well as Christodorus&#39;s description of statues in the Byzantine gymnasium&#0160;of Zeuxippos;&#0160;and a collection of inscriptions from a temple in Cyzicus.&quot; And then in 1300 or thereabouts Maximus Planudes brought together an edition which became standard, which, while adding some poems, also deleted or bowdlerized many of those that offended his puritanical Christian sensibilities. Planudes&#39; anthology was the only one known to Western Europe for many centuries; manuscript transmission was superseded when an edition based on his work was printed in 1494.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a lot more but that&#39;s enough information for us to understand the area which James Hutton worked.&#0160;Professor Hutton knew the anthology backwards and forwards and made it his business to trace&#0160;its considerable influence through&#0160;the Latin and vernacular poetry of late antiquity&#0160;and the&#0160;medieval and renaissance worlds. Quite an endeavor, in my opinion. &#0160;</p>
<p>Hutton was a Scotsman, born in Airth, son of a sea captain, though from where I sat (in a small seminar room in Goldwin Smith Hall!!), it was impossible to imagine that he had ever been a child or even a young man. He came to the US early in life and there was not a trace of Scotland in his speech. Hutton entered Cornell as a freshman in 1920, received three degrees there, stayed on to teach, and retired in 1973. According to his Cornell obituary, he was a life-long bachelor. For most of his adulthood, he lived with his mother, Mrs. Elizabeth Hutton, and he shared a house for many years with Professor Lane Cooper, his teacher and another bachelor Cornell classicist. After the death of his mother and of Cooper, he continued to live at 123 Roberts Place with his cousin/housekeeper, Mrs. Margaret Green. Perhaps he was a delightful presence among his friends, but to my eyes he was a pale, tall, gaunt, dry-as-a stick, bony man devoid of humor or juice. Born only two years before my own father, he seemed to be generations older. &#0160;</p>
<p>Now a few words about Terence and Catullus, the twin subjects of my 1958 Latin classroom experience.&#0160;</p>
<p>Terence (Publius Terentius Afer) was Roman playwright possibly of Berber origin but certainly originally a north African slave. Brought to Rome and freed, he wrote six comedies, adapted from Greek originals, of which we students of Professor Hutton plowed through three: <em>Andria</em> (166 BC); <em>The Self-Tormentor</em>&#0160;(163 BC) and the&#0160;<em>Adelphi</em>&#0160;(160 BC). Terence drowned on a trip to Greece, age 25. His must have been a marvelously romantic life, even though much curtailed. Too bad we know only its barest outline.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the title page to the first &quot;modern&quot; edition of Terence&#39;s works (1496)</p>
<div class="thumb tright">
<div class="thumbinner"><a class="image" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Houghton_Inc_473_-_Terence,_Works.jpg"><img alt="" class="thumbimage" data-file-height="1709" data-file-width="1257" height="299" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/Houghton_Inc_473_-_Terence%2C_Works.jpg/220px-Houghton_Inc_473_-_Terence%2C_Works.jpg" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/Houghton_Inc_473_-_Terence%2C_Works.jpg/330px-Houghton_Inc_473_-_Terence%2C_Works.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/Houghton_Inc_473_-_Terence%2C_Works.jpg/440px-Houghton_Inc_473_-_Terence%2C_Works.jpg 2x" width="220" /></a>
<div class="thumbcaption">
<div class="magnify">
<p>In Terence&#39;s plays, young noblemen dally with prostitutes or mistresses even as their fathers insist that they marry more respectable ladies.&#0160;Plots, often contrived by the dull hero&#39;s wily slave, fail to come to fruition because the conspirators are carelessly overheard. Sometimes apparently unrelated women (one rich, the other poor), turn out to be sisters. Sham marriages and double-dealing are frequent. It is not uncommon that sons discover by accident, in the last scene of the play, the identities of their biological fathers. When there are plans to destroy female infants, the girls are rescued and raised secretly, only to come forward as beauties at a critical juncture of the plot. Young noblemen are prone to breaking into the houses of pimps to carry off the girls they love. Generally, plays end with multiple and suitable marriages, the old folks outwitted and the youngsters carrying the day. Slaves are freed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, characters coin memorable aphorisms&#0160;in succinct, elegant Latin.&#0160;Everyone knows&#0160;&quot;<em>Homo sum, nihil a me alienum puto</em>&quot; &#0160;-- I am a man, nothing human is alien to me. &#0160;But also q<em>uot homines tot sententiae: suus cuique mos --&#0160;</em>So many men, as many opinions; to each his own way. And &quot;f<em>ortis fortuna adiuvat&quot; --&#0160;</em> fortune favors the brave. &#0160;And &quot;nullumst iam dictum quod nos dictum sit prius&quot; --nothing new is said that has not been said before. And &quot;a<em>mantium irae amoris integratio est&quot; --&#0160;</em>lover&#39;s quarrels are the renewal of love.</p>
<p>But with all these comic goings-on and witty sayings, there was not one moment that I can remember when Professor James Hutton laughed or smiled or indicated in the least that the plays were clever or amusing. Instead, we discussed grammatical questions with much emphasis on the differences between second century and first century Latin. Dry as dust, it was. The opportunity to find the common humanity of ancient Romans and 1950s Cornellians was missed, even shirked.</p>
<p>Terence&#39;s louche and lively plots must have posed a problem for Professor Hutton; Catullus&#0160;of Verona,&#0160;a poet of love and sex and bawdy, could only have caused even more of a difficulty. In the edition in which we read Catullus, a drab gray book which must have dated from the early part of the century, certain of the more scabrous poems were omitted but, in a moment of confused prudery, printed -- in a smaller font --in an appendix. I suspect that they were also bowdlerized. Some of the words that Catullus used in his freer verse were not to be found in our dictionary, which had also been cleansed. And in a translation that I consulted (was it the Loeb?) the offending poems did appear, but&#0160;only in Italian. Was the idea that if anyone could read Italian he must be sophisticated enough to deal with Catullan pornography. Perhaps my readers think that I&#39;m fantasizing or imagining this half-hearted censorship, but it&#39;s as true as true. Swear.</p>
<p>Even after all these years, two of Catullus&#39;s poems stay in my mind.&#0160;The best, the most frequently republished and the most influential is known to classicists as Catullus 5. It&#39;s a remarkable poem. Here&#39;s the Latin, which is not difficult.</p>
<p>Vivamus, mea Lesbia, atque amemus</p>
<p>Rumoresque senum severiorum</p>
<p>omnes unius aestimemus assis.</p>
<p>Soles occidere et redire possunt;</p>
<p>nobis, cum semel occidit brevis lux</p>
<p>Nox est perpetua una dormienda</p>
<p>da mi basia mille, deinde centum</p>
<p>dein mille altera, dein secunda centum</p>
<p>deinde com milia multa fecerimus</p>
<p>conturbabimus illa, ne sciamus,&#0160;</p>
<p>aut ne quis malus invidere possitor</p>
<p>cum tantum sciat esse basiorum.</p>
<p>And here&#39;s a translation. &quot;Let us live, my Lesbia, and love. The gossipings&#0160;of stern old men let us value at just one penny. &#0160;Suns may set and rise again, but us, when once the brief light has set, night is one perpetual sleep. Give me a thousand kisses, then a hundred, then another thousand, then a second hundred, then yet another thousand, then a hundred, then when we have counted up many thousands, let us shake [the abacus] lest some evil man be envious when he knows how many kisses there were.&quot;&#0160;That is to say, Let us keep on making love no matter what the old envious guys think. (Lesbia has nothing to do with lesbians; it&#39;s just code for the name of the married woman with whom Catullus was sleeping.) &#0160;</p>
<p>I have no recollection of any discussion of this peach of a poem in 1958. Perhaps we talked about the ingenious lux/Nox juxtaposition, but I am sure we didn&#39;t touch on either the boasted adultery or the joys of sex. We were still in the last gasp of Victoriana. We were pre-Beatles, pre-Kennedy, pre-readily available contraceptives. Some things were not to be discussed.&#0160;</p>
<p>The other poem that stands in my memory is Catullus 61, a joyous epithalamion (or marriage song) which celebrates, with great gusto, the wedding of Vinia and Manlius. It is sensual and almost hypnotic. It&#39;s frankness about sexual pleasure pleased me in 1958, when such things were rare. Still pleases me.</p>
<p>But what about the omitted poems, the ones too &quot;coarse&quot; for our tender eyes and ears? &#0160;How would James Hutton have dealt with them. Not at all, of course. But now, censorship and self-censorship and propriety eased, we can read the poem that begins <em>Paedicabo ego vos et irrumabo</em>. which I can now translate as &quot;I will fuck you in the ass and then fuck you in the face.&quot; And goes on from there. Not part of the 1958 curriculum. In Professor Hutton&#39;s class, we were more comfortable discussing a synezis of the genitive than any exercise of the genitalia.</p>
<p>But I wonder, now, about, James Hutton, at home after a hard day of declining and conjugating, at dinner with his mother and his bachelor roommate. What did Professor Hutton think about Catullus&#39;s &quot;<em>paedicabo ego vos et irrumabo&quot;.</em></p>
<p>This I know: whether repelled or offended or secretly sympathetic, he certainly did not share his feelings with his students.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>The twins and their older brother came to visit and were playing their favorite new game, &quot;hide the goose.&quot; The goose? &#0160;a two foot tall hollow plastic replica perhaps originally a lawn ornament, now an excellent child&#39;s toy. Easy to find. After the hiding game&#0160;had gone on long enough, and was just starting to become a trifle rambunctious, I tried to signal to my fellow student of Italian that the time had come for the goose to retire for the day -- but try as I might, I couldn&#39;t come up with a translation for the word goose. Later, after the lads had left, I looked in the Italian dictionary for&#0160;&quot;goose.&quot;&#0160;<em>Oca</em>, it said.<em>&#0160;</em>A strange, unanticipated word. &#0160;</p>
<p>I tried to recall the Latin word for goose. Nothing. But after several hours (and here comes the point of the story), a word suddenly floated to the surface -- <em>anser</em>. Let me tell you now, fans of Dr. Metablog, that I was exceedingly proud of myself. Fifty-five years or so after my last study of Latin, out popped <em>anser.&#0160;</em>Self-celebration knew no bounds.</p>
<p>After I had stopped crowing about my triumph, I started to marvel at the brain -- not just my brain, but any brain. In what corner of the brain, in what concatenation of synapses, had the word <em>anser</em> been lurking&#0160;lo these many decades. And what sort of ingenious search program needed only a few hours to ferret it out? <em>&#0160;</em>Glaciers have melted, rivers have changed their course, and yet anser remained unchanged, permanently embedded somewhere in my brain. It&#39;s kind of miraculous, isn&#39;t it?</p>
<p>So how did Italian acquire <em>oca</em>&#0160;rather than a word descended from <em>anser.&#0160;</em>Why not *asse, for example. My dictionary of classical Latin offers no alternative to <em>anser</em>, but&#0160;the&#0160;Italian etymological dictionary explains that the late Latin word for goose was&#0160;<em>auca,&#0160;</em>derived from a diminutive a<em>ucellus</em> of <em>avis</em> (bird) and it cites as cognates old French <em>oue</em> and Occitan <em>auca</em>. No doubt demotic auca replaced the &quot;book word&quot; anser sometime in late antiquity. &#0160;</p>
<p>The result of this investigation: next time, I will be able to say, with great authority, &quot;nascondi l&#39;oca.&quot;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I&#39;m most fond of the gasplant, also called fraxinella or dittany or, when formality is called for,&#0160;<em>dictamnus albus.&#0160;</em>It&#39;s a beautiful plant. In flower it&#39;s an ornament to the perennial garden, and even when it&#39;s done blooming, it&#39;s neat and orderly and retains a lovely shade of green throughout the summer. Smells good too. It&#39;s a long-lived perennial, very hardy. It takes a number of years to establish itself, but then lives almost indefinitely. If you have one, you treasure it. I have two, both of which I took from the garden of my late sister Phyllis when she died in 1998. Or should I say I had two, because over the winter one of them went missing. &#0160;</p>
<p>In the location where there should have been and always has been a fully-mature gasplant, there was nothing -- not a leaf, not a twig, not a root. If the plant had died, it would have left some evidence behind. It&#39;s a woody plant which dies back to the ground each year, so every spring there is a bundle of dry hollow stalks or kexes. But this year nothing. Not a shred.</p>
<p>What happened to Mr. Dittany. Here&#39;s a possibility. I transplanted him, put him somewhere else, and then forgot that I had done so. An unlikely possibility. I searched my brain but can&#39;t&#39; recall moving it. I searched the grounds -- no luck. If it wasn&#39;t me, was it someone else? &#0160;Did some malefactor steal the gasplant? &#0160;I have never heard of a gang of perennial thieves. Is it possible to believe that a nefarious individual entered the garden while I was away and heisted an out-of-season gasplant, roots and all? &#0160;Not an hypothesis I can much credit. Did the plant have enemies? If it&#39;s being held for ransom, I have yet to receive the note. &quot;We have your fraxinella. Either fork over $14.99 or we&#39;ll mow it.&quot;</p>
<p>Another possibility: there never was a dittany. It was&#0160;always&#0160;a hallucination of my decaying brain. Nope, no go. It&#39;s been in the same place for years. Many people have seen it. I show it off -- it&#39;s so dramatic, so striking.&#0160;</p>
<p>Or perhaps, it&#39;s a plot against me. Am I being gaslighted? &#0160;With a gasplant? &#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>1) &#0160;&quot;My husband&#39;s niece, his sister&#39;s daughter, has been staying with us. She&#39;s nineteen just about to turn twenty. For a couple of months now. She&#39;s working on her English --the family is Finnish. She&#39;s also enjoying the local social scene; she&#39;s out a lot a night, but that&#39;s not a problem. She&#39;s old enough to be on her own. She&#39;s a nice girl, I thought, a good girl, kind of pretty in a northern way. She helps out with the kids if I ask her. I had no complaint until I started to notice that money was disappearing. At first, I thought I was crazy, but I did a couple of experiments to make sure. I left my purse with the wallet inside it &#0160;in a place where only Anniki could access it. I counted the money carefully. Sure enough, when I came back a $20 was missing. I calculate she must have taken about $300 so far. What should I do? &#0160;I can&#39;t ignore it. I could hide my purse, hide the money, but either she&#39;d find it or she&#39;d know that I knew. I have to tell my husband. I mean, it&#39;s his responsibility, isn&#39;t it? &#0160;I don&#39;t care so much about the money, but I think, yes, she should reimburse me. And she needs to know that she&#39;s on a wrong path. She&#39;s too old for this. I think we should sent her back to Finland, tail between her legs. She needs to learn a lesson.&quot;</p>
<p>2) &#0160;&quot;I went back to South Dakota, haven&#39;t been there in a number of years, maybe three or four. I have second cousin, he&#39;s in his sixties. A decent guy, runs a wrecking service. Hard worker, no employees. Up all night sometimes. Twenty years ago, his son, Jake Leath Percy married this lady from Oregon. She got pregnant, had a baby, then skipped. No one ever saw her again. Returned to Oregon, we speculate. Left the baby with Jake Leath. Well, Jake Leath proved to be as incapable as his wife. On the road a lot. So my cousin Herb Percy kind of adopted the child. He was a big kid for his age, didn&#39;t do particularly well in school, but not a real trouble-maker. Herb did right by him. But then, and here I&#39;m unclear about the details, they did some sort of DNA testing, I don&#39;t know why exactly,&#0160;&#0160;and it turns out the kid isn&#39;t a Percy at all. Not biologically related to Herb&#39;s son. She was pregnant by someone else. Not a surprise, if you think about it. A cowbird kind of situation. But Herb brought him up, feels responsible. Doesn&#39;t really like him so much, I think. He&#39;s six-four, takes up a lot of room in the trailer. Drinks beer. And now it turns out he likes to start fires.&quot;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I am a bad sleeper. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m technically an insomniac but I can say in all honestly that for me, the nighttime is the hardest part of the day. It&#39;s been this way for a long time. I&#39;&#39;m good at going to sleep and I enjoy the &quot;first sleep&quot; of two or three hours, but after that, say from 2 am on, it&#39;s an adventure. Nightmares, tossing and turning, &quot;fluff in the lung and a feverish tongue,&quot; and mostly what I think of as &quot;airplane sleep&quot; -- that is, the kind of semi-sleep, semi-awake borderline limbo which you&#39;re in when you&#39;re sitting up in a crowded plane.</p>
<p>Moreover, things start to look mighty bleak in the 2-5 part of the morning. Is that pain in my toe a bruise, or is it the beginning phase of gout or neuropathy? Cancer of the instep? Will they want to amputate my leg at the knee?</p>
<p>Not so in the 1950s. Return we now to those days of yesteryear and recall the most glorious sleepings of my life. I&#39;m in my teens, and it&#39;s spring. A weekend. I spend the morning at the PS 217 schoolyard, playing basketball. I&#39;m tireless once I get my second wind. After four or five hours, I drag myself home for a roast beef dinner, stuff myself. Then I lie down, turn on the radio and listen to Red Barber and Connie Desmond broadcast the Dodgers game (if it&#39;s Sunday, perhaps a double-header). By the second inning, I&#39;m deep in the arms of Morpheus. Profound. Incomparable. A sleep beyond ordinary sleep. When I wake, it&#39;s the seventh inning. I&#39;ve been in sleeptopia for two hours.</p>
<p>Where are the sleeps of old time?&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p class="ecxMsoNormal">Althea Goss Pearlman, 76,&#0160;of Boulder, died February&#0160;10, 2016&#0160;at AltaVita&#0160;Memory Care Centre in&#0160;Longmont where she had resided for the last two and a half years.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal">&#0160;<br />Althea was born in Paterson, New Jersey in 1939 to Daniel Goss and Anne Krull Goss, both teachers of mathematics. She was raised in Utica, New York and graduated as valedictorian from Utica Free Academy in 1956. She held degrees in mathematics from Cornell University (where she was elected to Phi Beta Kappa) and Harvard University. She married Elihu Hessel Pearlman, whom she had met in a first-semester chemistry class, in June, 1960.</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal">&#0160;&#0160;<br />Althea had many interests but her life revolved around her two passions: teaching and family. Althea taught mathematics at Ithaca High School in Ithaca, New York, at Warren Junior High School and Newton South High School in Newton, Massachusetts, at the City College, CUNY, in New York City, at Platt Junior High School in Boulder and, for twenty years, at Boulder High School. In 1991-92, she was an Einstein Congressional Fellow in Washington, D.C, serving as an advisor to the House of Representatives on mathematics teaching. She also spent four years as a Clinical Professor in the School of Education at the University of Colorado, Boulder, where she acted as a mentor and coach to prospective teachers. For Althea, teaching was not a job or a profession, but a calling. She was an artist whose medium was chalk and blackboard. She accumulated a wall full of teaching awards, including, most notably, the Presidential Award for the Teaching of Science and Mathematics (1987), but was most gratified not by certificates but by appreciative letters from students whose lives she had influenced.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal"><br />Althea was an excellent and loving wife, mother, and grandmother. She is survived by her husband, with whom she enjoyed a deep, spirited, and ever-evolving love for more than half a century, by her children Nathaniel, Benjamin and Eve, by their spouses Connie Chang, Kyla Holcomb Pearlman, and Jonathan Soglin, by her seven grandchildren: Talia and Oliver Soglin of Alameda, California, Ella and Lola Pearlman-Chang of Washington DC, Luke, Caleb and Asher Pearlman of Boulder; and by her sister Paula Goss Gombas and husband Allen Gombas of Lyman, New Hampshire. Althea&#39;s sister Phyllis Goss Murray died in 1998.</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal">&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;<br />Althea&#39;s ashes will be buried in the family cemetery in West Bradford, Vermont.&#0160; A memorial event in her honor will take place in the auditorium of Casey Middle School, 1401 High Street, on Saturday, March 5, at 3:00 P. M.</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal">The family would&#0160;like to thank&#0160;the&#0160;skilled&#0160;and sympathetic caregivers at&#0160;AltaVita and at New Century Hospice who made Althea&#39;s last years as&#0160;comfortable&#0160;as possible.</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal">Should anyone wish&#0160;to make a gift&#0160;in Althea&#39;s honor, the family recommends the Althea Pearlman Memorial Fund at Boulder High School.&#0160;Checks should be made out to Treasurer, Boulder High School (at 1604 Arapahoe Avenue, Boulder, Colorado 80302) and designated &quot;Pearlman Memorial.&quot;&#0160;A scholarship will be awarded annually to an outstanding student of mathematics.&#0160;</p>
