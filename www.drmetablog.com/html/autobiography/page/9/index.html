                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Folks who know me know that I&#39;m not an imaginative or inventive human being.&#0160;I&#39;m kind of dull, actually -- predictable, routinized, even humdrum. What most people don&#39;t know is that I have an extremely vivid and creative nighttime life. I dream big and&#0160;I dream weird.</p>
<p>Take last night for example (an ordinary night by my standards).&#0160;I was on my way by NYC subway to Ebbets Field to see a 7:30 pm Brooklyn Dodgers night game.&#0160;I was accompanied by my elderly, arthritic father (in the dream I was in my 20s or 30s).&#0160;For some reason the train took a wrong turn and instead of proceeding from DeKalb to Atlantic, took me and pop to Pacific Avenue. I couldn&#39;t figure how to find a train going back to DeKalb so we went out on the street to catch a cab. No cab would stop but a few people who were also lost decided to rent a limousine.&#0160;I was told that it would cost $50 apiece but I agreed because my father was having trouble walking.&#0160;However, when the limousine came, he and I had lost our way and the car pulled away without us.&#0160;The next thing I knew pop and I were in a railroad car (it seemed like a compartment in a European railroad and he was stretched out asleep and I had in my arms a very pretty baby, whom I identified as my sister Susan who died at age 9 months in 1938.&#0160;She was sweet and gurgling&#0160;until she let loose with a tremendous flood of shit which covered my pants and even flooded over to contaminate my father. &quot;Who diapered this baby,&quot; I shouted.&#0160;I had no equipment to clean the child or myself.&#0160;The conductor came over to help and offered to stop the train but then the baby girl started to spew a huge quantity of vomit all over me. I looked in her mouth and found a Band-Aid, which I removed, and then, looking once again, found a roll of gauze, which I also removed. And then, all of a sudden, I was no longer on the train but instead was visiting the home of George Bush (the elder, not W) in Houston.&#0160;I had been invited for dinner, but before dinner was to be served I had to coach a grandson or great-nephew of the former president in basketball, teaching him how to dunk.&#0160;Afterward we all sat down to dinner and I felt extremely awkward, wondering what would have caused Mr. Bush to invite me, a Democrat. One of the guests asked me if I ever shopped at Hill&#39;s In Bradford, Vermont and I had to report that Hill&#39;s had closed. Then I was asked if I had ever eaten at the salad bar in the old Greyhound station in White River Junction. I said that I had (it&#39;s true!!) and then&#0160;I woke up.</p>
<p>Man o&#39; man that was something else.&#0160; Several novels worth of material for someone with a daytime imagination, I should think.</p>

                                <p>Which translates as &quot;sleep is the image of death.&quot; It&#39;s a medieval commonplace: God has blessed us with sleep in order to prepare us for the long sleep of death. A daily premonitory death.&#0160;</p>
<p>I can&#39;t buy the theology.&#0160;However, I believe that there&#39;s genuine truth to <em>somnus imago mortis</em>.&#0160;</p>
<p>I&#39;m a bad sleeper, a tosser and turner.&#0160;A person who&#39;s likely to read fifty pages of a novel or watch a few innings of pre-recorded baseball between 2am and 3am.&#0160;Even when I sleep I rarely fall into that deep trance-like state that I remember from my childhood.&#0160;I&#39;m in a dream state or&#0160;I&#39;m far too&#0160;aware&#0160;of my body, my surroundings, my worries.</p>
<p>But a few years ago, when I had the&#0160;surgery, I was thoroughly anaesthetized into a dead sleep. Nothing happened between the administration of the drug and the moment I awakened:&#0160;no dreams, no thoughts, no awareness.&#0160;Nothing. I went away and I came back, but from nowhere.</p>
<p>Let me tell you what happened&#0160;when I returned&#0160;to consciousness.&#0160;I thought&#0160; &quot;wow, if that is what death is going to be like, then it&#39;s not so bad. It&#39;s nothing to worry about, nothing at all to fear.&quot;</p>
<p>And I&#39;ve held on to that insight.&#0160;Perhaps ordinary s<em>omnus</em> isn&#39;t the image of death, but drugged sleep is unquestionably&#0160;a state of being that&#0160;gives real rational secular practical meaning to ancient wisdom.&#0160;&#0160;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I hit a ball sharply to right field into the cosmos and made it safely to second base. (By &quot;cosmos&quot; I do not mean that I hit the ball into the universal void, but rather into&#0160;a patch of&#0160;cosmos i.e. <em>cosmos bipinnatus,&#0160;</em>the common herbaceous perennial that was growingly thickly against the stadium wall, something like the ivy at Wrigley.) I was standing on second, enjoying the applause of 80,000 spectators at the old Yankee Stadium, when my daughter-in-law suddenly appeared with her two-year-old toddler in tow and handed him to me, saying, &quot;you&#39;re in charge.&quot; She disappeared, so there I was on second holding the boy by the hand. I told him to stay put, but on the next pitch he broke for third, running as fast as his little legs could carry him. I called out to the shortstop, &quot;Now you&#39;re in charge.&quot; &#0160;At which point I cannot recall anything further, except that I tried to follow the boy to third but I could hardly run and it felt as though I was running through mucilage.</p>
<p>A curious dream. Dream professionals and analysts will no doubt be attracted by the claim to significance embodied in the word &quot;cosmos&quot; and by the dreamer&#39;s -- that is to say my -- transparent urge to shirk responsibility.</p>

                                <p>It&#39;s a little late in the day for me to embark on a career in pteridology. Too many ferns, too little time. There may be a backup option: intimate, private pteridophilia or even pteridomania.&#0160;</p>
<p>But in fact, empty enthusiasm is no substitute for knowledge. It&#39;s mortifying that after all these years of treading upon, admiring and sometimes even transplanting them, I know almost nothing about the <em>Ophioglassales</em> or the <em>Marattiale</em>s, the<em> Equisetums</em> (although I can identify&#0160;both the scouring rush and the horsetail), the <em>Hymenophyllales</em>, the <em>lygodium</em> (which climbs with a twining midrib), nor the aquatic <em>Salviniales. </em>And then there are the&#0160;twelve thousand&#0160;separate and individual species of <em>Polypodiale</em>s. Although I could not help being aware of polypody ferns -- they&#39;re all over the place, sparkling in the understory and thriving in forest clearings -- I could not name the name of a single one save the extremely distinctive and graceful maidenhair and the undistinguished plain (and poisonous) and absolutely ineradicable bracken.&#0160;</p>
<p>Nor, until I read Robbin Moran&#39;s enchanting <em>A Natural History of Ferns&#0160;</em>(Portland, OR, 2004) did I have a clear idea of how ferns reproduce.&#0160;Of course I was familiar with the&#0160;folklore upon which Shakespeare drew -- that the seed of the fern is invisible and confers invisibility.&#0160;There&#39;s a micro-debate on the truth of this imaginative idea&#0160;in an early scene&#0160;of <em>The First Part of Henry the Fourth</em>:</p>
<p><em>Gadshill</em>:&#0160; We steal as in a castle, cocksure; we have the receipt [i.e. recipe] of fern-seed, we walk invisible. &#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>To which the skeptical chamberlain replies, &quot;Nay, by my faith, I think you are more beholding to the night than to fern-seed for your walking invisible.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Our sometimes clever but often obtuse ancestors, knowing that all plant must have seeds, and that ferns didn&#39;t, jumped to the conclusion that fern seeds must be invisible. Well, there&#39;s a theory. It took a surprisingly long time for the truth to out. In fact ferns bear very small, sometimes even microscopic spores, visible, at best, as a fine dust. It was not until 1794 that John Lindsay noticed that the spores produced a tiny green growth, nor until 1848 that Michael Jerome Leszczyc-Suminski deployed his microscope to determine that these so-called prothalli produced male and female sexual parts, and that from the union of egg and motile sperm an embryonic plant with roots, leaves, and stems was produced.</p>
<p>It seems like an unnecessarily complicated way to reproduce, but let&#39;s not judge it harshly because it&#39;s worked very successfully for 345 million years, more or less.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Of all the many ferns of past and present, the one that I would most like to see with my own eyes fell by the evolutionary wayside 225 million years ago and is unlikely to be resurrected in some vegetable Jurassic Park. They&#39;re the giant lepidodendrons of the late Carboniferous, tree-size ferns that in the form of coal are very likely providing right now the power for your and my computer.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>One oddity of some lepidodendra &#0160;was that after fertilization they took an unusual (perhaps even unique) path. The plant&#39;s root aborted while the burgeoning shoot produced both the usual stem and also a downward-growing rooting organ -- not a true root though it anchored the plant, but a root-like system called a rhizomorph. Because the plant was a monocarp --that is, a plant that grows for many years until mature, then flowers, fruits and dies -- both the upside and the downside of the plant were, so to speak, term-limited. And because the stem went both up and down, above ground and below ground, it was remarkably symmetrical along the axis of the soil.&#0160;</p>
<p>I wonder how a forest of lepidodendra would have appeared to a modern eye. Very exotic, I imagine. Lepidoptera differed from modern trees in many ways, but particularly in that their trunks were green with chlorophyll rather than bark-brown. I think that a grove of them would have been littered with many uprooted or rather uprhizomorphed plants. Quite a jungle, I should imagine, and quite a delicious menu for the lumbering beasts who feasted upon it.&#0160;</p>

                                <p>&quot;Enough&quot; is a mighty peculiar looking word, but a good one nevertheless. It frequently shows up in older texts as &quot;enow.&quot; I don&#39;t know how the original medieval velar fricative signified by &quot;ough&quot; evolved into so many different pronunciations: e.g. although, through, hiccough, plough, rough.</p>
<p>My favorite enough proverb dates back to the fifteenth century, and is as pertinent now as then: &quot;enough is as good as a feast.&quot;&#0160; Our moralizing ancestors knew that &quot;the avaricious scraping together that knows no bounds&quot; was a vice, especially because it &quot;renders us unfeeling to the wants of others.&quot; Yes to a full belly, no to the excesses of the feast.</p>
<p>There&#39;s an oblique modern commentary on &quot;enough is as good as a feast&quot;&#0160;in Maxwell Anderson/John Huston&#39;s <em>Key Largo.&#0160;</em>The dialogue is notable and&#0160;familiar, especially when we call to mind that the gangster Johnny Rocco is played by&#0160;Edward G. Robinson and the war hero Frank McCloud is Humphrey Bogart.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<div>
<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000064/?ref_=tt_trv_qu">Johnny Rocco</a>: There&#39;s only one Johnny Rocco.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000859/?ref_=tt_trv_qu">James Temple</a>: How do you account for it?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000007/?ref_=tt_trv_qu">Frank McCloud</a>: He knows what he wants. Don&#39;t you, Rocco?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000064/?ref_=tt_trv_qu">Johnny Rocco</a>: Sure.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000859/?ref_=tt_trv_qu">James Temple</a>: What&#39;s that?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000007/?ref_=tt_trv_qu">Frank McCloud</a>: Tell him, Rocco.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000064/?ref_=tt_trv_qu">Johnny Rocco</a>: Well, I want uh ...</p>
<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000007/?ref_=tt_trv_qu">Frank McCloud</a>: He wants more, don&#39;t you, Rocco?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000064/?ref_=tt_trv_qu">Johnny Rocco</a>: Yeah. That&#39;s it. More. That&#39;s right! I want more!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000859/?ref_=tt_trv_qu">James Temple</a>: Will you ever get enough?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000007/?ref_=tt_trv_qu">Frank McCloud</a>: Will you, Rocco?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000064/?ref_=tt_trv_qu">Johnny Rocco</a>: Well, I never have. No, I guess I won&#39;t.</p>
<p>So there it is -- a nice contrast between &quot;enough&quot; and &quot;more&quot;.&#0160; And instructive, I think, in this day and age when our one-percenters&#0160;seem to want more and more, and are incapable of grasping&#0160;that &quot;enough is enough.&quot;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>When I taught Shakespeare for the first time, at CCNY in the mid-60s, fresh out of graduate school, I was mightily unprepared. I set myself the challenge of teaching a new play every week for thirty weeks. So every weekend I would tackle a play that I had read but not studied and then MWF try to explain it to my unwilling cherubs. I learned a lot but I can&#39;t imagine that I was an effective instructor, struggling, as I was, to keep my academic head above water (and, by the way, deal with a colicky newborn at home).</p>
<p>But sometime during that first year I met Rose Zimbardo, who was teaching another section of the course, and it was from Rose that I began to learn my trade. She was a few significant years older than I, more experienced (and more imaginative as well). Rose invited me to go for lunch with her and her great friend Ed Quinn, who had recently completed, nominally with O. J. Campbell, but in fact all by himself, the still useful <em>Shakespeare Encyclopedia</em>. Quinn knew everything and Rose was chock full of theories about the plays, some sensible, some borderline daft, but all provocative. Lunches for me with Ed and Rose became a moveable seminar -- and it is not an exaggeration to say as valuable as another Ph. D. I was challenged, inspired.&#0160;</p>
<p>I lost that job (good fortune in the long run) and Rose moved on to Stony Brook. I didn&#39;t meet Ed Quinn for many years, when I encountered him at Boston hotel sometime in the 80s, and we had a moment to reminisce. I never set eyes on Rose again. But I thought about her and Ed often and I look back with fondness and gratitude for all they taught me.</p>
<p>Ed died a few years ago, a great loss.&#0160;And now Rose.</p>
<p>Last year, through the miracle of the internet, I was able to exchange a few emails with Rose. I hope I properly expressed my appreciation for all she had done for me. It was my intention to visit her the next time I found myself in California (she had retired to Davis, which she professed to loathe) as part of my farewell tour.Too late, alas.&#0160;</p>
<p>Rose was a fine scholar, an excellent teacher, and a great lady. Rest in peace, old friend.&#0160;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I enjoy&#0160;good relations with animal -- respectful,&#0160;sometimes even affectionate.&#0160;I remember with great fondness the many purring, playful&#0160;cats and kittens of my youth. I was once very taken with&#0160;a calf named September and, I confess, almost in love with the matriarch of a small herd of Morgans, a&#0160;lovely lady named Gillian.&#0160;The twin Nigerian dwarf goats, Orville and Wilbur, were, I think, special friends. But for some reason I&#39;ve never taken to dogs, even though I know the story&#0160;about dog/human&#0160;co-evolution. Doggy dogs are moderately acceptable, but the&#0160;various special&#0160;breeds of dogs, dog-show dogs,&#0160;seem to me to be freaks and monstrosities. We should have left them as wolves and not meddled.</p>
<p>Of all the various teratological breeds my least favorites are the ones who have been hybridized into snoutlessness.&#0160;Dogs deserve and need a snout.</p>
<p>I was once attacked by a snoutless ugly bulldog; its owner, who, incidentally, had quite a snout himself, instead of apologizing profusely, made the utterly unjustified claim that I had provoked the attack. The incident reinforced my prejudice against bulldogs. It&#39;s not just that bulldogs are aggressive; let&#39;s make no bones about it, it&#39;s that for some inexplicable perverse reason they&#39;ve been bred to be hideous. A travesty of a dog.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I was startled to read the following paragraph in Richard C. Francis&#39; new book on domestication of animals (<em>Domesticated</em>, <em>Evolution in a Man-Made World</em>, 2015):</p>
<p>The squashed face carries a heavy cost in and of itself. It starts with breathing problems. The shortened snout causes the soft palate to bunch up in front of the trachea in a way that impedes airflow. Since panting is the primary way for dogs to cool, bulldogs are also vulnerable to death by overheating. The mouth of a bulldog is also too small to accommodate its teeth, so they are crowded and grow at odd angles, trapping food debris. Gum disease is rampant. A bulldog&#39;s eyes don&#39;t seat properly In the skull and can pop out, even from straining at a leash. Often the eyelids cannot close completely, resulting in irritations and infection. The excessive skin folds often become infected. Perhaps most telling, the bulldog&#39;s head has become too large to pass through the birth canal; most births require Caesarean section.</p>
<p>Big mistake, the bulldog.&#0160;We humans should have learned to leave well enough alone.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>When I was a boy, the word boob denoted a simpleton, a nincompoop-- what Shakespeare calls a mooncalf and what in an earlier life I might have called a schmuck or a schmendrick. &quot;Boobs&quot; was an everyday expression; so common and pervasive that The Three Stooges might just as easily have been called the The Three Boobs. There were other related uses of the word; &quot;booby hatch&quot; -- a semi-humorous appellation for what was formerly called an insane asylum, and also the &quot;boob-tube&quot; -- though whether the boob in that doublet denoted the machine itself or the schmendricks who stared at it was never clear to me. But at some point in my linguistic career the word &quot;boob&quot; re-emerged with a new primary signification. It now seems to have become the most common word for the female breast.</p>
<p>I do not like&#0160;it when a breast is called a boob.&#0160;It is disrespectful.&#0160;A breast is soft and nurturing but&#0160;also erotic and enticing.&#0160;A boob is neither;&#0160;it is a denatured object, stripped of its warm associations and joined instead to foolishness and&#0160;boobery.&#0160;&quot;Boob&quot; is&#0160;a deliberately unsexual and undignified term. It is also, as Shakespeare says in a&#0160;different context,&#0160;&quot;base, vulgar and popular.&quot;</p>
<p>And available. If a person should happen to google the word &quot;boob,&quot; perhaps searching for information of an etymological kind, the first, second, third and perhaps hundredth entry that he or she will encounter is for &quot;boob selfies.&quot; A &quot;boob selfie,&quot; for readers equally as naïve as me, is a photograph which a woman takes of her boobs and posts on the internet.</p>
<p>Jane Austen did not do this. Neither did George Eliot. I can&#39;t demonstrate that the word &quot;boob&#39; is responsible for such a decadent display of immodesty, but I do note that phrases such as &quot;breast selfies&quot; or &quot;bosom selfies&quot; are inconceivable.&#0160;</p>
<p>Nor did suicidal Cleopatra, when bringing the venomous asp to her breast, say &quot;Peace, peace/ Dost thou not see my baby at my boob/ That sucks the nurse asleep.&quot;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I&#39;m devoutly secular, just as I was raised. Moreover, almost all of my friends are equally unreligious: either retired Catholics or atheist Jews or freethinkers or lapsed UU&#39;s or never-wases. I was therefore taken aback and a bit unsettled last week when at a friend and neighbor&#39;s dinner party, just as the guests were starting to dig in, we all paused for a moment and held hands while the head of the household thanked the Lord for providing. It was a brief and inoffensive grace but still startling because so unfamiliar. I had momentarily stepped into another world.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>And then I thought, if I were preparing&#0160;to deliver a &quot;grace&quot; before a meal, what would I say?&#0160; Who would I thank?&#0160; For I readily confess&#0160;that I feel great gratitude every time that I lift a loaded fork to my hungry, salivating&#0160;mouth.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>To begin, I wouldn&#39;t thank any god or gods, because I don&#39;t see the least evidence or sign of the supernatural around the table.&#0160;No god of the&#0160;beets or the chicken or the lasagna.</p>
<p>Instead, I would thank, sincerely and reverently, all the people, present and past, who have in fact made a real and palpable contribution to the meal. Let us think for a moment about the slice of bread. While I could not detect the real presence of anything transcendent, yet the bread was immanent with the labor of the farmer. And the trucker who delivered the fertilizer and the trucker who took the wheat to market. And the guys at the John Deere factory in Moline who made the tractor that harvested all the seven grains in my particular slice. And the baker. Road builders. And for that matter, now that I think about it, how about our intelligent Neolithic ancestors who first spotted the einkorn or emmer and decided that it was a plant worth domesticating. Moreover, the butter that I lavished on the bread did not arrive by flights of angels but through its own particular chain of development and distribution. And then the wine, the &quot;merry cheerer of the heart&quot; which wouldn&#39;t have cheered anyone&#39;s heart if someone hadn&#39;t mastered the technology not only of wine-making, but also of glass bottles. And I would also like to thank the furniture makers -- the designers, the carpenters, the turners -- because there would be no sitting at the table without their help. And therefore foresters and the manufacturers and inventors of chain saws. I could go on and on, but I think the sitters-down at my board would take my point. A moment&#39;s reflection reminds us that when we collect ourselves for dinner, we profit from the efforts and endeavors of not dozens but millions of people. Diachronic and synchronic, now and then.</p>
<p>It is to all of them that I offer my thanks, my <em>gratia</em>, my grace. And in doing so I acknowledge my continuing connection to all members of our wonderful, horrible species.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>

                                <p>Last night there was no moon and no clouds.&#0160;It was so bright and clear that I couldn&#39;t resist going out to take a gander at the stars.&#0160;It was, once again, a brilliant and dazzling spectacle.</p>
<p>I can never remember whether there are two hundred million or two hundred billion stars in the Milky Way.&#0160;Both numbers are so beyond my ability to grasp that I wonder whether it even matters.&#0160;But after marveling at the expanse of stars, I returned&#0160;to the computer and&#0160;did the research.&#0160;It&#39;s true and astonishing:&#0160;there are between 100 and 400 <em>billion </em>stars in our home galaxy. (The astronomers, I have to say, give themselves quite a bit of leeway.) And then I was reminded that there are an estimate hundred million galaxies in the known universe.</p>
<p>I was feeling mighty small, mighty intimidated.</p>
<p>After a while, I went upstairs to dip back into the book on human anatomy that I&#39;m struggling to read. Here&#39;s a fact that I should have known, but didn&#39;t: there are six <em>trillion </em>cells in the human body.&#0160;More or less.</p>
<p>That&#39;s a a lot of cells. And a lot of stars. If a trillion is a thousand billion, then there are a ten thousand times more cells in my own personal body than there are galaxies in the universe, which is an interesting but not particularly important statistic.&#0160;</p>
<p>I feel as though there is some important conclusion that I should draw from these numbers, but honestly I have nothing much to say beyond the usual awe -- that ordinary&#0160;feeling of insignificance and impermanence. It&#39;s not exactly news that I am merely a heap of cells in an obscure corner&#0160;of a&#0160;tiny planet of an undistinguished star&#0160;in a medium-size constellation.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>And yet, sitting by the pond this sunny afternoon, watching a pair of companionable ducks slowly swimming one after another, I have to say that this particular transitory conglomeration of cells has been&#0160;enjoying a mighty fine day.</p>

It&#39;s very difficult to know what to say to your friend. You want be sympathetic and consoling, and polite, but you just&#0160;can&#39;t find the right words. Perhaps the best you can do is to say nothing, just put your hand to your heart to indicate compassion, or give the guy or gal a sincere hug.</p>
<p>And here are some sentences that you should definitely avoid&#0160; --&#0160; all of them transcribed directly from real life.</p>
<p>1.&#0160; &quot;Think of it as a growth opportunity.&quot;</p>
<p>2.&#0160; &quot;My grandmother had Alzheimer&#39;s.&quot;</p>

                                <p>I know that I&#39;m not the only person in the world who&#39;s prone to snap judgments and easy stereotyping.&#0160; I say this in apology, because yesterday I was guilty of a spectacular misjudgement, a wildly incorrect speculation.&#0160; It&#39;s time to kneel on ground glass, to scourge myself (metaphorically speaking).</p>
<p>One of the attendees of a support group that I attend is a &quot;little old lady.&quot; Elderly, gray in complexion and attire. Wizened, juiceless. She looks as though nothing of any moment happened to her in all her eighty or eighty-five years. </p>
<p>Her husband, Steve, died last week. Here&#39;s the piece of her story that she revealed.&#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;I was Steve&#39;s third and fifth wife. He was an airline pilot, so we traveled together all over the world.&#0160; Steve had two children by his first wife; I had five children by my first husband. I had so many babies because they started to come in pairs. At his funeral I played some of the Bach preludes.&quot;</p>
<p>You, gentle imaginative readers, can fill in the blanks. There are many, several novelsworth, in fact, starting with the obvious question, &quot;who was wife number four; tell me about her?&quot;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Thomas Fairfax, a well-known nineteenth century lobster smack captain, wrote convincingly that &quot;lobsters are very good as an article of commerce, and pretty enough to look at, after they&#39;re boiled, but, as to eating them, I prefer castoff rubber shoes.&quot; George Hoag, a down-easterner, added that &quot;if them tourists want to come up from Boston and pay those prices, then, by Christ, let them. Damn fools. Lobsters, hell, they&#39;re big cockroaches, that&#39;s what they are. You won&#39;t catch me eating one, even if I could afford the damn things.&quot; Fairfax and Hoag may be two of the most honest men in the history of American commerce. Lobsters are loathsome, both in appearance and as culinary articles. The meat is stringy tasteless gristle. And inaccessible to boot. And messy to attack. How did modern &quot;sophisticates&quot; get themselves bamboozled into thinking that these big bugs of the sea should be considered a gourmet item. It boggles the healthy, balanced, sensible mind. Lobsters are hideous insect-like creatures. Who was the first addled individual who took a look at a lobster and said, &quot;looks good, I&#39;ll try it.&quot; Eeew.</p>
<p>Then there&#39;s the practice of immersing live lobsters in boiling water. Just remember to put your fingers in your ears while the poor creatures screech. Human beings degrade themselves morally and aesthetically when they lower themselves to such indifference. How can they torture a lobster and then pretend that the poor things are palatable.&#0160;</p>
<p>I&#39;ve eaten a couple, may all the gods of the sea forgive me. Before I reached the age of enlightenment I would go along to get along. I never pretended to enjoy them, but, petty conformist that I was, I would participate in the horrid feast. Now I&#39;d rather eat kale and tofu, tasteless trendy manifestations of liberal guilt, than violate my integrity with a severed claw or tail.</p>
<p>it&#39;s time for a moral revolution in America. Let&#39;s make a start by liberating the lobster.</p>

                                <p>On the mall, smoking, wheels (i.e. bicycles and skateboards), and pets are prohibited. Between forty and fifty signs and icons state the case very clearly. Nevertheless, the rules are often flouted.</p>
<p>Smokers are furtive: they can&#39;t help themselves even though they show, by their demeanor, that they are well aware that they&#39;re doing wrong. The bicyclists are apologetic. Skateboarders are oblivious, totally. The dog-owners are defiant. &quot;No bureaucrat is going to tell me where I can walk my dog.&quot; The beggars are entitled. This morning, one disheveled youth carried a sign that read &quot;Why lie?&#0160; I need to get fucked up.&quot; (I used occasionally to donate to our &quot;homeless&quot; until I was taught that meals are readily available and that the begged money goes to support alcohol and drug habits. Also I was taken aback when a man to whom I gave two quarters returned them to me, saying, &quot;I don&#39;t take coins&quot;.)&#0160; Some of the buskers are fine musicians and earn their one or five dollar bill but I think that there is something rather sad about their forced cheer.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the strolling young folks, holding hands and radiantly in love, are wonderful to behold, especially when there&#39;s a toddler or two trailing them. And I also enjoy watching the strolling old folks, fifty or more years into marriage, sometimes holding hands, sometimes wheelchairing it. Dyads of all ages and kinds cheer and encourage me.</p>

                                <p>A close relative has accused me of lacking spontaneity. Specifically, &quot;I doubt he ever did a spontaneous thing in his entire life.&quot;</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been mulling over this attack and I can think of at least three spontaneous actions that I have performed.&#0160; A) Frequently, in the middle of the afternoon, without forethought or planning, I take a nap.&#0160; B) And closely related, but certainly different, sometimes, waking up in the morning, I decide, spontaneously, to lie in bed for another hour or so. And C), just yesterday, when I trundled over to the Public Library to borrow the book on ancient dead languages that I had reserved, I spontaneously pulled a second book (on Neanderthals) off the shelf.&#0160;</p>
<p>Now if those aren&#39;t plain and distinct instances of spontaneity I don&#39;t know what.</p>
<p>Moreover, I am making a long list of spontaneous actions to perform in the near future.&#0160;</p>

                                <p>So far <a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2014/06/occupations-not-for-me-updated-edition.html" target="_self" title="">my list</a>&#0160;includes taxi-driver, trapeze artist, surgeon, dog-groomer, monk, and hostage. Here&#39;s another.&#0160;</p>
<p>Last week I had a room&#0160;on the twelfth floor of&#0160;a new downtown Brooklyn hotel. From my window I could watch a new skyscraper being assembled. The basic I-beam members were in place and&#0160;concrete floors and ceilings had been poured.&#0160;But the structure&#0160;lacked&#0160;external walls!!&#0160; Where there will&#0160;be walls sometime it the future, preferably before the building is leased and&#0160;inhabited, was what looked to be an&#0160;orange plastic mesh, perhaps reinforced with a thin cable or two.&#0160;From my vantage point, I could&#0160;could see right through to the interior of the building.&#0160;There men on aluminum stilts were spreading on the ceilings something that might have been plaster but was more likely some sort of curing preparation for raw concrete.&#0160;Let me make this clear:&#0160;men on stilts were plastering ceilings in rooms that had no exterior walls and where a slip or trip would send them plummeting&#0160;twelve stories to the hard sidewalk.&#0160;Frankly, I found it difficult to watch without vivid and&#0160;horrible imaginings flashing across my vulnerable brain.&#0160;So without hesitation I can add to the set of occupations in which I would fail ignomiously, stilt-walker in high-rise construction.&#0160;A terrifying way to make a living, especially for people like me, pre-frightened by heights.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I am inordinately fond of&#0160;mass extinctions.&#0160;I find them consoling.</p>
<p>The most recent mass extinction, the newly-famous Yucatan-comet-iridium K-T boundary event of&#0160;66 million years ago is one of my personal&#0160;favorites. To recall:&#0160;a comet six or seven miles in diameter, zooming along at 65,00 miles per hour and therefore generating a good bit of momentum, smacked into&#0160;what is now the Yucatan peninsula&#0160;with&#0160;the force of a heck of a large number&#0160;of&#0160;hydrogen bombs.&#0160;The impact produced&#0160;a crater that was initially&#0160;an astonishing 65 miles across and 18 miles deep, triggered massive earthquakes as well as tsunamis half a mile high, and briefly heated the earth&#39;s atmosphere to hundreds of degrees.&#0160;Within minutes, everything as far as&#0160;Illinois&#0160;became wasteland. Because of the blanket of smoke and dust, sunlight could not reach the earth, so temperatures plummeted, completely disrupting the world-wide chlorophyll-based food chain.&#0160;At the same time, downpours of acid rain corrosive&#0160;enough to dissolve rocks killed everything they&#0160;touched. A full 80% of the world&#39;s&#0160;animal&#0160;species disappeared -- along with half of all land plants.&#0160;</p>
<p>Although it must have been quite a show, it was not as thorough a disaster as the&#0160;Permian extinction (252 million years ago) which killed 95% of all living species, but it is, rather, comparable in scope&#0160;to the Ordovician extinction (444 million years ago), the Devonian&#0160;(375 million years ago) and the Triassic (201 million years ago).&#0160;It&#39;s no wonder that folks&#0160;in the know estimate that 99.9% of all the species that have ever existed have disappeared.</p>
<p>The knowledge that there will inevitably be another extinction helps to put our daily woes in perspective.&#0160;How can I worry about whether the grout should be &quot;Desert Sand&quot; or &quot;Forest Gray&quot; or whether my newest&#0160;skin thingy is benign or dangerous&#0160;when our species and the&#0160;cool green earth itself are doomed.&#0160;Judgment day is a-coming, whether in the form of another wayfaring comet, or a series of explosive volanoes, or the release of the nitrogen and carbon now sequestered in the permafrost, or some event entirely unpredictable. Something is going to happen, as sure as shooting.&#0160;Perhaps, some think, it&#39;s already happening.&#0160;</p>
<p>So that&#39;s one benefit of a mass extinction -- it helps you sleep well at night.&#0160;Why worry about trivialities?</p>
<p>And also:&#0160;if it weren&#39;t for the extinctions, we wouldn&#39;t be here at all.&#0160;If the dinosaurs hadn&#39;t been killed by the comet they would most likely&#0160;have continued to dominate the planet, and the&#0160;descendants of velociraptors and mosasaurs and thunder-lizards sure as heck weren&#39;t going to leave a lot of breathing room for&#0160;the proto-primates.</p>
<p>Extinctions are one of the many improbable accidents that got us here. Extinctions are jolly.&#0160;</p>

                                <p>We were playing punchball&#0160;on the&#0160;PS 217&#0160;&quot;big court.&quot;&#0160;It must have&#0160;been during school hours because Mrs. McGowan&#0160;(a fifth grade teacher) was the umpire&#0160;and the players included the entire population of the class, not just the regulars.&#0160;Michael Lurie, the least athletic student in the grade,&#0160;and perhaps in the entire borough, was told&#0160; to play third base, and obviously&#0160;unfamiliar with the game and with Billy Cox, stationed both feet directly on the white-painted&#0160;base.&#0160;Someone&#0160;hit (punched) the spaldeen&#0160;toward him and he froze, but the ball&#0160;landed&#0160;precisely&#0160;in his crotch, and lodged,&#0160;and after a bit he found it there and held it up.&#0160;We all knew that the&#0160;batter was out, but Mrs. McGowan, as ignorant as Michael Lurie, shouted, &quot;he caught it illegally&quot; and awarded&#0160;first base to the&#0160;batter.&#0160;I remember&#0160;that several of us protested, but&#0160;Mrs. Mc Gowan was adamant.<br />&#0160;<br />It was a miscarriage of justice.&#0160;A violation of the rules. The umpire was incompetent.&#0160;How could I ever trust authority again?&#0160;</p>

                                <p>My friend Mike, who is pushing eighty very hard, told me this story.&#0160;&quot;In the 1940s we lived in Sarasota, where the Red Sox held spring training.&#0160;I had had&#0160;rheumatic fever and my mother over-reacted and kept me in bed for years.&#0160;Nevertheless,&#0160;I was an altar boy and&#0160;I also would get out of the house&#0160;whenever I could to watch the Red Sox play -- Johnny Pesky, Johnny Doerr, Rudy York, Vern Stephens, Dom DiMaggio, and of course Ted Williams.&#0160;One day I talked to Ted Williams and asked him for an autograph.&#0160;He said he would bring&#0160;me a signed picture.&#0160;He did, but I wasn&#39;t at home.&#0160;Ted Williams came to my house and I wasn&#39;t there!!&#0160; My mother said, &#39;a very tall man came&#0160;by and gave me this for you. I told him you were at church.&#39;&#0160;I thought, how can I trust&#0160;a religion&#0160;that would let me be at church rather than at home when Ted Williams called.&#0160;That&#39;s when&#0160;I stopped believing.&quot;&#0160; It&#39;s a great story and I&#39;ve recorded it exactly as he told it.&#0160;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Here are some career paths that it&#39;s just as well I didn&#39;t tread.&#0160;Opportunities for failure and misery.</p>
<p>1. Taxi driver in a large city (especially a city that&#39;s not on a grid, such as Boston or London.&#0160; Even the DC-diagonals drive me nuts).&#0160; I&#39;ve earlier written about my incapacitating <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2006/09/geographical_dy.html">directional disability</a>, but I neglected to mention that I tend to get into a bit of a panic when I&#39;m lost --&#0160; I start driving much too fast and far too waywardly.&#0160;So, dear friends, imagine me a befuddled cabbie, sweating super-profusely, while the fares in back scream bloody murder when I take the exact wrong turn for the fourth consecutive time.&#0160;It would be a freakin&#39; nightmare.&#0160;Related occupations that won&#39;t work:&#0160;tour guide, wilderness guide, tracker.</p>
<p>2. Dog-groomer. I&#39;ve hinted at my lack of affection for doggies <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2006/01/my_campaign_for.html">before.</a>&#0160; I just don&#39;t think I&#39;d do a good job blow-drying Fido or brushing Fifi&#39;s teeth.&#0160;(Incidentally, I&#39;m joined in my prejudice against curs by gentle Will himself, whose references to canines are uniformly unfriendly: the superbly wicked sisters in <em>King Lear, </em>for example, are &quot;dog-hearted daughters.&quot;)&#0160; &#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>3. Trapeze artist. I&#39;m terrified of heights and I have absolutely no sense of rhythm.&#0160; Imagine me launching myself at just the right moment to catch my partner by the ankles. Related opportunity for ignominious disgrace: dance instructor.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>4.&#0160; Surgeon.&#0160;I&#39;m far too squeamish to be poking around in someone&#39;s innards. Even channel surfing has become a dangerous pastime since we accidentally acquired the live surgery channel.&#0160;Motto:&#0160; &quot;all gore, all the time.&quot;&#0160;I have to keep clicking that remote lest I accidentally pause at an open-heart moment.&#0160; The FCC should mandate a warning and a five-second delay:&#0160; &quot;Caution:&#0160;palpitating inner organs on view shortly.&quot;&#0160;Related non-opportunity:&#0160;veterinary surgeon.</p>
<p>5. Hostage. Chained to a bed somewhere in the &#39;stans wouldn&#39;t work for me. I must have my oatmeal every morning at 7 a.m., and I need to move my bowels shortly afterward. Moreover, if I don&#39;t eat lunch right on time, I get wicked headaches. Not to mention that I don&#39;t function well in rooms that are either too hot or too cold or not well ventilated, and I can&#39;t stand tobacco. On the whole, I&#39;d be a mighty cranky hostage.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>6. Monk. Poverty I could manage, I suppose. Chastity would be a struggle but with plain fare, isolation, and cold showers I might succeed (but why?). Obedience?&#0160; Never. Not a chance. Nope. Not for me.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I&#39;m late as usual getting in the vegetable garden.&#0160;After many years of adding manure and compost and leaves, the soil is soft and fluffy.&#0160;But every year, rocks and more rocks.&#0160; When I first started this garden in 1978, I was pulling out boulders;&#0160;then large stones, then small stones, now one-inch stones and pebbles.&#0160;Why do I continue to&#0160;do so?&#0160;</p>
<p>Because my father took the rocks out of his garden.&#0160;I remember once, as a small child, saying to him, &quot;Dad, you&#39;ll never get all the rocks out of your garden.&quot;&#0160; &quot;True enough, he replied, &quot;but I&#39;ll have fewer rocks&quot;&#0160; From which response I realized that he was not an idealist but a meliorist, as I&#0160;am. So every year, a new crop of rocks.&#0160;I put the rocks on the driveway, in the low spots where puddles accumulate after a rainstorm.&#0160; It&#39;s ridiculous, I know;&#0160; we order seven cubic yards of crushed&#0160;stone for the driveway every few years, so a bucket of rocks makes very little difference.&#0160; But if feels good to perform two useful services at once:&#0160; rocks out of the garden, rocks on the road.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I&#39;m not a good sleeper -- never have been. While I&#39;m very accomplished at <em>going</em> to sleep, I&#39;m deficient at staying there for the full eight hours.&#0160;By&#0160;two o&#39;clock in the morning, I&#39;m awake -- reading, watching a previously-recorded basketball or baseball game, or, more often, lying there with the body dormant but the mind in a frenzy about our doomed civilization and about&#0160;whether&#0160;my newest skin thingy&#0160;has already metastasized.&#0160;</p>
<p>So I decided that it was time for divine intervention.&#0160;</p>
<p>Surprisingly, there&#39;s&#0160;no patron saint of sleep. The closest is&#0160;St. Dymphna, but she&#39;s more properly, at least according to her website,&#0160;the saint of &quot;mental and nervous disorders.&quot;&#0160;Insomnia a nervous disorder?&#0160; I don&#39;t think so, but on the other hand, she works cheap.&#0160;To light a seven-day votive candle at her shrine in Massillon, Ohio costs&#0160;only $3.00 -- so what the heck.&#0160;And it can be done online,&#0160;via Paypal.&#0160;it&#39;s a bargain; why not give it a try?</p>
<p>Then there&#39;s St. Vitus, the patron saint of oversleeping, also not exactly my problem. But St. Vitus is a busy fellow, inasmuch as he&#39;s also the patron saint of actors, comedians, dancers, and epileptics when he&#39;s not busy warding off lightning strikes and fending off attacks by wild animals. He&#39;s kind of the go-to saint for all manner of things, but as far as i can tell, simple insomnia is not in his portfolio.</p>
<p>Inasmuch as I&#39;m even-handed about religions, I think I&#39;ll try Hypnos. who is billed as a genuine sleep god. Hypnos is the father of Morpheus (the god of dreams), brother of Thanatos (yes, that Thanatos) and the son of Nyx (night) and Erebus (the deity of darkness). Quite the family tree. In order to placate the entire group a three-buck candle would be clearly insufficient, even insulting. I figured better to go whole-hog and sacrifice a lamb. However, there are no lambs in my condo unit, and I was, frankly, afraid of making a mess, so I thought that &#0160;perhaps a lamb chop would do just as well. I mean, how would Hypnos know. So I checked the freezer and would you know it not a lamb chop to be found. However, I did manage to locate a couple of pork chops which I think will serve just as well. Tonight, I will eat them in honor of Hypnos. By the way, I make a nice sauce out of orange juice, soy sauce, and garam masala. I&#39;m hoping that honoring the deity will earn me a couple of good nights&#39; sleeps.</p>
<p>And as a&#0160;backup, I&#39;ll have 5 mg of ambien at hand.&#0160;</p>

                                <p>My 75th, my diamond jubilee, is coming up&#0160;in a few days, and it&#39;s about time that&#0160;family and friends gave serious thought to the celebration.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>When Queen Elizabeth II had her jubilee&#0160;just two years ago,&#0160;there was a specially-commissioned anthem, a service for two thousand folks at St. Paul&#39;s, an equestrian extravaganza (550 horses), a flotilla of schooners on the Thames, and something that involved&#0160;the lighting of 4000 beacons world-wide.&#0160;</p>
<div>
<div style="width: 222px;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Queen_at_the_Diamond_Jubilee.JPG"><img alt="" height="147" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Queen_at_the_Diamond_Jubilee.JPG/220px-Queen_at_the_Diamond_Jubilee.JPG" width="220" /></a></div>
</div>
<p>Frankly, a bit much.&#0160;A little over-the-top, if you know what&#0160;I mean.&#0160; Although&#0160;who can fail to admire&#0160; the hat.&#0160;</p>
<p>Last year, I suggested that a good choice for my birthday might be an Irish&#0160;&quot;starter&quot; <a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2013/01/birthday.html " target="_self" title="">castle.</a>&#0160; The year before that, I hinted at one or two ancient <a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2011/12/birthday.html" target="_self" title="">sculptures</a><a href="tp://www.drmetablog.com/2011/12/birthday.html " target="_self" title="">.</a>&#0160; But, disappointingly, there were no takers.&#0160;Birthdays number 73 and 74 were left unacknowledged -- to the shame of my fans.&#0160;</p>
<p>But here is an opportunity for redemption. Diamonds for the diamond jubilee. I would greatly appreciate a pair -- a singleton is tacky -- of those big hunking earrings that the professional athletes wear. They can be easily purchased, I understand, in the $900,000 to $1,100,000 range, depending on size and color.&#0160;</p>
<p>My only reluctance&#0160;is that piercing the&#0160;ears would violate the integrity of my body.&#0160;&#0160;Also, I&#39;m afraid of the pain.&#0160;So it&#39;s either pressure clips or ear-piercing under general anesthesia.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#39;t want to drop so precious&#0160;an ornament and then lose it forever when I vacuum the rug.&#0160;</p>
<p>Gosh, now I&#39;m worried if&#0160;I can afford the insurance.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I&#39;ve written before about <a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2006/10/occupations_not.html " target="_self">occupations that are not for me.&#0160;</a> Among them are tour guide&#0160;(because of my directional dyslexia), trapeze artist (i&#39;m terrified&#0160;of heights), surgeon (frightened of&#0160;gore), and dog groomer. I&#39;ve also discussed possible&#0160;options for future employment, such as my plan to become a&#0160;<a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2007/05/my_new_career.html " target="_self">power forward in the NBA</a>.&#0160;However, I&#39;m now starting to think that, what with my back acting up again,&#0160;and the NBA plagued with salary cap problems and an&#0160;influx of 7-foot tall Europeans, that&#0160;professional basketball might not be a realistic possibility.</p>
<p>But I have two new ideas. The first is to become a leader of a religious cult. I think I have what it takes: charisma, creativity, and ruthlessness. I haven&#39;t exactly come up with a theology yet, but if that Scientology guy could get away with Thetans and the &quot;clear,&quot; I feel that I could come up with something better. I&#39;m aiming for a system of belief in which participants deed over all their worldly goods to their leader, i.e. me. And also I&#39;d like a harem of willing maidens. I admit that some recent cult leaders have given the profession a black eye (David Koresh, Jim Jones, Charles Manson) but I have in mind something milder, something paternal or even grandpaternal. Less Kool-Aid, more chocolate milkshake.</p>
<p>A second idea:&#0160;hedge-fund&#0160;billionaire.&#0160;I admit that I don&#39;t know much about&#0160;hedge-funds, but I plan to get started&#0160;right away by reading the Wikipedia article.&#0160;How hard can it be?&#0160;It&#39;s not as though they manufacture&#0160;something&#0160;or invent anything.&#0160;And then, after you collect a&#0160;couple of billions, you get to have &quot;dark money,&quot; off-shore accounts, and your very own Super-Pac. This is a career&#0160;with no discernible&#0160;downside.&#0160;</p>

                                <p>The first (the most ordinary, the least wild):&#0160; I&#39;m sitting in a basketball stadium watching a game&#0160; (it&#39;s close to the end of the first half) when a fire drill is announced.&#0160;Everyone, including me and my &quot;date,&quot; a mysterious unknown woman whom my dreamatorium has conveniently supplied,&#0160;leaves their seats.&#0160;I&#39;m now outside but I&#39;m cold and I remember that I&#39;ve left behind my denim jacket. I return to my place&#0160;in the now-deserted&#0160;arena but no jacket.&#0160;Then I&#39;m outside again. I locate&#0160;my date and tell her about the missing denim.&#0160;She serenely rises from her squat to reveal that she&#39;s been sitting on the jacket.&#0160; I wonder:&#0160; did she try to steal it? &#0160;2) The scene shifts abruptly.&#0160;I&#39;m now back fifty years, in graduate school, and I&#39;ve been informed that a new requirement for the degree has been instituted.&#0160;Each semester, every student will have &#0160;to drink a 20 oz. paper cup&#0160;of a pink liquid (looks like Pepto-Bismol but is decidedly&#0160;more mucilaginous and nasty).&#0160; 3) All of a sudden i&#39;m being pursued by a huge scary rhinoceros with an ovesize horn.&#0160;I run, of course, terrified.&#0160;Fortunately, I come upon a cottage size stack of&#0160;carrots (large, grated, carefully arranged).&#0160;I&#39;m able to climb the pile, rather gracefully I think, but the rhino can&#39;t get any traction and I easily outdistance him.&#0160;I was scared for a while but the carrots saved my life.&#0160;Then I woke up.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Are there any interpreters of dreams out there?&#0160;&#0160;Clearly, Dr. M. needs your help.&#0160;(Do not bother using words like &quot;nutso&quot; or &quot;loco,&quot; please.&#0160; Serious interpretations only.)&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>And so we&#39;ve come to the end of&#0160;the &quot;holiday season&quot;&#0160;once again.</p>
<p>Another Christmas, another winter solstice, another St. Lucy&#39;s day with its deepest of midnights.&#0160;Even here in ever-sunny Colorado, things are a bit gloomy.&#0160;However, I have every confidence that another&#0160;spring is just around the corner. I don&#39;t need to bring greenery into the house in order to prevent&#0160;the dragon from swallowing the sun.&#0160;The days, now so abbreviated, will lengthen and in&#0160;five weeks we&#39;ll see the first crocuses and&#0160;a week later the daffodils and pussy-willows.&#0160;It&#39;s going to happen. But as always, the&#0160;last days&#0160;of the year challenge me.</p>
<p>I&#39;m relieved and happy that Christmas and the whole Christmas business is done and gone. No one wants to be a scrooge and I don&#39;t want to frown on carols and gift-giving and plum-puddings and good fellowship, but in my heart, let me confess, I don&#39;t like the holiday. I can&#39;t make sense of the virgin birth or the sacrifice of the only-begotten son. I don&#39;t even respect the story-- to me it&#39;s just dressed-up scapegoating. Moreover, Jesus&#39; revolutionary message about caring for the poor seems to be ignored or repudiated by Christianity&#39;s most vociferous advocates. And then there&#39;s all that incongruous stuff that has accreted around Christmas -- the hype and the commercialism and the religious chauvinism and the reindeer and the tactless triumphalism. It&#39;s both incomprehensible and offensive to me.</p>
<p>And I&#39;m in good company. I have allies.&#0160;Let&#0160;us&#0160;go back to the beginning of the American experience with Christmas.</p>
<p>If the profoundly religious seventeenth-century founders of our country had a single favorite Biblical moment, it&#39;s when the Lord (speaking through His prophet Amos) severely condemned the vanity of holidays. &quot;I hate,&quot; said the Lord, &quot;I despise your feast days, and I will not smell in your solemn assemblies.&quot; The Lord of Hosts specifically enjoined against the attempt to placate him by sacrificing animals (a matter of topical concern in Amos&#39;s time). &quot;Though ye offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings, I will not accept them; neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat beasts.&quot; Nor did He rest with these easy-to-follow injunctions, but He went on to condemn all musical tributes as well. Nor more chants, glees or carols: &quot;Take thou away from me the noise of thy songs; for I will not hear the melody of thy viols.&quot; Our Puritan forefathers recognized that the Lord opposed not only rituals and music but all formal observances and rote piety. The Ancient of Days was moved not by empty ceremony but by right action and good behavior. Instead of squeaking timbrels and sounding brass, why, &quot;let justice run down as waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream.&quot; Taking these uncompromising sentences as their guide, our founders dug in their heels against the ostentatious celebration of all holidays, especially Christmas.</p>
<p>I applaud the old guy, the Father, and I revere Amos. His mantra bears repeating: &quot;Let justice come down as the waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>The neglect of &quot;righteousness&quot; in favor of buying things makes me melancholy.&#0160;I would be happy to see fewer purchases and more good deeds.&#0160;It would help&#0160;us through the dark months.</p>
<p>The winter solstice is a sensitive time for me because it&#39;s the anniversary of my father&#39;s birthday. He arrived&#0160;to no poorer family on the planet on the darkest day of the year, the twenty-second of December, 1904.&#0160;‘And they called his name Emanuel, God with us,’ -- but whether by accident or design, I have no idea. My father lived a long and just life. He had many virtues -- one of them that he was the least materialistic person ever.&#0160;He had no possessions and craved none.&#0160;But he was righteous.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know how anyone could write a biography of Emanuel, my father. There was so little plot, so little conflict in his life. He went about his business, raised his family, kept to the straight and narrow. His memory is a blessing to us.</p>
<p>At this time of the year I turn once again to one of the most challenging&#0160;fathers in literature. The&#0160;voluminous works of Sir Edmund Gosse are not much read nowadays except by specialists in Edwardian literature, but <em>Father and Son</em> (1907) still stands as one of the world&#39;s&#0160;great autobiographies.&#0160;</p>
<p>The father in <em>Father and Son</em>&#0160;is the biologist Philip Henry Gosse, whom Charles Darwin once called &quot;an honest hod carrier of science.&quot;&#0160;The older Gosse&#0160;was a minister and a leader of the Plymouth Brethren, a very strict, very puritanical splinter&#0160;of English Protestantism --&#0160;one that could easily have taken Amos as its prophet and leader.&#0160;According to his son Edmund, P. H. Gosse held&#0160;that the celebration of Christmas was &quot;nothing less than an act of idolatry. The very word is Popish, [my father] used to exclaim, &#39;Christ&#39;s Mass!&#39; Then he would adduce the antiquity of the so-called feast, adapted from horrible heathen rites, and itself a soiled relic of the abominable Yule-Tide.&#0160;He would denounce the horrors of Christmas until it almost made me [that is, Philip Henry&#39;s&#0160;son&#0160;Edmund Gosse the autobiographer] blush to look at a holly berry.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>A passionate man, Philip Henry Gosse. A difficult father. Can we Imagine how Philip Henry Gosse would have suffered to behold a twentieth-century American Christmas: muzaked &quot;Silent Night&quot; in a shopping mall. Or even --horror of horrors --the odious, saccharine &quot;Little Drummer Boy.&quot; There&#39;s not a sappier song in all of creation.</p>
<p>In&#0160;<em>Father and Son,&#0160;</em>Sir Edmund recollects a Christmas of his youth.&#0160;One boyish&#0160;year he defied his father and, putting his immortal soul in danger, secretly ate some Christmas plum-pudding that had been offered to him by &#39;rebellious&#39; servants. But then, overcome with guilt and stomach-ache, he flew to his father, crying out &quot;Oh! Papa, Papa, I have eaten of flesh offered to idols!&quot; Philip Henry&#0160;then &quot;ran with me into the midst of the startled servants, seized what remained of the pudding,... and ran till we reached the dust-heap, when he flung the idolatrous confectionery on to the middle of the ashes, and then raked it deep down into the mass.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>A frightening episode for a nine-year-old -- but beautifully told.&#0160;Only&#0160;an accomplished writer of comedy&#0160;(and one who was steeped in Dickens) could have invented a phrase as marvelous as &quot;idolatrous confectionery,&quot; where the triviality of the noun undermines the high seriousness of the adjective.</p>
<p>Compared to Amos and to the Plymouth Brethren and to Philip Henry Gosse, my own resistance to Christmas is trivial. I&#39;m a dissenter, but a dissenter in moderation.</p>
<p>In fact, I&#39;m not even a Puritan --&#0160;I&#39;m delighted with the baked ham and the sweet potatoes. Moreover, I have devised a Christmas custom of my own. Every December 25,&#0160;I reserve three hours to listen to Handel&#39;s <em>Messiah --</em> not out of piety or reverence, but because the oratorio is so marvelous that it&#39;s almost -- almost -- sacred.</p>
<p>There are many <em>Messiahs</em>, but In our house, the performance of choice is, inevitably, the extremely intelligent Pearlman version (Boston Baroque Orchestra and Chorus-- Martin Pearlman, Conductor [Telarc 80322]). Blessings and honor and glory and hallelujahs be unto George Frederick Handel and unto his unsurpassed&#0160;oratorio.</p>
<p>So this year and every year: rejoice greatly but appropriately, ye sons and daughters of Zion!&#0160;</p>
