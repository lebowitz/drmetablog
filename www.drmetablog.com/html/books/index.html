                                <p>Chaucer&#39;s Pardoner, some will remember, has long blonde hair and speaks in a high treble voice. Chaucer calls him &quot;a gelding or a mare.&quot; A gelding is obviously a eunuch; what Chaucer means by mare is less clear -- perhaps &quot;female eunuch&quot; -- whatever that entails -- or a gay male or possibly even a woman cross-dressed as a man. In any case, a person of ambiguous sexuality -- &quot;gender fluid&quot; in modern idiom.&#0160;</p>
<p>Update: the Naval Academy Nimitz library at Annapolis has purged from its shelves a book by Robert S. Sturges called&#0160; &quot;Chaucer&#39;s Pardoner: Gender Theory.&quot; Isn&#39;t it reassuring that our national security will no longer be endangered by a discussion of the Pardoner&#39;s identity.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>After struggling through a run of mysterious and puzzling works, I&#39;m cheered to discover a book written by Cornell English faculty member that I could read with pleasure from beginning to end. And understand. And which alerted me to books and poems with which I was not familiar. No theory, no pretentious jargon; just honest scholarship and intelligent stylish analysis,&#0160;</p>
<p>It&#39;s <em>Facing the Abyss, American Literature and Culture in the 1940s</em>, by George Hutchinson, who is Cornell&#39;s Farr Professor of American Culture.</p>
<p>Unlike Professor Hutchinson, who is a considerably younger man, I myself was alive (although barely sentient) during the 1940s. I was too young for serious reading, so 1940s culture didn&#39;t come to my aluminum desk until the 1950s when I belatedly came to awareness. As a result, I read many of the books that Hutchinson discusses a decade past their relevance. Hutchinson also mentions many influential books that I didn&#39;t read at all and therefore came as a surprise -- and which underlined my ignorance. For example, during the 1950s, my high school and college years, I read many books of 1940s Jewish American writers to whom Hutchinson devotes a long chapter: Mailer, Bellow, Malamud, Rukeyser, Arthur Miller, etc. But my acquaintance was incomplete. I confess that I had never heard the names of Jo Sinclair or Isaac Rosenthal, both of whom Hutchinson scrutinizes at full. One name missing from Hutchinson&#39;s survey is J D Salinger, who started to publish in the 40s but only became famous with <em>Cather in the Rye</em> in 1951. Just as well -- I never caught Salinger fever although many of my friends were quite infected.&#0160;</p>
<p>Hutchinson has presented me with a reading list of books that I should have known but didn&#39;t and that will keep me engaged for months. I&#39;m grateful.</p>
<p>Hutchinson&#39;s chapter on WWII is most revelatory. Without being unduly partisan, it exposes and corrects the &quot;greatest generation&quot; mythology that I had half come to accept.&#0160;</p>
<p>After reading <em>Facing the Abyss</em>, I continued my investigation of Cornell English faculty publications by taking a couple of wild swings at Elizabeth S. Anker&#39;s mystifying<em> On Paradox</em>, <em>the</em> <em>Claims of Theory </em>(Duke UP, 2022). (Anker holds a joint appointment in Cornell&#39;s law school and its Department of Literature in English.) I can say just two things for certain about this difficult book: a) I didn&#39;t understand two consecutive sentences, and b) it&#39;s not about literature, not even tangentially. In fact, I&#39;m not sure what it&#39;s about -- as far as I can tell, it&#39;s not about the law. I have rarely attempted anything in English prose that I found quite so impenetrable. I never even grasped what Anker means by paradox.</p>
<p>I&#39;m sure it&#39;s <em>mea maxima culpa</em>, but so be it.&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>[April 4] PGB writes: &quot;Every time you post something, it becomes ever clearer that you&#39;re not the right person for this investigation. Give it up and stick to something within your abilities, like basketball. You write well on basketball. Do yourself a favor: stay away from the deeper issues that Anker discusses.&quot;</p>
<p>[April 4]&#0160; Vivian de St. Vrain responds: &quot;Perhaps you&#39;re right, PGB (whoever you are). The shoemaker should stick to his last. This Anker book is not intended for me, but I I wonder for whom it is intended. It&#39;s got to be an extremely small specialized audience. Six or eight people, worldwide. I doubt anyone on Cornell&#39;s English faculty then or now could make heads or tails of it.&quot;</p>
<p>[April 6]&#0160; Artie Greengroin writes: &quot;Thanks for hanging in there.&#0160; I hope you find other Cornell English Professors who know how to write English. I&#39;m not optimistic, though. BTW, I think PGB is harshing on you, but I agree that your basketball essays are pretty good.&quot;</p>
<p>[April 8] Vivian de St. Vrain responds: &quot;Thanks for the recommendation, Artie and PGB. If anyone is interested, my basketball essays are <a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/basketball/">here.</a></p>
<p>[April 9]&#0160; Charles Evans (Mercer College) writes: &quot;I agree. Vivian, your notes on basketball are quite good. But you&#39;re just not smart enough to understand philosophy.&quot;</p>
<p>[April 10] Joe J. Keen (Northwest Nazarene University, Nampa, Idaho) writes: &quot;I agree with Charles Evans. The basketball entries are amusing. But, Vivian, you&#39;re no philosopher.&quot;</p>
<p>[April 16] Vivian de St. Vrain writes: The &quot;Artie Greengroin&quot; who posted on April 6 does not exist. Artie Greengroin is not a real person; he&#39;s a character invented by the WWII novelist Harry Brown. Come on, Artie you can use your real name. Don&#39;t be afraid. Don&#39;t hide behind a pseudonym. We&#39;re all friends here.&quot;</p>
<p>[April 30]. Chester Bacon writes: &quot;Thanks for bringing the Hutchinson book to my attention.&#0160; I&#39;ve read and been enlightened by it. But following your recommendation I&#39;ll stay away from the Anker book. And I do like your basketball essays.&quot;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I first encountered the word &quot;text&quot; -- as did everyone else of my cohort -- as the first component of &quot;textbook.&quot; At P S 217, textbooks were issued on the first day of school. Then, later in the day, we ritually scissored brown paper grocery bags and improvised protective book covers. It was not unusual for the covers to be in better shape than the retirement-eligible books. At college, I was surprised to find that I was required to purchase my own textbooks -- a discovery that busted a hole in my precarious budget.&#0160;</p>
<p>And then the word &quot;text&quot; sat still for a number of years until it emerged as a term of art in critical theory. &quot;Text&quot; became a generic word for anything written: novels, poems, plays, signs, advertising slogans, tattoos -- anything that could be analyzed and discussed. I think, in retrospect, that the idea was not to &quot;privilege&quot; one form of writing over another. &quot;Text&quot; is to poem as &quot;provider&quot; is to doctor.</p>
<p>Nowadays, &quot;text&quot; has emerged from the gloom of academic criticism and has become the most frequently used of words. Who could have predicted it? I myself, formerly a writer of letters and postcards and until recently of emails, and for many years at one point a user of the telephone, now send and receive multiple &quot;texts&quot; in a day.</p>
<p>The noun has also acquired a variety of verb forms: &quot;I&#39;ll text you&quot;; &quot;I texted you&quot;;&#0160; &#0160;&quot;Text me when you arrive&quot;; &quot;Talk to you later.&#0160; I&#39;m texting.&quot;</p>
<p>All derived, ultimately, from L. <em>texere</em> textus, to weave; or textor, a weaver.</p>
<p>The use of &quot;text&quot; in religious ceremony, as in a cleric&#39;s, &quot;today&#39;s text is...&quot; has never been a part of my life.</p>

                                <p>Elisha Cohn is an associate professor in Cornell&#39;s Department of Literatures in English. Her <em>Still Life, Suspended Development in the</em> <em>Victorian Novel&#0160;</em>(2016) strikes me as two books in one. The first is quite lovely and filled with a variety of splendid <em>apercus.&#0160;</em>Cohn explores &quot;lyric moments&quot; in the novels (confession: I read closely only the chapter on Thomas Hardy, the novelist with whom I&#39;m most familiar). She observes that Hardy (a poet as well as a novelist) occasionally stops the progress of the story and allows his characters to experience a moment of stasis or reflection or reverie that is more a characteristic of lyric poetry than prose. I was much impressed by her analyses of these moments -- and wondered why I had failed to notice such events -- or non-events -- myself. So criticism did what it&#39;s supposed to do -- widens our understanding and appreciation of works of literature. I returned to the Victorian novel armed with a new way of seeing. In fact, I&#39;m now reading <em>Little Dorrit&#0160;</em>again for the express purpose of ascertaining whether a non-poet like Dickens employs the same S<em>till Life </em>method. So far, not the case -- Dickens has his own particular (and very successful) methods of expanding the consciousness of his characters.</p>
<p>Ah, but then there&#39;s the other side of Cohn&#39;s book which attempts to develop her useful insights within the slough of &quot;theory.&quot; I half suspect that Cohn felt obliged to make herself relevant or contemporary or tenure-worthy with her tumble into this quicksand -- but perhaps I&#39;m wrong. Perhaps she devoutly believes in an apparatus that I find so incomprehensible and transient. In this second part of the book, many famous names are invoked and admired; some of these are very French and very revered; others&#0160; are merely professors at American universities. Pages of text and footnotes defend against the horrid possibility that <em>Still Life</em> might be &quot;insufficiently theorized.&quot; And in these speculative paragraphs Cohn discusses the deprivilegization of hierarchical thought in favor of forms of lateralization in which individuations are impersonal and singularities are pre-individual and which reterritorialize along the lines of preexisting structures of power which re-consolidate into static concepts, etc., etc. Which is when I either descend into a reverie (or nightmare) of my own or hurl he book across the room.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>[February 23&#0160; Audrey ap Howell writes:&#0160; &quot;Vivian de St. Vrain, you&#39;ve go it wrong. The notion that there are poetic moments in the novels is well established. The originality of this book lies in its theorizing of these moments. You would know this if you had read carefully and not skimmed.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>[February 24] J C Occhiogrosso writes: &quot;This is a well-written book. Complicated but not obscure.&quot;</p>
<p>[February 25]&#0160; Reuben Musgrave writes:&#0160; &quot;I bet that Cohn is a delightful teacher -- if she keeps to the events in the novels and stays away from bewildering &#39;theory.&#39;&quot;</p>
<p>[February 25] Savannah Courtermanche writes:&#0160; &quot;All novelists pause the plot for moments of reflection. Nothing new here.&quot;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>[March 5]&#0160; Joy Jourgenson writes:&#0160; &quot;This difficult monograph would have been more useful as a series of short, insightful essays.&#0160; Too bad it had to be expanded into a repetitive static book. Not the author&#39;s fault -- just the tune of the times.&quot;</p>
<p>[March 6]&#0160; Eli Munn writes:&#0160; &quot;Vivian, you&#39;re too old and out of it to have an opinion worth anything. Shut it down and go back to your knitting.&quot;</p>
<p>[March 15] Rogers Roggen writes:&#0160; &quot;I wonder, Vivian, how you can work yourself up into such a snit about Cornell when the USA is going to hell in a handbasket. Shouldn&#39;t you put your effort into more pressing matters.&quot;</p>
<p>[March 18] Homer vanNess writes:&#0160; &quot;Reuben Musgrave, are you possibly the &quot;Cousin Rube&quot; that I heard my parents mention? I know there&#39;s a Musgrave branch to my family. (I found your name doing a random googlesearch). If you are Cousin Rube, could you pm me at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="7d150b1c1313180e0e3d1a101c1411531e1210">[email&#160;protected]</a>. I&#39;d love to hear from you. I think you went to Cornell; so did I but much later.&quot;</p>

                                <p>Vivian de St. Vrain writes: &quot;Cathy Caruth is the Frank H. T. Rhodes Professor of English at Cornell University. She has written quite a number of books but the one that I selected for this Cornell English Department project, partly because of its engaging title, is <em>Literature in the Ashes of History. </em>Alas, the title is misleading, because Caruth doesn&#39;t concern herself with literature in any recognizable way. Rather, the book investigates psychoanalytic theories, especially of loss and trauma. Although in an earlier part of my life I read and studied all of Freud&#39;s major works, I found this book to be far too subtle and abstruse for my downright brain. I have therefore asked assistance from my long time friend A. Barnett Langdale, Jr. Barney is a very smart medical school graduate, a therapist, and psychologist (though not a psychoanalyst) and a person for whose opinions I have great regard.&quot;</p>
<p>A. Barnett Langdale, Jr., writes: &quot;Thanks, Viv, for entrusting me with the of task of reading and evaluating this book. I fear that I shall disappoint you, because I had a hard time understanding <em>Literature in the Ashes of History. </em>In order to profit from reading this book, one must accept certain assumptions about Sigmund Freud and about the art of psychoanalysis. Caruth sets out to modify and reinterpret the famous f<span style="text-decoration: underline;">ort-da </span>episode in Freud&#39;s <em>Beyond the</em> <em>Pleasure Principle.</em> This became an immediate problem for me, because I have never agreed with Freud&#39;s analysis of his grandson&#39;s play -- perhaps because his interpretation clashes with what I have&#0160; learned from long years of closely observing children in my professional practice. Events such as <span style="text-decoration: underline;">fort-da</span> can generate a spectrum of meanings and a variety of interpretations equally as valid or invalid as Freud&#39;s. As I result, I read this book with a great deal of resistance to its assumptions and their ramifications.</p>
<p>Many of the arguments that Caruth creates (&quot;suggests&quot; is her usual verb) are too arcane for me. She carries her readers away from common sense. She inhabits an intellectual world in which every event or fact carries its own negation. And that negation bears a consequent negation, and so on <em>ad infinitum</em>, like the images in a pair of opposed mirrors, leading inevitably to a situation in which, as Macbeth says, &quot;function/ Is smothered in surmise and nothing is/ But what is not.&quot;</p>
<p>Vivian de St. Vrain responds: &#39;Many thanks, Barney. In the course of reading <em>Literature in the Ashes of History</em>, I came to think that its procedure is, in a sense, a lot like theology. If you make certain assumptions about god and angels and creation, you can generate a fantastically complicated superstructure of ideas that has absolutely no relations to the world in which we dwell. This book is not theology, it&#39;s psychoanalytic theory, but it shares a similar procedure, because, despite its highly-elaborated complexity, its assumptions are unprovable if not absolutely false. Intelligence and sophistication can take you only so far. I&#39;m afraid that in the end, there&#39;s no more heft in this kind of study than there is in theology -- the &quot;subject without an object.&quot; Ultimately, it&#39;s Cloud-Cuckoo-Land.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>[February 15] Walter Balletto writes: &quot;Before you dismiss this intelligent book out of hand, you might want to read the ecstatic review by Michael Levine in <em>The Undecidable Unconscious: A Journal of Deconstruction and Psychoanalysis.&#0160;</em>It&#39;s online. Levine makes the effort to read carefully, which neither you nor your friend Langdale do.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>[February 15] Vivian de St. Vrain responds: &quot;At first I thought that Mr. Balletto was being ironic, inventing an improbable self-parodic name for an academic journal. Who would believe there is actually such a publication? But I looked it up and, by golly, it&#39;s real. Moreover, it&#39;s published, <em>mirabile dictu</em>, by the University of Nebraska Press!!!&quot;</p>
<p>[February 16] Janet Rich asks: &quot;You haven&#39;t said anything about Caruth&#39;s presence in a Department of English. Shouldn&#39;t she relocate to Psychology?&quot;</p>
<p>[February 16] Herbert Lecovin (Cornell &#39;61) asks: &quot;I wonder how many of Caruth&#39;s colleagues can read and understand her work?&quot;</p>
<p>[February 16] Anita Robillard writes: &quot;Caruth is on an island, and instead of welcoming friends to join her, she erects walls and barricades to keep them out.&quot;</p>
<p>[February 17] Joel Salzberg writes: &quot;What do you mean by &quot;island.&quot; She teaches at Cornell; Cornell&#39;s not an island.&quot;</p>
<p>[February 17] Anita Robillard writes: &quot;It&#39;s a metaphor, Joel.&quot;</p>
<p>[February 17] Herman S. Levi writes: &quot;I don&#39;t understand why you compare psychoanalysis to theology. They&#39;re nothing alike.&quot;</p>
<p>[February 18] Vivian de St. Vrain responds: &quot;Professor Levi, let me refer you to a familiar passage in the <em>Leviathan,</em> where Hobbes writes of &quot;names that signifie nothing, but are taken up and learned by rote from the Schooles, as <em>hypostatical</em>, <em>transubstantiate, consubstantiate, eternal-Now </em>and the like canting of Schoolemen.&quot; Similarly, the words of psychoanalysis, such as <em>pleasure principle,</em>&#0160;<em>Ego</em>, etc. signify nothing at all. Theologians and psychoanalysts can be very smart people, but the net practical result of their involuted speculation is transitory, wrong, useless, specious, and false.&quot;</p>
<p>[April 1]&#0160; Skye Barasch writes:&#0160; So, Vivian, is there anyone on the Cornell English faculty whose work meets your antiquated approval?&#0160; It&#39;s all bad, according to you.</p>
<p>[April 1]&#0160; Vivian de St, Vrain responds: Actually, Ms/Mr Barasch, I&#39;m just about to add a paragraph on a member of the faculty whose book was very informative and comprehensible. No abstruse jargon, I&#39;m glad to say.&#0160; Stay tuned;&#0160; my comments will appear here in a day or two. I do wonder, now that I think of it, if I&#39;m unconsciously picking the least approachable books to report on. I&#39;ll try to mend my ways.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I&#39;m a lifelong fan of Defoe&#39;s <em>Robinson Crusoe.</em> I love all the shipboard stuff, the adventure, the exoticism, Crusoe&#39;s self-reliance, his&#0160; psychological complexity, his religious ponderings, and especially the recapitulation of nascent capitalism on the island. I&#39;m as entranced as ever by the attempt to domesticate goats, by his attempt to build a boat, by the single footprint on the beach, by Friday&#39;s escape and the battle with the cannibals. With a little effort, I have been able to set to one side the novel&#39;s faults: the author&#39;s careless repetitions, his appalling colonialist racism, those last anticlimactic adventures and the return to England, the unnatural absence of sexuality or passion, the paranoia and the unnecessary violence. Massive defects, yes indeed, but <em>Robinson Crusoe</em> is still a great eternally wonderful mishmash of a novel.&#0160;</p>
<p>So it came as a surprise to read Laura Brown&#39;s one-sentence summary of the novel in <em>The Counterhuman Imaginar</em>y: &quot;<em>Robinson Crusoe</em> enacts a self-creative other-than-human vitality by setting matter in motion through the persistent repetition of irresistible succession.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Maybe Robinson Crusoe does &quot;enact&quot; and &quot;set matter in motion&quot; -- I don&#39;t know, can&#39;t say. But I do not plan to undergo the pain and woe of making sense out of her ungainly and mystifying sentence. For Laura Brown, <em>Robinson</em> <em>Crusoe</em> is not the pleasure and challenge that it has been for three hundred years -- it&#39;s just raw material for her dry-as-dust ideological machine.</p>
<p>And a waste of my precious time.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>[February 1] Bernhard Starr writes:&#0160; &quot;Brown transforms the gold of literature into the dross of criticism.&quot;</p>
<p>[February 1] Professor Merlon Crenelle, Southwestern Louisiana U., writes: &quot;Vivian, you&#39;re totally unfair. You take one sentence out of the chapter and make fun of it. You don&#39;t even bother to see how the sentence is related to the larger argument. You owe Professor Laura Brown an apology. You&#39;re irresponsible.&quot;</p>
<p>[February 1] Marianne Morrison, Ph. D. writes: &quot;Vivian, I agree with Mr. (Ms.?) Crenelle. Youve not tried to understand Brown. Your lazy.&quot;</p>
<p>[February 2] Vivian de St. Vrain responds:&#0160; &quot;Whether I&#39;m lazy or not, Brown writes in an obscure code. Why should I have to try to crack the code?&#0160; Why can&#39;t she write in English? She&#39;s a Professor of English, for goodness sake. It&#39;s not my job to figure out what she&#39;s trying to say; it&#39;s her job to make it plain.&quot;</p>
<p>[February 2] Sean R. Fine writes: &quot;It makes me wonder about the &quot;imaginary&quot; in which Laura Brown seems to thrive. Closed, cloistered, self-congratulatory.&quot;</p>
<p>[February 3] Thurman Valentino (SVDGA) writes: &quot;I think that Vivian de St. Vrain is absolutely correct not to try to figure out what that sentence means. It&#39;s not a reader&#39;s responsibility. My opinion is that Laura Brown is smart enough to produce a complicated argument, but not smart enough to make complicated argument clear.&quot;</p>
<p>[February 3] Michael F. Bristol writes: &quot;Or maybe, dear Viv, you&#39;re not smart enough to figure it all out.&quot;</p>
<p>[February 4] Vivian de St. Vrain replies: &quot;OK, Bristol, if you&#39;re so smart why don&#39;t you just tell us exactly what &quot;persistent repetition of irresistible succession&quot; means.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>[February 4] J C Occhiogrosso suggests: &quot;One thing regularly follows another?&quot;</p>
<p>[February 7] Beulah Withee writes:&#0160; &quot;The problem is not with just that one sentence. It&#39;s that whole paragraphs and pages are filled with such difficult sentences. After each of these, a reader has to pause and interpret before going on to the next one. It puts far too much burden on the reader.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>[February 9] Gabriel Cussen III writes: &quot;I tried to read the book but I didn&#39;t get very far. Do visitors to this blog remember the criticism of academic articles and books: &quot;What is new is not true and what is true is not new.&quot; This book is even worse, because what&#39;s true is utterly trivial.&quot;</p>
<p>[February 9] Bernhard Starr responds: &quot;Gabriel Cussen, I agree with you.&#0160; There&#39;s no there there.&quot;</p>
<p>[February 13]. Herbert Lecovin (Cornell &#39;61) writes: &quot;The important question is what is going on in her classroom. Does she lecture in this dialect and does she expect her students to write as she does?</p>

                                <p>I&#39;m still trying to come to terms with Laura Brown&#39;s book, <em>The Counterhuman Imaginary</em>. I&#39;ve wrestled the title to a draw, and now I&#39;m going to take a crack at the Introduction. Is this task a good use of my limited time?</p>
<p>Let me quote a sentence that I take to be the very heart of the book and the heart of the problem. It&#39;s a doozy.</p>
<p>&quot;Human story telling is found to provide a subtle scenario for affirming the other-than-human, based on an imputed commonality that replaces human priority with cross-species inclusivity that transcends the human.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>Laura Brown&#39;s prose reads as if it were first drafted in German and then rendered into English by Google Translate.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>It takes effort, but once you penetrate its peculiar idiom, it makes a kind of sense. For those of my readers who are still with me, let me try to parse this sentence. I suspect It may mean something like, &quot;human beings project thoughts and feelings onto animals and objects.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Human story telling&quot; [that is, literature]</p>
<p>&quot;is found to provide&quot; [the passive &quot;is found,&quot; should be deleted even though it functions as a compliment to the person (i.e. the author herself) to whom this insight has been revealed.]</p>
<p>&quot;a subtle scenario&quot; [I don&#39;t know exactly what the phrase &quot;subtle scenario&quot; means; nor do I think that anyone else does.]&#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;based on an imputed commonality &quot; [I understand &quot;commonality&quot; because I know that humans and animals share many features. I don&#39;t see the necessity for the word &#39;imputed&quot;; imputed by whom? who other than humans can &quot;impute.&quot;]&#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;that replaces human priority&quot; [i.e. there should be no preference for humans over animals and rocks, despite the paradox that humans and not animals can think about the equivalence.]&#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;with cross-species inclusivity&quot; [&quot;inclusivity&quot; is implicit in the previous rejection of &quot;human priority.&quot; Wow, these abstract nouns do pile up (commonality, priority, inclusivity). Suggested simplification: &quot;that includes other species&quot;]</p>
<p>&quot;that transcends the human.]. Transcends, in this final clause, smuggles into the argument a new idea, because &quot;to transcend&quot; means &quot;to surpass.&quot; The claim now, as this snake of a sentence winds its weary way to conclusion, is that the meaning that humans attach to things is greater than the humans who do the attaching. At least I think that is what it may mean.]</p>
<p>So after completing this investigation, I think that the claim is that literature projects ideas onto animals and also things. And sometimes these projections illuminate and enhance both things and animals.&#0160;</p>
<p>I&#39;m exhausted. I had planned to discuss the Introduction at greater length, but I&#39;ve had enough. Instead of proceeding with the introduction, I&#39;m going to try to understand the chapter on <em>Robinson Crusoe</em> (a novel that I first read as a boy and have read several times since, and which I feel that I understand). Stay tuned.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>[January 31]&#0160; Petal Rivera writes:&#0160; &quot;So it seems that Brown&#39;s book is not a novelty of ideas, but a novelty of language.&quot;</p>
<p>[January 31] Sean R. Fine writes: &quot;I agree with Ms. Rivera. Simple ideas cast in pretentious language to make them seem important. This emperor of literary criticism has no clothes. None whatsoever,&quot;</p>
<p>[February 1] Joel Salzberg writes: &quot;Vivian, good job of unravelling that sentence even though I still don&#39;t quite understand it.&quot;</p>
<p>{February 1] Viola Pilbeam writes: &quot;Vivian, you&#39;re too kind. Why don&#39;t you just&#0160; admit that this whole book is absurd American nonsense.&quot;</p>
<p>[February 4] Helena Hotchkiss-Jones replies: &quot;This absurdity can&#39;t be blamed on the Americans. It&#39;s as much the fault of Deleuze, Adorno, etc.&quot;]</p>
<p>[February 4] Joel Salzberg replied: &quot;Who is Deleuze Adorno?&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>[May 2]&#0160; Evelyn Efflandt writes: &quot;Joel, you always were a couple of candles shy of a menorah.&quot;</p>
<p>[May 3] Vivian de St.Vrain replies: &quot;Evelyn, you always were a nasty bigot.&quot;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I am absolutely buffaloed by Laura Brown&#39;s book, <em>The Counterhuman Imaginary&#0160;</em>(Cornell UP, 2023).</p>
<p>The title is a puzzle. Why does the adjective come after the noun? And what does the word &quot;counterhuman&quot; mean?&#0160; (One hundred and forty-six pages to go and I&#39;m already off balance. I&#39;m worried that if I can&#39;t understand the title I&#39;m going to have a heck of a difficult time with the content.)</p>
<p>I took a guess that the coinage &quot;counterhuman&quot; would signify something monstrous or terrifying, like a vampire, troll or ogre. But I was not even in the ballpark. &quot;Counterhuman,&quot; I have now discovered, is a term of art in contemporary literary criticism that refers to everything that is not human: not only animals, natural phenomena such as storms and earthquakes, but also &quot;things&quot; or objects -- anything that is constructed or manufactured. Not &quot;inhuman&#39; -- just not human. (But why &quot;counter&quot; rather than &quot;non&quot; human?)</p>
<p>Moreover, the word &quot;imaginary,&quot; which I have for a lifetime understood to be an adjective signifying what is not material but rather a product of the human mind, as for example, art and literature and dreams, has also undergone metamorphosis. According to wiki, the adjective-turned-noun &quot;imaginary&quot; &quot;is the set of values, institutions, laws, and symbols common to a particular social group and the corresponding society through which people imagine their social whole.” That&#39;s a deal of territory, but I think I understand: &quot;imaginary&quot; is essentially a synonym for what I might, naively, have called &quot;culture.&quot; (Might an alternative to <em>The Counterhuman Imaginary</em> be <em>The Culture of Things</em>? It&#39;s a more inviting title and much less pretentious.)</p>
<p>But now I&#39;m stopped in my tracks. The &quot;imaginary, it appears, is &quot;the work of a particular social group.&quot; How in the world, then, do the &quot;counterhuman,&quot; who are incapable of thought, possibly generate &quot;a structure of ideas?&quot; Pots and pans and volcanoes and marmosets don&#39;t have brains that think or speak, except when we humans attribute such traits to them.&#0160;</p>
<p>In a whimsical moment, Duke Senior, in <em>As You Like It</em>, proposed that there are &quot;tongues in trees, books in the running brooks, sermons in stones.&quot; Am I to understand that this author takes seriously what Shakespeare regarded as an ironic jokey extravagance? Gosh, I hope not.</p>
<p>I think I now get the point: Laura Brown, the prestigious Class of 1916 Professor of English at Cornell University, intends to defend a paradox. She will explain to me how non-humans, things without an intelligence, can create a culture. I&#39;d better pay close attention. Or perhaps the author means to advance the trivial but more sensible and less sensational idea that humans can attribute culture to animals and things.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I must say what&#39;s on my mind -- what a deliberately off-putting title. It&#39;s clearly designed to repel the general reader, someone like myself, and to speak only to coterie fellow-travelers who might understand either or both of the words &quot;counterhuman&quot; and &quot;imaginary.&quot; Not a large potential audience.</p>
<p>Do I have a chip on my shoulder as I turn from the title to the Introduction. Yes, I believe I do.</p>

<p>[January 25] Marianne Morrison, Ph.D. writes:&#0160; &quot;Vivian, you should not go on with this. Your so prejudiced against this writer that you cant give her a fair hearing.&quot;</p>
<p>[January 25] Vivian de St. Vrain responds: &quot;Marianne, I&#39;m trying my best to be fair and honest.&quot;</p>
<p>[January 26] Petal Rivera writes: &quot;Vivian, I think you&#39;re naive to suggest a less pretentious title. I hate to say it, but the point is not to avoid pretense, but to be pretentious. No modesty in this book.&quot;</p>
<p>[January 27] J C Occhiogrosso writes:&#0160; &quot;Vivian, you&#39;re being deliberately obtuse. C&#39;mon, it&#39;s not so difficult.&quot;</p>
<p>[February 4] Vivian de St. Vrain responds:&#0160; &quot;Ok, J C, if it&#39;s so easy, why don&#39;t you suggest a better title.&quot;</p>
<p>[February 12] Winifred A. Walker writes: &quot;Like it or not, this is typical academic jargon. If you want to read this book, you must master the idiom.&quot;]</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>To begin my project of getting a fix on Cornell&#39;s Department of Literatures in English, I attempted to read Professor Jeremy Braddock&#39;s <em>Collecting as Modernist Practice</em> (Johns Hopkins, 2012).&#0160;</p>
<p>My plan is to read these Cornell contributions to knowledge with as much empathy and as little prejudice as I can muster.</p>
<p>Despite my good will, I got off to a bad start. The title of Braddock&#39;s book, <em>Collecting as Modernist Practice,</em> struck me as dispiriting and uninviting. It&#39;s an uncompromising coterie title that seems to say to me (and to every general reader), &quot;I don&#39;t care whether you read this book or not.&quot; And indeed the copy that I borrowed from the university library had sat on the shelf unthumbed and pristine for the twelve years since its publication. Perhaps it&#39;s the minuscule typeface.</p>
<p><em>Collecting as Modernist Practice&#0160;</em>is not a page-turner. I found it rough going, and I now confess that I read closely only the introduction and one chapter -- and skimmed the rest.&#0160; Braddock studies the work of collecting and anthologizing art and poetry in the modernist (mostly 1920s) period. The chapter that I studied, The <em>New Negro</em> in the Field of Collections, was enlightening and I was glad to have read it. Braddock is an indefatigable researcher. Sentence after sentence is supported by extensive archival work and a plenty of footnotes. I do wish that the author was as interested in the art and mystery of literature as he is in literature&#39;s reception. <em>Collecting as Modernist Practice&#0160;</em>might be more at home in a department of sociology.&#0160;</p>
<p>Braddock&#39;s prose style is awkward and forbidding. He loves long static sentences with complex subjects and predicates that are sutured with weak verbs. In the pages that I studied, I rarely encountered a metaphor or any other figure of speech. Braddock is also partial to newly-coined polysyllabic abstractions that he may think add heft to his thesis, but which in fact frustrate his readership: minoritarian, identitarianism, anthologization, narrativizing. On the whole, entirely too much suffixizationality.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>I will always be grateful to Braddock for introducing me to Witter Bynner&#39;s 1917 Spectra hoax, of which I was ignorant, and especially for acquainting me with the fabulous name of one of poets that Bynner invented: Anne Knish.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>[January 13] Oksana Sartry writes:&#0160; &quot;Vivian, I don&#39;t think that you&#39;re entirely fair to Braddock. It&#39;s true that his prose style is imperfect, but remember that the book is most likely his dissertation.&#0160; And for a diss. it&#39;s quite good. I also think that when he writes about poetry, he&#39;s quite thoughtful and insightful.&quot;</p>
<p>[January 13] Marianne Morrison, Ph. D. writes:&#0160; &quot;Vivian, your too harsh about Braddock&#39;s vocabulary. Those words that you poke fun at are the regular vocabulary for people of his generation; your out of touch.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>[January 14] Oksana Sartry replies: &quot;I wonder why Johns Hopkins published this diss. in its modernism series. Good diss., but immature book.&quot;</p>
<p>[January 17] Sean R. Fine writes:&#0160; &quot;I&#39;m interested in modernism, but frankly, this book is absolutely unreadable. Whatever value it has is buried beneath tons of jargon. Gives academia a bad name.&quot;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Here&#39;s a truth that blows my freakin&#39; mind: since I earned my B. A. in English from Cornell University in 1960, sixty-five years have come and gone. Glaciers have melted and rivers have changed their course since, way back when, in a prior millennium, I was first introduced to serious literature -- to Chaucer and Milton and George Eliot.</p>
<p>My professors in those far-away-and-long-ago days were exclusively male and for the most part veterans of WW2 or the Korean war. They wrote definitive scholarly articles for the <em>Philological Quarterly </em>or for <em>Modern Philology</em>; they published learned monographs on canonical poets and novelists; and they taught courses with such forthright titles as <em>The Seventeenth Centur</em>y and <em>Wordsworth and Coleridge. </em> Although I was an indifferent student before I arrived at Cornell, I found an intellectual home in the Department of English. Inasmuch as I did not have a brain for rigorous science or for the tough analytic philosophy that was then in fashion, I was fortunate that the work of English suited my limited abilities -- curiosity, patience, a good memory, and something of a feel for language.</p>
<p>Just yesterday (and what, pray tell, prompted me?), I took a peek at the current website of Cornell&#39;s English Department. (In the index-card 1950s, when the manual typewriter was the acme of technology, the word &quot;website&quot; would have signified a dark corner colonized by spiders.) Even at first glance, the 2025 Cornell website said to me &quot;very very different, very &#39;now&#39;.&quot; While an occasional word or phrase was recognizable, it was the novelty -- the modernity, I guess -- that flared from the electronic page and dazzled mine eyne. Time marches on, no doubt, but whether it marches boldly forward or plunges over a cliff remains to be established.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>First of all, it&#39;s no longer the Department of English. It&#39;s now, hurrah!, the &quot;Department of Literatures in English.&quot; What a welcome redefinition -- an assertion that English is a world language and that it houses a world literature. Nowadays, if I sit down with a work of fiction, I&#39;m just as likely to read a novel by a writer from Africa or India or Australia as one from the British isles or North America. There&#39;s not a reason in the world why Chinua Achebe or Abdulrazak Gurnah should not be studied in an English Department. I respect this shift in focus and I regret that my 1950s Beowulf-to-T. S. Eliot English department was so parochial, so provincial. I can only admire the fact that the Department of Literatures in English has annexed to itself whole continents of writing -- a case of academic imperialism that this time seems wholly right and just.</p>
<p>The website also reveals that, in a nation in which the study of the humanities in higher education is at risk, Cornell&#39;s English is a huge thriving enterprise. There are fifty-one people on permanent staff, almost all of professorial rank. Of this number, twenty-seven -- or slightly more than half -- are women. And among those pictured on the site, a significant number are &quot;of color.&quot; Undoubtedly, the present department is a far more representative collection of individuals than my 1950s faculty. Moreover, the chair, the associate chair, the director of undergraduate studies, the director of graduate students, and the director of writing are all women. It may once have been the case that the occasional female interloper was a token for display only, but not so now.</p>
<p>And what do these handsome and distinguished men and women study? Fortunately for me, members of the faculty list their areas of concentration. Most claim two or three specialties, some as many as five; a few recalcitrant individuals list none, leaving me to wonder whether they are polymaths or just ornery uncooperative academics. Among the fifty-one, the single expertise most commonly claimed is &quot;cultural studies.&quot; This preponderance set me back a bit, because &quot;cultural studies&quot; is not a term I recognize nor one that existed, as far as I know, in the 1950s, when the word &quot;culture&quot; was synonymous with &quot;civilization&quot; -- sometimes just Western Civilization -- and when &quot;cultured&quot; meant something equivalent to &quot;educated&quot; and possibly even &quot;socially established.&quot; But now, apparently, &quot;cultural studies&quot; is, and I quote a respected source, &quot;an academic field &#0160;that... investigates how cultural practices relate to wider systems of power. These include ideology, class structures, national formations, ethnicity, sexual orientation and gender.&quot; Am I correct, and is it possible, for me to infer from this litany of nouns that &quot;cultural practices&quot; comprehends just about everything that we as a society say or do? Clearly the Department of Literatures in English lays claim to a heck of a lot of intellectual territory -- and that it is a far more aggressive entity than is revealed by its mere absorption of Anglophone novels. I was initially suspicious of these extensive claims, but after reflecting a while I recognized that, if I set to one side the self-aggrandizing listing of ideology, ethnicity, class... etc,), cultural studies may in practice simply bring to the forefront such elements as imperialism and nationhood in <em>Robinson Crusoe</em> or race and gender in <em>Othello</em>. Wouldn&#39;t it be comforting if &quot;cultural studies&quot; is at least in part merely traditional wine in spiffy new bottles? I, for one, certainly hope so.</p>
<p>After cultural studies, it is &quot;literary theory&quot; that claims the largest group of adherents -- thirteen, or about a quarter of the faculty. This revelation surprised me because I would have guessed that &quot;theory&quot; had long since gone the way of the aurochs and the mouflon. &quot;Theory&quot; had its herd of enthusiasts in its obscurantist heyday in the last century, yet it seems to be alive and kicking at Cornell -- but only, I suspect, as a vestigial remnant of an earlier time and only among the more senior members of the Department.</p>
<p>Following &quot;theory&quot; in popularity among the professoriate are the seven members who stake their claim to &quot;gender studies.&quot; Six other say &quot;African-American.&quot; The nine who announce a specialty in creative writing may not know that they are the successors and the beneficiaries of the late revered Professor James McConkey. Not a single member of the faculty offers &quot;Shakespeare&quot; or &quot;Milton&quot; as an area of expertise. I do not doubt that the study of gender and African-American and Asian-American literatures is a good thing, but I would have wished that the authors of the finest works of art in all of Anglophonia be accorded equivalent attention and status.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>Would a reincarnated Youthful Me elect take a degree from such a faculty?&#0160; I&#39;m skeptical, but I can&#39;t say for sure because I don&#39;t know whether or not, in the classroom, the scrupulous examination of literature and ideas has been undermined by transitory and faddish ideologies. I must confess that the biases of the website make me feel old and wary and out of touch. And tired.</p>
<p>Well then, what does take place in the classroom?</p>
<p>Let&#39;s sample some evidence.</p>
<p>In days of yore, I enrolled in &quot;Elizabethan and Jacobean Drama,&quot; a course taught by the distinguished scholar and teacher David Novarr. The course was organized as a chronological march from Kyd and Marlowe in the 1580s right through to Ford and Massinger -- the last playwrights of significance before the theaters went dark in 1642. I remember savoring some delightful comedies by Ben Jonson and Francis Beaumont and also a couple of ferociously brilliant tragedies by Thomas Middleton -- writings, I suspect, that 2020s English majors are not destined to encounter -- even though an acquaintance with these plays is essential background for understanding the timeless works of Shakespeare.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>There&#39;s no equivalent course in the present curriculum, but there is an analogue, and it appears in the catalogue of offerings thusly:&#0160;</p>
<p>ENGL 3240. <strong>Blood Politics:&#0160; Comparative Renaissance Drama</strong></p>
<p><em>Blood is everywhere. From vampire shows to video games, our culture seems to be obsessed with it. The course examines the power of &quot;blood&quot; in the early modern period as a figure that continues to capture our imagination, not only as a marker of racial, religious, and sexual difference and desire, but also as a dramatic player in its own right. How does a politics of blood appear on stage when populations are being expelled and colonized for reasons (mis)understood in terms of blood?.... Topics include honor, revenge, purity, the body, sexuality, conversion, and death.</em></p>
<p>The course description itself is a mess -- both incomprehensible and meretricious. I&#39;m shocked by the catchpenny pandering. Do 2020s teachers need to lure students into their classrooms with &quot;vampires&quot; and &quot;videos?&quot; The assertion that &quot;blood is a dramatic player in its own right&quot; is nonsense. The description reads like advertising copy for a cheesy low-budget horror flick playing at some louche all-night grind house.</p>
<p>Moreover, &quot;blood&quot; isn&#39;t &quot;everywhere.&quot; Goodness gracious!</p>
<p>I&#39;m afraid that these entrancing plays are doomed to be put through the &quot;cultural studies&quot; homogenizer. Or &quot;theorized&quot; out of all compass.</p>
<p>Ah, well.</p>
<p>Back in 1960, I had a summer job in Ithaca and therefore happened to be loafing around the campus when the University hosted its returning alumni. Among the returnees were the old folks&#0160; -- some few of them members of the class of 1895 -- who had walkered and wheel-chaired to their Sixty-Fifth. Geezers, I thought. It&#39;s sobering to realize that those codgers were the same age -- 86 -- as I am now. Should I&#0160; return to Ithaca this coming spring, for my very own Sixty-Fifth, I will be perceived by the young &#39;uns exactly as I observed those Class of 1895 guys: as ancient and irrelevant.</p>
<p>It follows, therefore, that my reservations about the 2025 English curriculum have their exact parallel in the 1895ers perspective on my 1960 curriculum. It&#39;s not hard to imagine that they -- I mean the members of the class of 1895 -- who had been educated in elocution and Old Norse, would have been shocked and perhaps outraged by the 1950s &quot;modern&quot; curriculum that I found so enticing and illuminating.</p>
<p>And now, because I don&#39;t want to go full curmudgeon and become the kind of superannuated guy who shakes his ebony stick at the modern world and deplores the decline of civilization, I&#39;m going to make an effort to find out what&#39;s really going on in 2025. I have therefore set myself the task of reading a representative sample of the books written by members of the present-day English faculty.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll report on my studies right here.</p>
<p>Stay tuned.</p>
<p>[January 18] Bernhard Starr writes:&#0160; &quot;Vivian, you are right about the course description. It&#39;s a disgrace. It&#39;s badly written and ridiculous. Why didn&#39;t you include the name of the prof. who wrote it?&#0160; He/she needs to be exposed. What &quot;populations are being expelled and colonized&quot; by <em>Volpone</em> or <em>The Changeling?</em>&#0160; And did you look other course descriptions -- are they equally silly?&#0160; What&#39;s worst about the course description is that it doesn&#39;t respect the plays that the class is going to examine. They&#39;re not important interesting dramas to the teacher -- they&#39;re just fodder for an ideology.&#0160;</p>
<p>[January 19] Vivian de St. Vrain replies: &quot;Mr. Starr, I didn&#39;t identify the author of the course description because the website doesn&#39;t identify him/her. Just as well. Also, I didn&#39;t read other course descriptions though I might do so in the future. I think you&#39;re correct that the course description does not respect the dramas or their authors. Which is, as you suggest, mighty disappointing.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>[January 19] Bernhard Starr replies:&#0160; &quot;I think I&#39;d rather study Old Norse.&quot;</p>
<p>[February 4] Thurston Dale replies:&#0160; &quot;I guess I&#39;m a geezer, too (Cornell, &#39;65). I&#39;m glad I majored in English before criticism turned crazy. Great teachers -- Mizener, Abrams, Parrish, Novarr.&quot;</p>
<p>[March 17] Anatole Miles Webber writes: &quot;Vivian, you were naive back in the 1950s and you&#39;re still naive now. You assume that the Cornell English Department of your youth, 65 years ago, was normative and normal. You were then and still are oblivious to the fact that the Department&#39;s 1950 curriculum was the product of stress and change and compromise. Try to remember that there were at least three forces at work and that various faculty members had various degrees of commitment to them. The first group was the oldest -- the traditionalist who studied, as they had always done, literature as history and biography and philology. Get the text and the context right was their primary concern. Then there were the &#39;new critics&quot; -- heirs to Leavis and <em>Scrutiny</em> in England and the southern agrarians (Ransom, Tate, Warren) in the US. But the main intellectual current riling English Departments were the fierce critics out of New York (mostly Jewish) circles (Kazin, Trilling, Fiedler, Paul Goodman, Irving Howe, etc). In retrospect, even though Cornell brought both Lionel Trilling and Cleanth Brooks to Ithaca during your and my years there, the new winds made little impression on our education. Cornell was peaceful, isolated and non-ideological. It appears from your writing that you preferred it that way and still do. It was stable until the theory people brought in novelty and confusion and excitement.</p>
<p>[April 15] Parnell Pratt replies: &quot;And also monumental pretension. And eventual collapse and failure.&quot;</p>
<p>[May 3] Lance Birdseye (Lt., USAF) writes: &quot;What a funny website this is. Hey, folks, join the real world.&quot;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>As a rule, I keep my distance from live performances of a Shakespeare play because I seldom enjoy the experience and regularly find it misleading. This has not always been the case. A few versions, notably the lucid Scofield <em>Coriolanus</em> at Stratford in 1962, are still vivid in my brain. What has happened?&#0160; Somewhere along the way, I&#39;ve lost patience and lost interest in playgoing. Am I alone?&#0160; I remember sitting in some theater or other in the way back when, when, glancing left and right in my row, I could not help noting that a significant cadre of my fellow spectators were not engrossed in the performance but were nodding off, and that others in my vicinity were clearly bored, drifting passively toward sweet sleep.</p>
<p>This is a phenomenon that I had never encountered at a baseball game where everyone is alert and engaged. Anything but silent and sometimes raucous?</p>
<p>So why were all these numb Shakespeare spectators sitting as still as stones?</p>
<p>And why was I among them, inasmuch as I too, let me confess, was bored by the performance. I was not, as I yearned to be, lost in the words or engaged by the action. While I resisted sleep, except possibly for a second or two here and there, I was treading mental water, so to speak. Not exactly hypnotized, but certainly not transfixed. And I was in this state of inattention even though I knew the words that the actors were saying as well or better than they knew them themselves. Eventually, in the course of time, I came to admit to myself that to attend a Shakespeare play was not for pleasure but rather to honor an eminence, to pay dues to a cultural icon, to participate in a ritual of cultural hegemony -- and that I had paid good money in order to worship at the shrine of Shakespeare and to lend my support to what has long been labelled &quot;Shakespeare idolatry.&quot;&#0160; This revelation, or <em>apercu</em>, or insight made me unhappy as I am not by nature given to reverence. To try to bend my will to admire on-stage oratory felt inauthentic, contrary to myself as I knew myself.&#0160;</p>
<p>Yet I am an unabashed, unapologetic lover of Shakespeare. Not of the theater, but of the book. When I sit myself down to read one of Shakespeare&#39;s most excellent plays, the experience can be and often is utterly transcendent.&#0160;</p>
<p>It is reading that unlocks the play; puts me in touch with true genius.There&#39;s something about the one-on-one concentration that you can give to a book in your very own hands in your very own chair that you can&#39;t give to a performance, where you&#39;re crammed into your space and have lost to your neighbor the battle for the arm rest. You&#39;re distracted by the inevitable snuffles and sneezes of your fellows and by the too-clever sets and costumes and lighting and artifice -- all of which interfere with your grasp of what is most important about poetic drama -- the words. But at home, I&#39;m dazzled by the poetry and I am transported with aesthetic bliss (however defined). I&#39;m moved to tears and laughter and also admiration.</p>
<p>He&#39;s endlessly fascinating, this Shakespeare guy, and intelligent, and a poet like none other.&#0160;</p>
<p>It&#39;s all I need; a comfortable posture for my ancient limbs, a bit of silence, a book --&#0160; and I&#39;m in awe.&#0160;</p>
<p>Performances, in my opinion, erect a barrier to understanding and obscure rather than illuminate the plays. It&#39;s necessarily so, because directors and actors interpret the play.&#0160; It&#39;s their job;&#0160; it&#39;s what they do. Interpret. And every interpretation, no matter how skillful, is an obstacle.</p>
<p>A reader is less constrained and can keep his mind open. No one, no thing, to mediate between the eyes and the page.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Performances are especially hazardous when directors deliberately attempt to make a play relevant or in accord, somehow, with the zeitgeist of the decade. Clever catchpenny novelties do nothing for me. Why must plays be set anywhere but where Shakespeare intended them?&#0160; Any effort to update a play, or make it &quot;contemporary&quot; or &quot;feminist&quot; or &quot;anti-fascist&quot; or &quot;anti-colonial&quot; or whatever, produces only distraction and distortion. Which is why the long history of Shakespeare on stage is a woeful history of addled misinterpretation. Nahum Tate&#39;s notorious King Lear of 1681, in which Edgar and Cordelia embrace at the end and Lear is pensioned off is ludicrous, but not more absurd than last year&#39;s Queen Lear.</p>
<p>Query: if I&#39;m so disdainful of live performances, how is it that I&#39;m so fond of Shakespeare on film.</p>
<p>But that&#39;s a subject for another day.&#0160;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I read Felipe Alou&#39;s autobiography, <em>My Baseball Journey</em> (2018). It&#39;s not a literary masterpiece, but nevertheless a solid book that &quot;does the job.&quot; It&#39;s particularly valuable for its story of the brutalities faced by a black Dominican pioneer coming to segregated America in the early &#39;50s. A good reminder of a part of our ugly racial history that is so easy to forget or ignore. In an afterword, Bruce Bochy calls Alou the &quot;Jackie Robinson of South America.&quot; <em>My Baseball Journey&#0160;</em>is also a good reminder of the daily hardships faced by the professional athlete. True enough that they&#39;re well paid, but also true that they&#39;re subject to injuries and decay and insecurity and have to fight for their job every day. There&#39;s no such thing as tenure in sports. Alou was smart and resilient and proud and enjoyed a career that can be justly celebrated -- but not all do.&#0160;</p>
<p>Here&#39;s my favorite paragraph: &quot;I missed playing when I retired. Every retired ballplayer goes through the same things, the same thoughts and emotions. I still miss playing. To this day, I have dreams that I&#39;m still playing. Sometimes I have nightmares where I&quot;m late for a game or I&#39;ve missed a team bus to the ballpark.&quot; I understand this sentiment very well; like many of my peers, I still dream that I&#39;m either late for class or am standing in front of a large audience and have absolutely no knowledge of the subject about which I&#39;m required to discourse for an hour.&#0160;</p>
<p>One weakness of <em>My Baseball Journey:&#0160;</em>though Alou managed through the steroid years, and knew Barry Bonds and others, he gives the drug problem mighty short shrift. His book turns a blind eye toward that painful period.&#0160;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>The singer and composer Barry Manilow writes that he took three arduous years to produce his rather thin memoir (<em>Sweet Life, Adventures on the Way to Paradise,</em> 1987). I&#39;m skeptical of his claim because his book has all the outward indications of the celebrity genre that might justly be called the &quot;as-told-to&#39;s. It&#39;s written as a flow of &quot;I did this, then I did that; I was great.&quot;&#0160; The dullest prose; I don&#39;t think there&#39;s so much as a metaphor in the entire book.&#0160; Gosh, I searched high and low for genuine feeling, for insight or learning, or for complexity of vision. No dice. How could such an unreflective, shallow being have achieved so much?&#0160; Been so popular, so highly regarded, so famous.</p>
<p>I can&#39;t say that I&#39;m very familiar with Manilow&#39;s music, but I&#39;m pleased to learn that he produced Bette Midler&#39;s debut album, <em>The Divine Miss M</em>. &quot;Delta Dawn&quot; and &quot;Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy&quot; were midlife favorites that I&#39;ve been pleased to revisit today (with the assistance of officious Alexa).</p>
<p>Brooklyn influence? Manilow seems to be a bit ashamed of his origins. At age 20, he moved from Brooklyn to Manhattan. &quot;As we drove away, I said to myself, &#39;Good-bye, Brooklyn. Thanks for everything. I&#39;m never coming back.&#39; And I never did.&quot;&#0160; The only clear evidence of his Brooklynity is that he named his beloved dog &quot;Bagel.&quot;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Half of Pete Hamill&#39;s memoir sometimes seems to have dropped down from another universe or more precisely from an alternative civilization, while the other half depicts events and ideas that are as familiar to me (as they say) as the back of my hand. Although Pete and I are both Brooklynites and near-contemporaries (he was born in 1935, and I in 1939), our lives were o so similar and yet completely different. But that&#39;s the way things were in complex, composite 1940s Brooklyn.</p>
<p>The title of Hamill&#39;s memoir establishes the differences. It&#39;s well-named -- <em>A Drinking Life</em> (1994) -- and it is saturated with liquor and Irish bars and elbow-lifting and most especially with Pete&#39;s father&#39;s uncontrollable and disabling alcoholism. Yet just a few blocks over, in my part of Brooklyn, alcohol played no part whatsoever in my own family or my life in the neighborhood. I would not call an autobiography of my own <em>An Abstinent Life</em>, because we weren&#39;t teetotalers and there was always a glass of Scotch to offer to guests, but we hardly ever touched the stuff ourselves. It wasn&#39;t until much later in life that I came to realize that my father and I were genetically incapable of digesting alcohol. I&#39;ve written about this peculiar phenomenon <a href=" https://www.drmetablog.com/2009/11/adh22-in-my-life.html">here.</a>&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Equally in contrast was Hamill&#39;s early education. The poor fellow was enrolled at Holy Name of Jesus, a Catholic parochial school where one of his teachers was the &quot;snarling vicious Brother Jan, a thick-necked Pole with a jutting jaw and bent nose&quot; -- your classic sadist -- who derived his joy in life by whipping with a thick ruler the bare hands and butts of defenseless boys. I myself learned to read and cipher at P.S. 217, a public elementary. At 217, we had teachers both gifted and incompetent but no deranged monsters and no corporal punishment. I can remember being bored at school, but not terrified. Not terrified of the teachers, that is -- among the students we had our fair share of bullies and sociopaths.</p>
<p>Hamill&#39;s Park Slope family took Roman Catholicism seriously but he himself was not an enthusiast. Although he loved the costumes and the incense and the majestic hymns, and although he confesses that the loved the &quot;cartoony name&quot; of the Holy Ghost, he was, right from the start, an instinctive atheist. My Flatbush family proffered us nary a single drop of religious information or indoctrination or training. I myself had never attended a single religious service in either synagogue, church, temple, mosque or tabernacle until 2021, and then only because it was New Orleans and we heard that Ellis Marsalis had volunteered to improvise a few measures on the piano. Hamill was a atheist by dissent; I was one by inheritance.&#0160;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Hamill and I shared a great deal -- mostly, I think, in the form of popular culture. Ring-o-levio, spaldeens, stoop ball. Where else but in Brooklyn was a &quot;do-over&quot; a &quot;hindoo?&quot; And baseball. Hamill remembers that an uncle confided to him that &quot;the Dodgers are the greatest thing in the world.&quot; He delights in reciting a litany of familiar Dodger names: &quot;Augie Galan, Dixie Walker, Ralph Branca, Joe Hatten, Henk Behrman, Hugh Casey.&quot; Except to a select few of us, these names are meaningless random syllables, but to those who were children at a particular time and place, they are poetry in its purest and most sublime form, each name a luscious mouthful of pure pleasure. Syllables that will forever bond Hamill and me to the end of the chapter. Syllables that transcend this transitory sublunary existence.</p>
<p>Like me, Hamill was a great lover and collector of comic books. Both of us savored heroes such as Captain Marvel and Captain Marvel jr. and the Human Torch and the Green Lantern and Plastic Man and the Sub-Mariner and Wonder Woman and Invisible Scarlet O&#39;Neill. Hard to believe but there are those who think that Freddie Freeman is only an all-star first baseman, but Hamill and I know better.</p>
<p>And also like me, Hamill found his way the public library where he measured himself against Jim Hawkins and Edmond Dantes and Sydney Carton and D&#39;Artagnan. Tough competition.&#0160;</p>
<p>Sometimes, Pete Hamill leaves pop culture behind and delves into his own personal psychology. Here&#39;s a paragraph of unusual sincerity and one that touches at least tangentially on my own experience. It appears in a discussion of the writings of Robert Louis Stevenson. (I should mention that I read everything of Stevenson&#39;s that the McDonald Avenue Library possessed.)</p>
<p>&#0160;&quot;I sensed (says Hamill) that I was my own version of Jekyll and Hyde. In my head, the Good Boy was constantly warring with the Bad Guy. I wanted to be the Bad Guy, tough, physical, a prince of the streets, at the same time I was driven to be the Good Boy: hardworking, loyal, honorable, an earner of money for the family. The Bad Guy cursed, growled, repeated dirty jokes and resisted Brother Jan, the Good Boy served Mass in the mornings and read novels in bed at night.&quot;</p>
<p>In retrospect, I realize that I shared&#0160; a bit of Hamill&#39;s doppelgangerism. In real life, I was a conforming Jekyll; but in my heart, in my soul, I was a fierce dissenter. Lots of anger, lots of unfocussed passion. I didn&#39;t much act upon my Hydeness, except for the occasional adolescent pilfering and the meaningless fights. But how else to account for the violent dreams -- especially the regularly-repeated nightmares where I bashed in the heads of unidentifiable adults with a heavy shovel?&#0160; And buried their bodies in my father&#39;s backyard garden underneath the hybrid teas?&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Both partisans and skeptics of Jane Austen&#39;s <em>Emma</em> will remember Harriet Smith, the young woman who becomes the object of Emma Woodhouse&#39;s officious matchmaking. Harriet&#39;s ancestry is explained by JA; she is &quot;the natural daughter of someone&quot; -- that is, she is an illegitimate child of obscure origin. Harriet&#39;s patronizing friend Emma imagines, without a shred of evidence, that the poor dear must be the daughter of nobility. She therefore interferes with Harriet&#39;s romantic prospects, first by discouraging an &quot;attachment&quot; to an upright and capable farmer -- and then by promoting relationships which we readers are taught to believe should be beyond Harriet&#39;s aspiration. JA, for all her satirical spirit, is not one to challenge the rigid class distinctions of rural Highbury.&#0160;</p>
<p>But then, at the very end of the novel, other options having led to disaster, Harriet and farmer Robert Martin are allowed to marry.&#0160; Almost as a coda -- an afterthought -- Austen reveals to us that&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Harriet&#39;&#39;s parentage became known. She proved to be the daughter of a tradesman, rich enough to afford her the comfortable maintenance which had ever been her&#39;s and decent enough to have always wished for concealment, -- such was the blood of gentility which Emma had formerly been so ready to vouch -- It was likely to be as untainted, perhaps, as the blood of many a gentleman, but what a connexion had she been preparing for Mr. Knightley -- the Churchills -- or even for Mr. Elton! The stain of illegitimacy, unbleached by nobility or wealth, would have been a stain indeed.&#0160;</p>
<p>It&#39;s a curious and I think distressing revelation.</p>
<p>There&#39;s an unpleasant sneer in the dismissive phrase, &quot;daughter of a tradesman&quot; where &quot;merchant&quot; or even &quot;prosperous merchant&quot; might have been more generous. Moreover, the pregnant phrase &quot;illegitimacy unbleached by nobility or wealth&quot; neatly encapsulates the hypocrisy of a society that can condone a rich bastard but condemn a poor one.&#0160;</p>
<p>But what is most bothersome about the paragraph is what it omits. Although JA pull back the curtain on Harriet Smith&#39;s father, she does not bother herself to reveal anything about Harriet Smith&#39;s mother. Surely even an illegitimate child had one, and surely that mother, in addition to her pregnancy and childbirth, had a story of her own -- both before and after she surrendered her child. If Harriet&#39;s father can be revealed (even though he is not named), why then, why not her mother?&#0160; What is implied by this omission? That the mother doesn&#39;t matter -- she was merely &quot;someone&#39;s&quot; mistress or concubine. Or perhaps a prostitute. That Harriet&#39;s status in society has nothing to do with her inconsequential mother.</p>
<p>Or perhaps that JA, raveling the loose ends of her story, preferred to avoid a distracting complication.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>My own theory is that JA just simply forgot. Because fathers matter a great deal and mothers matter much less, it&#39;s not of any moment who was Harriet&#39;s mother. In psychological terms, JA is guilty of a perfect parapraxis -- and unconscious forgetting, canceling, or, in modern jargon, an erasing. Harriet&#39;s mother is not even erased -- she&#39;s utterly non-existent.</p>
<p>Sometimes what is not represented can be as revealing as what is included.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>My first visit in four months to the new acquisitions shelf of the Boulder Public Library turned out to be fruitful, for I discovered J. H. Stiehm&#39;s 2023 biography of Janet Reno: <em>Janet Reno, A Life</em> (Gainesville, Fl). Janet was a classmate (&#39;60) at Cornell and also proceeded with me to Harvard, where she was one of 16 women in her law school class, and I was a undistinguished graduate student in GSAS. I knew her slightly at Cornell; she &quot;sat desk&quot; at Sage Hall, where I was a frequent caller. Our relationship never advanced beyond superficial chat and I was surprised as all get out when she re-emerged in 1993, having been appointed Attorney-General by President Clinton. She served in that position for eight years and made quite a mark.&#0160;</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been on a project of reading the memoirs of members of my age-cohort, especially of those with whom I&#39;ve crossed paths, even if ever so slightly.&#0160; I think that so far, Janet Reno is the only one of my acquaintances who&#39;s earned not just an autobiography, but a biography of her own.</p>
<p>I was particularly interested in the paragraphs about Janet&#39;s Cornell and Harvard years, but I&#39;m sorry to report that those sections are notably thin and superficial. Stiehm&#39;s account make Cornell seem archaic and primitive -- out of a 1930s movie. It is news to me that &quot;freshman wore beanies, sophomores had Cornell sweaters, juniors had blazers, and seniors had straw hats.&quot; Mere mythology. It&#39;s true, though, that there was considerable drinking at fraternity and apartment parties, but for what college was that not true?</p>
<p>Careless errors: Janet did not live at Dickinson Hall, she lived at Clara Dickson Hall. She did not study political theory with non-existent Professor Mario Anatti, but no doubt she did take classes with the distinguished scholar-politician Mario Einaudi.</p>
<p>Stiehm passes over in silence the most egregious moment in Janet&#39;s career -- when she was suckered into allowing villainous Ken Starr to expand his probe into Bill Clinton&#39;s sexual adventures. Either an apology or an explanation should surely have been in order.</p>

                                <p>&quot;Roux&quot; is word that everyone seems to know but me. To the best of my recollection, &quot;roux&quot; had never crossed my personal threshold until last week -- perhaps because I have never taken any special interest in fine cuisine. I&#39;ve now enlightened myself, but at the cost of blundering into a bewildering etymological thicket.</p>
<p>&quot;Roux,&quot; to reprise the obvious, is &quot;a mixture of flour and fat cooked together and used to thicken sauces.... Butter or lard are commonly used fats.&quot; But why &quot;roux,&quot; with its excrescent French x? <em>Un nom étrange.</em> Roux, if I have it right, means brown, or more precisely, reddish brown (as opposed to &quot;<em>brun</em>&quot; or &quot;<em>marron</em>.&quot; In the case of the sauce, roux is an abbreviated version of &quot;beurre roux,&quot; or brown butter and, curiously, comes unbuttered into English as simply &quot;roux.&quot; Roux derives from Latin russus or ruber, reddish, both of which ancient words originate in the same Indo-European root. I&#39;ve now learned of a kind of surgery called a Roux-en-Y, probably pronounced &quot;ruin why,&quot; which is a kind of &quot;anastomosis&quot;--&#0160; or gastric bypass -- in which blood or intestinal vessels are configured into a Y shape. But although one may suspect so, this &quot;roux&quot; has nothing to do with sauces, thank goodness, but is named for the Swiss&#0160; physician who originated the surgery, César Roux. I suspect that Roux&#39;s roux does not descend from ruber but from rufus, red-headed, as in William II, aka William Rufus.</p>

This rue comes to English through French and from Latin <em>ruta.&#0160;</em>The other English rue, as in &quot;rue the day&quot; is, as one might expect, of entirely different origin deriving from Old English <span class="foreign notranslate">hreow</span>&#0160; -- &quot;grief, repentance, sorrow, regret, penitence.&quot;</div>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p><em><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51YpkC0-MeL._SL500_.jpg" /></em></p>
<p>Two weeks ago, I wrote some admiring <a href=" https://www.drmetablog.com/2022/12/east-side-west-side.html ">remarks &#0160;</a>about a little-known post-WWII film called <em>East Side, West Side</em>. I said then that I was sufficiently impressed and intrigued by the film that I intended to read the novel upon which it is based, but that since <em>ES,WS</em> has evaporated into the mists of time, I would have to wait for Interlibrary Loan to dig up a copy for me. Well, the novel has arrived, coming haste-post-haste from Laramie, Wyoming, the flyleaf inscribed, &quot;To Mrs Eccleston, from Anna.&quot; Gosh, I&#39;d love to know who Mrs. E and Anna were, and what they (and Laramie) made of this extremely Manhattan-y book.&#0160;</p>
<p><em>East Side, West Side</em> (published in 1947), I can now report, is a big hunking doorstop of a novel. Not a very good one, I&#39;m afraid. It is prosy, untidy, and crammed with too many episodes and too many undifferentiated characters. To transform its meanderings into an economical screenplay required great intelligence and imagination. All praise to the screenwriter, Brooklyn&#39;s own Isobel Lennart, who condensed characters, eliminated subplots, rationalized excesses, and to some degree toned down the book&#39;s inherent snobbery.&#0160;</p>
<p>ES,WS can be described as an old-fashioned &quot;woman&#39;s novel,&quot; and not in a good way. Its female characters are, almost uniformly passive victims. Plus there&#39;s far too much chat about makeup, dinner parties, and &quot;fittings.&quot; There&#39;s an old --very old-- canard that an erotic novel for women consists of 400 pages of courtship and foreplay&#0160; followed by a proposal of marriage. I&#39;m afraid that ES,WS fits this unfortunate formula. Jessie Bourne, wronged and soon-to-be-divorced wife, is wooed by gentlemanly General Mark Dwyer but o so slowly. Sex is teased and deferred for chapter after chapter. In Isobel Lennart&#39;s alert and improved script, women are not afraid to take charge.&#0160;</p>
<p>There&#39;s one episode in the novel that seriously rankled me. There&#39;s a murder. The privileged East Side aristocrats do not turn the guilty party over to the police; instead, they suppress evidence and suborn perjury in order to keep the scandal out of the newspapers. They succeed, though their plot couldn&#39;t have deceived the dullest precinct flatfoot. In the film, I&#39;m glad to say, a killer is brought to justice.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>Toward the end of the novel, Marcia Davenport introduces a long embarrassing digression in which the General, just returned from the European theater, lectures on the post war situation in Eastern Europe. I&#39;m sorry to say that he praises Soviet aggression in Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, etc. I suspect that these tortured apologetics were written before Davenport lived in Prague and was engaged to marry the Czech foreign minister Jan Masaryk, who in 1948 was thrown out of a window by agents of the KGB.&#0160; I hope that Davenport would have changed her position after the defenestration.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Richard Powell&#39;s novel <em>The Philadelphian</em> has not worn well. It was a best-seller in 1956 and was made into a &quot;blockbuster&quot; film, starring Paul Newman, in 1959. We watched the movie (called, for some reason, <em>The Young Philadelphians)</em> on TCM and I was sufficiently intrigued that I ordered up the long-forgotten novel through our blessedly-efficient Interlibrary Loan. Gosh, what a disappointment! <em>The Philadelphian</em> is a pot-boiler, I&#39;m afraid, very mid-century. It&#39;s got it all -- three-generations of rags to riches, heroic army service, blighted romance and cheesy sex, and a contrived climactic courtroom showdown. Powell&#39;s prose is flat, unstylish, at its best &quot;journalistic,&quot; but marred by flights of tough-guy pseudo-Hammettian or Chandleresque prose: &quot;He came slowly downstairs from the bedroom, with the pulse of blood hammering inside his skull like a rivet gun&quot;; &quot;Her head felt like a boiling tea kettle, and her thoughts kept escaping from it like steam&quot;; &quot;The applause had been a cheer for the underdog. Later it had developed that a wolf was romping around in underdog&#39;s clothing&quot;. Frankly, I&#39;m surprised that the novel achieved such popularity in the years of my youth. Sorry to say but it&#39;s a trashy piece of writing.</p>
<p>The film is a bit better; more honest and more disciplined, hugely reliant on Paul Newman&#39;s youthful charisma.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I read James&#39; <em>Portrait of a Lady</em> in 1963 but never again until last week, so there has been a hiatus of almost three score years. During the interim, glaciers have melted, continents have subducted and conventional notions about what constitutes a &quot;lady&quot; have shifted quite marvelously.&#0160;</p>
<p>After such an interval, it&#39;s not disgraceful for me to confess that I remembered very little of the novel and that even major plot points came as a shock and surprise. Moreover, I re-read the novel with a bit of prejudice, because I had recently learned that Theodore Roosevelt once met James and dismissed him as &quot;a miserable little snob.&quot; Even if I hadn&#39;t been alerted by Roosevelt&#39;s back-of-the-hand slap, I would have recognized that <em>Portrait of a Lady </em>generates enough snobbery to power a nineteenth-century locomotive from Rome to Florence even while hauling the book&#39;s entire cast of frequent travelers. It&#39;s a class-ridden novel in which lesser sophisticates are out-snobbed by superior sophisticates. Despite this unfortunate failing, <em>Portrait of a Lady</em> is a rather wonderful piece of writing.</p>
<p>Let me further confess that I brought a second and more deeply-rooted prejudice to my re-reading. In the early 1960s, when I was a graduate student of &quot;English and American Language and Literature&quot; at a New England university, Henry James was at the apex of his critical reputation. He was &quot;the Master.&quot; In fact, an appreciation (or devotion) to James became a sort of ticket of admission to the coterie of the literary elite. A touchstone. If you (that is, me) were able to appreciate and adore James&#39;s extraordinarily subtle judgements and discriminations and his sustained and intricate analyses of the velleities of social interactions, why then, you were one of the elect. But if you were baffled by his niceties and sometimes could not divine what the heck he was going on and on about, why then you weren&#39;t what James calls in <em>Portrait</em> &quot;a person of sensibility.&quot; And if you weren&#39;t a person of sensibility, why in tarnation were you studying literary history at a university that had been home to establishment sophisticates since 1636?</p>
<p>Not a James devotee, I managed to slip through the system without the disgraceful lacunae in my preparation coming to anyone&#39;s attention. And until this past week, I managed to keep my distance from Mr. Henry James.&#0160;</p>
<p>But I may have made a mistake to have done so. I&#39;d still say that<em> Portrait of a Lady</em> isn&#39;t up there in the stratosphere with <em>Bleak House</em> and <em>Middlemarch</em>, but it&#39;s still a darn good novel. It&#39;s not conventionally exciting; in fact, it&#39;s talky and static in the extreme. Nothing much happens. Isabel Archer talks with Henrietta and HJ analyses the conversation. Then someone goes to Gardencourt and has a long conversation with Lord Warburton. Then Lord W meets Countess C in Rome and they talk. Then Madame Merle, who, we are told, was born in Brooklyn and therefore ought to have known better, has a long conversation with Isabel Archer. Then someone meets someone else in a museum or a train station or a restaurant and they have a long conversation -- once again dissected by HJ. Then they ride the rails to Florence and talk. Meanwhile Ralph Touchett is slowly dying and will continue die (and talk) for another five hundred pages. These various conversations are often oblique, with the most important points omitted or merely implied (to be grasped only by persons of subtlety and sensibility). It&#39;s all so slow that I sometimes felt myself yearning for a good solid knife fight or at least a lengthy car chase. When Isabel finally tells enigmatic villainess Madame Merle that she doesn&#39;t want to see her ever again, I longed for her to spit it out with a a good round &quot;fuck off&quot; -- but no such luck.</p>
<p>And yet as mysteries are revealed in the last third of the novel, <em>Portrait</em> becomes undeniably exciting. Much is familiar; it seems as though James recapitulates the marriage of Dorothea Brooke and Eddie Casaubon in the misalliance of Isabel Archer and the &quot;sterile dilettante&quot; Gilbert Osmond. And also borrows the Pansy plot from the story of Honoria Dedlock. But I came to these insights, if they are insights, only in retrospect; while reading the novel, I was surprised and intrigued.</p>
<p>I strongly object to the ending of the novel, which seemed to violate the trajectory of the plot. Surely Isabel has earned her freedom. To me, her continued bondage to propriety seems cruel to both the character and also to hopeful (but deceived) readers. Wicked, in fact, to the point of sadism. No doubt the conclusion tests a reader&#39;s sophistication, and no doubt if I read the voluminous commentary that the novel has engendered, the apparent cruelty of the conclusion would be be explained and justified. But I won&#39;t read the commentary. I&#39;m obviously not a &quot;person of sensibility&quot; and I prefer to remain unimproved, unenlightened, and pissed.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Through the continuing miracle of TCM, we watched <em>Divorcee,&#0160;</em>a 1930 &quot;pre-Code&quot; drama of marriage and adultery. It&#39;s a film that was shocking in its own time and still carries a bit of an edge. Jerry Martin (Norma Shearer) and Ted Martin (Chester Morris) attempt to create a marriage of perfect equals, but Ted strays. There&#39;s a great understated scene in which Jerry, the betrayed wife, cold-bloodedly tells her unfaithful husband, that &quot;I&#39;ve balanced our accounts.&quot; Ted, though he has proclaimed a commitment to equality, does not, let us say, handle the revelation of his wife&#39;s adultery with grace. The marriage comes to a disastrous end. But alas after an hour or so of travail and weeping, Jerry loses her nerve, succumbs to propriety, pursues her erring husband to Paris, and promises to be true. The assertion of equity has turned out to be just so much blather. The double standard has been tested but has held firm. The film flirts with radicalism but reverts to a Hollywood ending in which love conquers all and an adventurous woman accepts her subordinate place.</p>
<p>I was sufficiently intrigued by the film to investigate its background. The source is a novel called&#0160;<em>Ex-Wife</em> (1928) by Ursula Parrott, which sold 100,000 copies and was a sensation in its day. I confess that although I&#39;m supposed to know something about literature, I had never heard of this scandalous piece of fiction. <em>Ex-Wife</em> sunk like a stone and has been out of print for many years, but our interlibrary loan department managed to locate a 80s reprint in Fort Lewis, Colorado. (Thanks, Interlibrary Loan!).</p>
<p><em>Ex-Wife&#0160;</em>is an inartistic piece of writing -- hectic, repetitive, padded, but one that obviously struck a nerve. In this novel, a young divorced woman does not just pine for her wandering husband. Instead, she enjoys her independence, and &quot;sleeps with more men than [I] can count.&quot; She then she falls deeply in love with the wrong man, and finally opportunistically marries a third fellow whom she doesn&#39;t love but to whom she promises to be faithful (we are skeptical). The novel is marinated in speakeasy bootleg liquor and easy morality. Much wilder than the rather tame film version, it is also more challenging and revolutionary.</p>
<p>In the course of the novel, our heroine has a baby (who conveniently dies) and also an abortion. The babies are important to the larger backstory. In 1922, the then Katherine Ursula Towle, a recent Radcliffe graduate, married Lindesay Marc Parrott, a young reporter for <em>The New York Times.&#0160;</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>They had a son named Lindesay Marc Parrott Jr. two years later. However, his existence was kept a secret from Ursula&#39;s husband, as he never wanted to have a son. So, Ursula left the child in the custody of her father and sister and returned to Lindesay, still not speaking a word about the son. It was not until 1926 that Lindesay found out that he was a father. As a result, he immediately divorced Ursula, rejected the existence of his son, and never once went to see him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s an astonishing revelation that certainly does not speak well for Lindesay Parrott, but adds some autobiographical interest to the plot of Ursula Parrott&#39;s <em>Ex-Wife</em>. Suddenly, the deceased child and the abortion make a certain kind of sense.</p>
<p>I should add that Lindesay Parrott was a name well known to me in the days of my youth. I was then a diligent reader of <em>The New York Times</em> and Lindesay Parrott covered the Korean War, so I encountered his name every single day from 1949 to 1955. And then in the 70s, I learned that Lindesay Parrott had retired from the <em>Time</em>s and had purchased a small farm on Kidder Road in Bradford, Vermont, a bit more than a mile, as the crow flies, from where we lived on Hackett Hill Road. I gave thought to knocking on his door, but I heard through the local gossip chain that Parrott was a recluse and a terrible alcoholic. Whether true or not I don&#39;t know. Of course I had no idea that Lindesay Parrott had once been married to a notorious novelist.</p>
<p>As for Ursula, after her divorce from Lindesay Parrott, she married three more times, and was also rumored to have had affairs with F. Scott Fitzgerald and Sinclair Lewis. She died in 1957 &quot;in the charity ward of a New York City hospital.&quot;</p>
<p>Here&#39;s Ursula Parrott&#39;s Radcliffe graduation picture:&#0160;</p>

<div class="bRMDJf islir" role="button" tabindex="0">[September 24, 2023]&#0160; I&#39;ve just read a remarkable biography of Ursula Parrott, called <em>Becoming the Ex-Wife</em>, by Marsha Gordon, a professor of film studies.&#0160; It&#39;s a deeply researched piece of writing, and a revelation. Ursula Parrott&#39;s life was both more tied to convention and more lurid than it was represented in the Wik article from which I drew my information. The story about Lindesay Parrott not knowing about his son&#39;s birth nowhere appears on the biography. It&#39;s a myth, though it is true that Parrott was not much interested in his offspring (but in a indifferent-father rather than an ignorant-father way). Can&#39;t always trust Wikipedia.</div>

<div class="bRMDJf islir" role="button" tabindex="0">How Ursula Parrott managed to burn through the huge sums that she garnered from her writing is mysterious to me, but it is unquestionable that she was a tragic homeless pauper at the end. Although Professor Gordon seems to have read everything Parrott wrote (and she composed acres of novels and stories), she did not entice me to read further in Parrott&#39;s work -- even if I could locate these long-out-of-print performances.</div>
<div class="bRMDJf islir" role="button" tabindex="0">&#0160;</div>
<div class="bRMDJf islir" role="button" tabindex="0">Gordon does not interest herself in the later career of Ursula&#39;s first husband so my anecdote about Lindesay Parrott&#39;s last years might yet be accurate.&#0160;&#0160;</div>

		<a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2021/12/betty-smith-brooklyn.html">Novels Set in Brooklyn:  A Tree Grows in Brooklyn</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>My new reading project: novels set in Brooklyn. There are, I&#39;ve already discovered, tons of them. I wonder how long I will last at this endeavor. Will it be a sterile or a fruitful exercise?</p>
<p>How is it that I never read, until this very week, <em>A Tree Grows in Brookly</em>n?&#0160; It&#39;s certainly the best known novel with the noun &quot;Brooklyn&quot; in its title. I&#39;ve known about it all my life and just never got around to looking at a single page. Did my parents, always tentative about sex, warn me off because the novel has a few frank passages. Or was it anti-Brooklyn snobbery?&#0160; As a young person, I wanted to read about far off places -- Pitcairn Island, nomadic central Asia, and the Africa of Rider Haggard, -- certainly not familiar grimy Brooklyn. At the McDonald Avenue branch of the public library, there were many well-worn copies of of <em>A Tree Grows in Brooklyn </em>sitting on the shelf -- which I ignored and, if I remember correctly, disdained.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>What did I miss?&#0160; <em>Tree</em> is not much in the way of a fiction. There&#39;s nothing like a plot, only a series of loosely-related episodes, and except for the central figure, not much character development. It&#39;s a barely-disguised autobiography. Francie Nolan, tracked from birth through her escape to, believe it or not, Michigan!!, comes from a grindingly poor family (&quot;food insecure&quot; before the term was invented). Much of the first few hundred pages is the barebones account of the struggle for sustenance (and lodging). There is so much emphasis on overcoming lack that <em>Tree</em> almost seems to fetishize or celebrate poverty.&#0160;</p>
<p>So much scrabbling for the next meal is hard to bear, painful to read. It&#39;s especially painful for me, because Betty Smith, born in 1896 in Williamsburg, preceded my father, also a native of Williamsburg (born in 1904) by only a few years. He came from an immigrant family as poor as poor can be, and some of the stories that he told me about the impoverishment of his youth echo and sometimes exceed Smith&#39;s. The essence, therefore, of this &quot;novel,&quot; is familiar to me, perhaps entirely too familiar.</p>
<p>One blot upon the novel is its casual bigotry. Irish characters sometimes go to &quot;Jewtown&quot; for clothes or food. Jewish characters are gross stereotypes. But what can be expected from a popular novel of the 1940s, when the radio offered us, day after day,&#0160; large doses of <em>Amos and Andy, Life with Luigi, The Goldbergs.&#0160;</em>How we guffawed at ethnic &quot;humor&quot; in those unenlightened days!&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Nor was I happy about the novel&#39;s Brooklyn chauvinism. For example:&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">&quot;&quot;There&#39;s no other place like it,&quot; Francie said.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">&quot;Like what?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">&quot;Brooklyn. It&#39;s a magic city.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">&quot;It&#39;s just like any other place.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">&quot;It isn&#39;t. It&#39;s mysterious here in Brooklyn. It&#39;s like -- yes -- a dream. The houses and streets don&#39;t seem real. Neither do the people.&quot;</span></p>
<p>I wish the novel offered some corroboration for the claim of Brooklyn&#39;s magic and mystery. If it was there, I didn&#39;t find it in this grim novel, nor at the corner of Newkirk and Coney Island Avenues where I first came to awareness.</p>
<p>The &quot;tree that grows in Brooklyn&quot; is the so-called &#39;tree of heaven,&quot; <em>ailanthus altissima. </em>Smith has chosen it as a symbol of resilience, for the tree of heaven can thrive under the most inauspicious circumstances. I, for one, can remember playing on the roof of one of those six story apartment houses so common in our neighborhood, and noticing an ailanthus growing right out of the asphalt. I was astonished. But I wish that Betty Smith had chosen a different tree to invest with meaning, because the ailanthus is, frankly, a &quot;trash tree.&quot;&#0160; It&#39;s generally considered a noxious weed, an invasive species. It grows rapidly but is short-lived. Its wood is soft and useless. It suckers vigorously and eternally, pours forth strong alleopathic chemicals upon its neighbors, invades subterranean sewers and pipes, is extremely fecund, and stinks. It is known to gardeners and foresters not as the &quot;tree of heaven&quot; but as the &quot;tree of hell.&quot; It&#39;s not a tree that often finds itself celebrated in fiction. Nor in pastoral. Brooklyn, my Brooklyn, was a city of magnificent oaks, maples, sycamores and elms. My people, my fellow Brooklynites, deserve a more distinguished avatar than the tree of of so-called heaven.</p>
<p>Some will remember that T. S. Eliot once referred to the tree that grows in Brooklyn as the &quot;rank ailanthus.&quot;</p>

                                <p>I decided to keep a record of the books that I read this past 2021. It&#39;s in roughly chronological order, starting just about a year ago. It&#39;s an eclectic bunch; after years of being forced to be a specialist I&#39;ve reverted to my natural dilettantism. I&#39;ve probably forgotten some books, both my record-keeping and my memory not so good as before.</p>
<p>Here they come (long drumroll):&#0160; three novels by Lewis Grassic Gibbon: <em>Sunset Song, Cloud Howe,</em> and Grey<em> Granite&#0160;</em>(the first is a masterpiece); Derek Wilson,&#0160; <em>Charlemagne: a Biography; </em>Park Honan, <em>Christopher Marlowe, Poet and Spy; </em>John Heisey, <em>A Checklist of American Coverlet Weavers; </em>H. L. Allen, <em>American Coverlets of the Nineteenth Century&#0160;</em>(taught me a lot about Jacquard coverlets); Eric Sloane, <em>Museum of Early American Tools&#0160;</em>and&#0160;<em>A Reverence for Wood;&#0160;</em>Rinker Buck, <em>The Oregon Trail,&#0160;</em>Edna O&#39;Brien, <em>In the Forest (</em>a forceful novel); Evelyn Piper, <em>Bunny Lake is Missing&#0160;</em>(which I read because I was curious about the film of the same name);&#0160;Patrick Svensson, <em>The Book of Eels; </em>Isabel Wilkerson, <em>The Warmth of Other Suns&#0160;</em>(a long important book which would have been even better if it had been edited to 2/3&#39;s its size);&#0160;Benjamin Kilham,<em> In the Company of Bears&#0160;</em>(a fascinating book set just south of us in Lyme, NH);&#0160;James Essinger, <em>Jacquard&#39;s Web,&#0160;</em>Steven Vogel, <em>Why the Wheel is Round (</em>which it isn&#39;t; it&#39;s circular); Elizabeth Barber, <em>Women&#39;s Work, the First 20,000 Years;&#0160;</em>J D Schein, <em>Coverlets and the Spirit of America; A</em>nne Tyler, <em>A Spool of Blue Thread&#0160;</em>(by one of the most reliable of contemporary novelists); Elizabeth Barber, <em>Prehistoric Textiles&#0160;</em>(a fascinating story); Thomas Stumpf, <em>South St. Louis Boy,</em> v. ii, by my graduate school classmate and friend; William Dean Howells, <em>The Rise of Silas Lapham,&#0160;</em>Andy Horowitz,<em> Katrina&#0160;</em>(sad story of governmental and bureaucratic incompetence in New Orleans);&#0160;Sarah M. Broom<em>, The Yellow House; </em>George Eliot, <em>Middlemarch&#0160;</em>(what, fifth time?&#0160; or sixth?); Kathryn Hughes, <em>George Eliot, the Last Victorian; </em>Shakespeare, T<em>he Winter&#39;s Tale; </em>Charles Dickens,<em> Great Expectations&#0160;</em>(another perennial favorite); John Le Carre, <em>The Mission Song; </em>Jane Austen, <em>Persuasion;&#0160; </em>Klyza and Trombulak, <em>The Story of Vermont&#0160;</em>(summer reading);&#0160;Harry Reed, <em>Harry, Scenes from my Life (</em>another autobiography by a friend); Shaun O&#39;Connell, <em>Assembled Pieces, Selected Writings; </em>Alice Munro, <em>Carried Away; </em>David Lee, <em>Chainsaws, A History; </em>Seymour Gitin, <em>The Road Taken (</em>reminiscences of one of Lynn&#39;s relatives-in-law); Louis Menand, <em>Cold War (</em>all 800 pages!<em>); </em>Lisa Genova, <em>Remember;&#0160; </em>Mark Harris, <em>Mike Nichols;&#0160;</em>H. L. Gates, <em>The Black Church; </em>Thomas Hardy, <em>The Woodlanders (</em>twice<em>); </em>Madalaine Bohme, <em>Ancient Bones; </em>Simon Schama,<em> The Story of the Jews (to 1492); </em>John McWhorter, <em>Nine Nasty Words;&#0160;</em>two remarkable novels by Shirley Hazzard: <em>The Transit of Venus</em>, and <em>The Great Fire</em> (read twice); Valerie Trouet, <em>Tree Story</em>; James Shapiro, <em>Shakespeare in a Divided America;</em> Betty Smith, <em>A Tree Grows in Brooklyn; </em>Joshua Hammer,&#0160;<em>The Bad-Ass Librarians of Timbuktu;&#0160;</em>Jacqueline Woodson,&#0160;<em>Another Brooklyn;&#0160;</em>Paule Marshall, <em>Brown Girl, Brownstones;&#0160;</em>Paula Fox, <em>Desperate Characters</em>.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve started on a reading project for 2022: books about Brooklyn. Will I persist? The crowd is in an uproar, waiting to see how it goes. Look for a report same time, same station, next year.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I&#39;ve given over the last week or ten days to Lewis Grassic Gibbon&#39;s <em>A Scots Quair </em>and I&#39;m very pleased to have done so. And I&#39;m embarrassed that I&#39;ve only now read this strange brooding wondrous series of novels. How could I not have known? For those equally as ignorant as I, the<em> Quai</em>r is a trilogy -- <em>Sunset Song</em> (1932), <em>Cloud Howe</em> (1933) and <em>Grey Granite</em> (1934). Together they tell the story of Christine Guthrie from childhood -- about the turn of the century -- through the years of the Great Depression. I can&#39;t remember reading a piece of fiction that has so thoroughly engaged me, or encountering&#0160; a fictional character so fully realized as Chris Guthrie Tavendale Colquhoun Ogilvie.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a picture of Gibbon (birth name: James Leslie Mitchell) who died at age 34 from a botched surgery.</p>
<p><a class="image" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Leslie-mitchell.jpg"><img alt="" class="thumbimage" data-file-height="403" data-file-width="272" decoding="async" height="326" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Leslie-mitchell.jpg/220px-Leslie-mitchell.jpg" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/Leslie-mitchell.jpg 1.5x" width="220" /></a></p>
<p>The novels do for the northeast corner of Scotland what Thomas Hardy did for the southwest of England. Gibbon&#39;s corner of Scotland is traditional agrarian society beset by doctrinaire religion, industrialization, war, and the Great Depression. The novels range from extremely brutal to marvelously lyrical. They are not without defect: sometimes too long, often too preachy. Occasionally, I felt that I was being treated to a Scottish version of &quot;orientalism&quot;: Scotism, perhaps. The books want condensation, editing; sometimes I felt that I was reading a first draft -- but Gibbon wrote fifteen books in seven years, so signs of haste are inevitable. Gibbon might be called a local colorist or a social realist, but he&#39;s much more. His feel for the landscape and for history is unparalleled.</p>
<p>In subject matter and tone, <em>A Scots Quair</em> reminds me most of Halldor Laxness&#39;s great Icelandic novel, I<em>ndependent People.&#0160;</em>It&#39;s also like one of Hardy&#39;s Wessex novels, but funnier, more playful, and yes, more sensual. There are stream-of-consciousness speeches that recall Faulkner and passages that might have been written by James Joyce (not the Joyce of<em> Ulysses</em> but the Joyce of <em>Portrait)</em>.&#0160; A much neglected masterpiece.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>In the mid 1980s, thirty-five years ago, I was &#39;in residence&#39; for a week at the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, D.C., researching an article on one of the lesser English Renaissance dramatists -- a pleasure as well as a condition of employment. The article that I completed turned out to be not a bad piece of academic prose, if I do say so myself, but not something for the ages either. It was a mere twenty years since I had completed my degree in &quot;English and American Language and Literature&quot; at a Large Eastern University, specifically Harvard. I was not drawn to the Folger for professional reasons only. It was a delight and a great privilege to hold in my very own hands and to read dozens and scores of four-hundred-year-old ephemeral books that -- more than the canonical literature -- helped me to understand the age of Shakespeare. Sermons by the wagonload, biblical commentaries, almanacs, political pamphlets, poems by minor and unknown versifiers, broadsides, medical textbooks, collections of jokes, how-to-write-a-letter-in-Latin trots, schoolbooks. The library possessed inexhaustible troves of such material. The Folger&#39;s plenty licensed my dilettante brain to follow its own naturally wayward inclinations.</p>
<p>While doing my duty and also having some fun, I fell in with a fellow Folgerite named Boyd Berry who was visiting from Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, Virginia. Over cups of coffee, Boyd and I discussed some of the less well-known writers of the period in whom we shared a mutual interest. I remember that we also talked about the teacher&#39;s perennial frustration at engaging the interest of our sometimes less-than-enthusiastic students. I do not remember what prompted me to ask Boyd this question: &quot;what was the worst course that you ever took either as an undergraduate or graduate student.&quot; He replied, without hesitation, &quot;Douglas Bush&#39;s lecture course on Milton at Harvard in 1961.&quot; I was flabbergasted, in part because I hadn&#39;t guessed that Boyd had been at Harvard during my years there, but more because I had enrolled in exactly the same course -- same time same station same year -- and because Douglas Bush&#39;s Milton course was also my own nominee for the worst course ever. Parallel lines had accidentally and miraculously met, so to speak. Although Boyd and I were the same age, he was one year behind me and had taken the course as a senior undergraduate while I had been a first-year graduate student. It seemed an astonishing coincidence, but then, the universe of students of English Renaissance literature is a small one. Nevertheless, the fact that we shared the same opinion about Professor Bush&#39;s course was comforting and, as they say, &quot;validating.&quot; Boyd said out loud words that I had only speculated upon <em>in petto</em>. Perhaps I wasn&#39;t the only outlier.</p>
<p>Why were we in such accord? The obvious answer is that Professor Bush, then in the tail end of his much-celebrated career (he had uttered his infant cries during Grover Cleveland&#39;s second presidency), was tired and bored by his teaching and put little heart into the work. In brief, he droned, unconscionably. Not only did he drone, but it seemed as though there was an invisible shield between his podium and our seats. He didn&#39;t speak to us -- he addressed the empyrean. His lectures consisted of a superficial running commentary on Milton&#39;s poems. &quot;There&#39;s a particularly lovely passage starting on line 695,&quot; -- as if a challenging idea would be beyond our collective capacity. If a student broke into the drone to hazard a question, Professor Bush&#39;s characteristic answer was, &quot;Well, that seems self-explanatory.&quot; But Bush&#39;s classroom style was not the only reason for my unhappiness; I had more substantive concerns.&#0160;</p>
<p>Let me interject a few words about Professor John Nash Douglas Bush. Although almost forgotten today, Bush was by all odds the most formidable and learned literary scholar of his generation. He knew everything there was to know about English, Romance, and classical literature and had written a dozen comprehensive critical and historical books. If the gossip can be trusted, he greeted the dawn of each new day by reading two hundred lines of Latin poetry and a hundred of Greek. I am sure that he knew more about John Milton than Milton knew about himself. He had edited the volume of Milton&#39;s complete poetry (English, Latin, Greek, and Italian) and, astonishingly, had memorized the entire twelve books of <em>Paradise Lost.</em> He was an exacting scholar and a stylish and witty writer. Moreover, he was a kindly, gentle man, cordial and generous to his students -- even to me. If he had flaws of character, I didn&#39;t know of them. To my mind, he was an unimpeachably excellent person and scholar -- and at the same time a teacher from whom I learned just about nothing.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>I was once invited -- along with a clutch of my ambitious graduate-school classmates -- to some sort of reception at Professor Bush&#39;s Cambridge residence. His home was exactly as it should have been -- that is to say, if one were making a movie about a distinguished Harvard professor, one&#39;s location scout would not rest until he discovered the Bush quarters. It was a spacious and civilized home presided over by gracious Mrs. Bush, who was also exactly as she should have been. I remember that the giant main room in the house -- which must once have been two or more large rooms that had been sutured together, was Professor Bush&#39;s enormous study. It was more like an institutional library than something to be found in a private home. Just as one would expect, the study was lined floor to ceiling with handsome wooden bookcases chock full of an enviable display of publications in many languages, some of which I could identify. I remember being served sherry, I think, and also something preternaturally green and fishy on an unfamiliar but I&#39;m sure very elite kind of cracker. This dream of an academic utopia filled me with envy. It also scared the living blazes out of me. Why? Because for all Professor Bush&#39;s elegance and his library, and his lovely deferential wife, his movie-set home struck me as soft, fey, self-satisfied, and bloodless. I was dazzled and intimidated by its splendors but at the same time wary and resistant. Only five years beyond crowded Erasmus Hall High School in darkest Brooklyn, I knew myself well enough to know that, however seductive, his style of life was not for me. I would have to find a more appropriate path.&#0160;</p>
<p>Now I want to step further back and report on two cases in which I was in conflict with Professor Douglas Bush. Actually, the conflicts were only on my side; Professor Bush, Olympian and serene, did not notice -- nor should he have, frankly. These incidents continue to haunt me to this day, sixty years after the fact. Both occurred not in the Milton course, but in an &quot;advanced&quot; seminar called &quot;Science and Humanism in the Seventeenth Century.&quot; I must explain that the word &quot;humanism&quot; did not carry the meaning that it does today, as in the phrase &quot;secular humanism&quot; -- an approach to the natural world that is allied with agnosticism and which sometimes resolves into pure atheism. Professor Bush&#39;s humanism was the altogether different &quot;Christian humanism.&quot; It was, in brief, the noble but ultimately unsuccessful Renaissance attempt to fuse the &quot;inspired&quot; and &quot;revealed&quot; truths of Christianity with the thoughtful, upstanding but unfortunately &quot;natural&quot; morality of the Greeks and Romans. If &quot;Christian Humanism&quot; could be distilled to a sentence, it would be Desiderius Erasmus&#39; daring speculation -- that he would like someday to be able to say, &quot;Sancte Socrates, ora pro nobis&quot;, or &quot;Saint Socrates, pray for us.&quot;</p>
<p>I was a humanist of the secular variety -- by birth, inclination, education and because in my brain there was no place, not even a lone neuron, where &quot;faith&quot; or &quot;prayer&#39; or &quot;worship&quot; might in more standard heads be lodged. Bush, on the other hand, was not just a scholar of Christian Humanism, he was an honest-to-god trapped-in-amber Christian Humanist -- and a devout one, deeply rooted and entirely comfortable in late medieval/early renaissance thinking. In his seminar on Science and Humanism, humanism was right and just, and science, its antagonist, was, if not altogether bad, at a minimum a very dangerous alternative. Did not both Bacon and Descartes assert that &quot;nature&quot; -- the real world -- could be studied directly, on its own terms, rather than as an entity infused with god&#39;s being and majesty. That we mortals might study nature not to reaffirm the goodness and omnipotence of god, but to accumulate objective knowledge and to reap practical material benefits. It&#39;s a fact that the separation of nature from the &quot;truth&quot; of religion has over the centuries unquestionably led to the marginalizing of Christian thinking and therefore, according to Bush&#39;s view of the world, to the steep decline of civilization. The world, no longer driven by revelation, has been going to hell in a heathen hand basket, as Professor Bush said or implied every Tuesday at 4:00 pm.</p>
<p>Regular readers of this blague as well as Dr. Metablog&#39;s family and friends will recognize that Youthful Me did not accept Bush&#39;s premises. In fact, in those days, I was probably even less open to religious ideas than I am now. And therefore, each Tuesday was a day of discomfort.</p>
<p>And then, one afternoon, Professor Bush began the allotted two hours by launching a surprise assault on the then-new and controversial Third Edition of the Merriam-Webster dictionary. The Third had shocked traditionalists. Until 1962, dictionaries had been &quot;prescriptive &quot;-- that is, they explained how language &quot;should&quot; be used and they stigmatized as <em>colloq</em>. or <em>subst. </em>[substandard] those words or expressions that fell beneath the bar. The Third forsook tradition and was not prescriptive but descriptive. It aimed to record the language as it was really used. The Third therefore included many words hitherto banned as slang or vulgar and it was loose and permissive with regard to &quot;shall&quot; and &quot;will&quot;, and &quot;imply&quot; and &quot;infer,&quot; etc. For Professor Bush, the Third was a plunge into darkness -- another example of the collapse of Western Civilization as we know it, or should know it. So he excoriated the new dictionary and its editors and its supporters. The tirade having been completed, he turned mildly to the class and asked if anyone present had a different opinion. Now I had learned a little about modern linguistics at Cornell, and I was a descriptivist both by education and democratic instinct, and I knew that Bush was completely out of step with contemporary thought. I was astonished to discover that I knew more about this particular field of knowledge than he. But, alas, I was totally intimidated and did not open my mouth. What abject cowardice on my part! Nary a word did I say, and so the class segued to a discussion of the Cambridge Platonists and their vain attempt to tame and assimilate Descartes and Spinoza. I still wonder if any of the other 2G&#39;s around the table were aware of my shame. Probably not -- did my peers, the late Arthur Oberg, the late Jake Mills, the late Brian Hepworth, the late Terry Logan, the late Bill Godshalk, and others whose names I have forgotten, notice my moral collapse? I suppose that it&#39;s too late to worry. Nevertheless, my failure to raise my hand and voice still humiliates me, still rankles.&#0160;</p>
<p>Another Tuesday, another surrender. In 1961, William Empson published his innovative study, <em>Milton&#39;s God</em>. While Empson was not as learned as Professor Bush (no one was) he was a much more imaginative and challenging reader. Some say that after Johnson and Hazlitt, Sir William has been English literature&#39;s most insightful critic. Empson was an intellectual and social dissenter (he had been banished from Magdalen College, Cambridge when a condom [horrors!] was discovered among his possessions). He had written two highly influential critical books that every serious mid-century student of literature studied -- the first on ambiguity, the second on pastoral. Empson read <em>Paradise Lost</em> through a very different lens than Bush. He was not a Christian; in fact, he confessed himself anti-Christian because he judged there to be a serious moral flaw at the heart of the religion -- that the sacrifice of Jesus was a highly elaborated form a scapegoating. About <em>Paradise Lost,&#0160;</em>he concluded that God (that is, the character God in the epic) was confused and contradictory, repeatedly tying himself into logical and rhetorical knots in order to justify the unjustifiable. He also argued that irrespective of Milton&#39;s intention, the character God became more complex and interesting when he became less ideological and more dramatic; more, so to speak, human. He revered <em>Paradise Lost</em>, but for his own, not Bush&#39;s, reasons. <em>Milton&#39;s God</em> was trashed by Professor Bush, who dismissed Empson as a simple &quot;village atheist.&quot; I was stunned. True enough that Empson was an atheist, but true also that he was a powerful thinker, not someone to be given the back of the hand with a flippant <em>ad hominem</em>. Bush&#39;s review came out in <em>The New York Times</em> on a Sunday; the following Tuesday, our teacher was lauded by my fellow seminarians. He basked in their admiration. Did my young colleagues genuinely agree with Bush, or were they egregious sycophantic toadies? I don&#39;t know and will never know. And then, after the celebration, Bush asked, as if he were open-minded, &quot;Does anyone here have a different opinion?&quot; If Empson had been summarily dispatched, what chance had I? So once again, I fled the field, remained mute -- and slunk deeper into my expensive leather chair.&#0160;</p>
<div class="text parbase text-56 section">So there they were, my two abject failures of nerve.</div>
<div class="text parbase text-56 section">&#0160;</div>
<div class="text parbase text-56 section">Have I flagellated myself sufficiently?&#0160;</div>
<div class="text parbase text-56 section">&#0160;</div>
<div class="text parbase text-56 section">But now I also remember a third Science and Humanism event -- the Tuesday that Professor Bush fell asleep.</div>
<div class="text parbase text-56 section">&#0160;</div>
<div class="text parbase text-56 section">The class routine was for members of the seminar to offer a ten-minute presentation on the topic of the day, after which Professor Bush would initiate discussion with the unfocussed inquiry, &quot;Any questions, or comments? &quot; At which point I would yearn for my Cloak of Invisibility. One fatal day, the student in question was John Knott, a fine and intelligent youth but not a ball of fire, oratorically speaking. When he brought his effort to a close, there at the head of the table sat Professor Bush, eyes closed, breathing rhythmically, his large round head bobbling on his small round body, lost in blissful slumber. A few seconds went by, then some more seconds, a minute, a minute and a half. Thanks be to all the gods in the pantheon that he did not snore! And yet there we all were, arrayed around that splendid dark mahogany table, frozen. No one moved or even twitched, no one spoke, no one made eye contact with a fellow sufferer. No one breathed. It was unbearable. At last, after another twenty or so ticks of the clock, I had endured all I could endure, and I raised my <em>Complete Poetry of John Milton</em> into the air and was just about to let it slam, when Professor Bush opened his eyes, and without the slightest acknowledgement that something unusual had occurred, intoned the familiar words: &quot;Any questions, or comments?&quot;&#0160;</div>
<div class="text parbase text-56 section">&#0160;</div>
<div class="text parbase text-56 section">I do not recall this event in order to nip at Professor Bush&#39;s revered heels. Every teacher is entitled, occasionally in a long career, to lose focus while a beginning graduate student discourses on a volume such as Henry More&#39;s <em>Explanation of the Grand Mystery of Godliness </em>(an important-in-its-own-day [1660] monograph eloquent in support of rational providentialism and the preexistence of the soul). For all I know, Professor Bush may have been exhausted because he had been up past the midnight hour Monday night, possibly contributing more to scholarship in an evening than I did in an entire career. In hindsight, it was not the sleep itself that distressed me -- it was the passivity and silence of my fellows -- and the fact that when I remained silent I&#0160; honored the charade, the falsehood, that Bush was not asleep. Faced with an emperor&#39;s-new-clothes opportunity, I punted.&#0160;</div>
<div class="text parbase text-56 section">&#0160;</div>
<div class="text parbase text-56 section">Just as I had failed to defend modern linguistics, had failed to defend the &quot;village atheist,&quot; so I failed to bang my book on the board -- an act which would have been forthright and honest and true to myself. The first two events were disgraces of an intellectual kind; the third was one of manners and, I think, of social class. The alliance of Bush and Harvard had overwhelmed me, taken from me my natural freedom of action. Let me confess that it was a secret guilty pleasure to have been accepted into Harvard&#39;s kind embrace. I feared banishment. Would I have still been welcome, would I have been worthy, would I have been a gentleman if I had noisily ended the nightmare. I felt, and I feel to this day, that all of us around the table were in an implicit, unacknowledged conspiracy not to notice the obvious so that we could protect the reverend professor and therefore defend the institutions that he exemplified. We contrived not to notice Bush&#39;s well-earned snooze because to do so would have punctured the balloon. It would been bad manners, barbaric manners, and to exhibit bad manners in a wood-paneled seminar room would mean that we were not genteel, not civilized, unworthy of Harvard and of the privileges it bestowed on us.&#0160;</div>
<div class="text parbase text-56 section">&#0160;</div>
<div class="text parbase text-56 section">On the other hand, I myself had only twenty-two years on my scrawny back, and was just five years out of rambunctious Erasmus Hall High School in Flatbush, where if a teacher were to fall asleep in class, he would within seconds have been met with derisive catcalls and a squadron of paper airplanes. And I admit that, although I conformed myself superficially to the ways of my &quot;betters,&quot; I had enough of a residual catcall-and-paper-airplane soul that I have regretted my inaction now these sixty years.&#0160;</div>
<div class="text parbase text-56 section">&#0160;</div>
<div class="text parbase text-56 section">Family, friends and stray internet pilgrims: perhaps you think that I&#39;m making too much of these trivial long-ago-and-far-away events. Far too fraught, too melodramatic. Are you not, readers, skeptical of the idea that he (that is, me) honestly believes that the essence of his being was threatened by a seminar in seventeenth-century European humanism? Possibly you also think that I exaggerate the gap between Harvardity and Brooklynity. So let us return to early 1960s and re-examine the historical context of these events.</div>
<div class="text parbase text-56 section">&#0160;</div>
<div class="text parbase text-56 section">I have reported on Douglas Bush&#39;s theological convictions; let us now turn to his retrograde views on education.</div>
<div class="text parbase text-56 section">&#0160;</div>
<div class="text parbase text-56 section">Bush was, without question, an unapologetic elitist. I don&#39;t mean &quot;elitist&quot; as the word is now popularly used -- as an all-purpose insult to those who are presumed to think that they are better than we because they are wealthy or have studied to a prestigious college. I mean elitist as in &quot;snob.&quot; Bush was an elitist because he felt that education was only for the elect. Once you admit ordinary, common folk, by golly, the end is near. He was blunt: &quot;education for all, however fine in theory, in practice ultimately leads to education for none.&quot; He deplored the ungenteel idea that &quot;students [would] come to college out of a desire for economic or social advantage.&quot; Let them stay in the places to which they were born! In a still shocking moment of undiluted social and racial snobbery, he pronounced that &quot;the rising flood of students is very much like the barbarian invasions of the early Middle Ages.&quot; &quot;Barbarian invasions&quot;? His metaphor is &quot;self-explanatory,&quot; is it not?&#0160; Bush presented himself as a guardian at the gate, protecting Christian Europe from the wild-eyed, uncivilized incursions of Lombards and Visigoths. And how was I to understand the analogy?&#0160; Did it not apply to me? Was I a civilized European or was I a violent Vandal? In theory, once I was admitted to Harvard&#39;s sacred precincts, I became an insider. But in reality, in my heart, I could identify only with the migratory hordes. Although I was camouflaged by my thrift-store jacket and tie, and I did not bring my seax to class, did not subsist on mare&#39;s milk, and felt no urge to sack Harvard, I knew myself to be, in essence, an interloper -- an abominable Avar, or brutal Bulgar, or horrible Hun. Or, in my particular case, a member of the tribe of anxious Ashkenazim.&#0160;</div>
<div class="text parbase text-56 section">&#0160;</div>
<div class="text parbase text-56 section">So now let us circle back to the beginning. Why was &quot;Douglas Bush&#39;s Milton course&quot; the worst class ever? For me, it was not just because Bush regularly lulled his classes to sleep. It was also because in his illiberal hands, John Milton, my John Milton, was diluted and distorted. I was, <em>ante</em> Bush, an admirer of Milton&#39;s courage and I was infatuated with his poetry. Milton is the only poet in the language, I believe, who ever equalled Shakespeare. <em>Lycidas (</em>written in 1636, the year of Harvard&#39;s founding) is in my opinion the world&#39;s single best poem. In tribute, I had memorized its 193 glorious lines. Moreover, Milton was a truly admirable human being. He was the furthest left, the most radical figure in the whole of English literature and perhaps in western literature. Did he not defend the execution of Charles I and the end of monarchy?&#0160; Did he not argue that marriage should be based not on dynastic alliances, but on love and sexual compatibility? Did he not authorize every individual to interpret the Bible in his own way, without the interference of a church or its priests and ministers -- the &quot;priesthood of all believers?&quot; And was it not true that he composed the Areopagitica, a seminal, essential contribution to freedom of thought?&#0160; But for Bush, I regret to say, Milton&#39;s impassioned advocacy of human dignity distracted from his poetry. He daydreamed in class about the poems Milton might have written if he hadn&#39;t allowed himself to be waylaid and distracted by politics. My Milton, on the other hand, was as much a public man as a poet. He had willingly given twenty years of his life and his precious eyesight to work for the radical transformation of society and for human freedom. Bush&#39;s judgment was in my opinion a major error, a disabling error, and it meant that the professor, however knowledgeable, was so blinkered by his conservative ideology that he missed the defining points of Milton&#39;s life. Just as I could not fully embrace Bush&#39;s Milton, he could not or would not ever fully grasp the greatness, the importance of my Milton. It therefore irked me to sit and listen every day, while Milton&#39;s contribution to world history was neglected, discounted, or dismissed. It hurt.&#0160;</div>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>There is no author with whom I feel greater kinship than with Michel de Montaigne and there&#39;s none with whom I&#39;ve passed more hours and days, except for Shakespeare. For many years, Montaigne&#39;s <em>Essais </em>has been my bedside companion, first in the old Everyman Library edition as translated by John Florio, a book which I early discovered among my father&#39;s small collection, and latterly in the 1958 version by Donald Frame. Of the two writers, Shakespeare is the greater, but he is unknowable and certainly not a comrade. &quot;Negative capability&quot; -- and all that. Shakespeare, the human being, lies hidden behind a profusion of characters and borrowed stories. Sometimes I think I can catch a glimpse of the man himself in recurring images or in a repeated motif, but how can I be sure? It&#39;s all guesswork and supposition. Shakespeare is an <em>auctor absconditus. </em>He can be admired, even revered, but he&#39;s too mysterious ever to be a pal. Montaigne, on the other hand, is insistently present. He talks directly to me, guy to guy, teaches me, argues with me. Even though there&#39;s a universe of differences between me and this astonishingly erudite sixteenth-century French Catholic skeptic, I feel that we are good friends.</p>
<p>Why the kinship? Montaigne is so various, so mutable, so inconsistent, that he&#39;s difficult to define, but nevertheless exhibits traits with which I l am in deep sympathy. Of all the important thinkers, he&#39;s the least systematic -- which is a benefit, at least for me. I can&#39;t make heads or tails of his near-contemporaries Spinoza or Descartes because both are too orderly and logical for my unsubtle head. But Montaigne works differently -- he advances an idea, modifies it, retracts it, illustrates it with a dozen anecdotes, and then announces that he can&#39;t come to a definitive conclusion -- which is the way my mind works, although obviously at a much lower order. And then Montaigne&#39;s brain is a hodgepodge, a gallimaufry of formidable learning strewn in heaps, like the last scene of C<em>itizen Kane</em>. So is mine, although it&#39;s a cramped attic compared to Montaigne&#39;s warehouse. And of course, Montaigne writes almost exclusively about himself, as I do in these fragmentary blague entries.</p>
<p>Moreover, we both seem to be at least in part writing for the same purpose. I compose these essaylets for what I conceive of, pretentiously, as dynastic reasons. Because I I so much wish that I had some artifacts or writing of my grandparents or great-grandparents, who left nothing behind, no scrap remaining, I want my descendants to have something of mine. Montaigne agrees: &quot;What a satisfaction it would be to me to hear someone tell me of the habits, the face, the expression, the favorite remarks, and the fortunes of my ancestors. How attentive I would be. Truly it would spring from a bad nature to be scornful of even the portraits of our friends and predecessors, the form of their clothes and their armor.&quot; [Montaigne came from a family with a strong military tradition, unlike mine, which is epitomized by grandfather&#39;s desertion from the Russian army.] &quot;I keep their handwriting, their seal, the breviary and a peculiar sword that they used, and I have not banished from my study some long sticks that my father ordinarily carried in his hand.&quot; I have no &quot;sticks,&quot; but as I sit here pecking at the word processor, I see out of the corner of my eye my father&#39;s library ladder, used for retrieving just the right law book.</p>
<p>Montaigne is not done with the topic. He continues by exploring an idea about which I also have ruminated. For whom do I devote these hours, if not for myself?&#0160; He is eloquent upon the subject.</p>
<p>&quot;If no one reads me, have I wasted my time, entertaining myself for so many idle hours with such useful and agreeable thoughts. In modeling this figure upon myself, I have had to fashion and compose myself so often to bring myself out, that the model itself has to some extent grown firm and taken shape. Painting myself for others, I have painted my inward self with colors clearer than my original ones. I have no more made my book that my book has made me -- a book consubstantial with its author, concerned with my own self, an integral part of my life....&#0160; Have I wasted my time by taking stock of myself so continually, so carefully. For those who go over themselves only in their minds and occasionally in speech do not penetrate to essentials in their examination as does a man who makes that his study, his work, and his trade, who binds himself to keep an enduring account, with all his faults, with all his strengths.&quot;</p>
<p>I wish I could say that I&#39;m as honest as Montaigne; I&#39;m not. I recognize that the &quot;me&quot; that appears here is to some degree different from the me that is me. Although I do not lie about myself, I conceal some of my most flagrant deficiencies. Nor do I blow my own small trumpet. As a result, the portrait that has emerged is solider and also less troubled than the true-to-life person. Don&#39;t say I didn&#39;t give you notice, unwary descendants.&#0160;</p>
