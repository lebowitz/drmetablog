		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I&#39;ve several times poked fun at sad instances of Victorian sexual prudery. If, gentle reader, you doubt that I&#39;m capable of prude-pokery, check <a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2007/12/more-on-contrac.html " target="_self">here</a>, <a href=" http://www.drmetablog.com/2012/12/more-on-sex-ed-in-victorian-england.html " target="_self">here</a> and <a href=" http://www.drmetablog.com/2007/11/empson.html " target="_self">here</a>.&#0160; </p>
<p>My mild animosity toward the sexual silliness of our ancestors originated in my childhood. My father, though in most things a font of good common sense, was, sexually speaking, very much a old-fashioned dyed-in-the-wool Victorian. Whenever a discussion of sex or anatomy or reproduction would arise in our house, he would immediately turn red and stumble out of the room. Early on, I learned not to ask. On the few occasions when my poor papa mumbled something before he bolted, his information was always uninformed, frequently wrong, and occasionally dangerous.&#0160;</p>
<p>My father inhabited an earlier psychological universe and he couldn&#39;t possibly have imagined how the&#0160; invisible worm has turned. If he were alive today, he couldn&#39;t watch movies or TV or read novels. Too much gross language, too much frankness, too much nudity, too much casual coupling. He would have been aghast and embarrassed.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, repression has its compensations. It is absolutely clear to me that people of his generation and earlier experienced pleasures that cannot be realized now. The brave new libertine world of hooking up and sloppy drunken sex and XXX sites gratifies the instincts, but at significant cost.</p>
<p>Return we now to the last years of the nineteenth century, when Helen and the great poet <a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2013/01/edward-thomas.html" target="_self">Edward Thomas</a> went a-courting. In their young twenties, a couple of years into their anguished relationship, they (in Helen&#39;s words)</p>
<p>w<span style="color: #0000ff;">ere sitting in the undergrowth of a little copse in a remote part of the common. Edward had said that he had never seen a woman&#39;s body, and I do not remember quite how it came about, but I quite naturally and simply without any feeling of shyness, knelt up in our secret bower and undid my clothes, and let them fall about my knees so that to the knees I was naked.&#0160; I knew my body was pretty, my breasts wre firm and round and neither too small nor too large, and my neck and shoulders made a pleasant line, and my arms were rounded and white, and though my hips were small, the line of the waist was lovely.&#0160; I was proud of my body, and took the most innocent pleasure in its lines and health and strength. So we knelt in the grass and dead leaves of the copse opposite to each other, he silent and I laughing with joy to feel the air on my skin, and to see his enraptured gaze. For as he knelt he gazed wonderstruck and almost adoring, quite still, quite silent, looking now and then in my eyes with a serious ecstatic look, his eyes full of tenderness and love, searching mine for any sign of regret or shyness. He did not touch me, but just knelt there letting hie eyes take their fill of the beauty that was filling his soul with delight. When, without a word, I lifted my clothes about me, he helping me, he only then said, &#39;Helen, I did not know there was such beauty.&#39;
</span></p>
<p>Scoff as you will, ungentle readers.</p>
<p>I know -- it&#39;s prettified and romanticized. But it&#39;s an innocence that cannot be invented. And I&#39;m not scoffing. I don&#39;t think that there&#39;s a person on our continent or in our century as naive as Edward Thomas was in England in 1898. Nor do I think that there&#39;s anyone who could say what he said, and say it with such bedazzled and wonderful sincerity: &quot;Helen, I did not know there was such beauty.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#39;s a world that we have lost. </p>
<p>(Helen Thomas unveils in her memoir, <em>Under Storm&#39;s Wing</em>).</p>

		<a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2013/01/edward-thomas.html">A New Biography of Edward Thomas</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I&#39;ve just finished a genuinely wonderful new biography by Matthew Hollis called&#0160;<em>Now All Roads Lead to France, a Life of Edward Thomas. </em>I&#39;m dazzled, and glad to be so. The book is carefully and comprehensively researched, literate, sensible, and compassionate. Its author is confident enough not to overwhelm the poor reader with pounds of extraneous detail. I&#39;m not easily rivetted, but this biography was truly rivetting. Thank you, Matthew Hollis.</p>
<p>I&#39;m a longtime Edward Thomas enthusiast. Thomas learned how to employ the language really used by men more successfully than some of his highly-regarded predecessors. I didn&#39;t know much about Thomas&#39;s life, and therefore hadn&#39;t realized (though I might have guessed had I been more astute) how much Thomas had learned from Robert Frost. The two became inseparable friends during Frost&#39;s English years and spent hours and hours together, neglecting their wives and families but talking poetry and poetic language. Clearly, they cross-fertilized.</p>
<p>In fact, if you listen closely, you can hear overtones of Frost in Thomas&#39;s best-known poem. </p>
<p>Yes, I remember Adlestrop -- <br />The name, because one afternoon <br />Of heat the express-train drew up there <br />Unwontedly. It was late June. <br /><br />The steam hissed. Someone cleared his throat. <br />No one left and no one came <br />On the bare platform. What I saw <br />Was Adlestrop -- only the name <br /><br />And willows, willow-herb, and grass, <br />And meadowsweet, and haycocks dry, <br />No whit less still and lonely fair <br />Than the high cloudlets in the sky. <br /><br />And for that minute a blackbird sang <br />Close by, and round him, mistier, <br />Farther and farther, all the birds <br />Of Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire.</p>
<p>The first line of the poem is so casual and demotic that it sounds like what later came to be called &quot;found poetry.&quot; I&#39;m glad to know that there is an actual Adlestrop up there in the Cotswolds, though surely Thomas was well aware that &quot;Adlestrop&quot; sounds as though it were invented by the Ministry of Silly Names. </p>
<p>The poem is a latter-day pastoral which contrasts the hiss of industrial steam with the with perennial birdsong and cloudlets. A brief ecstatic revelation.&#0160;&#0160; </p>
<p>My all-time favorite poem by Thomas is this blank-verse masterpiece:</p>
<div style="min-height: 570px; margin-top: 20px;">
<div>
<p>
						As the team&#39;s head-brass flashed out on the turn<br />The lovers disappeared into the wood.<br />I sat among the boughs of the fallen elm<br />That strewed the angle of the fallow, and<br />Watched the plough narrowing a yellow square<br />Of charlock. Every time the horses turned<br />Instead of treading me down, the ploughman leaned<br />Upon the handles to say or ask a word, <br />About the weather, next about the war.<br />Scraping the share he faced towards the wood, <br />And screwed along the furrow till the brass flashed<br />Once more.<br /><br />The blizzard felled the elm whose crest<br />I sat in, by a woodpecker&#39;s round hole, <br />The ploughman said. &#39;When will they take it away? &#39;<br />&#39;When the war&#39;s over.&#39; So the talk began –<br />One minute and an interval of ten, <br />A minute more and the same interval.<br />&#39;Have you been out? &#39; &#39;No.&#39; &#39;And don&#39;t want to, perhaps? &#39;<br />&#39;If I could only come back again, I should.<br />I could spare an arm, I shouldn&#39;t want to lose<br />A leg. If I should lose my head, why, so, <br />I should want nothing more...Have many gone<br />From here? &#39; &#39;Yes.&#39; &#39;Many lost? &#39; &#39;Yes, a good few.<br />Only two teams work on the farm this year.<br />One of my mates is dead. The second day<br />In France they killed him. It was back in March, <br />The very night of the blizzard, too. Now if<br />He had stayed here we should have moved the tree.&#39;<br />&#39;And I should not have sat here. Everything<br />Would have been different. For it would have been<br />Another world.&#39; &#39;Ay, and a better, though<br />If we could see all all might seem good.&#39; Then<br />The lovers came out of the wood again: <br />The horses started and for the last time<br />I watched the clods crumble and topple over<br />After the ploughshare and the stumbling team. 
						</p>
</div>
<div>
Although understated and matter-of-fact, it&#39;s a moving, emotional story. The conversation between poet and ploughman is framed by the lovers, who enter the wood, attend to their pleasure, and then emerge. The poet is at first flippant and even jokes about losing a limb. But he is soon taught that there&#39;s nothing amusing about the end of an peaceful era. &quot;Everything/ Would have been different.&#0160; For it would have been/ Another world.&quot; In these two lines, I hear gas attacks, trench warfare, dysentery.&#0160; and catastrophic casualties (including Thomas&#39;s own). The ploughman is more optimistic and hopeful, but he proved to be mistaken. </div>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>From a mosquito bite to his lip.&#0160; </p>
<p>Rupert Brooke was an immensely talented young poet, best known today for the hyper-nationalistic World War I sonnet, &quot;The Soldier.&quot; He lived for just twenty-eight years and his death was a tragedy for letters.</p>
<p>It&#39;s easy to be skeptical about the mosquito. I&#39;ve been in the company of these insects many times, and I&#39;ve never been bitten on the lip. Mosquitoes seem to avoid the mouth area -- at least, they avoid my mouth. But then, I don&#39;t know anything about the habits of eastern Mediterranean mosquitoes.</p>
<p> Brooke was a sub-lieutenant with Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve; the mosquito attack took place while his ship was anchored in the Aegean. He developed an abscess and sepsis and as a result was transferred to a French hospital ship, the <em>Duguay-Trouin</em>. He died at 4:46 pm on 24 April, 1915 and was buried in an olive grove on the island of Skyros. </p>
<p>An unlikely death-- as odd and irregular as that of Aeschylus (struck on the head by a tortoise dropped by an eagle), or Isadora Duncan (strangled by a scarf entangled in the wheels of a motor-car). Or the unfortunate composer Jean-Baptiste Lully, who, while conducting in the traditional manner by beating time with staff, accidentally knocked his own foot, causing an abscess which became gangrenous and fatal. Alas, no antibiotics in 1687.&#0160; </p>
<p>My guess is that if Brooke had not been bitten and had survived Gallipoli (where his ship was headed), the &quot;pure and elevated patriotism&quot; displayed in &quot;The Soldier&quot; might have become less enthusiastic. Brooke&#0160; might have evolved in a direction similar to that of his jaded-about-warfare contemporaries Siegfried Sassoon, Wilfrid Owen, Isaac Rosenberg, Ivor Gurney, and Edward Thomas. But we&#39;ll never know. </p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Many years ago, when I was young and invulnerable, it was most amusing that Mr. Barkis, the &quot;willin&#39;&quot; carrier in <em>David Copperfield</em>, offered up his shillings with such agony.</p>
<p> Barkis is bedridden with a cripplingly painful illness. He has a locked box of coins, and although he has become &quot;near,&quot; he has the generous impulse to give David a guinea. However, to fetch the money costs him a martyrdom. &quot;He endured unheard-of agonies in crawling out of bed alone, and taking it from that unlucky box....&#0160; We heard him uttering suppressed groans of the most dismal nature. This procedure racked him in every joint.&quot; &#0160; </p>
<p>Barkis&#39;s pain was, once upon a time, comic. Nowadays, alas, I can only imagine that Barkis has ruptured a disc, and must endure a chronic, unameliorable, incurable torture that will only end with his death.</p>
<p>And then there&#39;s the Fat Boy, in <em>Pickwick Papers</em>, who cannot prevent himself from falling asleep. What&#39;s so funny about chronic fatigue or narcolepsy? At my present advanced age, I tend to fall asleep every time I lie down with a book, even if the book is a&#0160; wild extravagant wonderful novel by Charles Dickens. Inopportune sleep by day is almost as unpleasant as insomnia or nightmares (or insomnia plus nightmares) at night. &#0160; &#0160;&#0160;&#0160; </p>
<p>I think also of Mr F.&#39;s demented Aunt, in <em>Little Dorrit</em> , who can no longer follow the conversation, but &quot;after regarding the company for ten minutes with a malevolent gaze, 
delivered the following fearful remark:&#39;When we lived at Henley, 
Barnes&#39;s gander was stole by tinkers.&#39;&quot;&#39;&#0160;</p>

<p> It were, but now it ain&#39;t no longer.</p>
<p>Dickens died young, at 58, so there is no way to know whether his sense of humor would been softened by the ravages of disease and age.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Unaware that I was choosing a splashy and controversial best-seller, I selected from the library&#39;s new book shelf something called <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Unorthodox</span> (New York, 2012), by one Deborah Feldman, and a sadder, more dispiriting book I have rarely read.</p>
<p>Ms. Feldman had the misfortune to be raised in the Satmar branch of the Hasidic movement&#0160;-- a sect that, at least as she describes it, is unhappy, puritanical, finicky, repressive, ferociously anti-rational, patriarchal, and bossy. Boys study Talmud but girls are not educated past a high school -- what would be the point, when, as Deborah&#39;s&#0160;grandfather once told her, &quot;girls belong in the kitchen?&quot;&#0160;Feldman&#39;s memoir is not just dreary, it&#39;s ostentatiously lurid. Its subtitle is &quot;the scandalous rejection of my Hasidic roots&quot; -- and the attention-mongering scandals that she recounts are mostly sexual in nature.&#0160;</p>
<p>There is a old story that John Ruskin collapsed in a heap when he discovered, on his wedding night, that his bride had pubic hair. Feldman out-Victorians the great Victorian, claiming that she did not know that she had a vagina, an entrance, an opening, &quot;down there.&quot; Is such ignorance possible in this age?&#0160; And then she explores her sexual failings, mostly her vaginismus-induced post-honeymoon extended virginity -- which she blames on her Satmar upbringing (although want of curiosity might also be a factor).</p>
<p>Feldman&#39;s memoir has upset the Hasidic community and there is at least one website devoted entirely to attacking its veracity. And in fact the memoir does contain the commonplace omissions and elisions of autobiography --&#0160; none of which seem to invalidate the whole. However, the defenders of the sect miss the point (as does Ms. Feldman).</p>
<p>The Satmar movement isn&#39;t reprehensible because it dishonors brains and women and especially women&#39;s brains. It&#39;s reprehensible because it is erected on a lie. &quot;We learn in school that God sent Hitler to punish the Jews for enlightening themselves. He came to clean us up, eliminate all the assimilated Jews....&quot;&#0160; What an absurd and odious doctrine! Are we expected to entertain the hypothesis&#0160;that six million Jews died for eating lobster?&#0160; &quot;The first and greatest Satmar rebbe said that if we became model Jews, just like in the olden days, then something like the Holocaust wouldn&#39;t happen again, because God would be pleased with us.&quot; So Hitler and the Nazis and the SS and the camps are a) the fault of the Jews themselves, and b) God can be placated if all Jewish women wear thick stockings and wigs and cover themselves from collarbone to wrist and knee.&#0160; It&#39;s a brainless argument, and one that, if you think about it for a few seconds,&#0160;gives the victory to Hitler. Plus, it&#39;s an argument that creates a god who is even crueler and more idiotic than usual.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Indoctrinated with this criminal bullshit, the survivors of the Shoah and their descendants voluntarily re-ghettoize themselves and, of their own foolish accord, imprison themselves&#0160;into a new dark age of their own invention.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s what I learned from this book. Satmar is a check-your-brains-at-the-door cult that controls 130,000 adherents who manifest all the symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder. It&#39;s &quot;bad things will happen to me if I step on a crack on the sidewalk&quot; raised several painful orders of magnitude. &#0160;</p>
<p>Ms. Feldman may have escaped the cult but she&#39;s still in the dark. She&#39;s left Satmar behind because she couldn&#39;t read the books she wanted to read or wear the clothes she wanted to wear and she couldn&#39;t locate her own vagina. But it&#39;s not her vagina that readers should worry about;&#0160; it&#39;s her brain.&#0160;&#0160;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I&#39;ve been reading about the early colonization of New York city, a subject that I&#39;ve not approached since my days in elementary school in the 1950s, where, in retrospect, it seemed that we went over the ground quite regularly -- Henry Hudson, the purchase of Manhattan Island, New Amsterdam, Peter Stuyvesant, and the English acquisition of the Dutch colonies. As we learned it, it was a sunny story, untroubled and inevitable -- a path leading from pleasant but primitive beginnings to its inevitable culmination in the Greatest City in the Greatest Country on earth. There were large helpings of nationalism and triumphalism -- attitudes that I&#39;ve come to loathe -- along with the insistence that America was chosen among all the nations for peace and tolerance.&#0160;</p>
<p>It appears, however, that there are events recounted in Russell Shorto&#39;s <em>The Island at the Center of the World</em> (New York, 2004) that, if they had been mentioned, might have diluted our tadpole triumphalism. Kieft&#39;s War, for example, was never discussed.</p>
<p>Willem Kieft was one of the Dutch governors of the new colony, and he was a pioneer in genocidal racism. A small group of indians had camped at Corlaer&#39;s Hook (now the Lower East Side) and a larger group had settled near what is now Jersey City in New Jersey. The Indians (Wickquassgeck and Tappan) sought sanctuary from the Dutch against the Mohawks, to whom they had fallen behind in their tribute payments. Kieft, for reasons of his own, launched an unprovoked attack. According to a contemporary chronicler, &quot;infants were torn from their mother&#39;s breasts, and hacked to pieces in the presence of their parents, and the pieces thrown into the fire and in the water, and other sucklings, being bound to small boards, were cut, stuck,and pierced and miserably massacred in a manner to move a heart of stone. Some were thrown into the river, and when the fathers and mothers endeavored to save them, the soldiers would not let them come on land but made both parents and children drown.... Some came to our people in the country with their hands, some with their legs cut off, and some holding their entrails in their arms....&#0160; After this exploit, the soldiers were were rewarded for their service, and Director Kieft thanked them.&quot;</p>
<p>Such atrocities (there were many others) were omitted from the P. S. 217 curriculum.&#0160;</p>
<p>When I read these stories, I feel as though I was tricked. I&#39;m indignant and angry.</p>
<p>It&#39;s all part of a grand deception in which every child is indoctrinated with the idea that his own group is wiser, kinder, and better than the others.</p>
<p>If our great country were truly superior, we would have shown it by telling the truth, the whole truth, not a purged and sanitized half-truth.&#0160;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I&#39;ve now read the first three of the quintet of the much-praised Patrick Melrose novels by Edward St. Aubyn, and that&#39;s all I&#39;m going to read. It&#39;s been a long time since I&#39;ve encountered anything so nasty.&#0160; Is there a word for a place in which every single individual is evil, snobbish, vindictive, petty, and cruel. <em>Kakatopia</em>, perhaps. In St. Aubyn&#39;s world, Iago would have been an innocent. True enough that he was jealous, obsessed, manipulative and murderous, but I doubt that even Iago would have anally penetrated his five-year-old son.</p>
<p>And moreover: if I were a handsome, rich young woman (or a plain poor one) and my date asked me to get down on all fours and eat some squashed figs off the patio floor without benefit of fork or knife, I would run away screaming, slam the door, and let a few years lapse before resuming social activity. So, I hope, would everywoman. In the world of St. Aubyn&#39;s fiction, <em>reader, she marries him</em>, and the couple live miserably ever after.</p>
<p>The dilemma that&#39;s posed by these novels is that in addition to being richly kakatopic, they&#39;re also amusing, clever, and arch, with dialogue that might have been written by a jaded Oscar Wilde. So I laughed -- but whenever I laughed I felt dirty and complicit.</p>
<p>So no more St. Aubyn for me. These novels transcend satire and transmute into ugly spewing. Not for me, thanks.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I&#39;m sure that I once before read a book called <em>The Art of Fielding</em>, perhaps in the 1960s, but it wasn&#39;t a baseball novel; it was a old-fashioned critical monograph about Henry Fielding, the author of <em>Shamela</em>, J<em>oseph Andrews</em>, <em>Tom Jones</em>, <em>Amelia</em>, and <em>Jonathan Wild</em>. (For what it&#39;s worth, Chad Harbach, who contributed this year&#39;s <em>The Art of Fielding</em>, though a skillful plotter, doesn&#39;t have the range or the release or the depth to play in Henry F&#39;s league.)</p>
<p>I generally stay away from big-selling first novels. I prefer to let them marinate for a decade or two, check out their staying power, before I make an eight-hour commitment (not counting naps) to a 400-pager. It&#39;s an economy of my own: there are too many great old things that I haven&#39;t gotten around to yet. But I must say that Harbach&#39;s <em>Fielding</em>, highly recommended by friends, kept me engaged right down to the last sentence. Plot, plot, plot, is the formula, and there were enough surprises and twists in the story to keep even a skeptic like myself turning pages enthusiastically. It&#39;s a hybrid novel, a genre-crosser, with baseball books and academic novels (and a touch of <em>Death in Venice) </em>in its bloodline.&#0160;</p>
<p>What&#39;s best, beside the surprises in the plotting? The characters, most of whom defy or challenge stereotypes, what a blessing. What&#39;s worst? The style: not a memorable sentence or turn of phrase in the entire bland (ninth-grade vocabulary, straight-ahead syntax) book. Most disappointing: the killing off of an important character just when his situation becomes interesting and troubling. Harbach, in my opinion, punts just&#0160; when he should have pulled the goalie and swung for the fences.&#0160;&#0160;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I can&#39;t remember a time when I wasn&#39;t at home in a library. Although very much a schoolyard urchin, passionate about baseball, trading cards and punchball (or any kind of game played with a spaldeen), I rarely failed my weekly trip to the storefront Avenue J branch of the BPL, where there were cases upon half-height cases of juvenile and later &quot;young adult&quot; books. I read like a hungry larva, without direction or discrimination. A few years later, when I reached Erasmus Hall, my after-school employment was to shelve books at 75 cents an hour at the BPL branch at McDonald Avenue (accumulating the $900 which paid my full first-year tuition at Cornell). I not only mastered the Dewey Decimal System but also absorbed everything that the library had to offer in the 612.6 area of knowledge. At college, I was dazzled by McGraw, my first real library. In my senior year, I was granted a stack pass, and therefore was able to waste many hours not only in aimless browsing, but also lolling in long by-passed and superseded libraries-within-the-library. I doubt that those most pleasant out-of-the-way nineteenth-century nooks and corners survived modernization, more&#39;s the pity. Later, in Cambridge, it was first Widener (where genuine incunabula sat unprotected on the shelves), then Houghton, my first experience with rare books, which, I discovered, are to be savored not only with the eyes, but with the fingertips and the nose. Thence to Colorado, where, without the resources of a major library, I dutifully read STC books on microfilm -- which made me queasy, or on microfiche -- which produced genuine nausea. In 1976-77, I spent one day a week at the British Library, studying sometimes in the old circular reading room, where on downpour days buckets were distributed around the room to deal with the leaks, and at other times in the North Library, where I read big hunks of the perpetually exciting Thomason Tracts. In the early 80s, I was able to enjoy the Huntington in San Marino, where the highlight of the day was lunchtime among the exotic cacti and succulents. Later, at the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, I found not only an unequalled trove of books and mss., but also camaraderie with similarly-obsessed specialists. There was always someone who could answer the obscurest of questions, and there were even a few times when I was able to return the favor. At a cafeteria lunch, once, I asked (faux-naively) &quot;what do we do with the orts?&quot; and everyone at the table knew exactly what I meant -- orts the word that Shakespeare used in <em>Troilus and Cressida</em> to refer to the uneaten portions of a meal.&#0160;</p>
<p>Now I&#39;ve come full circle and the Boulder Public is my three-times-a-week destination. Not great holdings, but through the miracle of an efficient interlibrary loan system, and supplemented by googlebooks and other electronic resources, I can find enough to satisfy my unsteady, dilettante brain.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I&#39;ve been studying (or more exactly being dazzled by) the illustrations in a magnificent four-pound coffee-table extravaganza called <em>The Horse From Cave Paintings to Modern Art. </em>It was first published in France (<em>Cheval dans l&#39;art</em>) in 2008 and came to me through the Abbeville Press on Varick Street in NYC and also through the generosity of our local public library (it&#39;s too expensive to purchase). The history of the horse in art begins with the Chauvet Cave and includes thousands of years of wonders. But I don&#39;t write merely to extol the book, however great it be.&#0160;</p>
<p>I call it to your attention because I have a birthday coming up soon and any number of my friends and relatives and readers of this blague have been asking me what I would like as a gift. This book has given me a few ideas. At the outset I&#39;d like to say that I&#39;m not really interested in the monumental paintings that fill most of the pages of the book: battle scenes, hunting scenes, royal processions. Not my cup of tea. Besides the fact that they are too large for the condo, most of them are a little on the pretentious side, and frankly. I don&#39;t think they&#39;d work with our understated decor.</p>
<p>However, I&#39;d like to suggest that friends, relatives and constant readers might want to pool their pennies and present me with one of the smaller, more discreet objects.&#0160;</p>
<p>My first choice:&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p><a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef0162fe1ba88f970d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Silver danish horse" border="0" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef0162fe1ba88f970d image-full" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef0162fe1ba88f970d-800wi" title="Silver danish horse" /></a><br /><br /></p>
<p>It&#39;s known as the Chariot of the Sun sculpture. It&#39;s bronze with a little bit of gold leaf and was found a hundred years ago in a Danish bog, where it had apparently sat for about 3500 years. It might be a little the worse for wear but I don&#39;t mind. At three feet long and two feet high it would sit nicely on the dining room table. No longer bog-bound, it presently resides in the National Museet in Copenhagen but I&#39;m sure the museum would entertain a reasonable offer. I think you can assume that unlike the callous Danes, I would treat the sculpture right and not stick it in a swamp somewhere.</p>
<p>If the Chariot of the Sun is unavailable, or the Museet <span style="font-family: Arial;">(the phone number for the &quot;butikken&quot; is 33 47 38 30)</span><a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#caa8bfbea3a18aa4abbea7bfb9e4aea1" style="font-size: 10px; color: #be000d;"></a> proves to be sticky to deal with, I have another suggestion. It&#39;s not as good, but good enough. <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef01675f1007e7970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Charlemagne_Equestrian_statue_9thC" border="0" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef01675f1007e7970b image-full" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef01675f1007e7970b-800wi" title="Charlemagne_Equestrian_statue_9thC" /></a><br /><br /></p>
<p>&#0160;It&#39;s Charlemagne.&#0160; A ninth-century bronze equestrian statuette. The picture is misleading because the statuette is only nine inches tall, which makes it just right for a window sill or the top of one of the stereo speakers. The rendering of the emperor himself is a little stiff, and the sword that should be in his right hand is missing, but the horse, imitating Roman models, is pretty damn good. Charlemagne and his horsey are in the Louvre just waiting for an offer. The statuette is so small that it shouldn&#39;t cost much.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>And please, friends, no tacky reproductions.</p>

                                <p>It&#39;s absolutely astonishing that I&#39;ve lived all these years in total ignorance of onagers. And would have presisted in abysmal onagerian oblivion hadn&#39;t read David Anthony&#39;s fascinating monograph, <em>The Horse, the Wheel, and Language </em>(2007). Anthony&#39;s thesis is that &quot;proto-Indo-European&quot; -- from which the Slavic, Celtic, Germanic, Romance, and Indic languages, among others, are descended, originated in the steppes north of the Black and Caspian seas. The inhabitants of these areas domesticated horses and invented or adopted the wheel and the wagon, which gave them the technological advantage to spread their culture and language across the steppes eastward as far as China and westward to the Atlantic. This same people also invented&#0160; the chariot -- a horse-drawn single-axle vehicle, which, manned by a warrior armed with bronze-headed javelins, was the principal engine of war for the thousand years that began about 1700 BCE and ended about 700 BCE. It&#39;s a lovely hypothesis, bristling with the evidence of hundreds of archeological digs.&#0160;</p>
<p>Pre-proto-Indo-European speakers ate horses long before they domesticated them and rode them before they learned to harness them to chariots and wagons. However, horses weren&#39;t the only equid in the neighborhood.&#0160; There were also onagers.</p>
<p>But all they could do with onagers was feast on them. The evidence lies in the thousands of midden heaps that are loaded with onager bones. Here are two onagers:</p>
<p>&#0160; <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef0162fdbbeece970d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Onager2" border="0" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef0162fdbbeece970d" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef0162fdbbeece970d-800wi" title="Onager2" /></a><br /><br /></p>
<p><a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef0162fdbbec79970d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Onager1" border="0" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef0162fdbbec79970d" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef0162fdbbec79970d-800wi" title="Onager1" /></a></p>
<p>Onagers are half the size, or less, than the horses with which we are familiar. They are apparently untamable, like zebras, but, uniike zebras, edible. (So tasty, in fact, that fewer than a thousand of them survive in the wild.)</p>
<p>Anthony doesn&#39;t say so, but if there had been only onagers, and not those noble and cooperative horses, we would certainly not be speaking and writing an Indo-European language -- and, for that matter, we might still be trundling across the wide Missouri in oxcarts.&#0160;</p>
<p>From the Bronze Age down to the second decade of the nineteenth century, the horse was the fastest and most reliable way to travel, the quickest way to convey information, the backbone of armies, and the most conspicuous index of wealth and status.</p>
<p>Horses are handsome and intelligent. Onagers are ugly, awkward, and stubborn, and could never have taken part in the creation of complex civilizations. Poets have celebrated &quot;fiery Pegasus&quot;&#0160; for millenia; no one, to the best of my knowledge, has ever rhapsodized the onager.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Having just read the posthumously published&#0160;<em>An Old Man&#39;s Love</em> (1884), I believe I can now claim to have read every single one of Anthony Trollope&#39;s forty-seven novels. Who would have guessed, when I encountered <em>The Warden</em> and <em>Barchester Towers</em> back in 1958, that it would have taken fifty-three years to complete the marathon? &#0160;</p>
<p>I&#39;m glad that I saved <em>An Old Man&#39;s Love</em> for last. It&#39;s very much a valediction to love and to life.&#0160;</p>
<p>William Whittlestaff, the &quot;old man,&quot; is fifty years in age, which, to my occluded septuagenarian eyes, seems barely beyond adolescence. He falls in love with his ward, Mary Lawrie, who is a generation younger than he. She agrees to marry him, but then her first love, John Gordon, returns from Kimberley, where colonial diamonds have conveniently cured his poverty. Eventually, Whittlestaff ungraciously concedes the bride to the younger man. Self-abnegation does not come easy.</p>
<p>My interest focused on Mary Lawrie, who is so paralyzed by notions of duty and honor that she cannot lift a finger in her own interest. It would be wrong, in her conception (and in Trollope&#39;s), for her to imply, however slightly, that her commitment to Whittlestaff ought to be re-assessed. In fact, to avoid becoming the much-dreaded &quot;jilt,&quot; she has to argue with herself against her own inclinations. Gordon and Whittlestaff are allowed to be active in working out their interests; Miss Lawrie remains entirely passive and therefore virtuous.</p>
<p>As is always the case in Trollope&#39;s novels, courting couples are not allowed to engage in forthright conversation until after matters are settled.</p>
<p>Even after completing the forty-seven novels, I cannot help but marvel at this strange Victorian ethic.</p>
<p>It&#39;s unfortunate that Trollope doesn&#39;t conclude by granting Whittlestaff an avuncular or grandparental role toward the new couple and their putative children. What would it have hurt him to have imagined a scene in which Whittlestaff, a white-haired gentleman, walks the balmy Barset woods with nine-year-old John and seven-year-old Mary Gordon?&#0160; No such event takes place, and Whittlestaff therefore retains his gloom right to the end. Charles Dickens, always warm-hearted, would have been more generous.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I borrowed <em>About Schmidt</em> from our local library because I had seen and enjoyed the Alexander Payne movie, even though it starred Jack Nicholson, who was once again -- yet once more -- still another time -- reprising J. J. Gittes Redux. There was however only the most marginal connection between novel and film. In the film, Warren Schmidt is a insurance executive in Omaha whose nasty wife has recently died and whose Denver daughter is about to be married to an asbestos salesman. In the novel, Albert Schmidt.&#0160; an upper-class Harvard/New York/Hamptons lawyer for a white shoe firm, has recently retired, and has lost his beloved, talented and patient wife to a brain tumor. He fusses endlessly about money, of which he has a more-than-ample supply. His major problem is that he don&#39;t much like Jews, and that his daughter is about to marry one (a young partner in his law firm). She (the daughter) teases her father with the possibility that she&#39;s going to convert to Judaism. Schmidt has a nasty streak but he&#39;s a good man underneath it all and one who can return blow-for-blow and flirt for flirt. It appears that redemption from his narrowness will come through an affair with a twenty-year-old Boriquena who doesn&#39;t much care about money and who introduces him to a new world of modern sexuality. Just when the novel seems unable to conclude, Schmidt receives a large enabling bequest from his father&#39;s second wife and all his financial problems are solved. <em>Thesaurus ex machina</em>, so to speak. Inasmuch as the novel seems to look askance at Schmidt&#39;s money worries, it seems odd that it should end with a triumphant, and I suppose comic, infusion of additional cash. I didn&#39;t find the conclusion to be satisfying.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>The relationship between Schmidt and his daughter is stressful and painful and rings true -- it&#39;s the best thing in the book. It&#39;s a wonder that the movie version neglected such rich material. My suspicion (I have no evidence to offer) is that the perpetrators re-shaped the novel into a vehicle for Jack N. I hope that Louis Begley, the author of this urbane tale, was amply rewarded for the use of the novel&#39;s title, because the movie made almost nothing of the plot, or the characters, or the dialogue, or the ambience.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a good book -- and&#0160; certainly intriguing enough to send me scurrying back to the library for other novels by Louis Begley.&#0160;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife, or at least a mistress, especially if he does not wish to indulge with&#0160;ladies of easy virtue,&#0160;of which the neighborhood&#0160;enjoyed an ample stock.&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their pining, inhibited, and frustrated daughters.</p>
<p>``My dear Mr. Bennet,&#39;&#39; said his lady to him one day, `have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?&#39;&#39;&#0160;As usual, Mrs Bennet&#39;s&#0160;stomach was distempered with wind, which caused&#0160;frequent eructations and annoying flatulence.</p>
<p>Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.&#0160;</p>
<p>``But it is,&#39;&#39; returned she; ``for Mrs. Long&#0160;has just been here, and she told me all about it.&#39;&#39;</p>
<p>Mr. Bennet made no answer.</p>
<p>``Do not you want to know who has taken it?&#39;&#39; cried his wife impatiently.</p>
<p>``<em>You</em> want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.&#39;&#39;&#0160; Mr. Bennet was customarily cranky and irritable,&#0160;perhaps because he had not enjoyed his lady for the last fourteen years, or ever&#0160;since the birth of his youngest daughter, when Mrs. Bennet had declared&#0160;that five pregnancies were sufficient. He frequently retired to his room, where, pretending interest in his extensive library, he surrendered to self-abuse.</p>
<p>This was invitation enough.</p>
<p>``Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week.&#39;&#39;</p>
<p>``What is his name?&#39;&#39;</p>
<p>``&quot;Bingley.&#39;&#39;</p>
<p>``Is he married or single?&#39;&#39;</p>
<p>``Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!&#39;&#39;&#0160; He must be in the pink of youthful vitality, and if we can only bridle his natural impulses until he has been entranced by Jane or Lizzie, we might capture a prize.&#0160; Perhaps out of excitement,&#0160;Mrs. Bennet&#0160;let fly an enormous, resonant&#0160;fart.</p>
<p>``How so? how can it affect them?&#39;&#39; replied Mr. Bennet, pretending not to notice that the air was rent with the sound and savor of the explosion.&#0160;</p>
<p>``My dear,&quot; replied his wife, ``how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them. He&#39;ll be so blinded by youthful lust that he&#39;ll surely imagine himself to be in love.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>My first purchase for the new Kindle was a &quot;set&quot; of fifty novels by Anthony Trollope for $4.95 -- or ten cents for each spacious, digressive, leisurely book, many of which I have read in the past as three-volume baggy monsters. Initiating a 21st-century electronic device with classic Victorian novels tickles me.</p>
<p>The Kindle fits nicely with my latter-day anti-clutter neurosis. No need to buy a new bookcase. No need, even, to dust the volumes.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>It&#39;s a new way of reading, but whether for better or worse I can&#39;t yet say. The Kindle is portable and easy on the wrist. There&#39;s a built-in light for cloudy days and the middles of nights. But I&#39;m used to knowing where I am in a novel. How many pages I&#39;ve read, how many to go are elements crucial to the experience. I miss, frankly, the heft of the book, the gratification of accumulating all those turned pages. (The Kindle notes the percentage of the book that you&#39;ve read, which is helpful but not satisfying. And when you buy fifty novels in a bundle, the K tells you only that you started <em>The Eustace Diamonds </em>at, say, 26% and finished at 29% -- information which is utterly useless.)&#0160;</p>
<p><em>Can You Believe Her? </em>clearly signaled that it was coming to an end, but <em>Phineas Finn</em>, this time through, came to a conclusion that seemed to be far more hasty than in previous readings. I was surprised that Trollope left so much unresolved. But then, perhaps he had a sequel already in mind.</p>
<p>I need to remind myself that the first readers of these novels didn&#39;t read them in book form. They read them as periodic installments in magazines. The experience of reading a novel in the course of a year or eighteen months was profoundly different from zooming through 800 pages in a few days. While there&#39;s&#0160; nothing &quot;authentic&quot; about &quot;kindling,&quot; the kind of Trollope-reading at which I&#39;ve had a lifetime of practice is&#0160; equally artificial. &#0160;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>A couple of years&#0160;ago, when I had journeyed through roughly half of his writings, I made some preliminary <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2007/12/interim-report.html">observations</a> about the fictional world invented by Philip Roth. In the course of discussion, I advanced two hypotheses. The first was that Roth hated children, whom he regarded as encumbrances to male freedom and pleasure. The second is that although Roth had invented a boatload of adult male narcissists, he had not created a single mensch -- a caring, responsible, mature man. In Roth&#39;s vision of the world, I suggested, &quot;only a schmuck would be a mensch.&quot;</p>
<div class="entry-content">
<div class="entry-body">
<p>After a pause for rest and rehabilitation, I&#39;ve now resumed my upriver voyage to the heart of the Rothworld. I&#39;ve just finished reading <em>American Pastoral</em> (1997), a novel set during the difficult, still-controversial Vietnam war. I must boast that my hypotheses about children and menschdom are fully confirmed by the new evidence provided by <em>American Pastoral.&#0160;</em>In this novel, children are indeed hateful, and the mensch who has at last made an appearance is nothing more than a schmeggegy. Roth has given us Seymour &quot;Swede&quot; Levov, an archetypal mensch, and behold, what a poor naive schmuck is he! Levov nurtures everyone he encounters, but Roth works it so that his virtue leads directly to his downfall.&#0160;Poor Swede owns and manages an exemplary factory but he is betrayed by his workers; he&#39;s loyal to Newark, so Newark riots and pillages; he loves and supports his fragile wife only to discover that she&#39;s sleeping with his friend. Most of all, he adores his daughter, unamusingly called Merry, who turns out to be, just as we might expect, a devil child. She screams unaccountably from the moment of birth and stutters through her awkward childhood (Roth seems to think that colic and speech impediments are signs of inherent viciousness).&#0160;At adolescence, Merry transforms into an unhandsome Patty Hearst clone who participates in several senseless but deadly political bombings.&#0160;She then goes underground, only to return secretly in Newark to haunt Levov all the more.&#0160;Under this succession of attacks, Swede Levov&#39;s carefully-crafted menschdom is little-by-little exposed as naive schmuckhood.&#0160;If only Levov had taken the Zuckerman route: love only thyself, fuck &#39;em and forget &#39;em; abort when all else fails.</p>
<p>And now, for the benefit of younger readers, I pause for a few refresher sentences about the historiography of the Vietnamese catastrophe. The significance of this period is highly contested. For those on the left, the war was a foolish attempt to block a peasant uprising against neo-colonialist overlords. The Bundys and Lyndonites and Kissingers squandered fifty thousand American and two million Vietnamese lives (plus moral authority and treasure uncountable).&#0160;Nevertheless, as the left sees it, the war provided an opportunity for heroism:&#0160;for the first time in human history, a free and patriotic people, making use of peaceful assemblies, petitions, political activism, boycotts, and resistance to the draft, succeeded in turning an erring government from its mistaken path.&#0160;On the other hand, the right wing knows an entirely different Vietnam war.&#0160;For conservatives, the war against communism was lost because squishy liberals lost their nerve. Conservatives remember only the excesses of the anti-war movement: the culture of drugs, the sexual freedom, the violence, and of course, the bombings.</p>
<p><em>American Pastoral </em>is firmly of the right-hand file. Roth has performed a amazing piece of legerdemain.&#0160; He has written about the period of Vietnam, but he has omitted (or suppressed) both the atrocities of the war and the organized, largely peaceful opposition to it. In <em>American Pastoral</em>, resistance is not political but personal.&#0160;It&#39;s embodied in Swede&#39;s daughter Merry Levov, who is vacant, violent, angry and disgusting.&#0160;By stripping the novel of its historical context and coloration, Roth reduces the opposition to the war to an oedipal conflict between a demon child and her well-meaning but ineffectual father.The novel lacks even the decent ambiguity that Roth might have created if he had given Levov other and perhaps more reasonable children. But it&#39;s a good guess&#0160;that in a novel by Philip Roth, more children would have led not to a widening of focus or to a richer novel, but only to more tsouris.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a shame that so skillful an artist (and one who is not generally a right-winger) has written a novel that&#39;s only inches away from neocon propaganda.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p><a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef01538eb1a2c0970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Drood" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef01538eb1a2c0970b" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef01538eb1a2c0970b-800wi" title="Drood" /></a>&#0160;<br />I can&#39;t remember when I last read <em>The Mystery of Edwin Drood</em>, but I&#39;m certain that it was before 1997.&#0160; It was in that year that I passed the age that Dickens had attained when he left our planet, leaving Drood undone.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>This time, I&#0160;read <em>Drood </em>with a sense of Impending Doom.&#0160;I think&#0160;it&#39;s because Dickens died far too young -- in the prime of his age.&#0160; Not, however,&#0160;in the prime of his&#0160;genius&#0160; -- although one never knows&#0160;what he would have produced if he had lived to his&#0160;allotted three score and ten.&#0160;The novel struck me as a tired and eneravated performance.&#0160;&#0160;Too many of&#0160;the characters are recycled&#0160;from the&#0160;Dickens repertory company, the humor is too strenuous, the clues and&#0160;the red-herrings too obviously contrived.&#0160; It&#39;s only very near the moment of truncation,&#0160;when the splendid Mrs. Billicken makes her appearance, that&#0160;the novel feels inspired in the&#0160;old Dickens way.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>I also read in sadness.&#0160;When&#0160;we commit to reading a long,&#0160;densely plotted novel,&#0160;we&#0160;take it for granted that all its mysteries will&#0160;eventually be resolved.&#0160;&#0160;Such is the bargain that the novelist makes with his readers.&#0160;But this novel is different, because Dickens didn&#39;t make it to the end.&#0160;And so, we read it always tentatively, knowing that&#0160;its&#0160;mysteries will remain mysteries forever and ever.&#0160;So this time, alas,&#0160;<em>Drood </em>was a <em>memento mori -- </em>and goodness gracious, I already have enough of those.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>It&#39;s bad enough to be born into and involuntarily indoctrinated into a religion, but if a person has&#0160;the good fortune to be born into&#0160;a family of non-believers, why should he or she regress&#0160;to dogma and doctrine and fantasies of the afterlife?</p>
<p>But then, I&#39;m tone deaf and colorblind to religion.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Nevertheless (you can trust me here, dear blog-reader), I&#39;ve read more than my share of the kind of autobiography called the &quot;conversion narrative&quot; in which the writer describes how he or she came to locate and embrace some particular god or creed. &quot;Conversion narratives&quot; generally take one of two shapes.&#0160;In some&#0160;of them, the subject experiences a sudden blinding insight (after the style Saul/Paul on the road to Damascus); in others, the&#0160;author endures a&#0160;long dark night of the soul that is painfully and gradually superseded with&#0160;&quot;enlightenment&quot; (Newman&#39;s <em>Apologia</em>&#0160;is the archetype).</p>
<p>G. Willow Wilson&#39;s memoir&#0160;<em>The Butterfly Mosque&#0160;</em>(New York, 2010)&#0160;describes&#0160;a conversion of a&#0160;sort&#0160;that I&#39;ve never before encountered -- it lacks not only a&#0160;voice from the clouds and but also a scalding of the heart. Wilson simply sets out with a&#0160;desire to convert and then hunts for an appropriate religion -- a most odd and unusual&#0160; procedure. In college, Wilson&#0160;reports, she was &quot;in the market for a philosophy.&quot;&#0160;Soon after, she&#0160;became a Muslim -- essentially because she wanted to be something and couldn&#39;t think of anything better.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the key paragraph: &quot;I discovered&#0160;I was a monotheist....&#0160; That rules out polytheism.&#0160; I also have a problem with authority, which rules out any religion with a priesthood.... And I cannot believe that having given us these bodies, God thinks we should be virgins unless we desperately feel a need to reproduce.&#0160;That rules out any religion that is against family planning or sex for fun....&#0160; Islam is antiauthoritarian, sex-positive monotheism.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#39;s a series of reasons so quirky that it&#39;s hard to take seriously. &#0160;If I were G. Willow&#39;s spiritual counselor, and she came to me with such a shallow&#0160;argument, I would have said, &quot;go home, young lady, take a couple of years and try to think more deeply.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;I discovered I was a monotheist&quot;? Mere mysticism, no more more&#0160;persuasive than&#0160;&quot;I discovered I believed in only one angel.&quot;&#0160;Islam has no priesthood?&#0160; Depends on how you define priest, doesn&#39;t it. No Roman-style priest who acts as an intermediary to&#0160;God, but a heck of a priestly establishment nonetheless -- boatloads of imans and mullahs and ayatollahs all laying claim to special forms of knowledge. Is Islam sex-friendly?&#0160; Perhaps in theory, but in practice it&#39;s hard to find a more misogynist or homophobic operation&#0160;out there in monotheismland -- and I suspect that&#0160;sex is more cheerful when it&#39;s shared by equal partners.</p>
<p>On the whole, Islam does not meet Wilson&#39;s three criteria nearly as well as the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, which is monotheist to a overcooked fault, supports not a single&#0160;priest (only a website), and as far as I know, expresses not the slightest antagonism to sex in any form or coloration.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p><em>The Butterfly Mosque </em>offers its readers some very sensitive insights into Egyptian society and especially into American-Muslim relations. It&#39;s also a fine little love story&#0160;-- a young American woman finds a sweet young man in Cairo and tactfully negotiates the profound cultural barriers that might have divided them. Sometimes it seems a little like Romeo and Juliet&#0160;gone all sentimental and gooey -- as though the young lady would be secretly happier if her marriage had caused a Montague-Capulet feud. It doesn&#39;t because both&#0160;Omar&#39;s family and G. Willow&#39;s parents are urbane, sophisticated, open, loving, practical and non-ideological &#0160;and offer no resistance whatsoever to the exogamous marriage. And Wilson is honest enough to admit it.</p>
<p>I worry about the stability of this conversion. &#0160;When a new religion is embraced for such superficial reasons, it can be shucked equally as easily. &#0160;It wouldn&#39;t surprise me if G. Willow returns, some day, to the steady rationality of her parents. Let&#39;s hope so.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Yesterday&#39;s&#0160;NYTimes reports&#0160;that it&#39;s the&#0160;75th&#0160;anniversary of the first publication of <em>The Story of Ferdinand </em>by Munro Leaf.&#0160; This brief novel about a pacific&#0160;bull was the&#0160;first book that I knew and loved. It was The Book of my first few years on earth and I&#39;ve probably read it, to myself and to my children, twenty times more than I&#39;ve read <em>King Lear </em>and <em>Hamlet</em> combined. I&#39;ve never tested myself, but I might be able to recite it from beginning to end with only an occasional prompt. I believe that several leaves from my 1942 codex are still the the family archives (and by archives, I mean those plastic boxes in the basement),</p>
<p><a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef0147e3bcb022970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Ferdinand" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef0147e3bcb022970b" height="203" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef0147e3bcb022970b-800wi" title="Ferdinand" width="159" /></a>I did&#0160;not know that &quot;Ferdimam&quot;&#0160;(as the kids call it)&#0160;was thought by many to be a subversive, unpatriotic allegory and that it had been banned by Franco and burned by Hitler. As a child, it never occured to me that Ferdinand was a&#0160;pacifist -- I thought he was sensible.Why be killed in a bullfight when you can sit and smell the flowers?</p>
<p>It was the book&#39;s language that engaged me,&#0160;especially the one sentence that was my first taste of pure, immortal, transcendent poetry:&#0160;&quot;Flags were flying, bands were playing... and all the lovely ladies had flowers in their hair.&quot;&#0160; Not even Shakespeare ever composed a more glorious&#0160;succession of iambs.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Charles Dickens and I are intimate friends and have been so since 1952, when, delighted and astonished, I zoomed through&#0160;<em>David Copperfield</em> -- the first of ten or a dozen readings.&#0160;At this very moment, I&#39;m renewing our long asymmetrical friendship by re-reading the fifteen novels (fourteen and a half, actually, inasmuch as Dickens collapsed while&#0160;<em>Drood</em> was still in process).&#0160;It&#39;s my third pilgrimage through the collected works; first in the summer of 1969, again sometime in the early 1980s, and now once again (no doubt the last).&#0160;I know a couple of the novels almost word for word -- <em>Great Expectations</em>, for example, -- but others, such as <em>Barnaby Rudge</em>&#0160; -- gosh, I don&#39;t think that I could say any more about it than that&#0160;it&#39;s a historical novel and that it contains both riots and a conspicuous cherry ribbon. I don&#39;t know any more about <em>Barnaby Rudge </em>than your&#0160;average man on the street.&#0160;Despite these blank spots, my relationship with Dickens has been enduring and satisfying.&#0160;Troubled, some of the time, but always rich and complex.&#0160;</p>
<p>He&#39;s the best of novelists; he&#39;s the worst of novelists. Dickens&#39; formula is &quot;make &#39;em laugh, make&#39; em cry, make &#39;em wait.&quot; Waiting must have come easier in previous centuries. It&#39;s a good thing that I&#39;m a patient person, because these 800-pagers can wear a reader down. There are times in almost every one of the novels in which I would be happier if there was a trifle less waiting. On the other hand, laughing and crying have remained a splendid part of the Dickens experience. No matter how much I steel myself against the obvious tearjerker death or disaster looming at chapter&#39;s end, I still fall into the Dickens trap and besprinkle my Penguin with hot tears -- not as plentiful, I think, as those that I let fall when poor David&#39;s mother died in 1952, but no less genuine. And when Aunt Betsey threatens to tread on Miss Murdstone&#39;s bonnet or when Trabb&#39;s boy lashes himself with his empty blue bag -- well, even after all these years, I can&#39;t help but break into loud laughter. When he goes after Chadband and Creakle and Podsnap, he&#39;s unequalled. No one can equal Dickens for comedy. &#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>I am convinced that the finest moment in all of nineteenth-century literature occurs just in <em>Bleak House</em>, just after the death of poor Jo the crossing sweeper, when Dickens stops the novel right in its tracks and directs the full&#0160; force of his indignation at his own indifferent country:&#0160;&quot;Dead, your Majesty. Dead, my lords and gentlemen. Dead, Right Reverends and Wrong Reverends of every order. Dead, men and women, born with Heavenly compassion in your hearts. And dying thus around us every day.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;There has never been another writer who had the magnificent effrontery, the bravura daring, to so attack his readers, high and low.&#0160;Dickens is a force of nature, not to be judged by ordinary canons of literary excellence.&#0160;</p>
<p>But Dickens can also be awful -- sentimental, gooey, repetitive, obsessive.&#0160;Sometimes the satire is ill-aimed.&#0160;Why is it so ridiculous to be concerned with the victims of imperialism?&#0160; Perhaps the denizens of Borrioboola-Gha, on the left bank of the NIger, need all the help they can get.&#0160;Why should Mr. Guppy or young John Chivery to be so pilloried, just because they dare to love above their stations?&#0160;&#0160;Why does Dickens have so much trouble with ambitious or wronged women?&#0160; Don&#39;t Miss Dartle and Miss Wade have a right to be angry?&#0160;And what about Dickens&#39; Jewish problem?&#0160;His bigotry disfigures the page and makes the philosemitic Mr. Riah even more offensive than horrid old Fagin.&#0160;And then there are all those monsters of goodness:&#0160;the weak-tea Brownlows and Clennams.&#0160;Dickens is sometimes faulted for his caricatures, but his grotesques are a thousand times more realistic and more interesting than his faultless, blameless, bowel-less goody-goodies.&#0160;And there are moments of high stupidity, such as Mr. Krook&#39;s death by spontaneous combustion.&#0160;Goodness gracious -- the greatest of hearts supported by the most ordinary of brains.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Up next in my final passage through the novels, already two-thirds of the way to the finish line: <em>Dombey and Son</em>,&#0160; where I&#39;m going to cry at Paul&#39;s death, be offended by perfect Walter Gay, giggle at Mr. Toots, marvel at Edith Grainger, and spend far too much time transfixed by Carker&#39;s teeth.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>In <em>Pickwick Papers, </em>Pickwick checks into the Great White Horse Inn in Ipswich,&#0160;is shown to his room by a chamber-maid only to discover&#0160;that he&#39;s left his watch downstairs.&#0160; He retrieves it but then cannot find his way back to his room.&#0160;&#0160;He&#39;s utterly, hopelessly lost. &quot;Rows of doors... branched&#0160;off in every possible direction.&#0160; A dozen times did he softly turn the handle of some bed-room door which resembled his own, when a gruff cry from within of &quot;Who the devil&#39;s that&quot; caused him to steal away....&#0160; He was reduced to the verge of despair when an open door attracted his attention.&#0160; He peeped in.... There were the two beds, whose situation he perfectly remembered.&quot;&#0160; Pickwick steps inside and has removed his clothes when another person enters the room.&#0160; He conceals himself.&#0160; Bad turns to worse.&#0160;&#0160;&quot;Mr. Pickwick almost fainted with horror and dismay.&#0160; Standing before the dressing-glass was a middle-aged woman in yellow curl-papers, busily&#0160;engaged in brushing her hair....&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; &#39;I never met with anything so awful as this,&#39; thought Mr. Pickwick, &#39;what a dreadful thing.&#39;&#0160; Uncertain how to proceed, Pickwick &#39;ha-hums.&#39;&#0160; &quot;Gracious Heaven!&quot; said the middle-aged lady, &quot;what&#39;s that?&quot;&#0160; &quot;It&#39;s -- it&#39;s -- only a gentleman, ma&#39;am.&quot;&#0160; &quot;A gentleman!&quot; said the lady, with a terrific scream.&#0160; &quot;It&#39;s all over!&quot; thought Mr. Pickwick.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>The expected complications ensue.&#0160; At last, Pickwick flees,&#0160;carrying his clothes and dropping his shoes.&#0160;&#0160;But the nightmare continues because he still can&#39;t locate his assigned chamber.&#0160;&#0160;Fortunately, he runs into his servant, Mr. Samuel Weller, who escorts him back home.</p>
<p>Clearly, Mr. Pickwick is directionally disabled.</p>
<p>Am I the only directionally-challenged person for whom&#0160;Pickwick&#39;s story is a horrible fear.&#0160;&#0160;I&#39;ve had repeated nightmares of exactly this complexion.&#0160; In fact, I&#39;ve dreamed this very dream dozens, perhaps scores of times.&#0160;&#0160;I check into a hotel, go for a walk in a strange city and then, for some reason, the elevator doesn&#39;t go to my floor, or the staircase comes to a sudden end, or the room numbers go from 401 to 405 when I know that my room is 403.&#0160; I wander endlessly until I wake up in a sweat, heart pounding.</p>
<p>And now I have to admit that&#0160;I once narrowly dodged this embarrassment.&#0160; In real life.&#0160;&#0160;I was staying at&#0160;a bed-and-breakfast somewhere in the west of Ireland.&#0160;&#0160;There was no private bathroom -- the facilities were&#0160;down the hall and a half a flight downstairs.&#0160;&#0160;In the middle of the night, after obeying a call of nature,&#0160;attempting to return to my room, I stepped&#0160;into a room that was not mine.&#0160; I was just about to get into bed with a strange party when I realized my predicament.&#0160;&#0160;Fortunately, I was able to escape without waking anyone.&#0160;&#0160;I found my own room (good thing there were only two to a floor) but I was in&#0160;quite a state for an hour or so.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>As I&#39;m writing this, I&#39;m guessing that most of my readers will harrumph their feelings of superiority.&#0160; &quot;Couldn&#39;t happen to me.&quot; My directionally dyslexic friends, however, will understand.&#0160; And they will also know why I sympathize and empathize with poor Pickwick.&#0160;&#0160;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>In order to illustrate the precarious social standing of Mr. Smouch, who takes Pickwick into custody for debt, Dickens described his carriage&#0160;as neither one thing or another.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;The vehicle was not exactly a gig, neither was it a stanhope.&#0160; It was not what is currently denominated a dog-cart, neither was it a taxed-cart, nor a chaise-cart, nor a guillotined cabriolet;&#0160; and yet it had something of the character of each and every of these machines.&#0160; It was painted a bright yellow, with the shafts and wheels picked out in black, and the driver sat, in the orthodox sporting style, on cushions piled about two feet above the rail.&#0160; The horse was a bay, a well-looking animal enough;&#0160; but with something of the flash and dog-fighting air about him, nevertheless, which accorded both&#0160;the vehicle and his master.&quot;</p>
<p>The original readers of <em>Pickwick Papers </em>would have known exactly what is meant by a &quot;guillotined cabriolet.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;I suspect that there&#39;s a joke there, but the joke has perished.&#0160;&#0160;I certainly don&#39;t get it.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Is there also joke in &quot;bright yellow?&quot;&#0160; What is the usual color of a gig or stanhope?</p>
<p>There might be all kinds of jokes in the following&#0160;list of&#0160;socially-crepuscular&#0160;horsedrawn vehicles, none of which precipitate hilarity, but of which the sum amuses me greatly:&#0160;&#0160;barouche, basket carriage, berlin, <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2006/01/new_words.html">britchka</a>, brougham, buckboard, buggy, cabriolet, caleche, cariole, carryall, chaise, chariot, clarence, concord wagon, coupe, croydon, curricle, cutter, daumont, dearborn, dennet, diligence, dog-cart, fiacre, fly, fourgon, four-wheeler, gig, go-cart, governess cart, hansom, herdic, jaunty car, jersey-wagon, kibitka, landau, <a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2010/04/horsedrawn-vehicle.html.html " target="_self">patache</a>, phaeton, pill-box, post-chaise, rockaway, shandrydan, shay, sociable, spider-phaeton, spring-van, stanhope, sulky, surrey, T-cart, telyezhka, tilbury, <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2008/01/the-tarantass.html">tarantass</a>, trap, troika, victoria, vis-a-vis, wagonette,&#0160;and&#0160;wurt.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>It&#39;s been a Charles Dickens revival here.&#0160; The Dickens&#0160;formula -- &quot;make them laugh, make them cry, make them wait&quot; -- works as well for me now as it did fifty years ago.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>I was curious to fill in the gaps in my knowledge, so&#0160;I trotted over&#0160;to the library and found a newish biography of Dickens.&#0160; It looked eminently respectable:&#0160; St. Martin&#39;s Press and its author a &quot;Professor of English Studies&quot; at the University of Stirling.&#0160;</p>
<p>But youch, what a travesty the new &quot;biography&quot;&#0160;turned out to be.&#0160;</p>
<p>Here follow&#0160;some sentences (none of which I&#39;ve altered in the least) from a book which&#0160;has the temerity to call itself <em>Charles Dickens, A Literary Life.&#0160;</em> Prepare yourself for&#0160;pretention, bathos, meandering metaphors&#0160;and syntactic peculiarities marinated in post-modern obfuscation.&#0160;&#0160;Savor these monstrosities.&#0160;<em>&#0160; </em></p>
<p>&quot;&#39;Dickens,&#39; a convenient and perhaps unavoidable label, masks a range of Dickenses, which, taken together, constitute a highly complex whole.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In short, this book will attempt to separate out at least some of the contextual forces that flowed through Dickens&#39;s pen along with the ink at the moment when he sat down to the ostensibly solitary and private process of making that series of black marks on white paper that we call novels.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Suffering is a crucial part of the artistic process and the artist is seen as quite different from the ordinary run of people through his possession of a creative power akin to that of God in His creation of the world.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This aspect of his career can be explored in a number of ways, in his deep respect for his own activity as a novelist as well as in an intense concern to extract his full pound of flesh financially from publishers and also, in a sense, from the public.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A dramatic opening and an exciting climax are desirable features of any narrative, but the desire to impose them on historical narratives may distort the flow that is an inherent aspect of historical process.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But the facts and arguments of this chapter show that the point at which Pickwick Papers came into being was one of turbulence in publishing which carried with it, as periods of turbulence always do, possibilities of movement in a variety of directions.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The serial violates the decorum appropriate to high art and the imagery of the passage embodies a distate of profusion which could be likened to a class-based disdain for the crowded urban environment and dislike of such new-fangled phenomena as the railway.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Public school meant the classics and, in England, university spelled Oxford or Cambridge, &#39;advantages&#39; which Dickens conspicuously lacked.&quot;</p>
<p>I could wisecrack about each of the above sentences, but I&#39;m in a more-in-sorrow-than-in-anger frame of mind.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;Why oh why do academics feel they have to write this way?&#0160;&#0160;Such woeful prose and trumpeting obviousness compromise the reputations of sober scholars and teachers.&#0160;</p>
<p>Does the author of this book realize that he&#39;s&#0160;bamboozling himself?&#0160; &#0160;&#0160;Does he know how&#0160;ridiculous he is?&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Miss Dusenberry, an English teacher at Erasmus Hall High School, was a formidable presence.</p>
<p>It was 1954 or 1955 and I was a junior, carrying just sixteen years of experience on my skinny back. To my shy, inhibited self, Miss Dusenberry (Edna? Grace?) was perceived as ancient (50s), statuesque (5&#39; 10&quot;), domineering (she spoke authoritatively on all things literary) and wildly eccentric. She wore fragrant cosmetics and bedecked herself with so many bracelets and bangles that, striding imperiously around the room, she jingled atonally and constantly.</p>
<p>My schoolwork did not please her. Miss Dusenberry derailed my educational career, demoting me from the honors track in English (where the bright students were grouped and where lessons were taught) to the general track where classrooms were disorderly, students ranged from noncompliant to sociopathic, and it was assumed that nothing would be learned, and it wasn&#39;t.</p>
<p>Yesterday, on an odd nostalgic impulse, I re-read Hawthorne&#39;s <em>Young Goodman Brown </em>for the first time in close to sixty years. The story is more shocking to me now than it could possibly have been in the 50s, when I had no background to understand puritanism or the manichean view of the world. The story is more alarming in what it takes for granted about American culture than for what it consciously critiques. Hawthorne&#39;s world is not and never has been, my America.&#0160;</p>
<p>Not only was I distressed by the story, but my mind flew back, or regressed, to Miss Dusenberry herself, who tried to present the story to unsophisticated, un-empathetic me back there in the Duke Snider/Joe McCarthy/Sid Caesar era. No wonder that I flopped in Miss D&#39;s class. Good grief, was I ever unwordly/unPuritan! On my intellectual horizon, the big worry was whether Roy or Gil might go hitless two days in a row. I had not the merest tad of experience (or even reading) to bring to bear on the elucidation of a dark allegorical treatment of severe Calvinist soul-sickness. Didn&#39;t, for that matter, know what Christians were talking about, except that the women and the kids dressed up and went to mass on Sundays (in our Neapolitan and Sicilian immigrant neighborhood, men stayed home and washed the car). There were no devils, real, imaginary, or allegorical in my deep, mysterious forests -- and no forests either, in concrete Brooklyn. I had no concept of spiritual despair or sin or damnation or salvation or any such things -- still don&#39;t in fact -- not in any personal way.&#0160;</p>
<p>Anyway, back in Erasmus Hall,&#0160;Miss Dusenberry led the class through some stories by Hawthorne.&#0160;We might even have read <em>The House of Seven Gables -- </em>that other novel, the one with the A-word, would have been far too sexual and embarrassing. Then came the unit exam and that&#39;s when the allegorical world of Calvinism hit the fan of naive Flatbush literalism. The topic on which we were assigned to write an in-class essay was -- &quot;Is there balm in Gilead?&quot;</p>
<p>I got to&#0160;tell you, I was buffaloed.&#0160;</p>
<p>It&#39;s easy to look back now, sixty years later, and translate Miss Dusenberry&#39;s question into &quot;in Hawthorne&#39;s view, is there hope for spiritual redemption in a fallen universe?&quot; An invitation, I must say, to turn the bullshittery up to eleven. But I didn&#39;t know the word &quot;balm&quot; and I had never heard of &quot;Gilead.&quot; I didn&#39;t know the hymn and I most certainly didn&#39;t know that there was any such thing as a Book of Jeremiah which contained relevant dark sentences to be interpreted allegorically or mystically.</p>
<p>So I failed, ignominiously. Not the worst failure of my childhood -- being thrown out at home plate when I had been sent in as a pinch-runner was a far greater ignominy. But to tell truth, I&#39;ve never made my peace with Miss Dusenberry. Her bangles occasionally rattle my sleep.</p>
<p>Hawthorne? well, I&#39;ve just kind of set him to one side.&#0160;&#0160;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>The Crackanthorpe name is not as well known as it should be. The short stories in <em>Wreckage </em>(1893) are a good sharp antidote to the pieties and sentimentalities of Victorian fiction.</p>
<p>There must be hundreds of novels which feature a virtuous, long-suffering heroine, who, however mistreated, turns cheek after cheek until her patience is rewarded with a beau and an unexpected inheritance. Think Jane Eyre.</p>
<p>Here is Hubert Crackanthorpe&#39;s version of this archetype:</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000bf;">&quot;A blind desire to silence [Aunt Lisbet], to stamp the life out of her, swept over Lilly. Seizing the parasol, which lay on the kitchen table, with all her strength she Aunt Lisbet across the side of her head.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000bf;">And over the thought of that blow she lingered, recalling it again and again, repeating it in her mind with a strange, exquisite pleasure. </span><span style="color: #0000bf;">For into it she had put the hatred of years.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000bf;">Aunt Lisbet uttered a low, plaintive moan -- the curious moan of sudden pain -- and fell, dragging with her on to the floor a pile of plates.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000bf;">The crash sent every nerve in Lilly&#39;s body tingling, but when, a moment later, Aunt Lisbet moved to get up, the blind, murderous desire returned. Another brutal blow of the parasol, and she knocked her back again.&quot;</span></p>
<p>Hubert Crackanthorpe drowned (perhaps accidentally, perhaps taking his own life) at age 26. His fiction is sometimes compared to that of de Maupassant, but I prefer to think of him as the Dostoevsky that England never produced.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I&#39;ve just read, and much enjoyed, a novel called <em>Mrs. Peixada, </em>by one Sidney Luska. The novel was published in 1886 by Cassell &amp; Company, Limited, at 739 Broadway, in New York City. I had it recalled it from the library&#39;s archives, where, from all the evidence, it hadn&#39;t been touched for a hundred or so years. Why did I read this book? Because a) I&#39;m reading stuff from the last two decades of the nineteenth century, and b) because the novel is listed in the bibliography of the wonderful anthology <em>Victorian Love Stories </em>(1996) edited and illuminated by Kate Flint -- an anthology which persuaded me that although I think of myself as moderately well read in Victorian fiction, there are untold riches out there of which I am embarrassed to be unaware.&#0160;</p>
<p><em>Mrs. Peixada </em>isn&#39;t exactly a shower of gold, but it&#39;s a revelation. The author &quot;Sidney Luska&quot; turns out to be a pseudonym for Henry Harland, who is better known for his second career as an editor of the <em>Yellow Book.</em>&#0160;I guess that <em>Mrs. Peixada </em>falls into the broad category, novel of sensation, but it&#39;s also a mystery story laced with occasional touches of social comedy and progressive social thought.&#0160;</p>
<p>The plot could be next year&#39;s blockbuster movie. Arthur Ripley woos and falls in love with the mysterious young widow, Ruth Lehmyl, who has recently moved into an apartment in his Beekman Place neighborhood. We&#39;re treated to the details their sophisticated and modern courtship&#0160; -- music, museums, poetry. At the same time, Ripley, a lawyer, has been engaged to track down a murderess named Mrs. Peixada, who fled New York after being acquitted on grounds of insanity of murdering her husband. Ripley tracks her from Vienna to Rome and to London, but then loses her trail. He marries Mrs. Lehmyl --&#0160; only to discover that she and Mrs. Peixada are one and the same person.&#0160;</p>
<p>Although there are holes in the plot through which a daumont or shandrydan could be driven with room to spare, the novel is engaging and intriguing. But then I&#39;m an easy mark.</p>
<p>Perhaps our screen writers aught to do some looking at the lower tier of Victorian novels&#0160; -- especially if (as it seems) they&#39;re interested in making lower-tier movies.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>But for me -- it&#39;s time to learn more about Henry Harland.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I have just read, for the first time ever, <em>Agnes Grey </em>(1847) by Anne Bronte, and what an infinitely sad book it is! Poor Agnes, an impoverished clergyman&#39;s daughter, goes as a governess and is daily humiliated by monstrously spoiled children and their grotesquely insensitive parents. Her sufferings are poignantly particularized. The novel is structured as if it were a comedy (after extended tribulations, Agnes marries a decent young curate) but it is nevertheless barren, desiccated, and joyless. Even the long-awaited marriage proposal receives the shortest of shrifts:</p>
<p>&quot;And so now I have overruled your objections. Have you any&#0160;others.&#0160;&quot;No -- none.&quot;&#0160; &quot;You love me then,&quot; he said, fervently pressing my hand.&#0160;&#0160;&quot;Yes.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>And that&#39;s all the romance that this poor downtrodden, passive, beaten-into-the-dust emotionally-stunted &quot;heroine&quot; is granted.&#0160;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, my own personal sadness while reading this novel&#0160;arose not from Agnes Grey&#39;s suffering, but from Anne Bronte&#39;s -- there being not a skin-of-the-teeth space between the bedraggled writer and the bedraggled protagonist.&#0160;Agnes&#39;s experiences as a governess exactly mirror&#0160;Anne&#39;s -- except there was no saving curate to snatch the&#0160;wedding chestnuts out of the fire.&#0160;Poor Anne returned home&#0160;defeated, virginal,&#0160;and alone, to die at age 28, of tuberculosis.&#0160;Nor is it simply the doormat heroine or the downtrodden&#0160;novelist that is so distressing -- it&#39;s the general oppression of women in the first part of the nineteenth century that must draw a tear from the stolidest of eyes.&#0160;Here&#39;s a society that offered no decent options for women, and even Anne Bronte, as talented as she was, hadn&#39;t the least&#0160;ability to think her way&#0160;through attitudes toward women&#0160;that proved to be paralyzing and ultimately fatal.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>I turned to&#0160;<em>Agnes Grey </em>because&#0160;I had recently read Anne&#39;s older sister Charlotte&#39;s <em>Villette, </em>a novel that perplexed me more than any book I&#39;ve read in years.&#0160;I couldn&#39;t make sense of it.&#0160;I&#39;ve read my share of nineteenth-century novels, and I would like to think that I have a general sense of how they&#39;re made, and, after I get a few chapters in, how they must conclude.&#0160;In&#0160;<em>Villete, </em>all the early markers point to the eventuality that young Lucy Snowe, after the customary and appropriate difficulties and misunderstandings will have been resolved, will marry the handsome young Dr. John. But somewhere in Book II, the game changed and the poor reader (me) became confused. Dr. John is allowed to make some bad choices -- sufficiently wrong that he becomes superfluous and gradually fades into the background. He metamorphoses from a major character in the first half of the book to a minor character in Book III. His place as Lucy Snowe&#39;s suitor is taken by a teacher, M. Paul Emanuel, who is nasty and unattractive when introduced but who becomes more and more acceptable as the novel proceeds. I couldn&#39;t comprehend the seismic shift until I read the truly excellent biography of CB by Lyndall Gordon <em>(Charlotte Bronte,&#0160;A Passionate Life </em>(1994).&#0160;It turns out the plot of the&#0160;novel parallels CB&#39;s&#0160;experience in Brussels.&#0160;Initially attracted to&#0160;a young man who lost interest in her, she fell&#0160;deeply in love with a teacher at her school. Alas, M. Heger was not available, either matrimonially or emotionally.</p>
<p>But at least Charlotte, unlike Anne, was willing to take a risk -- which is why, in Charlotte&#39;s greatest novel, witty, forthright, independent Jane Eyre, for all her weirdness, remains such a striking and refreshing alternative to the ordinary oppressed nineteenth-century heroine.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>J. D. Salinger&#39;s <em>The Catcher in the Rye </em>is an anti-<em>bildungsroman -- </em>a &quot;novel of education&quot; without the least shred of moral, intellectual, or spiritual growth. Holden Caulfield, the novel&#39;s naive yet jaded narrator, learns absolutely nothing either about himself or about life. Unable to profit from his various encounters, he dismisses almost everyone he meets as &quot;phony.&quot; That one adjective, repeated incessantly and <em>ad nauseam,</em> might lead a reader to hope that Holden will find authenticity somewhere in his horizon, but <em>The Catcher in the Rye </em>is not a novel that rewards optimism.&#0160; It concludes with a vision of Holden&#39;s pre-pubescent sister Phoebe going &quot;round and round&quot; on a symbolic carousel-- going nowhere, it would seem -- and in a brief coda Holden himself has been institutionalized and placed under the care of an unsympathetic psychoanalyst. Nor does the whiff of Humbertism in the relation between Holden and young Phoebe contribute any last-second learning or cheer.</p>
<p>Even in the 1950s, <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em> enjoyed a cadre of fiercely loyal partisans who powerfully identified with Holden Caulfield. I didn&#39;t believe then, and certainly don&#39;t believe now, that Holden mirrored the anguish of my own particular soul. I was not a true believer, and I was not entranced by Holden. For me, the novel was nothing more than a better-than-average coming-of-age story -- although a dispiriting one because Holden Caulfield does not mature but instead remains stranded in perpetual, painful adolescence.</p>
<p>A novel without hope, <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em> has become an inspiration for the hopeless. In Los Angeles, in 1989, twenty-one-year-old Robert Bando shot and killed a young actress whom he had been pestering with trinkets and messages. In a nearby alley, police found a .357-caliber handgun, a bloody shirt, and a copy of <em>The Catcher in the Rye. </em>Two years later, John Hinckley shot and crippled James Brady and almost succeeded in assassinating Ronald Reagan. Hinckley had fantasized that killing the president would impress the actress Jodie Foster, whom he imagined that he was wooing. In his pocket he carried a well-read, tattered paperback of -- you guessed it --<em>The Catcher in the Rye. </em>In 1980, on Manhattan&#39;s West Side, Mark David Chapman, concealing his pistol under a copy of <em>The Catcher in the Rye,</em> shot John Lennon five times at point blank. He had inscribed his copy of the novel with the words &quot;To Holden Caulfield from Holden Caulfield&quot; -- Chapman had tried to legally change his name to that of Salinger&#39;s troubled narrator. From jail, the proud murderer issued an endorsement: &quot;My wish is for all of you to someday read <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em>.&quot;&#0160; At his trial Chapman asserted that he had killed Lennon because the singer had become &quot;phony,&quot; and at his sentencing he read to the judge the section of the book in which Holden tells his sister Phoebe that he imagined himself in a field of rye with &quot;thousands of little kids&quot; whom he must prevent from falling off &quot;the edge of some crazy cliff.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p><em>The Catcher in the Rye</em> still sells well (15,000,000 copies in print by 1996) and has become a fixture in the high school and college classroom, where successive generations of adolescents can calibrate their degree of <em>angst</em> against Holden&#39;s. But increasingly, and paradoxically, attention has turned from the novel to Salinger himself, who has not published anything since 1965 and, secluded in his Cornish, New Hampshire retreat, has become the world&#39;s most notorious hermit since St. Simeon Stylites mounted his pillar in sixth-century Antioch. Although he is a hermit, Salinger is anything but a saint. In 1987, in a bizarre echo of Holden<em>-</em>obsessed stalkers, Salinger, then sixty-eight years old, flew to California and barged onto the set of the TV show <em>Dynasty</em> in search of one of the series&#39;s starlets, Catherine Oxenberg, with whom he had apparently fallen into long-distance electronic infatuation. He was &quot;escorted&quot; off the set. Did Catherine Oxenberg have a precursor?&#0160; She did, indeed she did. Several, in fact, including Joyce Maynard, described as &quot;the Lolita of all Lolitas,&quot; who was eighteen and a freshman at Yale in 1972 when Salinger, at the age of fifty-three, initiated a romance by sending her a fan letter. These and other even less savory details about Caulfield-Salinger&#39;s life can be found in Paul Alexander&#39;s thin, amateurish biography <em>Salinger </em>(Los Angeles: Renaissance Books, 1999), which does not propose, although it might, that J. D. has learned as little about life as his most famous character.</p>
