		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Irene Nemirovsky's spare but luminous novella, <em>Fire in the Blood</em>, is set in an out-of-the-way French  village a few years before the start of World War II.&nbsp; Just as the plot is beginning to come to a boil, the author interjects an easy-to-overlook but very telling incident.&nbsp; &quot;A car full of Parisians arrived and stopped in front of the Hotel des Voyaguers. 'It's so quiet,' one woman said.&quot;&nbsp; The automobile and its condescending passengers soon drive on and Nemirovsky, speaking through her narrator, offers her readership a few words of guidance:&nbsp; &quot;How many peaceful sleepy places they'll drive through tonight, how many sleepy villages.... They'll pass silent sombre country estates and will not begin to imagine the dark secret life within -- a life they will never come to know.&quot;&nbsp; </p>

<p>In <em>Fire in the Blood, </em>Nemirovky's subject is Issy-l'Eveque and its &quot;dark secret life.&quot;&nbsp; As it turns out, there is as much mystery and passion in this corner of rural Burgundy as in Paris or any other modern metropolis.&nbsp; In fact, the yearnings and loves and jealousies and inhibitions of these patronized village folk soon achieve nothing less than tragic proportion.</p>

<p><em>Fire in the Blood </em>resists easy classification. It's a satire, a novel of manners, a mystery, and also a romance. Nemirovsky manages to depict an entire society in little -- not only its ingrained customs, but the resistance to those customs.</p>

<p>Not to spoil the story, but here's the situation: unmarried old Uncle Sylvio, after many years abroad, has returned home to the village of his birth.&nbsp; His upstanding young niece Colette marries a local miller named Jean Dorin.&nbsp; A couple of years later, Jean Dorin falls into the river and drowns.&nbsp; Uncle Silvio happens to know that his niece has been carrying on an affair and he also knows that her young lover has been visiting not just Colette but also Brigitte Declos, an attractive woman married to an elderly farmer.&nbsp; From this beginning, the story takes a series of winding and unanticipated turns.&nbsp; But Nemirovsky is not content merely to complicate the plot. Her quarry is larger:&nbsp; it's the moral and psychological ramifications of Issy-l'Eveque's mysteries.&nbsp; Indeed, the story, the plot ends thirty pages before the novel comes to a close, and revelations that at first seem like a coda became a climax. It's a little miracle that Nemirovsky has created a story that manages to be both a wicked satire of rural complacency and an exhortation to a more full life.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>I've now read <em>Fire in the Blood </em>twice, the second time with great care.&nbsp; The novella was more intricate, more carefully plotted the second time than I had noticed or appreciated.&nbsp; Unless I'm deceiving myself, this is one heck of a piece of writing.&nbsp; I'm dazzled. </p>

<p>Irene Nemirovsky was thirty-nine years old when she was murdered at Auschwitz in 1942.&nbsp; She wrote <em>Fire in the Blood </em>in 1940.&nbsp; Thought to have been lost, the manuscript was discovered in an old valise and the novella published for the first time in 2007.</p>

<p>How many more stories might Nemirovksy have told?&nbsp; How much more life might she have lived?&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

                                <p>Philip Roth&#39;s <em>American Pastoral </em>(1997) attacked home-grown resistance to the Vietnam war and featured a child of unparalleled wickedness named <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2008/02/a-few-weeks-ago.html">Merry Levov</a>. I&#39;ve now read <em>I Married a Communist </em>(1999) which ridicules the post-World War II political left and gives prominence to an even more horrible demon-daughter. This time it&#39;s Sylphid Pennington, an Iago-strength villain, who destroys her mother&#39;s marriage to Ira Ringold. She does so by forcing her mother to abort Ira&#39;s child, which, if it is born, she will &quot;strangle in its crib.&quot; Roth&#39;s hatred of children is persistent, intransigent and obsessive. Has there been a writer since Thomas Kyd whose writings were so empty of <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2007/12/interim-report.html">love</a> (except for self-love) and so focused on vengeance?&#0160;</p>
<p>Moreover, what does Roth&#39;s prominence tell us about ourselves?&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;</p>

		<a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2008/02/a-few-weeks-ago.html">Philip Roth's American Pastoral</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>A couple of months ago, when I had journeyed through roughly half of his writings, I made some preliminary <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2007/12/interim-report.html">observations</a> about the fictional world invented by Philip Roth. In the course of discussion, I advanced two hypotheses. The first was that Roth hated children, whom he regarded as encumbrances to male freedom and pleasure. The second is that although Roth had invented a boatload of adult male narcissists, he had not created a single mensch -- a caring, responsible, mature man. In Roth&#39;s vision of the world, I suggested, &quot;only a schmuck would be a mensch.&quot;</p>
<p>After a pause for rest and rehabilitation, I&#39;ve now resumed my upriver voyage to the heart of the Rothworld. I&#39;ve just finished reading <em>American Pastoral</em> (1997), a novel set during the difficult, still-controversial Vietnam war. I must boast that my hypotheses about children and menschdom are fully confirmed by the new evidence provided by <em>American Pastoral.</em></p>
<p>In this novel, children are indeed hateful, and the mensch who has at last made an appearance is nothing more than a schmeggegy. Roth has given us Seymour &quot;Swede&quot; Levov, an archetypal mensch, and behold, what a poor naive schmuck is he! Levov nurtures everyone he encounters, but Roth works it so that his virtue leads directly to his downfall. Poor Swede owns and manages an exemplary factory but he is betrayed by his workers; he&#39;s loyal to Newark, so Newark riots and pillages; he loves and supports his fragile wife only to discover that she&#39;s sleeping with his friend. Most of all, he adores his daughter, unamusingly called Merry, who turns out to be, just as we might expect, a devil child. She screams unaccountably from the moment of birth and stutters through her awkward childhood (Roth seems to think that colic and speech impediments are signs of inherent viciousness). At adolescence, Merry transforms into an unhandsome Patty Hearst clone who participates in several senseless but deadly political bombings. She then goes underground, only to return secretly in Newark to haunt Levov all the more. Under this succession of attacks, Swede Levov&#39;s carefully-crafted menschdom is little-by-little exposed as naive schmuckhood. If only Levov had taken the Zuckerman route: love only thyself, fuck &#39;em and forget &#39;em; abort when necessary.</p>
<p>And now, for the benefit of younger readers, I pause for a few refresher sentences about the historiography of the Vietnamese catastrophe. The significance of this period is highly contested. For those on the left, the war was a foolish attempt to block a peasant uprising against neo-colonialist overlords. The Bundys and Lyndonites and Kissingers squandered fifty thousand American and two million Vietnamese lives (plus moral authority and treasure uncountable). Nevertheless, as the left sees it, the war provided an opportunity for heroism: for the first time in human history, a free and patriotic people, making use of peaceful assemblies, petitions, political activism, boycotts, and resistance to the draft, succeeded in turning an erring government from its mistaken path. On the other hand, the right wing knows an entirely different Vietnam war. For conservatives, the war against communism was lost because squishy liberals lost their nerve. Conservatives remember only the excesses of the anti-war movement: the culture of drugs, the sexual freedom, the violence, and of course, the bombings.</p>
<p><em>American Pastoral </em>is firmly of the right-hand file. Roth has performed an amazing piece of legerdemain. He has written about the period of Vietnam, but he has omitted (or suppressed) both the atrocities of the war and the organized, largely peaceful opposition to it. In <em>American Pastoral</em>, resistance is not political but personal. It&#39;s embodied in Swede&#39;s daughter Merry Levov, who is vacant, violent, angry and disgusting. By stripping the novel of its historical context and coloration, Roth reduces the opposition to the war to an oedipal conflict between a demon child and her well-meaning but ineffectual father. The novel lacks even the decent ambiguity that Roth might have created if he had given Levov other and perhaps more reasonable children. But it&#39;s a sure thing that in a novel by Philip Roth, more children would have led not to a widening of focus or to a richer novel, but only to more tsouris.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a shame that so skillful an artist (and one who is not generally a right-winger) has written a novel that&#39;s only inches away from neocon propaganda.&#0160;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Here the all but preternatural patience of metablogian aficionados is solicited as Dr Metablog quotes directly from an ancient (April, '07) posting on sex and the horsedrawn vehicle -- the R-rated entirety of which can be found <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2007/04/regular_readers.html">here</a>:</p>

<p>&quot;Regular readers of this blague are well aware that I have repeatedly indulged my bemusement with the names of extinct or obsolescent horsedrawn conveyances.&nbsp; My point is that modern readers, who know precisely what is signified&nbsp; -- in design, in metal, rubber and plastic and other constituents, and especially in social value -- by such words as Jeep, Jaguar, Jetta, and jalopy, know zero zilch zip about &quot;fly,&quot; &quot;trap,&quot; &quot;landau,&quot; &quot;chaise,&quot; &quot;phaeton,&quot; &quot;cabriolet,&quot; &quot;sulky,&quot; &quot;surrey,&quot; &quot;curricle,&quot; &quot;gig,&quot; &quot;hansom,&quot; &quot;buggy,&quot; &quot;four-wheeler,&quot; &quot;spring-van,&quot; &quot;berlin,&quot; &quot;barouche,&quot; &quot;britchka,&quot; &quot;troika,&quot; &quot;wurt,&quot; &quot;tandem,&quot; &quot;caleche,&quot; &quot;tilbury,&quot; &quot;dog-cart,&quot; &quot;wagonette,&quot; &quot;go-cart,&quot; &quot;victoria,&quot; &quot;brougham,&quot; &quot;diligence,&quot; &quot;clarence&quot; and &quot;post-chaise.&quot;&nbsp; If we notice these words at all, we tend to savor them as archaic Victorian music rather than to identify and evaluate them as specific forms of transportation.&quot;</p>

<p>My point is that we read Victorian novels with one hand tied behind our backs, so to speak, when we don't know whether a dog-cart or a clarence or a wurt delineates rich or poor, stylish or provincial, pretentious or aggressive or modest.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Perpetually naive, I thought that I had pretty much exhausted the list of nineteenth-century horsedrawn conveyances.&nbsp; However, by a curious coincidence, I just yesterday happened upon two more such vehicles.&nbsp; The first is a &quot;basket-carriage,&quot; an example of which I observed with my very own eyes at the New York Historical Society at Central Park West and 77th Street.&nbsp; A basket-carriage is a coach constructed of wicker.&nbsp; The carriage on exhibit looked mighty comfortable for summer travel but would be frigid and leaky when winter winds are raging.&nbsp; &nbsp;A second new conveyance materialized in Nikolai Gogol's story, <em>The Carriage.&nbsp; </em>It's the very versatile &quot;tarantass&quot; -- a horsedrawn coach fitted with removable wheels so that it could be converted into a sled come winter.&nbsp; Are there still more to be discovered?&nbsp; I wouldn't be surprised if there are. Stay tuned.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;Dear Dr. M.:&#0160; you&#39;re directly on target when you claim that Woody Allen and Philip Roth are the same person, but you&#39;ve unaccountably omitted to mention the most pressing evidence.The year: 1972. Philip Roth published <em>The Breast, </em>a fantasy about a writer transformed into one. Woody Allen released <em>Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex, </em>in which a giant female breast wreaks havoc upon the countryside.&#0160; Obviously, both &quot;Roth&quot; and &quot;Allen&quot; had recently read Gogol&#39;s <em>The Nose </em>and Kafka&#39;s <em>Metamorphosis</em>. Just as obviously, &quot;both&quot; of &quot;them&quot; were struggling with some seriously unresolved maternal issues. How fascinating that both of their boundless cups of creativity &quot;runneth over&quot; so to speak, in such similar ways. A coincidence? Hardly.&#0160;</p>
<p>By the way, both &quot;Roth&#39;s&quot; and &quot;Allen&#39;s&quot; contributions are embarrassingly false and flat.&quot;</p>
<p>Dr. M. responds:&#0160; &quot;You know, Professor Hollingsworth, I think I support your breast remarks. I&#39;d been aware of both of these upwellings of mammariness but I never put two and two together. If Roth/Allen aren&#39;t doppelgangers, they&#39;re certainly developing along twin tracks.</p>
<p>And let me add my own reservations:&#0160; the short stories by Gogol and Kafka are untouchable contributions to world literature.&#0160; Both writers create astonishing fantasies; they also manage to skewer the particularities of, in the one case, czarist Russia and in the other, early twentieth-century Prague. Frankly, neither Roth&#39;s nor Allen&#39;s breasts are anywhere nearly as full or pointed.&quot;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Michael Hollingsworth, associate professor of American Literature at Texas A &amp; M University, writes this:&#0160; &quot;Dr Metablog:&#0160; you claim that Woody Allen and Philip Roth are doppelgangers. I&#39;ve got to tell you something you might not want to hear: you&#39;re way behind the curve on this one. It&#39;s been well known in literary circles for many years that Roth and Allen are two different presentations of the same person. But there&#39;s lively disagreement about who&#39;s who. One group, the Rothites, think that Woody is an invention of Philip. The Allenites, on the other hand, are convinced that the Roth who very occasionally appears in public is an actor hired by Woody and that Woody has written all the so-called Roth novels. And then there&#39;s a more radical group (gaga conspiracy-theorists in my view) who claim that both Roth and Allen are the invention of some as-yet-unidentified third person, a prominent New York intellectual. This last theory is just nuts&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>Wow, this is exciting news. And here I thought that I had discovered something original when I identified Roth and Allen as one and the same. Isn&#39;t it always the case; you think you have an original idea but it turns out that someone has anticipated your insight?&#0160; Stay tuned, loyal readers, as I bring myself up to date on Roth/Allen doppelgangeritudinousness.</p>
<p>For a while there I was beginning to think that I was some sort of crank; now I see that I&#39;m part of the mainstream. How reassuring. And moreover, readers, I think that I&#39;ve already chosen my side in this battle. I&#39;m inclined to be an Allenite.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>A few days ago, noting that their careers and obsessions converge in ways that seem uncanny, I <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2007/11/roths-portnoys.html">suggested</a> that Philip Roth and Woody Allen were not just doppelgangers, but might in fact be one and the same person.&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="color: black; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;;">I&#39;ve just now read Roth&#39;s 1970 novel <em>My Life as a Man, </em>which must be the most self-consciously narcissistic &quot;fiction&quot; ever written<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>-- at least since Ben Jonson’s <em>Fountain of Self-Love </em>four hundred and seven years ago.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>The novel is a large helping of Philip Roth, followed by more Philip Roth and with a dollop of Philip Roth to the side.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> <em>My Life as a Man </em></span>purports to be drawn from the writings of Peter Tarnopol, who is one of the Roth’s many alter egos. The first part of the novel comprises two short stories by Tarnopol, so-called, about a character named Nathan Zuckerman (the very Zuckerman destined to evolve into the most highly developed of Roth’s self-projections -- Roth’s very own alter-ego-issimus). So here&#39;s the design of <em>My Life as a Man: </em>Roth, writing as Tarnopol, writes about Zuckerman, who is Roth himself. It’s a closed loop, a totalizing tautology, a pleonasm brought to perfection -- a literary eruv with nothing inside but Roth hisself.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: black; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;;">In the latter part of the novel, the psychoanalyst Abraham Spielvogel amusingly diagnoses Tarnopol as &quot;one of the top young narcissists in the arts.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>But gosh, just because R/T/Z can poke fun at his self-love (sometimes called autoeroticism) doesn’t mean that the novel becomes less oppressively claustrophobic.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: black; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;;">While reading <em>My Life as a Man, </em>I couldn&#39;t help thinking, “does Roth do anything other than act like Belmondo looking at himself in the mirror?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>does he have interests other than Roth?”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: black; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;;">Like Roth, Woody Allen appears in his own works as a familiar continuing persona –- he&#39;s always more or less the same guy: bespectacled, nervous, death and sex obsessed, self-mocking, a deliverer of one-liners -- who may not be Allen but is certainly constructed of woodyallenian raw materials. Allen’s collected works, like Roth’s, approximate an autobiography.&#0160; </span></p>
<p><span style="color: black; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;;">It&#39;s clear that one element of their doppelgangerism is their almost equivalent obssession with self.&#0160; But there are also more precise parallels.&#0160; &#0160; <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: black; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;;">In &quot;Useful Fictions,&quot; which is one of the short stories that comprise the first part of <em>My Life as a Man, </em>Peter Tarnopol tells the story of Nathan Zuckerman&#39;s disastrous marriage to a woman named Lydia Kettering. (It&#39;s a most puzzling liaison, because Zuckerman dislikes -- actually hates -- Lydia right from the start. Roth/Tarnopol claims that<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; exogamous </span>Zuckerman is enthralled or perhaps even hypnotized by Lydia&#39;s difference -– by her distinctly unJewish, unbourgeois, uneducated, undisciplined personality.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span>But Zuckerman’s attraction to her is inadequately explicated; it makes him seem not enigmatic but dull, dense, pathetic and ultimately incomprehensible. It&#39;s not the character who&#39;s flawed; it&#39;s the artistry of the writer. </span><span style="color: black; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;;">After some lunatic adventures, the Zuckerman/Kettering marriage begins to collapse. And then Zuckerman takes a shine to Lydia&#39;s daughter Monica, whom he met when she was just ten years old. (Cf. V. Nabokov, <em>Lolita, 1</em>959).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>After Lydia’s suicide, Zuckerman takes sixteen-year-old Monica to his bed and to Italy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>When she turns twenty-one and is technically no longer his ward, he proposes marriage. She refuses him. Smart girl.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: black; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;;">Here’s the question, class.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>Can anyone recall the name of a prominent film writer and director who formed a relationship with the daughter of his longtime companion?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; Let me give you a hint: </span>Roth grew up just west of Manhattan in Newark; the director in question hails from just east of Manhattan in Brooklyn.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>No hands?&#0160; No takers? Let me offer another hint:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>the young lady in question is named Soon-yi Farrow Previn.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>Anyone want to take a guess?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span>Yes, that’s right, it’s Woody Allen, whose romance with Mia Farrow’s daughter scandalized the nation in 1992.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: black; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;;">Omigod!&#0160; Woody did in the &#39;90s what Phil fictionalized in the &#39;70s:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> he married his </span>wife’s daughter.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: black; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;;">Did Woody read and study <em>My Life as a Man</em>?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span>Did both men imagine that <em>Lolita </em>was designed as a how-to guide to sexual manners? Or was there something in the seltzer that provoked both of these guys to dabble with the incest taboo?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>What, in other words, gives?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> Are Roth and Allen joined at the hip or at the area adjacent to the hip or are they in fact the same person?&#0160; Stay tuned as we explore this continuing mystery.</span></span></p>

                                <p>At&nbsp; first I found <em>Vernon God Little </em>to be rough going.&nbsp; The narrative voice -- a popcultch-saturated south Texas adolescent idiom -- took some getting used to. The novel is a post-mass-murder burlesque, hilarious in spots, but not even remotely credible.&nbsp; <em>Vernon God Little </em>won the Man Booker Prize in 2003, but I wonder whether the novel would be so highly regarded by English <em>literati</em> if it had portrayed England the way it portrays the U.S -- as a country where everyone, <em>every single person, </em>is either a pederast, an idiot, a con-man, a traitor, an opportunist, an incompetent, or just fat, lovelorn, vicious and vacant. The pseudonymous DBC Pierre, an Australian, seems to have acquired all his information about the United States from watching trash TV.&nbsp; He's written a funny book, because caricature can be very amusing, but I hope that unwary Europeans and Asians who read <em>Vernon God Little </em>don't think that they've entered the heart of America, because they sure as hell haven't. <em>Caveant lectores. </em>I wonder also about the novel's thick impasto of Christian symbolism.&nbsp; Vernon lives on Beulah Lane in a town called Martirio; he calls himself a &quot;skategoat.&quot;&nbsp; Will he die for America's vulgarities?&nbsp; And are we supposed to take seriously Vernon's last-minute conversion to faith?&nbsp; I couldn't -- in fact, the last-chapter Hollywood ending seemed to me mighty meretricious.&nbsp; &nbsp; <em></em></p>

		<a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2007/12/interim-report.html">Interim Report on P. Roth</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I&#39;ve now penetrated halfway into the Philip Roth corpus, reading not chronologically but as the novels become available in our local public library. At this moment I’ve interrupted my progress to enjoy DBC Pierre’s Booker Prize novel <em>Vernon God Little, </em>a virgin copy of which I uncovered in a basement storage box.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s my interim report on the works of Philip Milton Roth. No doubt but that Roth has created a stunningly original and accomplished body of work: it&#39;s witty, inventive, imaginative and unpredictable. So far <em>The Human Stain, </em>which I read a couple of years ago and plan to re-read soon, is my choice for masterpiece, but among the Rothgroup are a number of real dazzlers. Not a single book has been uninteresting (well, of the very early works, <em>Letting Go </em>was ordinary and <em>Portnoy&#39;s Complaint, </em>though notorious, was not serious). But everything has been engaging, even if only for the coruscating surface. I&#39;m genuinely impressed. The Roth guy is good.</p>
<p>But, you ask, Is Roth a writer for all time, or is he a writer for this present moment?&#0160; No one can make a fair estimate until the requisite hundred years have elapsed. Nevertheless, my great pleasure and admiration for his achievement notwithstanding, I very much doubt the permanent value of Roth&#39;s work. My provisional opinion is that Roth confines himself to too small a slice of human experience to sit at the table of the greats. The more I read, the more conscious I become that his engagement with the world is incomplete and deficient.</p>
<p>At bottom, Roth&#39;s subject is domesticity. His major characters, on the whole, do not track whales or go to war or cure diseases or wrestle with new ideas or sojourn in the wilderness; instead, they manage relationships with their parents and with their colleagues and with their mistresses and ladyfriends. It&#39;s no vice for a writer to choose the domestic arena: it&#39;s the domain of Jane Austen and Henry James, among many others. Roth, however, presents us with a severely circumscribed domesticity -- a partial and skewed view even of his own area of interest.&#0160;</p>
<p>Human social life begins with the family from which we derive, but it culminates in the family that we create. It&#39;s a cycle; we’re born, we mature, we marry, we bring forth children who themselves mature, and then we shuffle off the stage. Roth understands and engages the first part of life -- the growing out of childhood into adulthood. In traditional literature, it&#39;s the part of life that, recorded in the novels of a writer less satiric and more comic than Roth, might end with a wedding feast and the promise of future fertility. But Roth does not write traditional comedy, and he&#39;s inordinately hostile to marriage and especially to children. He&#39;s an acute observer of both the nuclear and extended families of his west-of-Manhattan Newark-Jewish roots. But when it comes to the progenitive phase of life, he has little to offer: incomprehension, or less than incomprehension -- merely vacancy, a hole, a void. There&#39;s no sign that Roth appreciates that to nurture a family of one&#39;s own is for most people a profound part of the human voyage. His characters don&#39;t willingly marry, and if they do, they don&#39;t stay married and they certainly don&#39;t reproduce. There are no babies, no boys or girls, no teen-agers in the homes and streets and schools of New Rothville.&#0160;</p>
<p>When we (that is, the plurality of human beings) grapple with parenthood, we inevitably come to some sort of detente with the generation that begot us. Not only do we learn about life from our sons and daughters, but we find it immensely satisfying to do so. But in the fifteen or so of Roth’s novels that I&#39;ve so far read, I&#39;ve yet to find the father who loves his own children. It&#39;s as though Roth were deaf and blind to the profounder half of human existence. Children are not a fulfillment; they are only a burden and an annoyance -- clogs to Zuckerman&#39;s or Kepesh&#39;s or Tarnopol&#39;s or Roth&#39;s freedom. (Readers of Claire Bloom&#39;s memoir of her life with Philip -- <em>Leaving a Doll&#39;s House --</em>will clearly remember Roth&#39;s implacable and inexplicable antagonism to Bloom&#39;s daughter.) For many novelists, the non-existence of paternal affection would not be a handicap to artistic achievement. But Roth writes entirely out of his own experience; he’s anything but empathic. Roth cannot conceive of the full adulthood that comes with mature parenthood. So he doesn&#39;t know what he can&#39;t know -- that his various alter egos, even as they age, linger in perpetual frozen adolescence.&#0160;</p>
<p>Unable to imagine the love of children, Roth also lacks the ability to appreciate or describe a functioning marriage. For Roth and his multiple avatars, marriages are similar to children in that they are restrictions on individual freedom.&#0160; And therefore Roth&#39;s hostility to husbands is corrosive and aggressive. Husbands are unmanly, emasculated. Real men have lots of women; those who pretend to enjoy a permanent partnership with one person are either slaves or eunuchs.</p>
<p>Roth writes obsessively about Jews and Jewishness and Jewish culture but there&#39;s a core Jewish value that he never acknowledges. It&#39;s &quot;being a mensch.&quot; A mensch is a mature man who does right by his friends, his associates, and especially by his family. He meets, and more than meets, his obligations, especially when it&#39;s rough going. He can be relied upon. He enjoys his life, but he would never put his own satisfactions ahead of his obligations to either his closest kin or humankind in general. Of such a traditional virtue, Roth&#39;s characters know nothing. In his novels, Roth&#39;s various alter egos not only shirk responsibility and run from trouble, but they judge it virtuous to do so.&#0160; In the world according to Roth, only a schmuck would be a mensch. But perhaps the satirist is always doomed to be the malcontent outsider. A happy Rothmensch would be no Roth at all.&#0160;</p>
<p>Philip Roth is by all odds the greatest novelist of arrested development ever produced by the state of New Jersey.</p>

                                <p>Philip Roth has written some wonderful books but this particular job isn&#39;t one of them. <em>Portnoy&#39;s Complaint </em>is nothing more than a comedian&#39;s shtick -- the undisciplined efforts of a borscht circuit comic &quot;working blue.&quot; Poor Philip Roth. He set to be the heir of Lenny Bruce but accidentally fathered that unfortunate by-blow, the egregious Howard Stern, who is Portnoy raised to a power.&#0160;</p>
<p>Like many nightclub monologists, Roth doesn&#39;t bother to develop rounded characters but relies entirely on stereotypes. The women in <em>Portnoy </em>are types reduced to their crudest manifestations: the ignorant Appalachian, the upper-class twit-ess, the sabra soldier. The worst instance of stereotyping: the narrator himself, Alexander Portnoy, who embodies every single characteristic of the stage Jew except avarice and accent. <em>Portnoy -- </em>or parts of it -- would make a great Catskill routine. But a novel it&#39;s not.&#0160;</p>
<p>Is it possible that Philip Roth and Woody Allen are one and the same person? Or aspects of the same person. Both start out doing sex-obsessed comic monologues and both develop into great artists. They employ similar plots and characters (compare Portnoy&#39;s gentile girlfriend Mary Jane Reed of West Virginia, whom the monologist half-heartedly tries to educate, with Annie Hall of Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, advised to attend adult education classes at NYU by Alvy Singer).</p>
<p>In the coming weeks, class, we will look at other Roth/Allen identities and parallels. They&#39;re both satirists and we&#39;ll explore the theory that Roth is an acerbic Juvenal while Allen is a genial Horace.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>No doubt that Philip Roth is envious of Woody Allen&#39;s more distinct features and more compact body, but has anyone actually seen the two together?&#0160; Or even a picture of them in the same undoctored frame?&#0160; Until they&#39;re sighted in the same room, I&#39;ll reserve judgment on whether Roth/Allen is one or two persons.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>It&#39;s easy to forget that our immediate forebears were absurdly prudish. Consider the case of William Empson, who ran afoul of the sex police in the late 1920s.</p>
<p> Empson may be the most influential literary critic of the previous century. All &quot;close reading&quot; was pioneered by him. <em>Seven Types of Ambiguity</em>, written when Empson was twenty-one years old and published in 1930, was the book with which my teachers were still wrestling well into the 1950s. Prompted by their puzzlement and by their enthusiasm, I dutifully read all about &quot;ambiguity&quot; and I also tried my best with the equally influential <em>Some Versions of Pastoral </em>(1935). In all frankness, both books were far too subtle for my blunt, unphilosophical brain. In 1961, when I was a graduate student, the pious and reactionary Douglas Bush, whose course in Milton was thrice-weekly transporting me to the caves of Morpheus, dismissed Empson&#39;s ground-breaking <em>Milton&#39;s God (</em>1961) as the work of the &quot;village atheist.&quot;&#0160; (Empson thought that Christianity was a cruel and savage religion because it was grounded in scapegoating; he demonstrated that <em>Paradise Lost </em>became muddy and opaque when Milton struggled with the ethical basis of core Christian doctrines. In later years, the literary leviathanette Stanley Fish made his reputation by domesticating, diluting, and popularizing Empson&#39;s challenging ideas.)</p>
<p>Although I had lived with Empson&#39;s work since mid-century, I had absolutely no knowledge of the author&#39;s troubled private life until I read John Haffenden&#39;s <em>William Empson, Among the Mandarins </em>(Oxford, 2005) which at 695 pages is the first of a projected two-volume biography. (It&#39;s far too detailed; let me confess to skipping and skimming.)&#0160; </p>
<p>As a student at Magdalen College, Cambridge, Empson was mostly homosexual.&#0160; Haffenden says that he was interested in &quot;male bliss and buggery.&quot; The upper-class students with whom Empson interacted were gay-tolerant and the authorities practiced a <em>de facto &quot;</em>don&#39;t ask-don&#39;t tell&quot; policy.&#0160; In 1929, Empson was elected to the prestigious Charles Kingsley Bye-Fellowship, which paid the then-splendid sum of 150 pounds annually. By that time, Empson had turned his attention to the other gender and was conducting an affair with a woman named Elizabeth Wiskemann who was seven years his senior. Somehow or other, a porter, an employee of the College, &quot;found that Empson had some contraceptives in his possession.&quot; It was a scandal and Empson was arraigned by the college authorities for &quot;sexual misconduct.&quot; He was stripped of his fellowship, expelled, his name expunged from the college records, and he was even banished from the city of Cambridge (by what authority Haffenden doesn&#39;t make clear).</p>
<p>For using contraceptives! For sexual relations with a woman! For preventing pregnancy! Clearly, Empson should have stuck to boys or kept clear of condoms.</p>
<p>Let us remember the situation of William Empson whenever conservative commentators trumpet &quot;family values&quot; and call for a return to the stricter sexual codes of previous generations. Or when we might be tempted to admire the wisdom of our ancestors.&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; </p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p><em>Annals of the Parish </em>is another book that I've waited far too long to read.&nbsp; Purporting to be the reminiscences of Mr Micah Balwhidder, minister of Dalmailing in Ayreshire, Scotland between the years 1760 and 1810, it's the most charming and friendly novel that I've encountered in many a day.&nbsp; The industrial revolution, with all its good and evil, has found its way to rural Scotland. In Balwhidder's succinct retrospective summation:&nbsp; &quot;there was at home a great augmentation of prosperity and everything had thriven in a surprising manner;&nbsp; somewhat, however, to the detriment of our country simplicity.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;The &quot;country simplicity&quot; seems more than half medieval;&nbsp; the &quot;augmentation of prosperity&quot; brings with it such benefits as literacy, London newspapers, commerce, regular transportation to Glasgow, a cotton mill (not a dark Satanic one, but a place where a decent livelihood may be earned) but also such debits as bankruptcies, American and continental wars, and social fissuring.&nbsp; <em>Annals of the Parish </em>traces the end of world we have lost and the inception of the world in which we now dwell.&nbsp; Galt is good solid Age of Reason optimist, but he knows enough to mourn the very changes that he appreciates.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

<p>The novel is written in Scots;&nbsp; it's not particularly difficult to understand, but sometimes Galt lays it on with a trowel.&nbsp; Mr. Balwhidder tries to persuade the church elders to repair his &quot;manse&quot;:&nbsp; &quot;I made a report of the infirmities both of doors and windows, as well as of the rotten state of the floors, which were constantly in want of cobbling.&nbsp; Over and above all, I told them of the sarking of the roof, which was a frush as a puddock stool.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;Frush&quot; means scratched or crushed;&nbsp; a &quot;puddock stool&quot; is a toadstool or mushroom.&nbsp; My unabridged dictionary does not have an entry for &quot;sarking,&quot; but it's not difficult to guess that a sarking roof is not in perfect repair. The rich dialect, reported with affection and without condescension, intensifies the regional flavor.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Galt's Dalmailing was in state of constant flux, while the various villages of Galt's great contemporary, Jane Austen, are, in social terms, static and immobile.&nbsp; Who was more the observant novelist?&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>It sometimes happens that you meet a perfectly decent, intelligent person with whom you cannot conduct a satisfactory conversation.&nbsp; He doesn't know when you're serious or when you're being ironic, doesn't get your jokes, misses your allusions and references, challenges your assumptions, and repeatedly asks, &quot;What exactly do you mean?&quot;&nbsp; You and he are just not on the same wavelength.&nbsp; There's no empathy, no meeting of minds.</p>

<p>Joseph Conrad and I have been locked into such an unprofitable relationship for these last fifty years (although, to be fair, the novelist himself is less engaged in the standoff than I).&nbsp; In the 1960s, I embarked on a Conrad tour and, as is my custom, began at the beginning, reading the first six or so novels, from <em>Almayer's Folly </em>through <em>Typhoon</em>.<em>&nbsp; </em>It was hard labor, not love.&nbsp; The much-celebrated romantic ornamented prose style settled like thick mist over my hebetudinous faculties, so much so that I frequently lost track of the plot, failed to differentiate the characters, felt myself strangled by the metaphors and boggled by the syntax.&nbsp; Befogged, miasmafied.&nbsp; Even the stories that I dutifully re-read, such <em>as Heart of Darkness</em>, required effort and discipline.</p>

<p>Hungry for books, last summer, I was browsing the second-hand book shelves.  There aren't many respectable options at the bodice-ripper-rich Bookshelf in Bradford, Vermont.&nbsp; Conrad's <em>The Secret Agent </em>seemed like a good choice, especially since I could dimly recall that in the 1950s, the great mid-century Khan of English Literature, F. R. Leavis, had placed this particular novel way up high in the literary firmament.&nbsp; For $3.50, I decided, what the heck, I'll try Conrad again.&nbsp; </p>

<p>I felt my way through the Conradian fog for a few chapters, set the book aside for a couple of weeks, then started once again.&nbsp; On the second or third try I finally succeeded and, for the first time in my life, connected to Conrad with ease and full comprehension.&nbsp; Here's the key<em>:&nbsp; The Secret Agent </em>is written in that familiar grave portentous style, but it's a funny, satirical leg-puller.&nbsp; A bunch of incompetents, playing at being anarchists and communists, screw up their lives and the lives of everyone around them.&nbsp; <em>The Secret Agent </em>is a spy novel, a police procedural, a political novel, and a comedy all rolled into one.&nbsp; While was stuck thinking, late Dostoevsky, I made no progress, but when I came to the realization, not Dostoevsky but Coen brothers, the elements immediately fell into place.&nbsp; Moreover, <em>The Secret Agent </em>is a novel not just for the pre-World War I moment, but for this present decade.&nbsp; It's extraordinarily keen and insightful about the banality of terrorism. </p>

<p>Now I feel that I can tackle those other Conrad novels that have lain in wait for me all these years.&nbsp; Stay tuned, fit audience but few, for further reports.&nbsp; Joe C. and I may yet become great friends. </p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Back in the early &#39;60s, when I was just beginning to learn about literature, I enrolled in a course on the eighteenth-century English novel. I diligently worked my way through an ambitious syllabus. There were more than twenty novels, some of them monumental in size, like <em>Clarissa </em>and <em>Tristram Shandy;&#0160; </em>and others blessedly brief, like Goldsmith&#39;s <em>Vicar of Wakefield </em>and Mackenzie&#39;s <em>Man of Feeling. </em>Diligent lad that I was, I read every single word, every syllable. In addition to the required reading, there was also an extensive register of recommended works. On this intimidating list was Robert Bage&#39;s <em>Hermsprong, </em>which, forty-five years after the fact, I&#39;ve at last read. Better very very late than never at all.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a good book -- not a masterpiece, but very fine, very enjoyable. The plot is&#0160; unoriginal. An heiress falls for a fortune-hunter, elopes to the continent, but is rescued just before the threatened deflowering; a domineering wicked old guy forces his unwilling daughter into marriage with an idiot aristocrat; a man of mysterious origin turns out to be the estate&#39;s true heir -- that sort of thing. But other elements are less cliched. Charles Hermsprong, raised among Indians on the banks of the &quot;Powtomack,&quot; is a plain-spoken &#39;merican radical; Maria Fluart is as witty and defiant and independent as Benedick&#39;s Beatrice -- sometimes it seems as though her lines could have been composed by Oscar Wilde himself. Maria is by far the most vibrant character in the novel. If Bage were as advanced a thinker as he sometimes pretends to be, he would have let his hero marry her.It&#39;s disappointing that Hermsprong falls for a conventional dutiful young simperer, while Maria, too strong for any man in the novel, is left on the putative shelf.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a passage that jumps out at the reader. It&#39;s from a description of two of the novel&#39;s minor characters:</p>
<p>&quot;But the tender interest they had in each other was torn asunder by pride and prejudice, and this pride and prejudice, she feared....&quot;</p>
<p>Whoa, daddy!&#0160; Jane Austen&#39;s novel was originally named &quot;First Impressions&quot; and only borrowed its familiar title from Bage late in the game. It is obvious that right there on Jane&#39;s bookshelf, next to <em>Sir Charles Grandison </em>and <em>Tom Jones </em>and the novels of Frances Burney, was a copy of <em>Hermsprong, </em>which Ms. Austen (unlike your dilatory &#39;60s student) was smart enough to read in a timely manner.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p><span style="color: #3333ff;">Today&#39;s posting is contributed by the art historian, Alan Saxe-Popette.&#0160; </span></p>
<p>Jane Austen&#39;s quiet private life has been thoroughly explored for events of emotional import. It is therefore a wonder that there has been such inattention to the portrait, identified some forty years ago,in which&#0160;the novelist, nude,&#0160;reclines on a green baize fainting couch.&#0160;One would have supposed that writers of fiction and especially film directors would have seized on the opportunities that the portrait presents, especially since the only other surviving representation of Jane Austen is her sister Cassandra&#39;s amateurish, unflattering, and essentially asexual sketch. The Austen nude has faded inexplicably from view.&#0160;Older readers of this blague&#0160;will surely remember the mid-1960s flurry of journalistic interest, some of it nasty and anti-feminist -- a cover story in <em>Time</em> (&quot;Did Jane Disrobe&quot;) as well as the scandalmongering reportage of Huntley and Brinkley.&#0160; But just like the revelations concerning Wordsworth&#39;s French mistress and like the notoriety that greeted Edith Wharton&#39;s pornographic short story <em>Beatrice Palmato</em>, the brouhaha over the Austen nude quickly evaporated.</p>
<p>The portrait itself, a full-length study in chalk and colored pencils, resides in the Carl H. Pforzheimer Collection of Shelley and his Circle, which is housed in Room 319 of the New York Public Library, and&#0160; may be viewed upon request.&#0160;Perhaps it is unfortunate that the first account of the Austen nude appeared in the pages of the <em>Keats-Shelley Journal</em>, a publication sponsored by the Pforzheimer.&#0160; More scholarly attention might have been paid if the identification of the portrait had been announced in a journal of larger circulation, such as <em>Nineteenth-Century Fiction</em> or <em>Romantic Studies.</em></p>
<p>The late R. W. Chapman, who knew more about Jane Austen than any scholar of his generation, resisted the idea that the portrait was genuine.&#0160;His attack on its authenticity, published as an appendix to the revised edition of the <em>Complete Works of Jane Austen</em>, is scathing, but is rather a reflection&#0160;of Chapman&#39;s Victorian prejudices than of the facts. Chapman was a traditionalist who believed that young females, even brilliant female novelists, should be, above all, decorous.&#0160;His Jane Austen was a bulwark of conservative and hierarchical values and he would certainly not have recognized the modern revisionist conception that situates the novelist in an uneasy alliance with transgression and subversion. In private, moreover, Chapman was notoriously prudish.&#0160;He is reported to have confessed to his great friend Kathleen Tillotson (herself a well-known scholar of English fiction) that &quot;I just don&#39;t want to go to my grave thinking that I&#39;ve looked upon dear Miss Austen&#39;s pubic hair.&quot;</p>
<p>In the 1960s, there was considerable resistance to the authenticity of the portrait, perhaps because, compared to Cassandra&#39;s prim drawing, the new rendering revealed a young woman in full beauty and bloom.&#0160;Jane retains the familiar apple cheeks and the dark hair, but her eyes are knowing and forthright rather than subdued, and her long, glossy and loose black locks, secured only by a single cherry-colored ribbon, appear as they were described by Jane Austen&#39;s grand-niece, who recalled her aunt having &quot;large dark eyes and a brilliant complexion, and long long black hair down to her knees.&quot; Opinions will of course vary, but many will find that in this portrait, Jane looks somewhat Italian or Gypsy or perhaps even Levantine. Her expression is eager, her waist slim, her legs short but shapely, and her breasts, despite their surprisingly large aureoles, magnificent.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>Misgivings about the portrait&#39;s authenticity survived even until the 1970s.&#0160;But then it was established that the chamber in which Austen posed was the drawing room at Steventon that she shared with Cassandra.&#0160;There&#39;s a useful description in Constance Hill&#39;s <em>Jane Austen, Her Homes and Friends</em> (1902). Hill, it is well known, had access to the Lefroy family papers.&#0160;The Lefroys were important connections of the Austens. It was James Lefroy who wooed Jane and then inexplicably broke off his relationship with her and retired to Ireland.&#0160;Jane&#39;s brother James Austen&#39;s daughter married a Lefroy;&#0160;Jane&#39;s grand-niece Anna Lefroy, the child of this union, left a remembrance of her great-aunt&#39;s sitting room.&#0160;&quot;I remember,&quot; wrote Anna, &quot;the common looking carpet with its chocolate ground that covered the floor, and some portions of furniture.&#0160;A pointed press, with shelves above for books, that stood with its back on the wall next the Bedroom, &amp; opposite the fireplace;&#0160;my Aunt Jane&#39;s Pianoforte -- &amp; above all, on a table between the windows, above which hung a looking glass, 2 tonbridge-ware work boxes of oval shape, fitted up with ivory barrels containing reels for silk, yard measures, etc.&quot; In the portrait, these two same oval Tunbridge work-boxes appear just to the left and behind Jane Austen&#39;s head;&#0160;the keyboard of &quot;Aunt Jane&#39;s Pianoforte&quot; is in part visible to the right; the oval cheval-glass is exactly as Anna described it.&#0160;Moreover, the ingenious young art historian Oksana Sartry, who, using powerful magnifiers, was able to identify the books in the press, discovered not only Richardson&#39;s <em>Sir Charles Grandison</em> and Robert Bage&#39;s <em>Hermsprong</em>, both novels known to have been much studied by Austen, but also a folio with the words &quot;Volume the Second&quot; inscribed on its spine. &quot;Volume the Second&quot; was the name that the novelist gave her manuscript collection of early works (which included the unfinished novel, <em>The Watsons).</em>&#0160;With this confirmatory evidence, skepticism was at last dispelled. Austen&#39;s remark to her sister Cassandra (reporting on a day spent with James Lefroy), &quot;imagine to yourself everything most profligate and shocking&quot; took on new meaning.&#0160; And what did Jane mean when she wrote to her sister, &quot;here I am once more in this Scene of Dissipation &amp; vice, and I begin already to find my Morals corrupted.&quot;</p>
<p>What was the exact occasion for the portrait and why was it found among the Lefroy papers?&#0160;There are two views.&#0160;The first is that Jane sent it to James Lefroy as part of the courtship process: &quot;here&#39;s what you get if you marry me.&quot;&#0160;This explanation is certainly possible, but the greater likelihood is that it was a &quot;revenge&quot; portrait: &quot;here&#39;s what you have scorned.&quot;</p>
<p>That the drawing has sexual content is undeniable, but it is absurd to think, as some have suggested, that Jane Austen would allow herself to be depicted in a post-orgasmic state.&#0160;It is true that Jane&#39;s skin is rosy and flushed and that her plump nipples are erect, but the placement of her hand just above the tendrils of abundant black hair is traditional and would not seem to indicate that she had pleasured herself.&#0160;Those who argue that Jane had recently masturbated seem, frankly, to have surrendered to prurience. I myself, after the very closest scrutiny, can discover no evidence whatsoever of what one writer has called &quot;a clitoral cleft in arousal.&quot;&#0160;Jane Austen was bold, but she would never, ever, have exceeded the bounds of modesty.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>A third of the way through <em>Anna Karenina -- </em>the finest novel in this or any other universe -- Anna&#39;s deceived husband Karenin reluctantly brings himself to consult with a famous divorce lawyer.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0066cc;">The lawyer was short, stocky, and bald, with a dark, reddish beard, long light eyebrows, and a bulging forehead.&#0160; He was dressed like a bridegroom, from his cravat and double watch chain to his patent leather boots.&#0160; He had a clever, rustic face, but his clothes were dandified and in poor taste....&#0160; Won&#39;t you sit down?&quot;&#0160; He indicated an armchair beside a writing desk covered with papers, and sat down himself behind the desk, rubbing together his little hands with their short fingers overgrown with fair hairs, and leaning his head over to one side.&#0160; </span></p>
<p>The lawyer&#39;s &quot;clever rustic face&quot; is the tipoff that he&#39;s of peasant origin and probably only a generation or two away from scythe and flail. With his pretentious get-up and his bulging forehead and his stubby hirsute fingers, he is repulsive, even brutish. O, the indignity of it all -- an aristocrat like Karenin having to seek help from such a pretentious upstart!</p>
<p>And there&#39;s worse. The lawyer is not only a social-climber; he&#39;s also a ruthless opportunist.&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p><span style="color: #0066cc;">He had just settled into this pose when a moth flew over the table:&#0160; with a rapidity it would have been impossible to expect, the lawyer unlocked his hands, caught the moth, and again assumed his previous posture.&#0160; </span></p>
<p>I would not want to assert that Karenin is precisely a moth. Nevertheless, Tolstoi certainly suggests that, given half a chance, the lawyer would not hesitate to strip his client&#39;s wings. It&#39;s clear that the awkward relations between the lawyer (whom Tolstoi never even bothers to name) and Karenin are governed by centuries of master-serf antagonism and by the prospect of revenge.&#0160;</p>
<p>Tolstoi quickly brings this episode to a close and never brings the lawyer back on stage. But he lets him exit exultantly.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0066cc;">He bowed deferentially, showing his client out the door. But once he was alone, he abandoned himself to his glee.&#0160; </span></p>
<p>Our lawyer now decides that it is time to give up moth-catching.&#0160; Instead,</p>
<p><span style="color: #0066cc;">he had definitely made up his mind to have his furniture reupholstered in plush the following winter, like Sigonin&#39;s.&#0160; </span></p>
<p>The dog-eat-dog lawyer is convinced that he can transform Karenin&#39;s distress into hard cash. The fees, which he savors prematurely, will allow him to catch up with his rival.</p>
<p>The world of <em>Anna Karenina </em>is both tough and unsentimental -- and revealed with great economy by its accomplished creator. It&#39;s a long novel, but packed with significance, every rift loaded with rich shining ore.&#0160; olstoi takes on all the great perennial and nineteenth-century issues -- class, wealth, family, labor, spirituality, city and country, science, women&#39;s rights, royalty and democracy, agricultural reform, bureaucracy, sexuality, etc. -- but he still manages to extract significance even from the lowly, Czarist moth.&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>It had been thirty years since I re-read <em>Anna Karenina. </em>Now I&#39;ve resolved to make it at least a biennial event. It&#39;s too astonishing a novel to let lie fallow.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Last week I read and was much impressed by Jhumpa Lahiri&#39;s collection of short fiction called <em>Interpreter of Maladies</em> (1999), especially the first story &quot;A Temporary Matter,&quot; which shouldn&#39;t leave a dry eye in the house. I&#39;ve now read Lahiri&#39;s only published novel, <em>The Namesake</em>(2003). It&#39;s a fine book. I didn&#39;t know, although I should have, that a film of <em>The Namesake,</em> directed by the great Mira Nair, is now in release. I&#39;ll try to see it.</p>
<p>Lahiri writes about Bengali immigrants in America. Acculturation is not a new subject in our fiction. Like other groups, the Bengalis bring their own flavor to the American gallimaufry. In <em>The Namesake</em><em>, </em>the first generation keeps the customs and the food and largely self-segregates; members of the second generation go to good colleges and become engineers and doctors, understand but don&#39;t write Bengali, eat pizza and Chinese takeout, and aren&#39;t keen about arranged marriages.</p>
<p>In Bengali society, individuals apparently have two names: an official public name, and what Lahiri calls a pet name, but which anthropologists call a hypocoristic. The central character in <em>The Namesake </em>was supposed to be called Nikhil, but through a bureaucratic error, his pet name, Gogol, became his school name. So he goes through the first years of his life as Gogol Gangulia. The name inhibits and embarrasses him. Before he matriculates at Yale, he changes his name back to Nikhil, yet he&#39;s always caught between the two identities signified by these rival appellations.&#0160;</p>
<p>Jhumpa Lahiri is a pseudonym for Nilanjana Sudeshna. She&#39;s married to Alberto Vourvoulias-Bush. I can&#39;t imagine what&#39;s on her passport or what&#39;s she&#39;s named her two children, but it&#39;s a sure thing that she&#39;s thought more than a little about nomenclature&#0160; -- as must anyone who feels that his name doesn&#39;t properly fit his character. I myself am ambivalent about my own name.&#0160; Vivian de St. Vrain isn&#39;t exactly &quot;me,&quot; if the truth by told. It&#39;s French, and I don&#39;t always feel French. My teachers couldn&#39;t always pronounce my given name properly, and I had to correct them, which was embarrassing for a shy youth. And Vivian -- it&#39;s so ambisexual. I would have preferred to have been named something decisive and less ethnic. I should have had Gogol&#39;s courage. Or Nilanjana Sudeshna&#39;s.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p><em>The Bridge of San Luis Rey, </em>although published in 1927, was still widely read in the 1950s both by the&#0160; general public and by students in classrooms all over America. It&#39;s a fine novel but it&#39;s unfortunate that Thornton Wilder&#39;s philosophical premise is so naive and lame. In 1714 a rope bridge over a gorge in Peru breaks and five people perish. Brother Juniper investigates the lives of the fallen, assuming that the good lord wouldn&#39;t have allowed them to die without a reason. Eventually, the well-meaning priest learns that the five victims were no worse and no better than any other quintet of ordinary mortals. His conclusion is displeasing to officialdom and both he and his compilation of facts are burnt by the Inquisition.</p>
<p>By the oddest of odd coincidences, I had recently read an essay on the rope bridges of the Incas, in which I learned that, though brilliantly designed, these bridges required annual renewal. My reading of <em>The Bridge of San Luis Rey w</em>as therefore colored by questions not of theology but of engineering. <em>Why didn&#39;t they repair the damn bridge?&#0160; Why did they think that a fiber bridge wouldn&#39;t rot?&#0160; Why doesn&#39;t Brother Juniper investigate the bridge maintenance department?&#0160;</em>The conclusions to which the novel seems to come -- that a) sometimes good people die for no good reason, b) that god is either indifferent or not there at all, and c) the Spanish inquisition was unpleasant -- don&#39;t seem particularly challenging. Is it possible that the novel&#39;s theses were daring in the 50s classroom? &#0160;They seem mighty tame today.</p>
<p>Though the frame of <em>The Bridge of San Luis Rey </em>is bland, the accounts of the five people who die are sharp and colorful and imaginative and rather beautifully written. There are moments, in fact, when Wilder&#39;s storytelling seemed almost post-modern. Here&#39;s part of a paragraph about the twins Manuel and Estaban. To me, it sounds like an extract from <em>The Hundred Years of Solitude. </em></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Because they had no family, because they were twins, and because they were brought up by women, they were silent. There was in them a curious shame in regard to their resemblance. They had to live in a world where it was the subject of continual comment and joking. It was never funny to them and they suffered the eternal pleasantries with stolid patience. From the years when they first learned to speak they invented a secret language for themselves, one that was scarcely dependent on Spanish for its vocabulary, or even for its syntax. They resorted to it only where they were alone, or at great intervals in moments of stress whispered it in the presence of others. The Archbishop of Lima was something of a philologist; he dabbled in dialects; he had even evolved quite a brilliant table for the vowel and consonant changes from Latin into Spanish and from Spanish into Indian-Spanish. He was storing up notebooks of quaint lore against an amusing old age he planned to offer himself back on his estates outside Segovia. So when he heard one day about the secret language of the twin brothers, he trimmed some quills and sent for them. The boys stood humiliated upon the rich carpets of his study while he tried to extract from them their <em>bread </em>and <em>tree </em>and <em>I see </em>and <em>I saw.</em> They did not know why the experience was so horrible to them. They bled....&#0160; </span></p>
<p>I think if this extract were presented to ten literate readers, nine of them would immediately guess &quot;Marquez.&quot; Of course, its Marquezness would be even more obvious if Manuel and Estaban would fly up to the ceiling or be transformed into a thousand glorious butterflies. I don&#39;t know whether Marquez ever read <em>The Bridge of San Luis Rey, </em>but I certainly wouldn&#39;t be surprised to discover that he had done so.&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Incidentally, Manuel dies and his twin Estaban wrestles with &quot;the guilt of the survivor.&quot; Is it relevant that Thornton Wilder&#39;s own twin died at birth?&#0160; And does it follow that Wilder, despite the fact that he came from a large and accomplished family, might well be thought of as some curious sort of replacement child?&#0160;</p>
                        </div>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p><em>Rules for Old Men Waiting </em>(Random House, 2005) is both a good and bad novel. Some of the time it&#39;s rather wonderful, but there are long stretches that are maximally pedestrian. It&#39;s distinctly odd that the story-within-a story -- a WWI morality about good and evil in the face of combat-- is gritty and real and exciting, while the frame is flaccid and unconvincing and also offers some of the woodenest dialog I&#39;ve read in the new millennium.&#0160;<em>Rules for Old Men Waiting </em>is a first novel by a sexagenarian that recounts the story of an old man who&#39;s decided to devote his last days to writing fiction. It&#39;s less involuted than it sounds but still a little too self-consciously theatrical. Pouncey must have had tons of trouble bringing the novel to a close, because in the last few pages he invents a new character to help him staple on an ending. Nevertheless, the novel is an honest, respectable effort -- and extremely effective when Pouncey sticks with his strengths.&#0160;</p>
<p>My geezer group is going to read <em>Rules for Old Men Waiting </em>later this month, so stay tuned for a fuller report.</p>

		<a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2007/04/what_we_read_in_1.html">What We Read in the Fifties:  Scaramouche</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>For the life of me, I cannot remember whether I read <em>Scaramouche</em> because I was entranced by the movie, or whether it was the other way around, and I surrendered my 16 cents to the Leader Theater because I had already fallen in love with Rafael Sabatini&#39;s historical romances. I know that I gorged myself on huge helpings of Sabatini -- not only <em>Scaramouche</em> and <em>Captain Blood,</em> but everything else in the rich collection of the McDonald Avenue library. <em>Scaramouche</em>, first published in 1921, enjoyed a second burst of popularity when the Mel Ferrer-Stewart Granger Technicolor swashbuckler hit the screens in 1952. I&#39;ve now re-read the novel, and while it lacks the magic that it had for my 13-year-old self, and, moreover, is awkwardly plotted, and stilted, and thin, and obvious, it&#39;s nevertheless an engaging adventure story. The central figure is the dashing and resilient Andre-Louis Moreau, who survives crisis after crisis with a witty, devil-may-care <em>sprezzatura</em>. The novel itself overlays elements of picaresque (on-the-lam Moreau becomes an itinerant actor, then a fencing master, and finally a politician) onto a traditional romance plot (in the novel&#39;s final pages, our bastard hero discovers that he&#39;s an aristocrat by birth). At heart it&#39;s yet another version of the secret-sharer<em>, doppelganger</em>, Jekyll-Hyde plot so common a hundred or so years ago. Moreau is haunted by his wicked double, the Marquis Gervais de la Tour D&#39;Azyr, with whom he competes for not one but two different women&#0160; -- one fallen and one pure, as was the custom in those days. D&#39;Azyr claims that Moreau has been &quot;the evil genius of his life,&quot; but he&#39;s got it backwards: he&#39;s Moreau&#39;s evil twin. In the thrilling climax, so-called, Moreau wins Aline de Kercadiou -- the upper-class paragon whom both he and his double desire. The novel is set during the French Revolution, but the historical context is dimly realized&#0160; -- a much paler embodiment than <em>The Tale of Two Cities, </em>which, like <em>Scaramouche, </em>is also a novel of doubles (remember Charles Darnay and his dissipated friend Sidney Carton!).&#0160; A dyspeptic reader might assert that the novel is nothing but dilute Dumas; it would be hard to challenge such an opinion.</p>
<p>The film, which I remembered fondly, was a bitter disappointment. It&#39;s appallingly, embarrassingly bad. There&#39;s some good theatrical dueling, but the plot is a mess, the dialog is ghastly, the humor infantile, and the acting vaudevillian. Eleanor Parker is hopeless as a cliche &quot;spitfire&quot; who alternately kisses and smacks around her admirers; however, a young and <em>rondelet </em>Janet Leigh, swathed in whole hectares of taffeta, manages to redeem the part of Aline. All the characters, even Aline, wear their hair in the oddest configuration: highly artificial, upswept white wigs. They look like well-groomed sheep. I suppose it&#39;s too late to shoot the hairdresser.</p>
<p>The Sesquipedalian Sibilance Society would like to extend its appreciation to Mr. Sabatini for popularizing the word &quot;spadassinicide,&quot; which is much-used in the novel. It&#39;s from Fr. <em>spadassin, &quot;</em>assassin,&quot; and from the Latin verb meaning, &quot;to kill.&quot;&#0160; Etymologically speaking, spadassinicide ought to denote a person who murders murderers, but the author uses it to mean a person who kills by taking advantage of the etiquette of the duel. It&#39;s a handsome old neologism, although not easy to work into everyday conversation.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Regular readers of this blague are well aware that I have repeatedly indulged my bemusement at the names of extinct or obsolescent horsedrawn conveyances. My point is that modern readers, who know precisely what is signified&#0160; -- in design, in metal, rubber and plastic, and especially in social value -- by such words as Jeep, Jaguar, Jetta, and jalopy, know just about zip about &quot;fly,&quot; &quot;trap,&quot; &quot;landau,&quot; &quot;chaise,&quot; &quot;phaeton,&quot; &quot;cabriolet,&quot; &quot;sulky,&quot; &quot;surrey,&quot; &quot;curricle,&quot; &quot;gig,&quot; &quot;hansom,&quot; &quot;buggy,&quot; &quot;four-wheeler,&quot; &quot;spring-van,&quot; &quot;berlin,&quot; &quot;barouche,&quot; &quot;britchka,&quot; &quot;troika,&quot; &quot;wurt,&quot; &quot;tandem,&quot; &quot;caleche,&quot; &quot;tilbury,&quot; &quot;dog-cart,&quot; &quot;wagonette,&quot; &quot;go-cart,&quot; &quot;victoria,&quot; &quot;brougham,&quot; &quot;diligence,&quot; &quot;clarence&quot; or &quot;post-chaise.&quot;&#0160; If we notice these words at all, we tend to savor them as archaic Victorian music rather than to identify and evaluate them as specific forms of transportation.</p>
<p>Return with us now to the unthrilling 1950s, before pre-marital cohabitation became ordinary. In those days, automobiles reeked of sex. Indeed, I can remember that one sociologist described them as &quot;portable bedrooms&quot; -- a witticism that produced profound envy in those of us who came from automobile-less families.&#0160; While I knew that Nashes and Studebakers and big ol&#39; DeSotos could serve as mobile boudoirs, I must confess that I had never suspected that horsedrawn vehicles could perform the same function. The eye-opener came by way of some sly and wicked goings-on in Flaubert&#39;s <em>Madame Bovary.</em>&#0160; Here&#39;s the situation: Emma has been wooed for a hundred or so pages by her young admirer, Leon. They are both eager to consummate their affair, but there&#39;s no convenient venue. Taking fate into his hands, Leon &quot;pushes&quot; Emma into a cab. &quot;&#39;Where to, Monsieur?&#39; asked the cab driver. &#39;Wherever you&#39;d like,&#39; said Leon.&quot;&#0160; And then Flaubert describes the route around Rouen taken by coachman, cab, and lovers. He give us a page and a half of paragraphs like this one:&#0160; <span style="color: #3333ff;">&quot;The coach promptly began to move again, passing through Saint-Sever, along the Quai des Corandiers and the Quai aux Meules, over the bridge once more, through the Place du Champ-de-Mars and behind the gardens of the Home for the Elderly, where, in the sunshine, old men clad in black jackets stroll up and down a terrace green with ivy. It climbed up the Boulevard Bouvreuil, traveled along the Boulevard Cauchoise, then right over Mont-Riboudet as far as the hill at Deville.&quot;&#0160; </span><span style="color: #003333;">At discreet intervals, Flaubert interrupts the narrative: &quot;&#39;Keep going,&quot; cried a voice from inside....&quot;&#0160; &quot;&#39;Keep going!&#39; shouted the voice, even more furiously....&quot;&#0160; &quot;The coachman could not understand what rage for locomotion could be compelling this pair never to stop.&quot; Eventually, the cab &quot;drew up in an alley near the Beauvoisine district, and a woman stepped out, walking off with her veil lowered, never looking back.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #003333;">Nineteenth-century writers were not allowed to be explicit about sexual events, so they had to adopt various circumlocutions and codes. They lacked the freedom of both earlier (Fielding, said Thackeray, &quot;</span><span style="color: #000000;">was the last of our writers who drew a man&quot;) and later (post-Joyce) novelists. To write frankly about the act of intercourse was absolutely taboo.&#0160; Despite the obstacles, Flaubert does a excellent job of suggesting both the duration, the energy and the jouissance that Emma and Leon experience while their coach was &quot;tossing about like a ship.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I suspect that Flaubert&#39;s readers had little trouble comprehending what is meant by the passengers&#39; sudden &quot;rage for locomotion.&quot;</span></p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p><em>In The Lake of the Woods</em> sold well and was much adulated in 1994. It&#39;s been on my reading list for a long time, and I&#39;ve finally gotten around to it. In plot, it&#39;s uncannily reminiscent of Sloan Wilson&#39;s <em>The Man in the Grey Flannel Suit </em>(on which I <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2005/12/what_we_read_in_3.html">reported</a> some months ago). Wilson&#39;s novel is post-WWII; O&#39;Brien&#39;s is post-Vietnam. In each novel, the semi-autobiographical ex-soldier protagonist has committed unspeakable acts that he conceals from his loving wife; his silence embitters the marriage. In both books, the central figure embarks an ambitious career, but he is haunted by his past. Eventually, by force of circumstance, closeted history re-emerges and a crisis is precipitated. Deliberate and willed amnesia is the common theme of both books -- in fact, neither the characters nor their creators can bring themselves to confront the past except obliquely.&#0160; &#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>I&#39;ve come to <em>In The Lake of the Woods </em>thirteen years too late. I&#39;m sure that it had immediacy and power when it was fresh and new, but now it seems contrived and obvious. The machinery of the novel&#0160; -- multiple interlocking flashbacks, third-person commentary, authorial interjections, etc. -- may have worked in 1994, but is now marvelously self-conscious and ostentatiously &quot;literary.&quot; I know that Vietnam was a trauma for all concerned and I respect O&#39;Brien&#39;s sincerity and pain. I just wish <em>In the Lake of the Woods </em>weren&#39;t so thin and pseudo-mysterious and evasive.</p>
<p>Is there a great novel of Americans in Vietnam or is it still waiting to be written?&#0160; It was a particularly ugly war and it was the watershed experience for people of my particular generation. Do we have a <em>War and Peace</em>?</p>
<p>Question:&#0160; How many masterpieces would it take to compensate for the disaster?&#0160; Answer:&#0160; There isn&#39;t enough paper.&#0160; &#0160; &#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I remember exactly when I first heard of James Agee&#39;s <em>A Death in the Family.&#0160;</em>It was in Ithaca in 1958. The late Edward Ruhe, who was then a young instructor in English, stopped me on the street and asked if I had read it. He said I must, and, obedient lad that I was, I immediately purchased a copy. I can&#39;t remember much from my fifty-years-ago reading, except that I was put off by the novel&#39;s long italicized flashbacks and by what I regarded as its excessively intimate tone, which I then judged to be sentimental and false. But I&#39;ve now re-read the novel. It&#39;s authentic, it&#39;s emotional, and it&#39;s so very American. I&#39;m very glad to have had a chance to revise my earlier opinion. Perhaps I was too young. It&#39;s curious that I didn&#39;t connect Agee to the autobiographical poets that I was then reading, for the ground that Agee covers was then being explored by Lowell and Snodgrass and Roethke and of course by Sylvia Plath.&#0160;</p>
<p>It&#39;s a novel not only about death (it&#39;s told through the observing eyes of Rufus Follet, the six-year-old whose father dies in an automobile accident) but about the details of American life. There&#39;s very little in the way of plot, but Knoxville in 1915 is wonderfully evoked, mostly through concrete images. It&#39;s very much a novel of things. Perhaps I&#39;m especially conscious of this technique because I&#39;ve been re-reading Flaubert. But in Flaubert&#39;s novels, almost every object is laden with satirical significance (which is also the case -- to choose an American parallel -- in the novels of Mark Twain). Agee, however, loves the objects that he describes. Although there&#39;s puzzlement and mystery, there&#39;s not an ounce of satire or cynicism anywhere in <em>A Death in the Family</em>. Rufus Follet and Huck Finn -- it&#39;s not as unlikely a pairing as it might at first seem.</p>
<p>The facilitator of Agee&#39;s achievement is James Joyce.&#0160;<em>A Death in the Family</em> could not have been written without the precedent of <em>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man.</em>&#0160;But it&#39;s an American not an Irish portrait -- not as complex or as original, but fully as real as Joyce&#39;s. If an extraterrestrial visiting our lovely green planet wanted to understand the difference between Europe and America, he couldn&#39;t do better than read <em>Portrait</em> and<em> A Death in the Family</em> side by side.&#0160;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Leonardo Sciascia&#39;s laconic and precise &quot;metaphysical mystery&quot; <em>The Day of the Owl (Il Giorno della Civetta, </em>1961) is set in unwholesome, Mafia-dominated Sicily.&#0160; Captain Bellodi and Sgt. Major Ferlisi, dedicated and intelligent police officers, investigate a series of horrific crimes. Their trail leads to the local boss, Don Mariano Arena, but further searching opens the possibility that an &quot;honorable deputy&quot; and a cabinet minister also may be implicated. We&#39;ll never know the whole story -- Bellodi is recalled to Bologna and Ferlisi transferred to Ancona, and the investigation languishes.</p>
<p>In Bush&#39;s America, Congressman Duke Cunningham is convicted of accepting bribes; further investigation appears to implicate &quot;Dusty&quot; Foggo, third in the hierarchy at the CIA. It&#39;s also possible that senior White House officials might be involved&#0160; -- but Carol Lam, the efficient U. S. attorney in charge of the case, is suddenly relieved of her position. The investigation languishes.&#0160;</p>
<p>And also: Jack Abramoff is sent to jail for perjury. The trail of corruption once again appears to lead to the White House -- but the prosecutor, Noel Hillman, is offered a federal judgeship and the investigation grinds to a halt.</p>
<p>At the end of <em>The Day of the Owl</em>, Captain Bellodi, though exhausted and disillusioned, resolves to return to Sicily. He will, it seems, try again. Sciascia&#39;s unhappy novel offers a small ray of hope. It seems to say that it is wrong to succumb to hopelessness and despair in the face of political abuse. A useful moral, I think.</p>

                                <p>The most glorious fictions that I&#39;ve read in many years are late writings by two nineteenth-century masters. The first is Leo Tolstoy&#39;s <em>Hadji Murad; </em>the second, Gustave Flaubert&#39;s <em>A Simple Heart. Hadji Murad </em>(published posthumously in 1912) is a novella on the subject of war and its follies<em>. A Simple Heart </em>(1877) is a short story about an exploited servant woman who finds a bit of beauty in an ugly world. They&#39;re both absolutely transcendent stories -- &quot;beyond beyond,&quot; as Shakespeare says.&#0160;</p>
<p><em>April 2.&#0160; </em>Additional recommendations. I&#39;ve now read three &quot;detective&quot; novels by Leonardo Sciascia. They are all superior creations, although their open-endedness might be disappointing to people who expect that mysteries must be resolved and that criminals should be brought to justice. They&#39;re not genre fiction; they&#39;re writings that cleverly expand and question the crime genre. The novels:&#0160; <em>he Day of the Owl&#0160; (1961), To Each His Own </em>(1966)<em>, Equal Danger </em>(1971)<em>, -- </em>all reprinted in attractive, reader-friendly editions by New York Review Books. I&#39;ll be looking for more Sciascia on the library shelves. Also, <em>You Know Me All, </em>by Ring Lardner, an excellent baseball novel first published in 1916. It holds up well, although the humor leans heavily on &quot;country bumpkin&quot; stereotypes.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>A year or so ago, I <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2006/01/new_words.html">confessed</a> that when I read novels that take place in pre-internal combustion days, I don&#39;t clearly distinguish among various horsedrawn conveyances -- they&#39;re all coaches to me. I have no mental image of &quot;fly,&quot; &quot;trap,&quot; &quot;landau,&quot; &quot;chaise,&quot; &quot;phaeton,&quot; &quot;cabriolet,&quot; &quot;sulky,&quot; &quot;surrey,&quot; &quot;curricle,&quot; &quot;gig,&quot; &quot;hansom,&quot; &quot;buggy,&quot; &quot;four-wheeler,&quot; or &quot;spring-van.&quot;&#0160; The pictorial or social resonance of these colorful names is something to which I&#39;m pretty much tone-deaf.&#0160;</p>
<p>I was therefore amused when just yesterday I happened upon the following passage in Flaubert&#39;s <em>Sentimental Education (</em>completed in 1869 but set in the 1840s).&#0160; Frederic and Rosanette attend the horse races in a &quot;berlin.&quot;&#0160; Stuck in traffic, they find themselves surrounded by a crestomathy of carriages: <span style="color: #0066cc;">&quot;barouches, britchkas, wurts, tandems, tilburies, dog-carts, covered wagonnettes with leather curtains full of singing workmen out on the spree, and go-carts carefully driven by fathers of families.&#0160; There were crowded victorias in which some young man would be sitting on the feet of other passengers, with his legs dangling over the side. Big broughams with cloth-covered seats carried dozing dowagers; and occasionally a magnificent high-stepper went by, drawing a post-chaise as simple and smart as a dandy&#39;s tail-coat.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I&#39;m positive that Flaubert chose his words carefully and I&#39;m equally sure that he had no premonition that his vocabulary would be obsolescent in just fifty years and incomprehensible in a hundred. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Every contemporary novelist knows that it matters whether his hero arrives in a Jeep or a Jaguar or a jalopy. If his book will be read in a later century, extinct and quaint words such as &quot;pickup,&quot; &quot;step-van,&quot; &quot;SUV,&quot; &quot;Buick,&quot; &quot;station wagon,&quot; &quot;jeep,&quot; &quot;hummer,&quot; &quot;flat-bed,&quot; and &quot;Subaru&quot; will be annotated with copious scholarly footnotes.

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>During my Erasmus Hall High School years, the hottest of all &quot;hot&quot; books was Irving Shulman&#39;s <em>The Amboy Dukes.</em> It was official doctrine that a single oblique glance at the inflammatory cover of this paperback could transform a well-behaved kid into a murderous, reefer-crazed, oversexed hooligan. Simply to read about the &quot;juvenile delinquents&quot; who populate <em>The Amboy Dukes</em> was to wander into a criminal twilight. A guy definitely did not want his mommy to know that he had heard of this book, let alone possessed a sticky contraband copy.</p>
<p>What was all the fuss about?&#0160; Why was the book condemned all over America and even banned (for a while) in Canada?&#0160; &#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a paragraph that was much brooded upon in the local schoolyard. (I&#39;ve since learned that some 1950s moralists condemned it as pornographic -- and perhaps they were right.)</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">They </span><span style="color: #3333ff;">pushed onto the bus, and Frank watched Black Kenny and Mike get a nice-looking broad between them and give her a rub. Mike and Kenny hemmed the girl between them, skillfully pocketing her to prevent her escape. In her eyes there was loathing and fear of the two hoodlums, who did not look at her but nevertheless pressed against her lasciviously, pinioning her against their rigid hot bodies. Mike pushed against the girl&#39;s buttocks, thighs, and legs, while Kenny pressed against her stomach and breasts. The girl wanted to scream, to cry out, but she was afraid....</span></p>
<p>Ugly to be sure, abusive, sexist, nasty, but still rather tame by later standards. It&#39;s an effort of will to remember that during the Eisenhower years, words such as &quot;breasts&quot; and &quot;buttocks&quot; were not uttered casually and that their appearance on the printed page was rare and incendiary. But I don&#39;t think it was the language alone, or even the stark portrayal of adolescents in heat that rattled polite society. It was the intrusion of viciousness in the tame 1950s father-knows-best twin-bed universe that provoked the reaction. That &quot;nice-looking broad&quot; whom Mike and Black Kenny molest was, or was imagined to be, some respectable family&#39;s sister or daughter. Just as the two hoods thrust themselves against the young woman, so <em>The Amboy Dukes</em> flaunted itself in the face of respectability. The proper middle class went to great lengths not to acknowledge that brutes such as Black Kenny and Mike were their next-door neighbors. The Eisenhower era lived in denial; there were some things that everyone knew but of which no one spoke. In <em>The Amboy Dukes, </em>Shulman spilled the beans.&#0160;</p>
<p>That&#39;s why <em>The Amboy Dukes </em>fascinated the guys who hung around the P. S. 217 schoolyard. Unlike our parents, we couldn&#39;t choose to deny the existence of psychopaths such as Black Kenny and Crazy Shak (the novel&#39;s rapist and murderer). Guys like that smoked and spit on every street corner and disrupted many of our classrooms. We had to negotiate with violence or with the threat of violence every day. To read <em>The Amboy Dukes </em>was oddly refreshing; it validated the daily reality of teen-agers who weren&#39;t gang members.</p>
<p>Moreover, the novel had a strong vicarious appeal. While my friends were trying to manage their hormones, keep up with their schoolwork and occasionally get in a good game of basketball or stickball, the Dukes were cutting class, punching out their teachers, smoking dope, and getting laid. Reading the novel let us share in some of that other-side-of-the-track forbidden fruit. But it allowed us to participate safely. <em>The Amboy Dukes</em>, like so many such scandalous publications, is at heart a cautionary novel. Frank Abbot, the central character, is a bad guy but he&#39;s appealing and not irredeemable; he goes too far, gets in over his head, and winds up dead -- a warning to all of us. <em>The Amboy Dukes </em>allowed &quot;normal&quot; kids to enjoy the novel&#39;s transgressive moments and still return safely to the nest.</p>
<p>Although <em>The Amboy Dukes </em><span style="color: #000000;">sold millions of copies, I couldn&#39;t find it in any of the libraries that I use. Through the miracle of the internet, I was able to buy a tattered, yellowed-pages-unglued 35-cent 1949 Avon paperback. The object itself is a piece of history. On the cover, a woman with flaming red hair resists the embraces of a dark and handsome young man. Their facial expressions (he: lustful; she: fearful) are highly melodramatic, but the pair are dressed conservatively, as though they&#39;ve just returned from a day of yachting. Also on the cover are a couple of claims to literary merit: &quot;The one book that tells the inside story of juvenile delinquency no other novel has told before.&quot; And an appeal to the moralists: &quot;This book is emphatically a reading &#39;must&#39;&quot; --Edwin J. Lukas, Executive Director, Society for the Prevention of Crime.&quot; Finally, in almost unreadable tiny print, &quot;This book is specially revised and edited for Avon Books&quot; -- an admission that leads me to guess that the paperback mass edition expurgated some words or events that were deemed too strong for the kids who bought the cheap edition and concealed it inside their official three-ring binders.&#0160;</span></p>

		<a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2007/02/the_damnation_o.html">The Damnation of Theron Ware</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>A few of us were in a coffee shop talking about Ted Haggard, <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2007/01/thoughts_about_.html">Darlene Bishop</a> and other right-wing Christianistas. One of the guys thought that I could gain some perspective and also stoke my outrage by reading Harold Frederic&#39;s 1896 novel <em>The Damnation of Theron Ware</em>. I recognized the title -- it had appeared on reading lists when I was a student in the 1950s and 1960s&#0160; -- but I&#39;d never turned a single page. Well, better late than never; <em>Theron Ware </em>is a truly splendid book.&#0160;</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a sample of its satirical spirit. Youthful, ignorant Theron Ware meets the governing elders when he arrives to take up his ministry at the Octavius Methodist Church:&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">&quot;We are a plain sort o&#39;folks up in these parts,&quot; said Brother Pierce....&#0160; We walk here... in a meek and humble spirit, in the straight an&#39; narrow way which leadeth unto life. We ain&#39;t gone traipsin&#39; after strange gods, like some people that call themselves Methodists in other places. We stick by the Discipline an&#39; the ways of our fathers in Israel. No new-fangled notions can go down here.&#0160; Your wife&#39;d better take them flowers out of her bunnit afore next Sunday</span><span style="color: #003333;">.&quot;</span></p>
<p>It&#39;s a wonderful speech, especially that last oppressive sentence, set without pause or punctuation against flimsy pretenses to meekness. Harold Frederic leaves us in no doubt that Brother Pierce and his Methodist co-religionists worship only at the altars of joylessness and petty tyranny. Theron Ware would like to rebel against these sour Puritanisms, but he&#39;s devoid of the necessary intellectual resources. He&#39;s backwoods ignorant. He does after a while acquire and read Renan&#39;s <em>Life of Jesus</em> and for a few chapters it seems as though he&#39;s going to tread the familiar nineteenth-century path from narrow sectarianism toward a less restrictive spirituality. But the author has many surprises in store. Ware encounters Father Forbes, an intelligent, informed and (gasp!) Roman Catholic priest and he also develops a painful crush on a dashing rich free-spirited young and (horrors!) Irish-American beauty named Celia Madden. Ware is unable to grasp that these two sophisticates treat him not as an equal, but as a kind of mascot puppy. Wonderful and embarrassing complications ensue.&#0160;</p>
<p>Frederic creates some full and rich and modern characters. Father Forbes is a 1890s decadent with roots in Pater and perhaps even in Huysmans, while Sister Soulsby is a practical, energetic no-nonsense entrepreneur whose trade just happens to be promoting Methodism. Most interesting of all is Celia Madden, who plays Chopin and admires George Sand, and who is as up-to-the-moment as anyone in <em>The Woman Who Did (</em>and who would have been perfectly at home discussing aesthetics in Bloomsbury). Theron Ware&#39;s encounters with her are painfully amusing. It&#39;s as if Frank Merriwell had somehow blundered into Madam Merle&#39;s drawing-room.</p>
<p>The town of Octavius is modeled on Utica, New York, where Harold Frederic was born and spent his young manhood. Utica is a place I know very well, but I don&#39;t believe I&#39;ve ever come across a Frederic monument or a &quot;Harold Frederic lived here&quot; plaque. Perhaps the city fathers aren&#39;t eager to remind us that Utica is portrayed as gossipy, narrow, ignorant, and exceedingly philistine.&#0160; &#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Mickey Spillane&#39;s <em>I, the Jury (</em>1947) is a loathsome novel. It makes me gag to remember that it was wildly popular in the P.S. 217 schoolyard -- passed from hand to hand in lurid 25-cent paperback editions. Spillane&#39;s hero, the crudely-monikered private investigator Mike Hammer, lives in a world in which guns are &quot;rods,&quot; bullets are &quot;slugs,&quot; cars are &quot;heaps,&quot; a policeman is a &quot;flatfoot,&quot; gays are &quot;queers&quot; and &quot;pansies,&quot; and people of any color other than white are &quot;jigs,&quot; &quot;bogies,&quot; or &quot;darkies.&quot; His is a horrible, amoral universe of bigotry and violence. Mike Hammer, nominally an officer of the law, makes no effort to bring criminals to justice -- he prefers to kill them. &quot;I&#39;m going to enjoy putting a bullet into that crazy son of a bitch more than I enjoy eating. I&#39;d sooner work him over with a knife first.&quot; He&#39;s a sadistic vigilante who beats up suspects and bystanders indifferently: &quot;my fist went in up to the wrist in his stomach.&quot;</p>
<p>Charlotte Manning, the beautiful uptown &quot;dame&quot; whom he thinks he loves, tells him what he wants to hear (and what the novel endorses) -- that he&#39;s a &quot;a real man -- no inhibitions.&quot; Of course, he doesn&#39;t go to bed with Charlotte Manning -- he only traffics with women who are those he derides as &quot;nymphos.&quot; At the climax of the novel, Hammer discovers -- a surprise to no one but himself! -- that the killer for whom he&#39;s searching is Charlotte herself. As he fingers his .45 caliber pistol, she slowly disrobes. When she&#39;s entirely naked, Hammer shoots her in the stomach. &quot;&#39;H-how could you,&#39; she gasps. Hammer: &quot;It was easy.&quot; Was it difficult, even in 1953, to understand such perverse, misogynistic symbolism?</p>
<p>Mickey Spillane left his native Brooklyn to go to serve as a soldier; what a shame that he returned as a fascist.</p>
<p>For all I know, I might have read <em>I, the Jury </em>during the same week that I read John R. Tunis&#39;s <em>The Kid from Tompkinsville. </em>As degraded as is the one novel, so the other is otherworldly and pure. The &quot;kid&quot; is Roy Tucker, a simple country boy who tries out for the Brooklyn Dodgers, wins a place on the team, and is pitching shutout after shutout when he trips in the shower and injures his throwing arm.&#0160; A few weeks later, <em>mirabile dictu</em>, he returns as an outfielder and leads his team to a pennant with his hitting. It&#39;s a heckuva lot of drama for one short season, but Tunis makes it credible&#0160; -- well, at least, it seemed credible to youthful me back in 1953.</p>
<p>Tunis takes his baseball seriously and he never patronizes his young readership. Like most of Tunis&#39;s novels <em>(The Kid Comes Back, Young Razzle, Iron Duke), </em>all of which I swallowed in single gulps, <em>The Kid from Tompkinsville e</em>xtols the virtues of integrity, effort, and teamwork. Was I astute enough to notice that there was no drinking, no staying out late, and not a hint of desire for women in Roy Tucker&#39;s life? I don&#39;t believe I was.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>While nasty old Mike Hammer asked us to wallow in a swinish world, upstanding Roy Tucker lifted us from the mire. There could hardly be a better illustration of Shakespeare&#39;s observation that &quot;the web of our life is of a mingled yarn, good and ill together.&quot; I&#39;d like to believe that Tunis was a greater influence on me (as he was certainly a greater source of pleasure) than Spillane -- even though, as I recently discovered, Mickey Spillane (Frank Morrison Spillane) was a fellow graduate of &quot;good-and-ill-together&quot; Erasmus Hall High School.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I received the following note from Marion Morrison, who is an associate professor of English at the University of Iowa. It was written in response to my entry <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2007/01/what_we_read_in.html">a few days ago</a> concerning H. Rider Haggard&#39;s <em>King Solomon&#39;s Mines.</em>&#0160;I&#39;m extremely grateful to Professor Morrison for taking the time to comment on my observations.&#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;Dear Dr. Metablog:</p>
<p>I detect the subtextual presence of mutually imbricated and conterminous forces in your multichronotopic problematizing of King Solomon&#39;s Minds. The indigenous woman, Foulani, living in a no (wo)man&#39;s land where the colonialist gaze dissects racialized gendering, foregrounds the elusive intersectionalities present in the semiological narratology of deconstructive post-structuralism. It is only by scrutinizing the poetics of diasporic displacement that we can contest the epiphenomenological echo of (hetero)masculinist discourse from a gendered perspective, which, if I understand your insufficiently theorized analysis, you have vainly tried to do. Such (re)mapping of knowledge, even when employing a single-axis feminist theory, unpacks syncretism and hybridity and at the same time denaturalizes doxa rooted in phallocentric epistemologies. But, you ask, what about the reproduction of alterity through a highly policed matrix of conceptual checkpoints?&#0160; The answer is simple: any binarist recontextualizing across multiple terrains adds a metadiscursive dimension to the polysemic site and leads to aporias of nationalist cartographies of knowledge, as is crystal clear in the case of Rider Haggard. Without otherizing the conceptual spaces opened up by postcolonial hybridity, hermeneutical nihilism would dismantle palimpsestic textuality -- and you know what that might lead to. A meta-analysis of King Solomon&#39;s Wives -- a textual situation in which there are multiple hegominid discourses as well as the potential for co-implicatedness -- could rupture various subaltern geographic positionalities (but only in a translinguistic sense).</p>
<p>As I&#39;m sure you understand, these comments are written under the sign of the plural.&quot;</p>
<p><em>January 10.</em>&#0160; Today I received another communication from Professor Morrison.&#0160; It&#39;s a bit angry, so I won&#39;t quote it all, but here are the relevant sentences.</p>
<p>&quot;Dear Dr. Metablog, or Vivian, or whatever you call yourself:</p>
<p>When you typed my comments into your blog, you clumsily erred. I certainly did not write &quot;hermeneutical nihilism would dismantle palimpsestic textuality&quot;; it&#39;s obvious that I wrote &quot;hermeneutical nihilism would <strong>not </strong>dismantle palimpsestic textuality.&quot;&#0160; Leaving out the &quot;not&quot; makes a mockery of my argument and renders it virtually unintelligible. You owe me and your readers an apology.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>Yours,</p>
<p>Marion Morrison, Ph. D.&quot;</p>
<p>Gosh, Professor Morrison. My bad. I don&#39;t know what I could have been thinking.</p>
