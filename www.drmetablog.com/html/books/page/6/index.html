                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>As an adolescent, I was a passionate enthusiast of novels by Sir Henry Rider Haggard. I read everything that was in the collection of the McDonald Avenue public library. Not only <em>King Solomon&#39;s Mines </em>and <em>Allan Quatermain</em> and <em>She</em> and <em>Allan&#39;s Wife</em> and <em>Ayesha,</em> but also some of the non-&quot;African&quot; adventures as well. I particularly recall <em>Eric Brighteyes</em> and <em>Montezuma&#39;s Daughter.</em>&#0160; Yesterday I read <em>King Solomon&#39;s Mines</em> (1885) for the first time in fifty years and I couldn&#39;t be more unhappy that I did so. It&#39;s a toxic mixture of imperialism, brutality, racism, sexism, classism -- a compendium of ethnocentric Victoriana gathered into a single atavistic novel.&#0160; I&#39;m familiar with the academic doctrine that to judge the past by contemporary liberal values is to commit the fallacy of &quot;presentism,&quot; but I&#39;m sorry, friends, I&#39;m mortified that I ever, even as a youngster, could have fallen for this appalling mishmash.&#0160; How could I have tolerated the paternalistic Englishmen and the child-like natives?</p>
<p>Here are two representative incidents from <em>King Solomon&#39;s Mines</em>. The first: three Englishman are tramping through Africa. They come upon a herd of elephants. They shoot and kill them. No explanation, no justification, no reason. The second: one of the Englishmen takes a liking to a young woman named Foulata. She dies, sacrificing herself, as is the custom in imperialist fiction, to save English lives. Rider Haggard&#39;s &#0160;comment: &quot;I consider her removal was a fortunate occurrence, since, otherwise, complications would have been sure to ensue. The poor creature was no ordinary native girl, but a person of great, I had almost said stately, beauty, and of considerable refinement of mind.&#0160; But no amount of beauty or refinement could have made an entanglement a desirable occurrence; for, as she herself put it, &#39;Can the sun mate with the darkness, or the white with the black?&#39;&quot;&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>I shouldn&#39;t have tampered with my fifty-year-old memories. But I&#39;ve made a resolution: I&#39;m going to wait fifty more years before I read another novel by Rider Haggard.&#0160; &#0160;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>This blague&#39;s readers know that I&#39;ve been revisiting books that I first read in the 1950s. Last week I reported on Sinclair Lewis&#39;s <em>Arrowsmith, </em>which was required reading in junior-year English in Erasmus Hall High School. I re-read <em>Arrowsmith</em> in the very convenient Library of America series, which includes <em>Elmer Gantry</em> and <em>Dodsworth</em> (along with <em>Arrowsmith) </em>in one thick volume.&#0160; I felt that I owed it to Lewis (after all, he did win a Nobel prize) to read another of his novels. <em>Elmer Gantry</em> won the toss.</p>
<p>While <em>Arrowsmith</em> has not worn very well, <em>Elmer G. </em>is uncannily pertinent. It&#39;s about an amoral fundamentalist preacher. He&#39;s a nasty opportunistic bastard who crusades against vice but maintains a series of mistresses; he&#39;s out for notoriety and money no matter what the cost to his parishioners or to American society. He even becomes --and here Lewis is truly prescient -- the first radio evangelist. It&#39;s a heavy-handed, sloppy, brutally satirical book, but it&#39;s also right on target.&#0160; I kept waiting for Elmer to be exposed, but the novel ends when he dodges another mistress and sets out on a route to more and more power.&#0160; It&#39;s a very dark view of the penetration of politics by religion. No wonder it was banned in Boston; even eighty years later, it&#39;s much too hot for high school -- although I can&#39;t imagine a single book that would be more medicinal for pious youth. And now I understand why <em>Arrowsmith</em> was given us to read:&#0160; honor the Nobel laureate, but stay as far away as possible from controversy. <em>Dodsworth</em> is about adultery; <em>Main Street</em> attacks American provincialism; <em>Elmer Gantry</em> pillories religion. <em>Arrowsmith </em>is a greatly inferior novel, but it was safer.&#0160;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Sinclair Lewis&#39;s <em>Arrowsmith</em>, published in 1924 and now hopelessly dated, was a mere thirty years old when we read it in Erasmus Hall High School English classes. I must confess, once again, that I recall almost nothing from my 1950s reading -- just a vague sense that I&#39;d been there before. Nevertheless, the novel wasn&#39;t a bad book to present to young people. Dr. Martin Arrowsmith is a dedicated, humorless, idealistic, workaholic scientist who eludes both the snares of commerce and also of love and family in a single-minded pursuit of the knowledge that will save lives. Sinclair Lewis&#39;s America is repressive, vulgar, materialistic, and unredeemed. Why not let high schoolers read a book with such a manic, satirical spirit?&#0160; It might have done them a world of good -- though I can&#39;t vouch that it did anything for me.</p>
<p>Dr. Arrowsmith has no time anything so frivolous as aesthetics -- and it&#39;s just as well, for neither does his creator.&#0160;<em>Arrowsmith</em> is shapeless in form and crude in style. It&#39;s a sledgehammer of a book, as unsubtle as America at its worst.&#0160;</p>
<p>Query: were we informed that Sinclair Lewis was famous for having said that &quot;when fascism comes to America, it will be wrapped in the flag and carrying a cross?&quot;</p>

		<a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2006/12/what_we_read_in.html">What We Read in the Fifties:  Ivanhoe</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>For an entire lifetime I&#39;ve had a ghastly relationship with Sir Walter Scott. <em>Ivanhoe</em> was a mandatory book in the Erasmus Hall High School English curriculum and I remember reading the novel with painful indifference. It&#39;s entirely possible that I didn&#39;t persevere to the final pages but instead relied upon the 1952 film. At various times I&#39;ve made an effort to read novels by Sir Walter, but time and again I&#39;ve foundered. Twenty or so years ago<em>, Old Mortality</em> and <em>Redgauntlet</em> were being trumpeted by academic critics, and I gave each novel a fair trial, but, after a chapter or two, ran aground on the sandbar of dullness.&#0160;As part of my project of re-reading books that were popular or required in the 1950s, I tackled <em>Ivanhoe</em> again, and I can report that this time I read it to the very last drop -- but what a colossal effort! I never &quot;got into&quot; it but read it in gobbets of five or six pages at a time before succumbing to boredom or sleep. I deserve the 2006 Bulwer-Lytton Prize for Drudgery.</p>
<p>Why did our elders judge <em>Ivanhoe</em> to be suitable for 10th graders? The plot plods, the characters are unidimensional cliches, and there&#39;s a total want of suspense. The dialogue is ludicrous. It reminds me of what Jonson said about Spenser--that &quot;in affecting the ancients, he writ no language.&quot; But in point of fact, Scott does write a language--he writes bad Blackadderese. &quot;Fear not, my lord. I must speak with you in private, before you mount your palfrey.&quot; &quot;Have patience, sir. I might retort your accusation, and blame the inconsiderate levity which foiled my design.&quot;&#0160; &quot;A truce with your raillery, sir knight.&quot;&#0160; &quot;If thou refusest my fair proffer, the provost of the lists shall cut thy bow-string, break thy bow and arrows and expel thee from the presence as a faint-hearted craven.&quot; And on and on for four hundred mucilaginous pages.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>There&#39;s another roadblock to empathetic reading.&#0160;<em>Ivanhoe </em>features a Jewish money-lender named Isaac who&#39;s a walking inventory of stereotypes: he&#39;s usurious, greedy, faint-hearted, fawning, and although he claims poverty, is secretly rolling in shekels. He sums up all the worst aspects of both Shylock and Fagin. But Scott thinks we should forgive Isaac even though he&#39;s such a miserable human being, and by asking us to do so, he somehow manages to make tolerance even more offensive than bigotry itself.In addition, Isaac has an impossibly beauteous and virtuous daughter named Rebecca. Yes, it&#39;s a miracle, says Scott, but there are Jews (or at least Jewesses) who are not money-grubbing villains. Thanks a lot, Sir Walter.&#0160;</p>
<p>Why was <em>Ivanhoe </em>high-school fare?&#0160; Beats the heck out of me. And it makes me angry to think that this bad book was thrust down our throats. Let&#39;s put those upstart immigrants in their place, is what they were saying. Was it malevolent or merely unconscious? Difficult to ascertain, but after slogging through <em>Ivanhoe</em>, I&#39;m not in a forgiving mood.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p><em>January 7.</em>&#0160; I&#39;ve now watched the 1952 <em>Ivanhoe</em> with Elizabeth Taylor as Jessica, an aging Robert Taylor as Ivanhoe, and an aging Joan Fontaine as Rowena.&#0160;It&#39;s a bit dated and it occasionally anticipates <em>Monty Python and the Holy Grail, </em>but it&#39;s not half bad. The writer, who had the wonderful name of Aeneas McKenzie, discarded the novel, started from scratch, and composed a screenplay that has action and adventure and romance and every once in a while borrows an incident from Sir Walter Scott. A good strategy, in my view.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I&#39;ve now re-read Robert Penn Warren&#39;s <em>All the King&#39;s Men </em>(1946), a novel that I hadn&#39;t looked at since the early 1950s. Once again memory has played its tricks. My fifty-year-old afterimage does not correspond to reality. The book that I thought I remembered focused on Willie Stark (Huey Long) -- his ascent to power, his anti-establishment politics, his ruthlessness, and his assassination.&#0160; Willie Stark does in fact appear in the book that I re-read, but he&#39;s not the central figure -- not even close. It&#39;s a novel about Jack Burden, press-secretary and chief blackmailer for Stark, and about the various spokes of Burden&#39;s wheel: his semi-aristocratic mother, his lawyer-turned-religious-fanatic father, the apparently upstanding judge who was his mother&#39;s lover, his childhood sweetheart Anne Stanton and her doctor brother, and also Sadie Burke, the Boss&#39;s secretary-girlfriend-political guru, and of course about Stark himself.&#0160; Perhaps I misremembered because the Willie Stark parts of the novel are so strong, or perhaps my memory was filtered through the 1949 Robert Rossen film. Even half a century later, it&#39;s hard to read the book without seeing Broderick Crawford and Mercedes McCambridge in the mind&#39;s eye. (The film is now in the Netflix queue, so I&#39;ll revisit it shortly.)</p>
<p>It&#39;s a good book, well worth the prizes and the accolades. For my money, there could have been more politics and more Louisiana and less young-man-searching-for-his-identity. It&#39;s a big, as they say, &quot;sprawling&quot; novel; sometimes the sprawl works, but at other times -- the long flashback in which adolescent Jack woos adolescent Anne, for example -- an editor&#39;s scissors would have done the novel a world of good. The prose is mannered and affected and derivative: hunks of Thomas Wolfe, a dollop here and there of Faulkner, along with extra-large helpings of Chandler or Hammett. But it&#39;s nevertheless strong writing.&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Melodramatic?&#0160; Yes, indeed: murders and suicides, betrayals and reversals, mysteries and exposures. But at the core, a genuine curiosity about America and its southland. <em>All the King&#39;s Men </em>persuasively creates a culture in which genuine goodness is mere namby-pamby and in which ruthlessness has become reasonable. To succeed in such a world, Jack Burden and Willie Stark become as corrupt as the world around them.&#0160;</p>
<p>The Huey Long material is excellent groundwork for a novel. Warren dresses it up with paragraph after paragraph of murky philosophizing. I confess that I didn&#39;t make the effort to absorb the meditations -- they seemed to be the usual southern stuff about religion and about the weight of history. I think that readers are supposed to learn that &quot;if you could not accept the past and its burden there was no future, for without the one there cannot be the other, and ... if you could accept the past you might hope for the future, for only out of the past can you make the future.&quot;&#0160; But if such a platitude is the best that Warren can do, it&#39;s best to skip the tepid philosophy and stick with the rich and abundant storytelling. &#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Regular readers (and even stray internet pilgrims) know that Dr. M. has composed a series of entries called What We Read in the Fifties, in which he&#39;s revisited books that were noteworthy or notorious during the days of his youth. It&#39;s been a rewarding exercise, at least for him. Some of the books have been canonical novels that were required reading in English class at Erasmus Hall High School, some have been pop best-sellers which his more earnest teachers would have scorned, and some have been cheap sensational paperbacks passed under the desk from hand to grimy pubescent hand.</p>
<p>In the years that have passed since I first read these books, rivers have changed course, glaciers have melted, and American society has altered almost beyond recognition -- and yet the books have remained exactly the same. Reading them has been an exercise in nostalgia and a test of memory, and also an unwelcome insight into the incalculable callowness of adolescence. And yet, Dr. Metablog has found readers -- or, at least, he thinks he has, for in May and in December, when high school students all over America, yea, even across the waters, write their assigned term papers on <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2006/02/what_we_read_in.html">Lord of the Flies</a> or <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2006/02/what_we_read_in_1.html">The Catcher in the Rye</a>, blague-traffic spikes, and the dissenting views offered in these essaylets are plagiarized and offered to a new generation of English teachers, who reward them with grades of D or F.&#0160;</p>
<p>I fear, however, that my readers might have gathered an erroneous impression of 1950s Flatbushian youth -- that they might have been literate or intellectual. Let me clear my conscience and confess that for every hour that I spent reading books that had actual bindings, I spent ten hours reading comic books and an equal measure with my ear to the radio. It was the comics that taught me how to read; I was well along in years before I came to realize that there were such things as lower-case letters and that there could be sentences that didn&#39;t end with exclamation points! In my neighborhood, super-heroes (Batman, the Flash, Green Lantern, Wonder Woman) were as common as squirrels or starlings. But radio -- radio serials-- affected us even more than the comics. Radio stimulated the imagination, took us to worlds far way, presented us with alternative realities. Members of my age-cohort will not forget the glories of radio:Jack Armstrong, the All-American boy, who trotted the globe in support of native ideals and Wheaties; Bobbie Benson, the youth who inherited the B-Bar-B ranch in the Big Bend country, and who, along with Tex, Windy, and Harka, triumphed daily over snakes, droughts, famines and outlaws; the Shadow, who had the power to &quot;cloud men&#39;s minds so they cannot see him,&quot; and who taught us, every day, that &quot;the weed of crime bears bitter fruit&quot;; Sergeant Preston of the Northwest Mounted, who fought crime and bad guys in the Yukon with horse and dog (&quot;Well, King, this case is closed&quot;); and the Lone Ranger, who with the aid of Tonto and the &quot;thundering hoof beats of the great horse Silver&quot; and with the marvelous voices of exotic Detroit&#39;s Fred Foy and Brace Beemer, created an enduring mythology of a spacious but vague and unlocatable west.&#0160;</p>
<p>Radio gave scope to the listener&#39;s imagination. When television came along, and these programs were translated into a visual form, they were all inevitably diminished. It&#39;s no wonder that the great epics (<em>Gilgamesh</em>, the <em>Odyssey</em> and <em>Iliad, Beowulf, </em>the Icelandic sagas) are oral creations. The spoken word can cast spells that are beyond the capacity of visual forms. When it comes to heroes, a single word is worth a thousand pictures.</p>
<p>Radio prepared me for Shakespeare. It&#39;s a fact that when Londoners crossed the Thames to attend the Globe, they did not go to &quot;see&quot; a play; they went to &quot;hear&quot; a play. There&#39;s a world of difference between seeing and hearing. When we &quot;see&quot; a movie, 90% of the information comes to us through the eye. In a Shakespeare play, it&#39;s exactly the opposite -- 90%, or more, of the information comes to us by way of the ear -- which is why recordings of Shakespeare&#39;s plays can be so entirely successful and so true to the original intent. And because the plays are primarily oral, with their big speeches and complicated rhetorical patterning and brilliant displays of verbal acuity, they can also be larger-than-life -- and they can be heroic. Shakespeare&#39;s plays are closer to radio than they are to any other modern literary form. Those of us who grew up with radio bring to Shakespeare an intuitive understanding of oral forms that precede television, film, and even precede the theater itself&#0160; -- especially decadent modern theater with its compulsive and distracting visual distortions.&#0160; &#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I liked the film <em>Wonder Boys </em>(2000) so very much that I set out to read all of Michael Chabon&#39;s writing. Here&#39;s my interim report. I couldn&#39;t finish <em>The Mysteries of Pittsburgh (</em>William Morrow, 1988). The book is reported to have sold well and it has been widely praised, but, I&#39;m sorry, I thought it was precious juvenilia and should never have been published. I do, however, love the title<em>. A Model World</em> (1991) and <em>Werewolves in Their Youth </em>(Random House, 1999) are collections of short stories. I found them both mighty insubstantial, and I confess to wearying of the little boy whose father left the family (a far-too-frequently-repeated motif). <em>Wonder Boys </em>(1995) is a fine, complicated, clever, satisfying novel.&#0160; Grady Tripp, Terry Crabtree, and James Leer are all memorable creations. The Passover service (omitted in the film) is top-flight -- comic and moving at the same time. The story is fast, funny, and original -- even richer than the fine, little-known movie.&#0160;</p>
<p>I respected more than I loved the pullet-surprise winning <em>Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay </em>(Random House, 2000). It&#39;s engaging but overcrowded. While reading it, I was too conscious of the artifice and too aware of the novel&#39;s debts: Nabokov, a pinch of Pynchon, Doctorow, etc. Chabon&#39;s a great storyteller with a bright future. So far, he&#39;s doesn&#39;t have the heft of Bellow or the fluency of Roth, but he&#39;s up there in the big leagues. I&#39;m hoping <em>Summerland</em> and <em>The Final Solution </em>are as good as the novels I&#39;ve read so far. It&#39;s going to be fun to follow Chabon&#39;s career. He&#39;s a talented guy.</p>
<p><em>October 25.</em> Today I read the novella <em>The Final Solution </em>(Harper Collins, 2004). It&#39;s a snazzy mystery. Chabon returns to his infatuation with mythic figures; he also re-creates the hero-sidekick relationship that is an obsession of <em>AAKC -- </em>this time its S. Holmes and Linus Steinman.&#0160; A very entertaining story, although sometimes I worried that I was reading a filmscript-<em>in potentia</em>.&#0160; Perhaps I&#39;m too suspicious: not many directors are jumping to cast a parrot in the lead role.&#0160;</p>
<p><em>October 30</em>.&#0160; I read forty or so pages of <em>Summerland </em>(Miramax, 2002). Two words: &quot;teen&quot; and &quot;fantasy.&quot; Not at all my cup of tea.&#0160; I hope that Chabon doesn&#39;t continue to indulge himself with such trivialities. He&#39;s too good for this stuff.</p>
<p>Michael: get back to work!&#0160; Get serious!&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Every American should read Khaled Hosseini&#39;s <em>The Kite Runner </em>(Riverhead, 2003) -- but for its political relevance, not its literary achievement. The novel is set in Afghanistan, which is one of the few countries where recent American foreign policy hasn&#39;t been entirely incompetent and disgraceful, so to read it feels reassuring and even patriotic. Inasmuch as we&#39;re engaged in a never ending war in Afghanistan, every one of our fellow citizens should have an idea why we&#39;re there and what we&#39;re doing. It&#39;s not at all obvious -- Afghanistan doesn&#39;t have a single drop of oil.&#0160; Americans should know how bad the Taliban was and might become again, and also why we should remain vigilant against any rabid fundamentalist theology--even ones that are near and more domestic than Islam.</p>
<p>In <em>The Kite Runner, </em>the conflict between Afghanistan&#39;s dominant Pashtuns and the exploited Hazaras reminds us that there are countries that are far more absurdly tribal than our own.</p>
<p>Even though I learned a great deal from this novel, I feel that as a work of art, T<em>he Kite Runner </em>is profoundly disappointing. It came highly recommended to me and I set out to fall in love, couldn&#39;t.&#0160; It&#39;s an overpraised work. It&#39;s advertised as written in &quot;hard, spare prose&quot; (I&#39;m quoting from the back-cover blurb), but in fact it&#39;s written in prose without any style at all -- and worse still, every paragraph or so there&#39;s a sentence that must make a discriminating reader cringe. The novel is very weak in characterization: aside from the autobiographical narrator, there&#39;s only one figure of any dimension --Baba-- and all the rest are flat as pancakes. The novelist is particularly bad with women, who are never more than wallpaper. The child Sohrab, in whom so much is invested, speaks an idiom that no living child has ever spoken. Has the author ever had a conversation with a real boy&#0160; The plot is filled with obvious contrivances, artificial cliff-hangers, and (goodness gracious!) a climactic fist-fight. And while I appreciate the author&#39;s love of his native country, it doesn&#39;t seem at all honest to attribute Afghani problems to &quot;Arabs, Chechens, and Pakistanis.&quot; In this novel, the Taliban is represented by a character who is half-German, a sociopathic admirer of Hitler, and (we eventually discover) a pervert who preys on little boys. He&#39;s a grotesque villain who seems to have wandered into an ostensibly serious novel from a James Bond melodrama. Why can&#39;t the author face the fact that the the Taliban are home-grown Afghani fascists? He would have given us a stronger novel if he had done so.&#0160; &#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>In Charles Dickens&#39;<em> Dombey and Son </em>(1848)<em>, </em>which I&#39;ve just re-read, Dombey&#39;s treasured son Paul dies when his older sister, Florence, is about six years old. Dombey has never liked his daughter Florence (he seems to blame her for being a girl) and likes her less after he loses Paul. Dombey could transfer his affection from his dead son to a possible &quot;replacement,&quot; his living daughter. But he shuns that very legitimate psychological option. Instead, Florence is neglected, ignored, exiled, and eventually even struck by her hard-hearted father. In real life, it&#39;s inevitable that Florence would become alienated, bitter, and distorted. In Dickens&#39; fairy-tale world her love for her father endures and she remains cheerful and optimistic. Although she experiences a truly horrible childhood, she suffers no permanent psychological deficit. Eventually, she reconciles with her father, forgives him (sic!) and produces two children (named Paul and Florence, of course).&#0160; Dombey, now chastened, grandfathers these true replacement children.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>It&#39;s a big, good novel, and Dickens makes us laugh and cry but sometimes against our will and always in defiance of our knowledge of real--as opposed to idealized--children. Dickens&#39; optimism and his faith in the power of forgiveness are wonderful but utterly otherworldly. Replacements, even quasi-replacements such as Florence, rarely fare so well.&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;</p>

		<a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2006/10/what_we_read_in.html">What We Read in the Fifties:  My Antonia</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>During the 1950s, I spent four long years treading water at Erasmus Hall, a jam-packed public high school at the bepigeoned corner of Flatbush and Church avenues.&nbsp; Among the required books in our overcrowded 11th grade English class was Willa Cather's prairie novel <em>My Antonia. </em></p>

<p>I've just returned to <em>My Antonia</em> after an interval of fifty years.&nbsp; It's an excellent novel, though I confess with shame that I remembered very little of it.&nbsp; I managed to retain a bit of the Nebraska atmosphere and emotion -- the empty, roadless steppe, the harsh winters, the sod houses, and the spirit of the indomitable settlers.&nbsp; I had absolutely zero recollection of the novel's details and not so much as a glimmer of the story.&nbsp; But then, there isn't much in the way of plot -- simply the history of narrator Jim Burden's socially confused and sexually troubled response to the &quot;Bohemian&quot; immigrant Antonia Shimerda, a vibrant girl (and later a woman) two or three years older than he.&nbsp; I remembered Antonia herself -- wild, willful, determined, and ultimately triumphant -- but I hadn't even a trace memory of Jim.&nbsp; Perhaps it's because Antonia remains in Nebraska where she tames her prairie acres and also births and nurtures uncountable children, while Jim, burdened with advantages and a middle-class education, leaves Black Hawk to become a lawyer for the railroad (in effect, an antagonist of the smallholding farmer) and, if I've read correctly, remains unmarried and childless, a rueful observer rather than an actor in the great pioneer epic.</p>

<p>I'm also astonished that I had no recollection of buxom, eager Lena Lingard, who teaches Jim about sex.&nbsp; Was I so virginal and naive that I was unable to construe Cather's circumlocutions? </p>

<p>I didn't remember, and surely didn't appreciate, that <em>My Antonia </em>is a lovely, evocatively written book, extremely economical and at the same time rich in telling detail.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

<p>When I read <em>My Antonia</em> for the first time, I hadn't encountered a plot of grass larger than the outfield at Ebbets Field (297 feet down the right field foul line), so &quot;prairie&quot; was a concept I had to take on faith. Now that I've been to Willa Cather country many times -- not yet to Red Cloud itself but to Hastings, where the author spent her adolescence&nbsp; -- <em>My Antonia</em> no longer seems quite so extra-terrestrial.&nbsp; Still, I wonder why the Italians and Irish and Jews and 'Negroes' who populated Erasmus Hall were supplied with such books-- <em>My Antonia</em> along with O. E. Rolvaag's no-longer-read <em>Giants in the Earth, </em>which is a desperately grim story of Norwegian immigrants in the Dakotas. I felt, and I think I was encouraged to feel, that <em>they </em>were the heroic, admirable, hard-working truly American immigrants, while <em>we (</em>shopkeepers, telephone linesman, garbage collectors, school-teachers) had somehow snuck in the easy, city way.&nbsp; Why weren't we asked to read books about us?&nbsp; Weren't we just as genuine?</p>

<p>Midway through the novel, Jim takes a few seconds to meditate on the relations between old families like his own (his grandparents came from Virginia) and the Czechs and Scandinavians whom they looked down upon.&nbsp; Conventional wisdom was that &quot;all foreigners were ignorant people who couldn't speak English.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;But today,&quot; says Jim, speaking as a surrogate Willa Cather herself, &quot;the best that a harassed Black Hawk merchant can hope for is to sell provisions and farm machinery and automobiles to the rich farms where that first crop of stalwart Bohemian and Scandinavian girls are now the mistresses.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;It's an observation that applies not only to the economics of Nebraska in the 1880s, but is perpetual to the American experience.&nbsp; Immigrants work hard.&nbsp; Is it possible that today's anti-immigration frenzy is driven by the fear that the present crop of brown-skinned newcomers will work so furiously that they'll leave in the lurch the neo-nativists who seem to have contented themselves with a lazy respectability?</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>[January 17, 2012.&#0160; There are at this moment three pages of comments appended to this entry, which I wrote almost six years ago. The comments are most interesting and revealing.&#0160; Don&#39;t miss &#39;em -- Vivian].</p>
<p>In <em>The Accidental Tourist </em>(New York [Knopf], 1991), Anne Tyler describes a malady that, as far as I know had never before been acknowledged in literature.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span>All four of her eccentric Leary siblings share &quot;a total inability to find their way around.&quot; Macon Leary, who writes travel books for a living and is the novel&#39;s focal character, christens this trait &quot;geographical dyslexia.&quot;</p>
<p>I&#39;m not convinced that &quot;geographical dyslexia&quot; is a good name for the Learys&#39; condition. An alternative, &quot;directional disability,&quot; is not much better. Whatever the name, sufferers will know what is meant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span>There&#39;s a class of people (I&#39;m one of them) who are chronically lost; who take a few steps in a strange city and can&#39;t find their way back to the hotel; who don&#39;t know how to exit the building they&#39;ve just entered because they&#39;ve strolled a corridor or two; who are totally befuddled and even panicked when they drive into a familiar intersection from an unaccustomed direction; who break into a cold sweat when someone says, &quot;you know how to get home -- just reverse the directions&quot;; and who, because they&#39;re frequently lost, are subject to ridicule and mockery from their very own families and from their most intimate friends.</p>
<p>Macon Leary has a theory about his persistent dysgeographica. He thinks he&#39;s disabled because all his life he&#39;s moved from house to house, and &quot;people who&#39;d been moved around a great deal never acquired a fixed point of reference, but wandered forever in a fog.&quot; I know of no evidence to support this wholly improbable suggestion. Macon clutches at a straw because there&#39;s no data (and there&#39;s no data, at least in part, because there&#39;s no accepted name for his condition).</p>
<p>Every sufferer nurses his own unscientific, anecdotal theory. I was once convinced that my dysgeographica was related to my total absence of rhythm -- as a child I could never learn to pump a swing or even to jump rope. My brother thinks that it must be connected to his aversion to heights. My niece takes the view that it&#39;s somehow related to her motion sickness and to her bouts of dizziness. A friend thinks that the trouble stems from the fact that she was naturally left-handed but was trained to be right-handed. In fact, no one knows whether dysgeographica is connected to any other trait, or whether it&#39;s one of a cluster of traits.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> In terms of hard science, the</span> directionally disabled have been allowed to languish in the dark ages.</p>
<p>I&#39;m almost convinced that dysgeographica runs in families. My father was monumentally disabled, and one of my brothers is so impaired that he&#39;s occasionally looked to me for directional advice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> Barking up the wrong tree, is he!! </span>(I have another brother who always knows exactly where he is -- perhaps he&#39;s adopted.) In <em>The Accidental Tourist,&#0160; </em>Anne Tyler, who&#39;s a very sharp observer of mankind, tellingly attributes dysgeographica to all four Leary siblings.Tyler also notes that Macon has learned how to cope: he &quot;kept a stack of index cards giving detailed directions to the houses of his friends -- even friends he&#39;d known forever.&quot; Coping mechanisms are essential to the dysgeographical. When I have to drive any distance without a navigator, I write the directions with a thick pen in a notebook and keep it open on the passenger seat. For some reason, I can&#39;t seem to retain more than one or two of the approaching turns in my mind, so I must continually refer to the notebook. Mapquest has proved to be a boon, especially if I remember to print out in very large type.</p>
<p>In <em>The Accidental Tourist</em>, no one pokes fun at the Leary siblings. But in real life, it&#39;s considered quite amusing to laugh at the chronically lost. People don&#39;t understand that dysgeographica is a disability like colorblindness. I can&#39;t say how many times I&#39;ve been instructed to &quot;concentrate,&quot; or &quot;pay attention&#39; -- advice which is just as effective as commanding a color blind person to make an effort to register shades of yellow or blue. Without a label and without a support group, the dysgeographical will continue to be ridiculed. It&#39;s time for us to unite. Unless we do so, we are not only doomed, like Macon Leary, to be &quot;adrift upon the planet, helpless, praying that by luck [we] might stumble across [our] destination,&quot; but doomed to be humiliated as well.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>When I encountered an excerpt from <em>wunderkind</em> J. S. Foer&#39;s <em>Everything is Illuminated</em> in the <em>New Yorker</em>, I was dazzled. The writing was witty, focused, intelligent, and emotionally rich.</p>
<p>Now I&#39;ve read the whole book, and I&#39;m deeply divided about this Jekyll-Hydish performance. The good parts are still excellent. Jonfen&#39;s Ukrainian adventures in search of Augustine are beautifully managed&#0160; -- although I must say that the joke about Alex&#39;s English, so wonderful in the excerpt, quickly grew wearisome. But the interspersed history of the shtetl of Trachimbrod is just plain bad. It&#39;s boring, embarrassing, and imitative, consisting not only of helpings of I. B. Singer and of the least attractive aspects of Marquez and his numerous unmagical epigonoi, but also of an unhealthy dollop of supermarket-checkout prose. Can Foer discipline his talent, find his own voice, and move into the big leagues?&#0160; It would be tragic if he continues to indulge his genius for imitation. Or perhaps he&#39;ll be both good and bad, like Larry McMurtry, who&#39;s written world-class novels (<em>Leaving Cheyenne,&#0160; Lonesome Dove) </em>but has also squandered his talent on pounds and pounds of glossy trash. Time will tell.</p>

		<a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2006/05/the_worst_perso.html">Adolf Award for Worst Person of the Century</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p class="MsoNormal">The winner of the Adolf for worst person of the century goes to Pope Urban II. The century in question is the first one of the previous millennium, or 1000-1100. Like many other Adolf award winners, Urban perpetrated evil deeds that have continued to provoke hatred, war and suffering even to the present day.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">HIs principal crime: Pope Urban fabricated a litany of Muslim atrocities in order to incite Christians to wrest Jerusalem from a “race” that he called “absolutely alien to God.” In November, 1095, in Clermont in the south of France, Urban told an eager audience that Muslims had circumcised Christians and spread their unspeakable blood on baptismal fonts; that they had “cut open the navels of others, tearing out their vital organs” and that they had committed appalling atrocities upon women “of which it is more evil to speak than to keep silent.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Some say that his catalog of mutilations and barbarities was based on faulty intelligence but most think it was his own invention. Urban did not just incite and condone warfare, he sanctified it. His crusade would be a pilgrimage -- and therefore a form of penance. Combatants who died in its course would be purified. God, it was claimed, has instituted “holy wars” so that knights might find a new path to salvation.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Roughly one hundred thousand crusaders answered his call and set out for the Levant to take Jerusalem from the infidels.On the way, they warmed to their task by conducting genocidal attacks of unprecedented brutality upon the Jewish communities of the Rhineland (communities that had been in place before the advent of Christianity). These quasi-sanctioned raids are now known as “the first holocaust.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The passage of the crusaders to the middle East was made easier because the Muslims were divided into two factions --Shiite and Sunni -- that were perpetually at daggers drawn. The crusaders laid siege to Antioch in October, 1099, and when they took the city, slaughtered its entire Muslim population. In possession of Antioch, they found themselves entirely surrounded by hostile armies. But God was on their side. The timely intervention of “countless armies with white horses… led by the saints George, Mercurius, and Demetrius“ allowed them to fight their way out of the city.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The crusaders headed south and in midsummer of 1099 besieged Jerusalem. Muslim defenders taunted the crusaders by setting up crosses and urinating on them; in response, the Christians catapulted the bodies of captured Muslims over the walls. When Jerusalem fell, the celebration was euphoric. The Provencal crusader Raymond of Aguilers reported that “some of the pagans were mercifully beheaded, others were tortured for a long time and burned to death in searing flames. Piles of heads, hands and feet lay in the houses and streets. Infants were seized by the soles of their feet from their mothers’ laps or their cradles, and dashed against the wall, breaking their necks.” Covered with gore, weighed down with plunder, “rejoicing and weeping from excessive gladness,&quot; the crusaders &quot;worshipped at the Sepulchre of Jesus the Savior.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Although Pope Urban II died just two weeks after the fall and sack of Jerusalem, there is no question but that his Adolf was well and truly earned and that his legacy lives on.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Yesterday we learned that my nephew Steven&#39;s book on the philosophy of martial arts will appear in July. Hosannas to him. Steven&#39;s wife, Terrylynn, has a book out on criminal justice.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a writing family. The direct descendants of Isaiah and Eta have produced books on a wide variety of subjects.&#0160;</p>
<p>It began when my father construed and annotated the standard form of real estate contract. And then my brother Jon published that novel about the dance and another family member of his generation wrote that introductory book about Shakespeare and a bunch of stuff on English literature. NGP&#39;&#39;s book on election technology. My cousin Marian&#39;s twin daughters (upon whom I haven&#39;t set eyes since their grandfather&#39;s funeral, which was in 1965, I believe) have written a number of books. Nancy, a folklorist wrote about <span class="GrayText10"><span class="GrayText11">the hammered dulcimer and about musical instrument making in New York in earlier centuries. Nora, a medical anthropologist, has written a classic account of sign-language on Nantucket as well as volumes about third-world medicine. And then there&#39;s Eve&#39;s journalism (not yet in hardcover). If we look to the descendants of Isaiah&#39;s father, we can include Hiram C&#39;s book on global justice.&#0160; </span></span></p>
<p><span class="GrayText10"><span class="GrayText11">I bet there are other books -- I&#39;ve lost track of many members of the extended family.&#0160; </span></span></p>
<p><span class="GrayText10"><span class="GrayText11">Also:&#0160; my sister-in-law Ellen&#39;s book on the internet; my daughter-in-law&#39;s writings on advanced technology, and probably all sorts of other things by non-genetic family members.&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; <br /><br />I have no statistics, but I&#39;d guess there&#39;s a higher concentration of published authors in our family than in most. Is there a gene for scribbling?</span></span></p>
<p><span class="GrayText10"><span class="GrayText11"> &#0160;It&#39;s interesting to me that except for the one novel, there are no other stories, poetry, screenplays.Our inheritance: facts rather than fantasy.&#0160;<br /></span></span></p>

		<a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2006/04/lions.html">Predators Then and Now</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p class="MsoNormal">There&#39;s more neighborhood mountain lion news: yesterday a seven-year-old boy, walking in the rearward of a group of six or seven hikers, was pounced upon in the mountains just west of town by a big guy. The child was bitten and clawed but is now recovering. Family members drove the lion away.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In my view, they should never have allowed the child to pull up the rear.&#0160;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I’d been thinking about predators even before this last attack (see the entry for April 8).&#0160; By one of those curious convergences that make life so rich, I just happened to be reading Bruce Chatwin’s <em>The Songlines</em> (New York: Viking, 1987), a travel narrative ostensibly about the sacred but invisible paths along which the ancestors of the Australian aborigines traveled and &#39;sang the world into existence.&#39;&#0160; The thesis of this quirky, self-indulgent and intermittently brilliant narrative is that human beings are by nature not sedentary but migratory.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">But the book isn&#39;t only about migrants; &#0160;n one of <em>The Songlines&#39; </em>many meanders, Chatwin writes a few pages on the age-old interaction of human beings with big predators like the mountain lion. He takes issue with the much-loved claim of right-wing thinkers that human beings are naturally territorial and aggressive -- that we are nothing more than naked apes who must continually strive to control larger and larger dominions. Instead, he offers the alternative view that because of our long history of fending off predators, human beings are naturally not aggressive but defensive&#0160; -- and, moreover, that It&#39;s the defensive imperative that caused our species to move from savagery to civility. He asks us to think of the situation of the earliest humans. &quot;The first men were humbled, harried, besieged -- their communities few and fragmented… clinging to life and one another through the horrors of the night.&quot;&#0160; &quot;Might not,&quot; he asks, &quot;all the attributes we call ‘human’ – language, song-making, food-sharing, gift-giving, intermarriage... have evolved as stratagems for survival, hammered out against tremendous odds, to avert the threat of extinction?&quot;&#0160; It&#39;s a challenging, overarching hypothesis -- and whether or not there are facts to validate it is beyond my ken.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It&#39;s certainly true that first humans in Africa had to cope with a variety of nasty predators -- lions were there long before people -- and that when&#0160; our ancestors migrated to Europe they walked into a wild, dangerous country. The European lion, <em>panthera leo,</em> widespread from 900,000 years ago to the end of the last ice age, was a third taller and longer than surviving African lions, which themselves can weigh 450 pounds and reach a length of 8 1/2 feet. The lions in the virginal land that our ancestors crossed the Mediterranean to colonize would have been as tall as a fully grown Paleolithic man and might have weighed as much as 880 pounds.&#0160; And remember that for 99% of our time on earth, humans were either entirely unarmed or possessed only of the hand ax -- a palm-size piece of sharpened but haft-less flint. No matter what theory of the origins of civilization we embrace, we should remember that our genes were selected in a world of woolly rhinoceroses, mammoths, aurochs, and wolves and that we competed with the big bears for what were then the best residences on earth-- the limestone caves in the Ardeche region in France.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It&#39;s in these caves that the memory of European lions is beautifully preserved. Thirty thousand years ago, a long tradition of animal representation climaxed in the paintings in the Chauvet Cave. There are beautiful representations of European lions on the hunt and at rest in Jean-Marie Chauvet&#39;s <em>The Dawn of Art: The Chauvet Cave </em>(New York: Abrams, 1995) --&#0160; irrefutable evidence that our forefathers knew them at first hand.&#0160; It&#39;s unquestionable that many a child -- and many an adult -- fell prey to these adversaries. And perhaps Chatwin is right; perhaps those humans who survived to reproduce were selected not for aggressiveness but for congeniality and especially for artistic ability. How else can we account for our species&#39; continual preoccupation, or perhaps obsession, with all the many forms of beauty?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>April 17.&#0160; </em>The authorities tracked and killed an 80-pound female panther. I sincerely hope that it was the offending animal and not an innocent bystander.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I had great hope that I would love to read&#0160;<em>The Naked and the Dead.&#0160;</em>Although Norman Mailer is quite a few years older than I, he&#39;s a Brooklyn boy who became a somebody. Mailer went to neighborhood schools, then on to Harvard and the Army, and made a quite a splash. (As a matter of fact, he attended P. S. 161 in Crown Heights, a school that we at P. S. 217 regularly trounced in the summer softball league.) &#0160;But <em>The Naked and the Dead</em> was less fun than I had hoped. It is 721 exhausting pages long. It has too many words, too many characters, too much flashback, too much repetitive talk. It&#39;s not epic; it&#39;s just long.</p>
<p>The profusion of detail swallows an exemplary story: on a south Pacific island, a platoon of soldiers is assigned to perform an impossible task. The platoon suffers deaths, injuries, wounds, tensions, and a variety of psychic traumas, even though, unknown to any of its members, by dumb luck and superior numbers, the American forces have long since broken through the Japanese lines and the battle for the island has been won.&#0160;</p>
<p>The novel had a huge impact in 1948 and throughout the fifties and it started Norman Mailer on his astonishing and perplexing career. It was much discussed in the P. S. 217 schoolyard not only as a hot book (lots of talk about sex and a superabundance of &quot;fugs&quot;) but also as a scary account of life in the United States military.&#0160; It certainly frightened me.&#0160;</p>
<p>It&#39;s hard to believe that fifty years have gone by I last read <em>The Naked and the Dead</em>. I still admire its ambition and I&#39;m impressed that Mailer was just twenty-five years old when it was published, but I&#39;m deeply offended by the want of economy, the lack of discipline, the narrow perspective, the philosophical incoherence, the plot lapses, and especially by the reliance on shallow ethnic stereotypes. I can&#39;t help thinking that, if Mailer had had patience and wisdom and, most of all, restraint, <em>The Naked and the Dead </em>might have been not a seven-hundred page monster but a two-hundred page masterpiece.</p>
<p>But I doubt that P. S. 161 put much emphasis on the virtue of restraint.&#0160; In storytelling, Brooklyn guys choose hyperbole over litotes.&#0160; &#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I know that I read <em>Lolita </em>sometime during my senior year in college, which was the last year of the socially-constricted Eisenhower presidency. Nabokov was a celebrity at Cornell and I remember attending a lecture in which he delivered a hilarious destruction of Soviet realism. He was the first novelist whom I ever saw with my own eyes (I had sat next to Tom Pynchon in a course in Eighteenth-Century English literature every day for a semester, but although Pynchon had published a story or two in <em>Epoch, </em>he was just another gangley guy and hardly the artist--or the enigma--that he would soon become).</p>
<p><em>Lolita </em>had been published in Paris in 1955, so it&#39;s just a bit more than fifty years old, and therefore halfway to its centennial, when, it&#39;s often asserted, it becomes possible to distinguish between works for the moment and works for the ages. An interim report:&#0160;<em>Lolita</em> is doing very very well.&#0160; It&#39;s as impressive now as it was then -- but for different reasons. When I read the novel In 1959, I was dazzled by its verbal surface: the allusions to Poe, to <em>Hamlet, </em>to Joyce (whose <em>Ulysses</em> I had read closely even then). Of course I missed much, especially because at that time I had read almost no continental literature. But I loved being able to decipher some of the novel&#39;s playful mysteries: that, for example, &quot;Vivian Darkbloom&quot; -- who is Clare Quilty&#39;s accomplice in crime -- was an anagram for &quot;Vladimir Nabokov&quot; and that Lolita&#39;s teachers &quot;Miss Horn&quot; and &quot;Miss Cole&quot; spoonerized an obscenity. It pleased me immensely that Charlotte Haze ordered a mattress from &quot;a firm located at 4640 Roosevelt Blvd., Philadelphia,&quot; because I had spent three dreadful summers working in the Sears Roebuck warehouse on Utica Avenue, where I might have composed an <em>Anatomy of Boredom. </em>I knew to whom &quot;Brown, Dolores&quot; alluded, and I knew why she squatted outside the gates of the cloister. And then there were Nabokov&#39;s extraordinary rhetorical displays. Had there ever been a novelist who cared enough to write a sentence like &quot;the least pressure would suffice to set all paradise loose,&quot; where &quot;least&quot; balanced &quot;loose,&quot; &quot;paradise&quot; balanced &quot;pressure,&quot; and &quot;set&quot; offset &quot;suffice?&quot;</p>
<p>I loved <em>Lolita </em>and I read all that I could find of Nabokov&#39;s early works and then all the new ones as they appeared. But it&#39;s been a long time since I last read the novel and the sexual abuse of children is no longer, if it ever was, a matter for flippancy. I was worried that <em>Lolita </em>would be insensitive and dated. But it&#39;s not so. It&#39;s still satirical, and it&#39;s still fun, but now it&#39;s less comic than it is sad. Humbert is still clever, but he&#39;s clearly a madman, and the murder of Quilty is the best apology that he can render to Lolita. Humbert knows he&#39;s the blackest of villains, that he&#39;s robbed Lolita of her childhood, that he lived in &quot;a world of total evil,&quot; and that &quot;even the most miserable of family lives was better than the parody of incest, which... was all I could offer the waif.&quot; The novel shocked Eisenhower America because it was thought to be lurid -- but it&#39;s no more lurid than <em>Oedipus.&#0160;</em>It&#39;s fully, designedly, and beautifully tragic.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>When <em>The Naked and the Dead</em> was published in 1948, the word &quot;naked&quot; still had shock value. Mailer&#39;s novel was followed by books with such titles as <em>The Naked Society, </em><em>The Naked Ape </em>and the moderately oxymoronic <em>Naked Lunch.</em></p>
<p>It wasn&#39;t long before shock devolved into cliche. The publishing world has now transformed itself, at least as far as book titles are concerned, into an enormous, sprawling colony of nudists. Amazon lists over a thousand books in English with &quot;naked&quot; in the title.</p>
<p>A reader interested in religion may choose from <em>The Naked Christian, Naked Buddha, Naked Buddhism, The Naked Soul, The Naked God, The Naked Church, Naked Angels, Naked in the Promised Land </em>and <em>Praying Naked. The Naked Parish Priest </em>may imply more than is strictly proper and <em>Buck-Naked Faith </em>suggests that ordinary nakedness is insufficient.</p>
<p>For the button-down corporate world, there&#39;s <em>The Naked Corporation, The Naked Consumer, The Naked Employee, The Naked Investor, Naked Imperialism, The Naked Entrepreneur, Naked Marketing, Naked Imperialism, Naked Economics, The Naked Capitalist, Naked in the Boardroom, The Naked Manager, The Naked Trader, Naked at the Interview, The Naked Factory, </em>and <em>Work Naked.</em></p>
<p>There&#39;s hardly an area of interest that hasn&#39;t been touched by the advent of naked titling. Politics?: <em>The Naked Empire, Naked Liberty, Naked Justice, The Naked Communist. </em>Geographical?:&#0160; <em>The Naked Tropics, Naked Sun, The Naked Island, Naked Heartland, The Naked Mountain, The Naked Tree, Naked Savages, The Naked Airport, Naked in Baghdad, Naked in Da Nang, Naked City, The Naked Tourist, Naked Wanderlust, The Naked Jungle, Naked Germany,</em> even<em>&#0160; Naked in Cyberspace, </em>wherever that is. Social?:&#0160;<em>Naked Conversations, Naked Bitch, The Naked Leader, The Naked Duke, The Naked Marquis, The Naked Warrior, Naked Ambition, The Naked Roommate, Naked Conversations, The Naked Crowd.&#0160; </em>Gastronomical?: <em>The Naked Chef, Naked Chocolate, Naked Fruit, Eat Papayas Naked, The Naked Martini.&#0160;</em>Anatomical<em>: The Naked Face, The Naked Neuron, The Naked Chiropractor, The Naked Quack. </em>Domestic: <em>Naked Rooms, The Naked Wall.&#0160;</em>Artistic?:&#0160; <em>Naked Clay, Naked Vinyl, Writing Naked, The Naked Cartoonist, Naked Poetry. </em>Athletic?:&#0160; <em>Naked Skydiving, The Naked Rower, Swimming Naked, The Naked Runner, The Naked Hunter, The Naked Pilot, Naked Weightlifting.</em></p>
<p>It&#39;s disappointing to find nothing in the arena of naked basketball, despite Dennis Rodman&#39;s expressed desire to play his last professional game naked-- to which the NBA commissioner is supposed to have responded, &quot;it would definitely be his last.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>Other professions: <em>The Naked Therapist, The Naked Detective, The Naked Bird Watcher, The Naked Spy, The Naked Civil Servant, The Naked Counselor, The Naked Anthropologist.</em></p>
<p>The field of dance has produced a series of related titles:&#0160; <em>Dancing Naked Under Palm Trees,&#0160; ...in the Mindfield, ..at the Edge of Dawn, ...in Front of the Fridge, ...in the Material World, ...on the Floor, ...in the Sun. </em>There&#39;s a whole genre of books for people whose tastes are more specialized than mine. A sample:&#0160; <em>Naked Hairy Jocks</em>.</p>
<p><em>Nearly Naked </em>is refreshingly modest.</p>
<p>As might be expected, naked has its parodists. The faux-romance <em>Naked Came the Stranger </em>was followed by <em>Naked Came the Manatee </em>and <em>Naked Came the Sasquatch. Naked and the Undead </em>is bloody good, and <em>Naked Brunch </em>is, I think, delicious. The most exquisite parody: Rita Rudner&#39;s <em>Naked Beneath My Clothes. </em>I&#39;m staking my claim to <em>Naked Came the Nudist.</em></p>
<p>I was entirely wrong to jump to the conclusion that <em>The Naked Mole Rat </em>was a parody; it&#39;s a serious study <em>of Heterocephalus glaber </em>by an academic zoologist.</p>
                        </div>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>J. D. Salinger&#39;s <em>The Catcher in the Rye </em>is an anti-<em>bildungsroman -- </em>a &quot;novel of education&quot; without the least shred of moral, intellectual, or spiritual growth. Holden Caulfield, the novel&#39;s naive yet jaded narrator, learns absolutely nothing either about himself or about life. Unable to profit from his various encounters, he dismisses almost everyone he meets as &quot;phony.&quot; The incessant drumming on that one particular adjective leads a reader to hope that Holden will find authenticity somewhere in his horizon, but <em>The Catcher in the Rye </em>is not a novel that rewards optimism. It concludes with a vision of Holden&#39;s pre-pubescent sister Phoebe going &quot;round and round&quot; on a symbolic carousel -- going nowhere, it would seem -- and in a brief coda Holden himself has been institutionalized and placed under the care of an unsympathetic psychoanalyst. Nor does the whiff of Humbertism in the relation between Holden and young Phoebe contribute any last-second learning or cheer.</p>
<p>Even in the 1950s, <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em> enjoyed a cadre of fiercely loyal partisans who powerfully identified with Holden Caulfield. I didn&#39;t believe then, and certainly don&#39;t believe now, that Holden Caulfield mirrored the anguish of my own particular soul. I was not a true believer, and I was not entranced by Holden. For me, the novel was nothing more than a better-than-average coming-of-age story -- although a dispiriting one because Holden does not mature but instead remains stranded in perpetual, painful adolescence.</p>
<p>A novel without hope, <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em> has become an inspiration for the hopeless. In Los Angeles, in 1989, twenty-one-year-old Robert Bando shot and killed a young actress whom he had been pestering with trinkets and messages. In a nearby alley, police found a .357-caliber handgun, a bloody shirt, and a copy of <em>The Catcher in the Rye.&#0160;</em>Two years later, John Hinckley shot and crippled James Brady and almost succeeded in assassinating Ronald Reagan. Hinckley had fantasized that killing the president would impress the actress Jodie Foster, whom he imagined that he was wooing. In his pocket he carried a well-read, tattered paperback of -- you guessed it --<em>The Catcher in the Rye. </em>In 1980, on Manhattan&#39;s West Side, Mark David Chapman, concealing his pistol under a copy of <em>The Catcher in the Rye,</em> shot John Lennon five times at point blank. He had inscribed his copy of the novel with the words &quot;To Holden Caulfield from Holden Caulfield&quot; -- Chapman had tried to legally change his name to that of Salinger&#39;s troubled narrator. From jail, the proud murderer issued an endorsement: &quot;My wish is for all of you to someday read <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em>.&quot; At his trial Chapman asserted that he had killed Lennon because the singer had become &quot;phony,&quot; and at his sentencing he read to the judge the section of the book in which Holden tells his sister Phoebe that he imagined himself in a field of rye with &quot;thousands of little kids&quot; whom he must prevent from falling off &quot;the edge of some crazy cliff.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p><em>The Catcher in the Rye</em> still sells well (15,000,000 copies in print by 1996) and has become a fixture in the high school and college classroom, where successive generations of adolescents can calibrate their degree of <em>angst</em> against Holden&#39;s. But increasingly, and paradoxically, attention has turned from the novel to Salinger himself, who has not published anything since 1965 and, secluded in his Cornish, New Hampshire retreat, has become the world&#39;s most notorious hermit since St. Simeon Stylites mounted his pillar in sixth-century Antioch.</p>
<p>Although he is a hermit, Salinger is anything but a saint. In 1987, in a bizarre echo of Holden<em>-</em>obsessed stalkers, Salinger, then sixty-eight years old, flew to California and barged onto the set of the TV show <em>Dynasty</em> in search of one of the series&#39;s starlets, Catherine Oxenberg, with whom he had apparently fallen into long-distance electronic infatuation. He was &quot;escorted&quot; off the set.</p>
<p>Did Catherine Oxenberg have a precursor?&#0160; She did, indeed she did. Several, in fact, including Joyce Maynard, described as &quot;the Lolita of all Lolitas,&quot; who was eighteen and a freshman at Yale in 1972 when Salinger, at the age of fifty-three, initiated a romance by sending her a fan letter.</p>
<p>These and other even less savory details about Caulfield-Salinger&#39;s life can be found in Paul Alexander&#39;s thin, amateurish biography <em>Salinger </em>(Los Angeles:&#0160; Renaissance Books, 1999), which does not propose, although it might, that J. D. has learned as little about life as his most famous character.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>In <em>Abducted:&#0160; How People Come to Believe They Were Abducted by Aliens (</em>Harvard, 2005), Susan Clancy recounts interviews with fifty or so &quot;abductees.&quot; Each person&#39;s experience is unique, but the various stories can be melded into a composite narrative.&#0160;<span style="color: #3333cc;">&quot;I was having problems with anxiety and depression. I was at Fenway Park with my buddies watching a game. The next thing I remember, I was on Mission Hill and it was five in the morning. I was always interested in science fiction. I read <em>Communion; </em>I saw <em>E. T</em> and <em>Close Encounters.</em> I went to a hypnotist, and memories started flooding back. I started sobbing uncontrollably. They were long and tall, with huge black eyes that went around their heads. I remembered them fastening a device like a suction cup to my genitals to suck out the sperm painfully. They inserted a foot-long tube into my nostril. I know it happened because I get nosebleeds. My dad thinks it&#39;s a transmitter they put in there.&#0160; They&#39;ve programmed other memories to disappear. Until I experienced the aliens, life was empty, meaningless. Now that I have my memories, I understand everything. What happened to me was overwhelming. It was real. I can&#39;t explain-- I felt it. I was changed from the person that I was.&#0160; It was the most positive event of my life. It helped me to see life as beautiful, as a gift.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Alien abductees may hold to false beliefs, but they have powerful faith. Clancy reports that once, at a convention of abductees, she tried to talk about the unreliability of anecdotal evidence, the fragility of memory, the nature of the sleep-paralysis syndrome, the creation of false memories under hypnosis, Occam&#39;s Razor (the employment of the most economical hypothesis to explain a phenomenon), etc. According to Clancy, there was a long silence, and then one of the participants said, </span>&quot;tell her about the metallic tube that came out of Jim&#39;s nose, the one that went down the sink before you both could catch it.&quot;</p>
<p>Eventually Clancy brings herself to discuss the obvious parallel of abduction to religion, which, she says, she is reluctant to do because she has &quot;about a thousand Irish Catholic relatives [she] doesn&#39;t want to offend.&quot; Nevertheless, she concludes that &quot;alien-abduction beliefs can be considered a type of religious creed, based on faith, not facts.&quot; Kind to her extended family, Clancy does pursue the argument to the next logical step: that ordinary, accepted beliefs of supernatural intervention in human affairs are exactly as credible -- no more, no less -- as belief in macrocephalic waifs with black wraparound eyes who stick needles into your navel to produce hybrid children.</p>
<p>She also reports that one of her informants, when challenged, responded, &quot;I trust my gut and my gut says aliens.&quot; Is there a better argument for listening not to our guts but to our brains?</p>
                        </div>

                                <p>Here&#39;s the description of a project posted on a literary website by (I&#39;m guessing) a young Shakespeare scholar: &quot;I want to create a comprehensive XML schema for Shakespeare&#39;s plays, and then apply the schema in an online prototype. The schema will conform to TEI standards where possible and appropriate, and exceed them where necessary.

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>We were in California tending the grandchildren (a girl, 6, and a boy, 4) while &quot;the daughter&quot; and her husband were on a sun-and-sand vacation down in Baja. The children are in the habit of coming into their parents&#39; &#0160;bed when they have trouble going to sleep. We&#39;re in the habit of reading aloud before putting out the lights. At present, I&#39;m reading <em>Swann&#39;s Way.</em> One night, the children, as is their custom, came in to snuggle. After they settled down, I resumed reading: &quot;I was not quite Bergotte&#39;s only admirer; he was also the favorite writer of a friend of my mother&#39;s, a very well read woman, while Dr. du Boulbon would keep his patients waiting as he read Bergotte&#39;s most recent book; and it was from his consulting room, and from a park near Combray, that some of the first seeds of that predilection for Bergotte took flight....&quot; The children fell almost immediately to sleep; Proust&#39;s undiagrammable sentences were too much for them.</p>
<p>The next night, same scenario. We&#39;re in bed. The children came in to snuggle; they thrashed about for a few moments, giggled, eventually settled down. I picked up Monsieur Proust. &quot;To Mme. Verdurin&#39;s great surprise, Swann never abandoned them. He went to meet them wherever they were, sometimes in restaurants in the outlying districts where no went went much yet, because it was not the season, more often to the theater, which Mme. Verdurin liked very much;&#0160; and because one day, at her house, she said in his presence that on evenings when there were premieres, or galas, a pass would have been useful to them, that it had inconvenienced them very much not to have one the day of Gambetta&#39;s funeral....&quot;&#0160; And then, the young lady looked at the young man, and he looked at her, and without a word, the two of them rose from our bed and padded back to their own room.</p>
<p>Literary criticism in its most elemental manifestation.&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;</p>

		<a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2006/02/in_the_latest_n.html">Beethoven Manuscript;  Missing Shakespeare Play</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p class="descender">The latest <em>New Yorker</em> reports the discovery of a long-lost manuscript by Beethoven. It&#39;s not a new piece, but an arrangement for piano, four hands, of the composer’s “Grosse Fuge,” or “Great Fugue,” -- which is one of the most exciting and challenging pieces of music in the known universe. The manuscript was sold at Sotheby&#39;s in December to an unnamed buyer for $1.95 million. I know the Grosse Fuge very well in the form of a string quartet; I would love to hear the four-hand piano version sometime soon.</p>
<p class="descender">The Beethoven discovery renews my hope that some day another long-lost item will re-emerge -- the Shakespeare play that&#39;s been missing for just about four hundred years.</p>
<p class="descender">In 1598, Francis Meres compiled a list of the plays of Shakespeare that were known to him: he mentioned, among a dozen others, Shakespeare&#39;s &quot;<em>Loue Labors lost,</em> [and] his <em>Loues labours wonne.&quot;&#0160;</em>No one gave much credence to Meres, who was thought to have hallucinated the second play, until 1953, when a book by Thomas Gataker called <em>Certaine Sermons (</em>1637<em>) </em>was rebound and two sheets of paper covered with Elizabethan handwriting were discovered in the backing. The papers were part of the ledger of an otherwise unknown stationer in Exeter and listed the books that were in his stock in August, 1603. Among them: &quot;marchant of vennis,&quot; &quot;taming of a shrew,&quot; &quot;loves labor lost&quot; and &quot;loves labor won.&quot;&#0160; So Meres was right all along; Shakespeare had in truth written a play called <em>Love&#39;s Labor&#39;s Won.</em> And it had been published. But the play must have soon disappeared because the diligent compilers of the great 1623 Folio either didn&#39;t know of it or couldn&#39;t locate a copy.</p>
<p class="descender">It&#39;s possible that the play has vanished into oblivion, but it&#39;s also possible that a copy lies in a closet, drawer or vault. The Beethoven fugue was found by a librarian who was cleaning a cabinet at the Palmer Theological Seminary in Wynnewood, Pennsylvania&#0160; -- how the manuscript found its way to that location is anyone&#39;s guess. The Thomas Malory manuscript -- one of the most important literary discoveries of the last century -- was lying unidentified in plain sight on top of a safe in Winchester Cathedral. So it&#39;s not at all impossible that a quarto of <em>Love&#39;s Labor&#39;s Won</em> still lurks somewhere, waiting.&#0160;</p>
<p class="descender">There are some other Shakespeare items of interest (and no doubt of monetary value) that might also resurface. There&#39;s the missing quarto zero (Q0) of <em>The First Part of King Henry the Fourth</em> (only a few pages of which are known, and then only because they were accidentally bound into a copy of a later quarto); there&#39;s <em>Cardenio </em>(co-authored with John Fletcher), which was probably Shakespeare&#39;s last effort; there might also be a fuller manuscript version of <em>Macbeth</em> (the Folio play seems to have been deliberately shortened for provincial performance).&#0160; Also of interest: the anonymous <em>Hamlet </em>that was written a decade or so before Shakespeare&#39;s, and which the playwright used as the basis of his revision. Only a single line of the earlier play has survived: the ghost is known to have cried, as shrilly as a street-seller of oysters, &quot;Hamlet, revenge.&quot;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>In my daughter&#39;s basement I found a dried-up, stained, pages-hanging-out 1959 paperback edition of William Golding&#39;s <em>Lord of the Flies.&#0160;</em>On the cover: &quot;Copyright 1954.&quot; &quot;Over 4,450,000 copies in print.&quot; &quot;Sixty-second impression.&quot; &quot;Now Available For Students And Teachers: the Casebook Edition&#0160; containing the full text of the novel, critical essays, notes, and bibliography.&quot; <em>Lord of the Flies </em>leaped into public prominence in the mid-1950s and quickly became a classroom staple. A quick googling found half a dozen websites designed to help high school students generate reports on the novel&#39;s &quot;symbolism,&quot; etc.</p>
<p>I didn&#39;t like <em>Lord of the Flies </em>when I read it back then and it&#39;s become less likable-- and less worthy of respect-- over the last half-century. It&#39;s a variation on <em>Robinson Crusoe</em>, except that this time a score of boys land (how? and not a one of them injured!!) on an uninhabited island in the Pacific. They very quickly degenerate into savages, murder two of their own number, and are hunting down the last boy who possesses a modicum of civility when a naval officer (<em>nauta ex machina?</em>) arrives to take command. <em>Lord of the Flies </em>is a dyspeptic, dystopian novel; it&#39;s also, according to the websites, a story of the contest between civilization and barbarism and,-- guess what?-- it&#39;s barbarism by a country mile.&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Robinson Crusoe himself was no perfect model of psychological health, but Defoe&#39;s story has been admired for centuries (it&#39;s the most reprinted novel in history) at least in part because it asserts that a resourceful human being can triumph over a bad situation. Crusoe reads his Bible, keeps a calendar and a diary, domesticates goats, develops a working agricultural system, learns pottery, carpentry and other crafts, and builds himself both a summer and a winter domicile. <em>Lord of the Flies,</em> on the contrary, is entirely pessimistic about human capabilities: its flat, book-less, unskilled characters devolve rapidly into war-painted, violent tribesmen. <em>Robinson Crusoe </em>embodied Age of Reason optimism; <em>Lord of the Flies </em>is a post-Nazi novel in which there is no culture, government is nothing more than incipient dictatorship, and religion deteriorates into cruel scapegoating.&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>Why was it imagined that <em>Lord of the Flies </em>had something of value to say about about human nature? It&#39;s a sure thing that if Golding had written a novel in which an isolated group of people behave like reborn Crusoes and work cooperatively to tame the forest and create a communal utopia, he would have been derided as a simpleton. No room in the Cold War inn or on the best-seller lists or in high school curricula for optimism!&#0160;</p>
<p>Golding arranges it so that the descent into barbarism appears to be not circumstantial but inevitable. He banishes from his island women and therefore any need for reciprocity in social institutions. (Violence without heterosexual sex--just what&#39;s needed in the high school classroom!) Moreover, the boys who land on the island are not a representative set of human beings: they are English public school children who&#39;ve already internalized poisonous notions of hierarchy, hazing, power and class. When, at the outset, they choose a chief, they&#39;re really selecting a head boy for whom lesser creatures will &quot;fag.&quot; Of the island&#39;s inhabitants, the only one with more brain than earwax is the physically repulsive Piggy, while the only boy whose instincts are democratic is slow, tongue-tied, and indecisive. Meanwhile, Jack, to whom Golding grants leadership abilities, is a slick soulless demagogue. The author may appear to be impartial, but in fact he&#39;s stacked the deck so that the emergence of a proto-fascism appears &quot;natural.&quot; Golding, both a student and a teacher in English public schools, seems to think that adolescents of his own circle somehow represent common humanity. His analysis of culture is therefore as shallow as a parking-lot puddle. And because it&#39;s so shallow, the novel is a treasure-trove for the kind of teaching where the identification of &quot;symbols&quot; substitutes for genuine thought, or emotion, or aesthetic revelation. It&#39;s a convenient opportunity -- a casebook -- for the kind of bad reading that has damaged generations of students.&#0160;</p>
<p>Golding&#39;s island abounds not in intelligence but in absurdities. Is it credible that three or four pre-adolescent boys armed only with sharpened sticks could a) confront a wild boar and b) actually bring down a mature sow, and that the sow would lie still, or allow herself to be held to the ground while one of the boys repeatedly stabs and eventually kills the animal with a penknife, and c) that the same boys, using no other tools than the single penknife, could quickly skin, butcher and behead the sow, and then d) cut and drive into the ground a post stout enough on which to mount that head?&#0160; Or e) that a few boys could dislodge and push a rock that is &quot;as big as a tank.&quot; Or that f) there could exist an uninhabited Pacific atoll so small that a group of boys could systematically search every inch of it like beaters on a hunt, but yet so large that, without experiencing much in the way of rain, it could have streams and pools of fresh water and, in addition, g) an inexhaustible supply of wild pigs (indigenous? feral?).</p>
<p>If <em>Lord of the Flies</em> is an allegory, then perhaps such howlers don&#39;t matter. Yet even an allegory should not cause a reader to guffaw at inappropriate moments.&#0160;</p>

		<a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2006/01/edward_dmytryks.html">Edward Dmytryk's The Caine Mutiny (1954)</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">In my experience, film memories are generally sharper than book memories. Film images crowd out the words. An exception is&#0160;<em>The Caine Mutiny</em>. I remembered the novel very well, and I was astonished that the film version, which I saw last night and must have seen in 1954 or thereabouts, had almost completely evaporated from my increasingly porous mind. I thought that I remembered something in black-and-white, but this film is in very bright colors. &#0160;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&#0160;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">Perhaps my memory faded because the movie can&#39;t hold a candle to the novel.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&#0160;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">Some of my many reservations:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>a) the actors are just too darn old.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>The novel is about young men, dislocated in early maturity, coming to terms with harsh new experiences. But the sailors who are supposed to be in their early twenties were played by Van Johnson (38), Fred MacMurray (46), and Jose Ferrer (45). Captain Queeg, who should be about thirty years old, was Humphrey Bogart, who was 55 and looked it, and who had, in fact, been wounded in World War I. The casting completely compromises the story and skews naive into conspiratorial. Robert Francis, who played Willis Seward Keith, was in fact twenty-four;&#0160; because he&#39;s so much younger than his shipmates, he looks more like their mascot than their contemporary. B) the romance between Keith and May Wynn (Marie Minotti in the novel), which is marginal or decorative rather than intrinsic in the novel, occupies far too much time in the film, and considerably dilutes the tension. C) the ship model that’s used in the typhoon scene was ludicrously inadequate. D)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> the </span>ethnic tensions that are a source of complexity in the novel are elided: May Wynn is no longer an Italian Catholic, so it’s impossible to understand exactly why Keith vacillates about marrying her; Barney Greenwald (the defense lawyer) is no longer Jewish. Simpler, in this case, is not better.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&#0160;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">It seems that the U. S. Navy wouldn’t cooperate with the project until the writers made certain changes in the script.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>It would be fascinating to learn how much of the film was censored, and for what reasons. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span></p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">In 1951, Herman Wouk won a Pulitzer prize for <em>The Caine Mutiny</em>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>The novel itself was a giant best-seller and along with it came the movie with Humphrey Bogart and also a Broadway play.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>It was a big 1950s literary event.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&#0160;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">It&#39;s almost exactly fifty years since I last read the book, and it&#39;s obvious why it was such </span>a triumph.&#0160;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"><em>The Caine Mutiny</em></span> is a first-rate popular novel: it’s long but fast-paced, clearly written, literate, suspenseful, timely, and patriotic. The characters are carefully differentiated (although they veer toward stereotypes).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>It’s memorable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>Parts of it were as vivid as if I had read them five months rather than five decades ago.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>I imagine that anyone who read the book, no matter how long ago, will remember “the strawberry incident,” “old yellowstain” and especially Captain Queeg and the two little steel balls that he rolls in his hand when he is under stress. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&#0160;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><em>The Caine Mutiny</em> is not a novel that requires sophisticated exegesis. Wouk is heavy-handed;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;h</span>e has a few points to inculcate, and he doesn’t allow his readers much wiggle room.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>Perhaps the lack of ambiguity accounts for the novel&#39;s popularity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>While the <em>The Caine Mutiny </em>raises important questions about war and authority, it resolves them too easily. Wouk lays on the patriotism with a trowel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>Although his navy is a nasty, inefficient place, individuals (at least American individuals) regularly rise above their institutions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>Wouk preserves the optimism about war that Tolstoy lost in the Caucasus.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&#0160;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">The main action of the novel turns on the mutiny and on the subsequent court-martial. There’s also an engaging secondary story that could have been extracted from a novel by John Marquand.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>Willis Seward Keith is an upper-class Princetonian whose mother opposes his romance with Marie Minotti.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>Marie is Italian, Roman Catholic, working-class, unschooled, and a night-club chanteuse to boot, and she may been to bed both with her (gasp!)

In the Marquand universe, he would jilt Marie, marry Constantia de Vere Buff-Orpington of the Newport Buff-Orpingtons, and live a respectable bland country-club (and sexless) existence.

When the U. S. S. Caine is kamikazeed, and Keith thinks he’s going to die, he realizes that he’s made a big mistake.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>He survives, writes a long, eloquent proposal of marriage, and in the very last pages of the novel seems to have persuaded Marie to come aboard.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;She&#39;s amenable and he&#39;s </span>euphoric, but whether or not Willie and Marie can make the marriage work is left very much in doubt.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">Is it mere coincidence that my two favorite novels during adolescence were <em>The Caine Mutiny</em> and <em>Mutiny on the Bounty?</em>&#0160; If it&#39;s not coincidental but meaningful, what ever happened to the incipient, budding mutinous spirit?</span></p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">In Thomas Hardy’s <em>The Return of the Native</em> (1878), Clym Yeobright and Eustacia Vye are brimming with impetuous youthful lust.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>They meet at a deserted spot on Egdon Heath -- a “vast tract of unenclosed wild” in southwestern England. Here’s how Hardy describes their moment of passion:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; &#0160; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&#0160;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160; </span>“’My Eustacia.’</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span>‘Clym dearest’</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160; They remained long without a single utterance, for no language could reach the level of their&#0160; condition: words were as the rusty implements of a bygone barbarous epoch, and only to be occasionally tolerated.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160; ‘I began to wonder why you did not come,’ said Yeobright when she had withdrawn a little from his embrace.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&#0160;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">Instead of the eager hands and tongues that a modern novelist would supply, Hardy substitutes a sentence about the inadequacies of language. Even so mild an allusion to physical pleasure was shocking to Victorian moralists, who regularly rebuked Hardy for ‘vulgarity.’ Hardy’s last and best novel, <em>Jude the Obscure</em>, was derided as Jude the Obscene.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&#0160;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">I myself had no idea that Hardy was a breaker of sexual taboos when I first read <em>The Return of the Native </em>in 1955.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>During the fifty intervening years, I’ve read almost every one of Hardy’s many books, some of them--<em>Jude the Obscure</em> in particular—repeatedly and with great admiration.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>Why did I not revisit <em>The Return of the Native</em> until this past week?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>The silly truth is that the novel was required reading in English class, and inasmuch as I was an alienated and unhappy high school student, I made it a point of honor to dislike assigned books.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&#0160;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">There’s also a second and more substantive reason:<em>The Return of the Native</em> was truly disorienting for provincial city kids like myself simply because so much of it turns on landscape.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>The novel is all about the way various characters respond to Egdon Heath, a furze-covered “somber stretch of rounds and hollows,” that is isolated, extensive, unchanging, brooding, dotted with primeval pagan barrows, and populated by sheep, shepherds and heath-croppers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>To understand Hardy’s Wessex landscape,I would have had to overcome two barriers: my appalling lack of imagination and my inexperience with geography.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>Perhaps some of my classmates could visualize Egdon Heath.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>Many of them came from families that owned automobiles, and had consequently<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>voyaged beyond city limits.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>They had looked upon an expanse of land larger than a baseball field and upon feathered bipeds more exotic than the flocks of pigeons that guanoed the steps of the Newkirk Avenue subway station.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&#0160;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">Had I been less put off by unfamiliar scenery and less hostile to assigned texts, I might have recognized that sparse Egdon and my crowded concrete neighborhood had much in common. Both places were backwaters untouched by modernity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>Neither offered much in the way of education -– either individuals who possessed any, or schools that were genuinely dedicated to providing it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>My territory, like Egdon Heath, was a place which anyone who happened to prosper, even a little, speedily abandoned -- to the port city of Budmouth in Hardy’s world, and to “the island,” that is, the new prosperous suburbs of Queens and Nassau, in mine.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&#0160;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">In the 1950s, I myself had only one big idea -- that there must be a world elsewhere. Why then did I not sympathize with Eustacia Vye, whose sole and only desire is to get herself away from Egdon?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span>She is as out of her element treading aimlessly on the heath as I felt myself to be when I bicycled an endless series of claustrophobic streets.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>More to the point, why didn’t I identify with the reddleman Diggory Venn? Diggory lives alone in his spring-van and wanders the heath selling reddle (a red dye used for marking sheep).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>If I had been capable of reading imaginatively, I would have taken Diggory to heart.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>He is Romanticism’s archetypical outsider and a character whom I should or could have recognized as a fellow sufferer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>I too was solitary, introspective, and on a quest for knowledge, but these traits were not understood –- as I understand them now -- as healthy questioning but instead were stigmatized as psychological disability (“Why are you moping? Why is your nose always in a book?”)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>An understanding of Diggory Venn might have lent dignity and historical context to my private woes.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&#0160;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">Even more to the point: there I was, awash with the imperious hormones of adolescence, and yet unable to notice that, although reticent about gropings and thrustings, <em>The Return of the Native</em> attaches enormous importance to sex. While I was mesmerized by the superficiality of <em>Blackboard Jungle </em>and suchlike novels, I somehow failed to observe that Thomas Hardy was very very serious about love and lust, loyalty and betrayal, passion and jealousy — and that <em>The Return of the Native </em>challenges its readers to acknowledge that sexuality was as dangerous as it was redemptive.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>Was there a more important lesson for me to have learned? Did my sixteen-year-old self catch the least glimmer of it? Not the slightest.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>In <em>Blackboard Jungle,</em> neither the author Evan Hunter, nor his lead character Richard Dadier, who recently started to work at North Manual Trades High School, can keep their eyes off teacher Lois Hammond&#39;s &quot;full and rounded breasts.&quot; She&#39;s so &quot;busty&quot; and &quot;big-breasted&quot; that every time she so much as shrugs her shoulders, both Hunter and Dadier continually focus on the way that &quot;her breasts move.&quot; These remarkable bazooms are at some times concealed by a blouse that is &quot;thin nylon&quot; and at other times by one that is &quot;peekaboo.&quot; There are occasions when the Hammond breasts are enhanced by &quot;the delicate lace of her slip and the slender straps of her brassiere,&quot; and other times when the &quot;firm abundant cones of her breasts [are] caught tight in a white cotton bra.&quot; But whether enhanced or restrained, not only the &quot;thrust of her brassiere,&quot; but even more so &quot;the obvious thrust of her breasts&quot; are under constant scrutiny. After an inadvertent sighting, Hunter and Dadier are able to report that one of these breasts (it isn&#39;t specified whether the left or the right) is &quot;a youthful breast, firm, with a nipple large and erect.&quot;</p>
<p>It is dispiriting to recall that for high school students in the 1950s, this romance-novel twaddle seemed like a breakthrough in the direction of realism. But consider the context: in the novels that were read in Erasmus Hall English classes, none of the heroines (Eppie, Rebecca and Rowena, Lucy Manette) had any breasts at all, or at least, none that came to the attention of author or reader.&#0160;<em>The Blackboard Jungle </em>seemed to be frank, honest, down-to-earth, and it was recognized in the schoolyard-and-drugstore culture of mid-century adolescents as a &quot;hot&quot; book, and along with <em>The Amboy Dukes</em> and <em>Forever Amber </em>was passed in cheap paperback editions from hand to sweaty hand. It reflected a reality (bad language, sexual urgency, near-anarchic disorder, gratuitous cruelty) far more present and immediate than did our &#39;official&#39; reading.&#0160;</p>
<p>Returning after all these years to <em>Blackboard Jungle</em> has been a sad revelation. As a work of literature, it&#39;s piss-poor. The tough-guy prose aims to be hard-boiled, but it&#39;s undercooked (&quot;the boys in the class considered English a senseless waste of time, a headless chicken, a blob without a goal&quot;). The story is padded with interminable didactic digressions, and many of its episodes are either woefully overwrought or just simply meretricious -- Dadier&#39;s infant son, for example, is stillborn for no earthly reason except to squeeze a sob from the reader.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, and in spite of its amateurism, it&#39;s still a disturbing book.&#0160;<em>Blackboard Jungle</em> covers the first four months of Dadier&#39;s teaching career: in the course of one melodramatic semester, he prevents the rape of a fellow teacher, he&#39;s attacked and beaten on the street by a gang of students, and he&#39;s slashed in a knife-fight in his own classroom. So much violence in so short a period of time seems to be beyond belief. Does it accord with the facts?&#0160; Wasn&#39;t it the case that the local bully-boy, Herbie W.,, attacked Mr. Proshan, our seventh-grade social studies teacher and wrestled him to the classroom floor?&#0160; Didn&#39;t the gang leader Runzi Marfeta terrorize the schoolyard? Weren&#39;t there fights outside the Bedford Arch almost daily? Wasn&#39;t it the case that every tenth student wore a &quot;garrison belt,&quot; the three-inch buckle of which was ground razor-sharp, just in case? It was the heyday of &quot;juvenile delinquents&quot; and zip-guns and gravity knives and gang fights, and in many of my classrooms the out-of-control ambience was established and sustained by the psychopaths and sociopaths among whom I was educated. And isn&#39;t it also the case that <em>Blackboard Jungle </em>doesn&#39;t even tell the whole truth but is a sanitized version of real life? There&#39;s not a single mention of drunkenness, of heroin and other widely-used drugs, of accidental pregnancy and illegal abortion, or even of what used to be called, euphemistically, &quot;broken homes.&quot;</p>
<p>Almost entirely anti-nostalgic, the novel did nevertheless provoke an occasional smile: Delaney cards, &quot;official class,&quot; &quot;daddy-o,&quot; street corner harmonizers. There&#39;s also one very brilliant comic touch in <em>Blackboard Jungle.</em>&#0160;At North Manual Trades High School, there&#39;s a men&#39;s teacher&#39;s lounge in which Richard Dadier seems to pass a lot of his time, smoking. In the lounge is a couch, and on the couch is a man -- a teacher -- lying prone, his face concealed. He&#39;s asleep at the beginning of the novel, and he&#39;s still asleep at the end; Dadier never sees his face and never learns who he is or what subject he&#39;s supposed to be teaching. It&#39;s an exquisite metaphor for an exhausted and overwhelmed educational establishment.&#0160;<em>Blackboard Jungle </em>is a bad book, but Evan Hunter earned his place in the story by bringing the scandal of high schools like North Manual Trades to public attention.&#0160;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p><em>Women and Thomas Harrow</em> was John P. Marquand&#39;s last novel. It was published in 1958; Marquand (born in 1893) died in 1960. It&#39;s another good but not great book. Despite the witty surface, it&#39;s very sad. Thomas Harrow (clearly a surrogate for Marquand himself) is a successful but not brilliant playwright; in the course of the novel, he comes to realize that he&#39;s squandered his talent and made a mess of his personal relationships. The last line of <em>Women and Thomas Harrow</em>: &quot;In the end, no matter how many were in the car, you always drove alone.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>I&#39;m still trying to figure out why my father thought so well of the novels of John Phillips Marquand. For one thing, Pop was clearly in tune with the author&#39;s relentless anti-modernism. In form, Marquand&#39;s novels are Victorian. There&#39;s no experimentation, nothing unusual or original in content or presentation. Moreover, in all the novels, not a landscape but has been destroyed, not a custom but has deteriorated, not a value but has been compromised. The modern world in Marquand&#39;s view has become too subject to analysis, too Freudified. Sometimes Harrow employs, with some resistance, the exact words that I heard without irony from my father&#39;s mouth: &quot;No one could escape from convention for long....&#0160; It was advisable to accept the mores of one&#39;s time, no matter if they shifted. It was better to be in tune... with the beat of marching music.&quot;&#0160; No dancing to a different drummer either in Marquand or in my father.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>When I read Neal Ascherson&#39;s <em>Black Sea,</em> I had to admit that I knew nothing at all about a huge and contested part of the world. I followed up on Ascherson&#39;s bibliography and read a series of ethnographic studies of ancient Black Sea peoples -- Scythians, Sarmatians, etc. -- and from there moved eastward to the Caucasus and leaned about the Abkhazians, the Ossetians, the Chechens, etc. Yesterday I finished Nicholas Griffin&#39;s <em>Caucasus</em> (2001), which is half travel book and half a biography of Imam Shamil. Shamil, of whom I also knew zero until a few days ago, is the legendary Avar guerrilla leader who led the opposition to the Russian conquest of the mountains in the mid-nineteenth century. He&#39;s the national hero of the Chechens, and is a compound of Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse, and Geronimo-- with a little Islamic fervor added in. The Russians conquered the Caucasus with a combination of overwhelming force, superior technology, and ruthlessness: they systematically obliterated villages, murdered as many civilians as possible, and when all else failed, cut to the ground the primeval beech forests -- defoliation not then an option -- in which Shamil and his Murids found refuge.</p>
<p>Reading about Shamil led me to <em>Hadji Murad --</em> Tolstoy&#39;s extraordinary last novel and one in which Shamil is a minor character. In 150 pages or so, <em>Hadji Murad </em>says as much about the brutality, the stupidity, and the vanity of war as <em>War and Peace </em>says in ten times as many pages. Tolstoy, who had soldiered in the Caucasus, wrote in his diary (according to Griffin) that the war was &quot;so ugly and unjust that anybody who wages it has to stifle the voice of his conscience.&quot; Hadji Murad is a charismatic leader who&#39;s involved in a foolish feud with Shamil; he surrenders to the Russians, tries to escape, and is killed and beheaded. That&#39;s the plot, but the genius is in the telling. After recounting an atrocity in which the Russians, in sport, destroy a small settlement, ruin the crops, and bayonet a small child, Tolstoy describes the feelings of the remaining villagers as they set about the hopeless task of rebuilding: &quot;It was not hatred, because they did not regard those Russian dogs as human beings, but it was such repulsion, disgust and perplexity at the senseless cruelty of these creatures, that the desire to exterminate them&#0160; -- like the desire to exterminate rats, poisonous spiders, or wolves&#0160; -- was as natural an instinct as that of self-preservation.&quot; Tolstoy is disgusted by the Russian actions, but he&#39;s equally repelled by the brutal mountaineers, and he goes out of his way to draw parallels between the utterly cruel Imam Shamil and the fat, ignorant, vainglorious Nicholas, the Czar of All the Russians.</p>
<p>In the nineteenth century, the Russians cut down the forests; in 1999, they conquered Grozhny (the capitol of Chechnya) by dynamiting every significant building in the entire city.&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160;</p>
