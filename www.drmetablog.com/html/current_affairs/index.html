		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>It&#39;s humiliating for me to confess that until a few weeks ago I had never heard of the Piacenza Liver, which is a life-size bronze Etruscan replica of the liver of a sheep, and unquestionably European civilization&#39;s most heralded metal liver. How could I not have known?&#0160;</p>
<p>The PL was unearthed in 1877 and dates from the first century BCE. Here&#39;s a picture of this most important artifact:</p>
<p><a class="mw-file-description" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Piacenza_Bronzeleber.jpg"><img class="mw-file-element" data-file-height="1266" data-file-width="1914" decoding="async" height="172" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Piacenza_Bronzeleber.jpg/260px-Piacenza_Bronzeleber.jpg" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Piacenza_Bronzeleber.jpg/390px-Piacenza_Bronzeleber.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Piacenza_Bronzeleber.jpg/520px-Piacenza_Bronzeleber.jpg 2x" width="260" /></a></p>
<div class="isv-r PNCib ViTmJb BUooTd" data-cb="3" data-cl="0" data-cr="0" data-ct="6" data-deckid="RKnxVg0oRgj_3M" data-hveid="16" data-id="5gGvlglMMzBy6M" data-oh="375" data-ow="640" data-rel="1" data-ri="10" data-sc="1" data-tbnid="5gGvlglMMzBy6M" data-tw="293" data-ved="0CBAQxiAoCmoXChMI8KP9i-O3hAMVAAAAAB0AAAAAEBo" role="listitem">
<div class="fR600b islir">Because my knowledge of sheep livers is so appallingly slim, and because most readers of this blague are not doubt similarly ignorant, let me quote an expert description of the object: &quot;In the Etruscan model, the liver is reversed, with the convex part of the gallbladder pointing down. On the right side of the gallbladder, we find a pyramid-shaped structure that was referred to as the processus pyramidalis corresponding with the caudate lobe in humans. On the other side of the gallbladder, we see a protrusion that was called the processus papillaris corresponding with the paracaval part of the caudate lobe.&quot; In other words, it&#39;s one heck of an accurate liver model. Yet It is not its fidelity to the shape and form of a sheep liver that makes the PL so crucial: it&#39;s the markings and inscriptions on its face. As you can see, the surface of the PL is divided into segments, on each one of which is inscribed a word or two in the long-extinct Etruscan language.</div>
<div class="fR600b islir">&#0160;</div>
<div class="fR600b islir">This find is obviously not one of your run-of-the-mill uninformative liver sculptures. It&#39;s brimming with meaning. Let us recall that Etruria was an advanced and prosperous civilization that dominated northwestern Italy from about 800 BCE to 500 BCE until it&#0160; gradually fell under the sway of the ambitious militaristic Romans. In the ancient world, Etruscans were famous not only for their arts and commerce, but also for their skill in consulting the gods through the process of haruscopy -- divination by examining the liver of a sacrificed sheep. The Etruscans passed along this accomplishment to the Romans who rarely made important decisions without the advice of the gods, which they acquired through the medium of a professionally certified haruspex. Inasmuch as the Romans, employing haruscopy, ruled the world for a thousand years, the power of the sheep liver-and-haruspex team cannot but be acknowledged.&#0160;</div>
<div class="fR600b islir">&#0160;</div>
<div class="fR600b islir">I have no idea, nor do scholars of the Etruscans, know when or why haruscopy originated. Etruscan civilization is replete with mysteries and moreover the Etruscan language is not fully understood. It&#39;s an &quot;isolate&quot; -- like Basque --an island in a sea of Indo-European languages to which it bears no relation. Etruscans arrived in Italy a long time ago -- long before they possessed a written language. When? From where did they come? How did it happen that they became proficient in haruscopy?&#0160; No one knows and there are not even any decent theories -- it&#39;s all lost in the dark backward and abysm of time.</div>

</div>
</div>
<div>Readers of a skeptical bent will wonder, what special powers are incorporated in the liver of a sheep?&#0160; Why not the pancreas or the spleen? Some might even ask, why a sheep?&#0160; Why not, for example, goats?&#0160; Goats are far more intelligent than sheep, and it stands to reason that a goat liver would house more prophetic oomph than the liver of a mouflon or an urial. For that matter, why is haruscopy to be preferred to less messy systems of augury such as ornithomancy, which utilizes the flights of birds, or ceraunoscopy, which works by the study of lightning and thunder. No bloody sacrificing required in either case. Livers, in my opinion, though I&#39;ve never come face to face with a sheep&#39;s, are kind of gross and not for the squeamish. But as William Cowper told us many years ago, &quot;God moves in a mysterious way,/ His wonders to perform&quot; and although Cowper was not specifically referring to the multiple gods of the polytheistic Etruscans, his words certainly apply. So divination by liver it was and has remained so. Whether or not the Romans would have conquered the world without the Etruscan facility with sheep livers is impossible to say.&#0160; &#0160;</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>A closer look at the PL reveals that each demarcated section is inscribed with a series of Etruscan letters. Inasmuch as Etruscan is an extinct language that has been only deciphered in part, the words are not fully understood.&#0160; Although Etruscan is almost impossible to translate, it&#39;s easy to transliterate, because the script is written in a version of the alphabet devised by some Phoenician genius and then passed along to the Euboean Greeks and then on to the Etruscans and to the Romans and eventually to us.&#0160;</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>Here&#39;s the most recent transcription of a part of the outside ring of words on the PL.</div>
</div>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="LAA3yd">&#0160;</div>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="LAA3yd">1.&#0160; &#0160;tin cil en</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" class="LAA3yd">12. tluscv</div>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="LAA3yd">&#0160;</div>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="LAA3yd">Kind of impenetrable, is it not?&#0160; Almost entirely opaque with only a few good guesses. But, alas, that&#39;s the sorry state of Piacenza Liver knowledge. Scholars are agreed that the markings are the names of the various gods -- each associated with a section of the live. It follows that the PL is a teaching instrument, a show-and-tell. It&#39;s not difficult to picture a veteran learned haruspex instructing his or her aspiring students to study the PL closely. Any peculiarity or disorder or irregularity in the liver would reveal much to a gifted haruspex.&#0160;&#0160;</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>It&#39;s shocking to me that the tourist-oriented website of the city of Piacenza advertises its Duomo, a 12th century Romanesque church, its Passerini-Landi Library, and the Palazzo Farnese, a 16th century great house, but offers not the slightest mention of its foremost liver (which is housed in the palazzo). An inexplicable omission.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>&quot;Hereditary meritocracy&quot; is a phrase, and a concept, that hits home. Reluctantly, I must concede that these words characterize my small corner of the American experience (at least in part).</p>
<p>&quot;Hereditary meritocracy&quot; is a pointed irony. It&#39;s obviously an oxymoron -- a contradiction -- in which an adjective that goes one way is sutured to a noun that goes another -- juxtaposing, as it does, unearned heredity to earned merit.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Heredity, as it defines an individual, comprehends the talents or defects that happen to lie in one&#39;s genes. In the wider social sense, it refers to what is often called &quot;ascribed status&quot; or &quot;ascribed value.&quot; You can be a marquis or a mogul because your father or grandfather was &quot;well born&quot; or because he made a ton of money -- not because you yourself ever lifted a finger. But to be a member of the meritocracy, you must have achieved something intellectual, financial, political, artistic, or whatever. Your own abilities, your own work.&#0160;</p>
<p>But heredity and merit are not as distinct in practice as they are in theory, as the phrase &quot;hereditary meritocracy&quot; indicates. The hereditarily rich and well-born have advantages that allow their offspring to &quot;achieve&quot; and prosper. Children of the advantaged develop, it&#39;s been shown, larger cerebellums. They attend better schools, enjoy a richer home life, have better medical care and are coached in music and art and athletics. Of course they then perform better on standardized tests, which is then interpreted as as a sign of merit. It&#39;s a better forecast of &quot;success&quot; to be rich with mediocre genes than poor with excellent genes and good work habits -- though it&#39;s hard for some of the privileged to admit this obvious fact.</p>
<p>And now to the point. I myself and my family have during this last century made our way into the &quot;hereditary meritocracy.&quot; Although we&#39;re not particularly rich in cash, we&#39;re rich in family resources and intergenerational support. I believe that every one of my own parents&#39; descendants, and there are now 24 of them, has or will graduate from college. We are almost uniformly &quot;professionals&quot;:&#0160; accountants, lawyers, teachers, librarians, journalists. Not a one of us rolls cigars for a living, as did my grandfather. We&#39;re prosperous.</p>
<p>Should we be embarrassed or ashamed that we can provide a privileged life for our descendants. I don&#39;t think so, because we didn&#39;t step on anyone&#39;s heads to get here. We need not apologize for our successes in this new world.&#0160;</p>
<p>But we do have obligations. The first is to be aware of our good fortune and to realize that our successes owe as much to opportunity as to effort. (After all, with the same genes, we were stagnant and miserable for a thousand years in the &quot;old country&quot;). And then we must also make sure that we do not put barriers in the way of others -- or more positively, we must try to help others find themselves in the same comfortable niche that we have reached. It&#39;s an imperfect system, this &quot;hereditary meritocracy,&quot; but it is far from the worst the world has known.</p>

                                <p>We were sitting on a metal bench in front of the Boulder Public Library, resting up for the half mile walk home. It was unusually peaceful; families in and out, borrowing or returning their bags of books. Once in a while, there&#39;s a discordant note: a homeless, drugged, or deranged person, muttering or sometimes shouting incoherently, dragging a dirty blanket or wheeling a stolen supermarket cart or bicycle. But yesterday there was an event. A large young man, 40ish, had lost his child. He asked us, &quot;have you seen a boy with a red hat.&quot; No we hadn&#39;t, but we said we&#39;d pay attention. The poor distressed guy ran from place to place in the park and in the adjacent parking lot, shouting &quot;Zack.&quot;&#0160; As he became increasingly agitated, so did I. Is there a worse feeling of powerlessness than when you&#39;ve lost contact with your child. As he became more and more frantic, I remembered Florence Dombey and Mrs. Brown, and Etan Patz, and Leiby Kletzky. After a few moments, I said to LERM, &quot;if the boy with the red hat had come out of the library alone, we would have seen and noticed him. He&#39;s got to be inside the library and I&#39;m going to find him.&quot; I walked into the building and almost immediately heard some high-pitched crying from somewhere in the stacks. In a few seconds I located the boy (four-years-old, I would guess). I said to him, &quot;I know exactly where your father is and I&#39;m going to take you to him.&quot; I took the boy&#39;s hand and walked out of the library -- almost immediately to encounter the crazed parent coming our way. I released the child and in a second he was in his father&#39;s arms. Father and son consoled each other. I sat back down on our bench, knowing that I had done a good deed. It was a very satisfying, human feeling. After a brief while, we walked home uneventfully.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Texas Representative Trey Moody (R-Flower Mound) introduced a bill in the lower house that would require all public school teachers, administrators, and other personnel to bear weapons during the entire school day. Weapons must be &quot;carried publicly, in a visible manner&quot; such as in a hip holster.&#0160;</p>
<p><img alt="Member Photo" class="member-photo" src="https://house.texas.gov/members/photos/4125.jpg?v=88.23" /></p>
<p>Moody stated that &quot;not only would firearms discourage shooters, they would also improve discipline and learning. An armed teacher is a respected teacher,&quot; he declared. According to the bill, teachers who refuse to carry sidearms would be immediately fired &quot;for cause.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>The Idaho legislature passed a bill that would reinstate the firing squad as a method of execution. The firing squad would consist of six to eight citizen volunteers. Anticipating great demand for the position, the law states that members of the squad be chosen by lottery from Idaho citizens who can demonstrate that they are proficient with &#39;long guns, or AK-47s&quot; and are certified members of the National Rifle Association.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Tennessee senator Shelby Shatzline (R-Sequatchie) has sponsored a bill that would automatically expel professed atheists from the state legislature.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p><img alt="Member Photo" class="member-photo" src="https://house.texas.gov/members/photos/3220.jpg?v=88.23" /></p>
<p>Atheists, he contended, &quot;lack the moral bearings to serve the public. They simply cannot tell right from wrong, inasmuch as they are not guided by a loving and&#0160; omniscient deity.&quot; The bill is expected to pass resoundingly in the Republican-supermajority Tennessee legislature, though its impact may be moot, inasmuch as there are no known atheists in either house. Senator Shatzline is also drafting a bill that would expel atheists from Tennessee.&#0160;</p>
<p>South Carolina representative Britt Brownfields, has introduced a bill that would penalize unmarried people who live together. It would impose a penalty of &quot;100% of state tax liability&quot; upon such couples. Brownfields stated that living &quot;in sin&quot; weakens the moral fibre of the nation and flouts Biblical law.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p><img height="199" loading="lazy" src="https://legislature.idaho.gov/wp-content/uploads/sessioninfo/2023/directory/Raybould5381.jpg" width="142" /></p>
<p>According to the draft of the bill in addition to the tax penalty, violators would immediately be tarred and feathered and ridden out of town on a rail. Perdue Chicken will volunteer the feathers and Koch Industries the tar.&#0160; A donor or vendor of rails has not yet been selected.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Representative Clay Hawkins of Eagle Hollow has filed a bill in the Idaho legislature that would regulate the travel of women of child-bearing age.</p>
<p><img height="139" loading="lazy" src="https://legislature.idaho.gov/wp-content/uploads/sessioninfo/2023/directory/Herndon7775.jpg" width="99" /></p>
<p>Hawkins&#39; bill would prohibit fertile women (14 to 54) from leaving Idaho unless they could present evidence that they were not pregnant. &quot;How else,&quot; said Hawkins, &quot;can we prevent them from traveling to a child-murdering state like Colorado and killing an unborn child?&quot; The bill would require women to present a certification from a doctor or the results of a recent pregnancy test.</p>
<p>The bill is expected to sail through the Republican dominated legislature. Governor Brad Little has pledged to sign the bill &quot;as soon as it hits my desk.&quot; He called it &quot;common-sense legislation.&quot;</p>
<p>Asked how the state plans to enforce the legislation, Representative Hawkins replied, &quot;roadblocks.&quot;</p>
<p>[April 15:&#0160; I wrote this parody of Republican foolishness a week ago, fully confident that my readers would recognize it as a joke -- an April fool exercise. But to my surprise, almost everyone who commented or contacted me took it for real. Readers readily accepted the idea that an Idaho legislature and an Idaho governor would take seriously a proposal to examine the menstrual cycles of childbearing-age women.&#0160; It goes to show not that my readers are unusually naive, but that the present-day Republican party is so fanatic, dictatorial, and intrusive that it might just offer such legislation. Which tells us something about the sorry state of our beloved country.&#0160;</p>
<p>In truth, I do not believe it was my imitation of journalist style that deceived my readers. I think it was the accompanying photograph. The doofus-schmendrick in the photo is in fact a member of the Idaho House of Representatives (though he&#39;s not Clay Hawkins, whom I invented). But the so-called Clay Hawkins has the face of a person who would conceive of such a fascistic bill -- the foolish, fatuous eyes, the pseudo-patriarchal beard no doubt camouflaging a receding or slack chin, the general air of know-nothing simple-minded idiocy. It&#39;s the picture, not the prose, that sold the satire.]</p>

<div class="rllt__details">
<div aria-level="3" class="dbg0pd" role="heading"><span class="OSrXXb">Although I regularly walk our many nearby scenic mountain trails, I&#39;m not a genuinely &quot;outdoorsy&quot; person. I don&#39;t ski, or snowboard, and I certainly don&#39;t rock climb. No climbing at all if I can help it. At this time, I have no plans to &quot;summit&quot; anything, not even my step stool.&#0160; My camping days are long over; no more sleeping outside even in a fancy modern tent. So it&#39;s not I who is the target of the two dozen outdoor gear shops that are within neighborly distance of my well-heated home and welcoming mattress.</span></div>
<div aria-level="3" class="dbg0pd" role="heading">&#0160;</div>
<div aria-level="3" class="dbg0pd" role="heading"><span class="OSrXXb"> These &quot;gear&quot; stores are ubiquitous; a guy can hardly take a few steps on the semi-famous Boulder Mall without stumbling into one or another. </span><span class="OSrXXb"><span class="OSrXXb">Perhaps you think that I exaggerate? Let&#39;s look at the facts. Right within a block or two there&#39;s Red Fox Outdoor Equipment (&quot;crafted for adventure&quot;); HIMALI (&quot;</span></span>apparel that stands up to the highest and harshest conditions on Planet Earth&quot;; Teton; Black Diamond (&quot;designed for epic outdoor adventures&quot;); Stio (&quot;built for Alpine pursuits&quot;), Burton (snowboards, boots, outerwear); Mount Inspiration Apparel; The North Face; Eddie Bauer; Arc&#39;teryx (&quot;weatherproof footwear and apparel&quot;); Fjäälraven (a Swedish outpost); Amundsen (Norwegian); Moosejaw (&quot;funky fun-loving climbing gear&quot;); Epic Mountain Gear; MontBell; Backcountry (&quot;gear up for fresh powder&quot;); REI; Neptune Mountaineering; Helly Hansen; Patagonia; Nomad (&quot;a mountain lifestyle retailer&quot;); Cotopaxi (&quot;sustainably-designed outdoor gear&quot;); Volcom &quot;skating &amp; snowboarding-inspired apparel&quot;); Norrøna Concept Store (outdoor apparel plus espresso bar); Christy Sports; Rapha &quot;world&#39;s finest cycling clothing&quot;). In addition, there are also several &quot;previously owned&quot; -- formerly called &quot;second hand&quot; -- outdoor gear shops.</div>
<div aria-level="3" class="dbg0pd" role="heading">&#0160;</div>
<div aria-level="3" class="dbg0pd" role="heading">Who buys all this stuff? Boulder doesn&#39;t contain enough bravers-of-the-elements to support so many enterprises. Perhaps it&#39;s the tourists. It&#39;s also been theorized that most of the gear business is internet-driven and that the various manufacturers like to boast a brick-and-mortar presence in prestigious Boulder. I wouldn&#39;t know; I&#39;m perpetually gearless.</div>
<div aria-level="3" class="dbg0pd" role="heading">&#0160;</div>
<div aria-level="3" class="dbg0pd" role="heading">Should a slug-a-bed like myself feel indolent and guilty in the presence of such passionate mountaineering energy?&#0160; Maybe a little, but mostly I&#39;m amused by what seems to me conspicuous equipment consumption. Life is not about &quot;gear.&quot;&#0160;</div>
<div aria-level="3" class="dbg0pd" role="heading">&#0160;</div>
<div aria-level="3" class="dbg0pd" role="heading">Question: does our Mall have more outdoor gear shops than it does marijuana outlets?&#0160; Or coffee shops? A census is warranted.&#0160;</div>
<div aria-level="3" class="dbg0pd" role="heading">&#0160;</div>
<div aria-level="3" class="dbg0pd" role="heading">What would the Boulder Mall look like if I myself were the target audience. Well, it just so happens that many years ago I designed a <a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2017/03/mallofme.html ">mall of me.</a> You can look it up.</div>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Am I just plain nuts to think that I live in a safe and secure world? All the evidence says &quot;perpetual vigilance&quot; and &quot;it can happen here&quot; and &quot;keep a close watch?&#0160;</p>
<p>Let&#39;s look at the situation.&#0160;</p>
<p>Our state has a violent history. In the far past: at Sand Creek in 1864, several hundred Cheyenne and Arapahos were brutally murdered. In 1914, a century or so ago, the Pinkertons, employed by the Rockefellers, killed no-one-knows-how-many miners when they shot randomly into the Ludlow tent colony.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>More recently, killing has become the work not of army or paid professionals but of heavily armed civilians. In 1999 there was the horrible Columbine High School massacre in which twelve were killed and twenty-one wounded. Just thirteen years later came the mass killing inside a Century 16 theater in Aurora, just a few miles south of where I live, in which twelve people were killed and another seventy injured. Then in 2015 there was a shooting at a Planned Parenthood clinic in which three were assassinated and nine others wounded. In March of 2021, just two years ago, in the Table Mesa King Soopers, a &quot;gunman&quot; killed ten -- customers, employees, a police officer. And last year, we had the nightclub shooting in Colorado Springs where five were murdered and twenty-five others wounded.</p>
<p>I didn&#39;t happen to be in any of these places, but I might have been. Although I wasn&#39;t at the Columbine school, I was at that very moment in a different classroom in Denver; I didn&#39;t go to the movies to see the <em>Dark Knight</em>, but I do go to theaters. It wasn&#39;t &quot;my&quot; King Soopers that was terrorized, but nevertheless I&#39;ve bought stuff at that very store many times when I&#39;ve happened to be in south Boulder; I wasn&#39;t at the Colorado Springs bar but I&#39;ve certainly patronized bars. In any one of these cases, It could just as easily have been me that was shot dead or maimed. I&#39;ve been one lucky fellow, but people much like me have not been so fortunate.</p>
<p>Two days ago, a vicious prank phone call set off a scramble and shelter-in-place warnings at two-block away Boulder High School. BHS is where AGP and our three children spent many a year. This scare turned out to be a case of &quot;swatting&quot; -- a disgusting new practice in which a nasty sociopath calls an institution to see if he can get a reaction from a SWAT team. Deliberate malice. Such false alarms are not mass killings, but they&#39;re still hair-raising, anxiety-provoking, and potentially dangerous events.</p>
<p>It&#39;s coming close to home, isn&#39;t it. Luck of the draw, so to speak, that I&#39;m still whole.</p>
<p>When I was a teacher, I was never in real danger but, like everyone else on the faculty, I had a few deranged students. I remember once that a particularly odd young lady asked to make an appointment for a conference. Wary of her, I proposed that instead of her coming to my office that we meet in the public cafeteria. l can&#39;t remember what she wanted to talk about, but I recall vividly that at one point she asked, &quot;do you think I have a gun in my purse?&quot;&#0160; I replied &quot;I don&#39;t know whether you do or not, but I know that this meeting is now over.&quot; I stood up and walked away, half convinced that I was about to be shot in the back. But I wasn&#39;t.&#0160;</p>
<p>It&#39;s a violent world; no one has ever been truly safe. But all we can do is go blithely about our business, hoping to be spared.</p>
<p>I shouldn&#39;t complain; we&#39;re not in a war zone; it&#39;s not like Ukraine, where at any moment Russian drones and shells and missiles can drop on you from the sky.&#0160;</p>

                                <p>The premise of Riley Black&#39;s <em>The Last Days of the Dinosaurs</em> (New York, 2022) is a most splendid one. Imagine, she proposes, that it is 66 million years ago and dinosaurs are the monarchs of the earth. What was it like, in that era, to be alive in, say, the steamy forests where Wyoming now lies -- a world in which club-tailed ankylosaurs were tracked by tyrannosaurs while primitive mammals scuttled in the ferny underbrush. Rich and strange, certainly. And then, how was it all transformed on &quot;the worst day in the history of the planet&quot; when the Chicxulub asteroid plowed into the Yucatan? One fine day, the dinosaurs were triumphant; and then in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, the six-mile-wide asteroid crash lands and everything goes all kablooey -- the sure and firm-set earth shakes, the atmosphere turns furnace hot, and acid rain and smoke and fire and tsunamis snuff out 80 per cent of our planet&#39;s animal species.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a fabulous idea for a masterpiece of science writing, and consequently I&#39;m grieved to report that <em>The Last Days of the Dinosaurs</em> is a disappointing book. It is loose and melodramatic and outrageously padded -- a thirty page essay turned into a swollen three hundred page opus. It&#39;s much too pop; it&#39;s insufficiently serious and therefore leaves poor frustrated me craving data and detail rather than reiteration. Who could believe that the high drama of Chicxulub could become quite so tedious? I put the blame on Ms. Black&#39;s literary agent, who, I have no shadow of doubt, advised her to &quot;turn your idea into a book, and keep it easy -- not too technical -- you&#39;ll sell a lot more copies.&quot;</p>
<p>What a shame, because Black is well-informed and writes with intermittent flair. She loves her reptiles, and in particular displays genuine warmth, almost reverence, for every young person&#39;s favorite dinosaur, the <em>tyrannosaurus rex. </em>An infatuation that lingers from her childhood, I suspect. I myself, not similarly transfixed, might have supposed that T. Rex had been expelled from the Terrible Lizard Hall of Fame sometime in the 1990s, when it came to be gospel that the 60-foot tall monster was not a top-of-the-food-chain predator but merely a snuffling scavenger. Was it not revealed to us that the creature&#39;s meager brain was dwarfed by its olfactory bulbs, so that it could effortlessly detect decaying flesh over the unbounded western landscapes? And was it not also agreed that its puny forelegs were useless for pursuit or attack? Black will have nothing of such paleontological revisionism. Her T. Rex is a hunter, lurking in ambush to pounce and to crunch with one powerful bite the enormous protuberant osteoderms that protected the stegosaurus spine. To me, the idea that a beast as gigantic as a tyrannosaurus could conceal itself behind bush or boulder and sneakily lunge at its prey seems totally ludicrous.</p>
<p>Black, bless her kindly heart, firmly embraces the unrevised T. Rex. Her loyalty is transcendent. In a burst of psychological overkill, she describes her crush on the dinosaur as an example of anemoia. And what, readers rightly ask, is anemoia?&#0160; It&#39;s an unfamiliar word that describes a baffling concept. Upon investigation,&quot;anemoia&quot; turns out to be a recent coinage, a &quot;fire-new&quot; word (as WS, in LLL, calls such innovations). It&#39;s &quot;a nostalgia for a time one has never known,&quot; such as Black seems to feel about the years and days that preceded Chicxulub. And here I must once again reveal my want of imagination. Anemoia, however hard I labor to grasp the idea, is too subtle for my downright brain. Isn&#39;t it the case that &quot;nostalgia&quot; is by definition a cherishing of something in one&#39;s own personal history, as such a one as I might remember with warmth a concert or a wedding or that long ago glorious day in which I, batting leadoff, started the game with a triple to right field.</p>
<p>I can&#39;t quite fathom a nostalgia for something I&#39;ve not known in my own person. The emotion that Black describes I would call simple curiosity. I&#39;m as intrigued as the next guy about the past and I can certainly summon a yearning to have been present at some great historical event, but I wouldn&#39;t call it anemoia. For example, I might wish that I had been at Fenway on September 30, 1960, the day that Ted Williams blasted a home run on his very last time at bat -- but I wasn&#39;t there and it would be a falsehood to claim otherwise. [Full disclosure: I was in attendance, just behind third base, the previous day, September 29, and therefore missed the moment by a scant twenty-four hours.] Unlike Black, I&#39;m not anemoiac about the dinosaur-dominated world of the K-P boundary, but I have other anemoiac -- as I&#39;ve now redefined the word -- yearnings.</p>
<p>My most pressing and immediate wish would be to have joined the crowd at a performance at the Globe Theatre in London, perhaps of <em>Hamlet</em> in 1599 or <em>Macbeth</em> in 1606. Why? Because even though Shakespeare&#39;s works have been studied microscopically for more than 400 years, no one really knows how those plays originally looked or sounded. My suspicion is that they were far more foreign, more strange, less realistic and more primitive than scholars recognize. After all, the most brilliant play ever written, <em>King Lear,</em> was performed in daylight and the actors had to project their voices to a crowd of 2000 people, many of them shuffling about, gossiping, and cracking hazelnuts. No sets, no curtains, no lighting, and no scenery to speak of. I&#39;d guess that the cast employed a style of dramaturgy closer to its medieval inheritance of allegorical representation than we like to admit. Furthermore, I am convinced that if I were present there at the actual Globe, I would discover an endless series of unknown unknowns. Unimaginable unknowns, that would knock our anemoiac socks off. The past is another country; they do things a heck of a lot differently there.</p>
<p>But wait! My dormant anemoia, now aroused, yearns to experience in my own person other events in the past. Where else to indulge my wants? Certainly in Athens, at a performance of a play by Sophocles -- which I can guarantee to be a hundred times stranger than anything London could possibly offer.</p>
<p>But why only the arts?&#0160; Now that I think of it, I would love to take a gander at forested Manhattan Island when Henry Hudson&#39;s <em>Half Moon</em> made its first landfall. I could have talked to the Lenapes; tried to warn them about the dangers that were coming down the pike. And there&#39;s much more. Just prior to struggling through <em>The Last Days of the Dinosaurs,</em> I read Marie Favereau&#39;s <em>The Horde (</em>2021<em>), </em>a most fascinating history of the Mongol civilization that conquered and controlled the area from Hungary in the west to Korea in the east during the 13th century and the first half of the 14th. Favereau&#39;s depiction of the Mongols was novel and disorienting, essentially because I&#39;m accustomed to think about great empires as centered on a dominant imperial city -- Athens, Rome, London. I believe that I understand a little of what life might have been like in Rome; after all, I&#39;ve read some of the ancient historians and I know a bit about cities. I&#39;ve even toured Pompeii, for goodness sake! But the Mongols did not live in cities; they were not particularly literate, they were unabashedly polygamous, animist, and almost entirely nomadic. It&#39;s a challenge to imagine a &quot;city&quot; of a hundred thousand people in constant migratory motion. When Mongol men went to war, which they seemed to do often and always, they brought along the women and children, the cattle-drawn carts and wagons and the felt tents along with their horses, goats and sheep. To spend time with a wandering horde, an entirely unfamiliar form of civilization, and to try to understand their mental world, would certainly challenge and enlarge my (and your) conception of what it means to be a human being.</p>
<p>Favereau doesn&#39;t dwell on such speculations (she is more concerned with military history than social or psychological matters) but nevertheless the ways in which the migrants related to each other and to their environment had to be entirely foreign to us mostly urban, post Age of Reason moderns. What was it like to be a Mongol? Perhaps I feel this question personally because a recent examination of my DNA tells me that I&#39;m 1% Asian by genetic inheritance. I assume, naturally, that like approximately 16,000,000 other people, I&#39;m directly descended from Mongol leader Chinggis (formerly Genghiz) Khan through one of his seven wives or his innumerable concubines. Is it anemoia, a recognition of my kinship to Grandpa Genghiz, that has produced in me, this morning, such a wildness in the blood? Or is it the caffeine?</p>
<p>In actual fact, although I&#39;m most curious about Mongol life, I don&#39;t think that I would have made a good nomad. In the first place, I suffer from serious directional disabilities and would no doubt promptly misplace myself on the vast and featureless Eurasian steppe; and secondly, I lack enthusiasm for subsisting on <em>kumis,</em> the fermented mare&#39;s milk which was the staple of the Mongol diet.</p>
<p>Let me now admit that while I indulge some pseudo-anemoia for my distant Mongol forebears, I feel much closer to my more recent Ukrainian shtetl ancestors. If I could be plopped down in the western Ukraine, I might be able to absorb the texture of life in Staroconstantinov in 1895, just before brave Isaiah and Eta set out for America.&#0160; As things stand, I know almost nothing of any importance about the lives of my eastern European ancestors. How did these resilient folks survive centuries, millennia,&#0160; of dearth, disease and pogroms? What did they eat? Where did they sleep? What, indeed, did they do for &quot;fun,&quot; if they had any conception of fun? What did they read? How did the sexes relate to each other? How did they find privacy? And most significantly: how seriously did they embrace that narrow, all-encompassing and demanding religion?</p>
<p>A nineteenth-century shtetl seems impossibly foreign and faraway, but in the longer time frame, it&#39;s actually very recent. The most distant past that we can readily imagine is when the archeological record begins to appear -- perhaps five thousand year ago. But my and your fully human ancestors migrated from the Olduvai Gorge some 60,000 years ago, which leaves approximately 55,000 years without any data at all -- or at least nothing beyond the merest occasional trace. For these many millennia our forbears lived in world where there were no cities, no writing, no pottery, no weaving, no domesticated plants or animals, no metals, no wheels and therefore no vehicles -- only stone hand axes and later spears and much later still bows and arrows. Two thousand five hundred precarious <em>generations</em> of foraging! I would like to see for myself how our common ancestors managed to survive when the gigantic short-faced bear competed for the cave and the terrifying European lion lurked in the shadows. I suspect also that the most dangerous predator our g g g... grandfathers faced was the tribe next door -- otherwise why would we have inherited such hostility to people who look or act just slightly differently than ourselves. Wouldn&#39;t it be profoundly anemoiac to join a family of our mutual forebears for a week or two and participate with them as they went about their lives?</p>
<p>What a treasure-trove of unknown unknowns would we confront!</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Ukraine has been invaded and whole cities have been obliterated by the Putin dictatorship. It&#39;s tragic. Once again, I&#39;m overwhelmingly grateful that my grandparents chose to pack up and leave the blighted Ukraine. It&#39;s a decision that has looked better and better with each passing year.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>My father&#39;s family came from a Ukrainian &quot;shtetl&quot; called Starokonstantinov, or Alt Konstantin (&quot;old Constantine&quot;). As a youth, I overheard but did not understand conversations in Yiddish about a place that my grandparents called (phonetically) Xusantine-gebernia, where the X stands for a non-English deep guttural fricative. Seventy years ago I paid little attention to my eastern European ancestry. Now I&#39;m fascinated.</p>
<p>Where is Starokonstantinov?&#0160; What is a &quot;shtetl?&quot;</p>
<p>I&#39;ve just read Yohanan Petrovsky-Shtern&#39;s new (2014) and highly pertinent history, <em>The Golden Age Shtetl (</em>an oxymoronic title if there ever was one). Y P-S defines a shtetl as &quot;an East European market town in private possession of a Polish magnate, inhabited mostly but not exclusively by Jews, and subject to Russian bureaucracy.&quot; Starokonstantinov, he claims, was a &quot;quintessential shtetl.&quot; &quot;My&quot; ancestral shtetl lies in the western part of Ukraine, about 50 miles south of a line drawn between Lviv and Kyiv. Nowadays, it has a population of about 30,000 souls.</p>
<p>I know that my grandfather&#39;s people lived in Starokonstantinov from the middle of the nineteenth century, but I have no idea when they first arrived -- it might have been years or centuries before. The town itself is not an ancient foundation. It enters history only in the late 16th century when a Polish noble named Konstanty Ostrogski built himself a castle (which still survives) and took ownership of the surrounding area. Starokonstantinov was a &quot;private town&quot; -- meaning that it was owned by the Ostrogski family for several hundred years. In its first years, Starokonstantinov was included in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In 1569 it became part of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. In 1793, and for many years, even after my ancestors had struck out for the new world, it was a possession of the Russian Empire. Now it&#39;s in the independent Ukraine, and hoping to remain so.</p>
<p>The history of Starokonstantinov is marked by a series of tragedies prior to the one now in progress. An early disaster was the Battle of Starokonstantinov in 1648, which was a key event in the Chmielnicki Massacres of 1648-49. Eastern rite Cossacks broke into the fortified town and killed all of its 130 Jewish families and as many Polish Roman Catholics as they could find. During the early part of the 18th century, the Haidamack massacre of Uman by Cossacks spilled over into other Ukrainian shtetls, including &quot;mine.&quot; And then beginning in 1881 came the series of pogroms -- anti-Jewish peasant riots provoked and tacitly supported by the Russian officialdom. In Starokonstantinov, there were 6611 Jews in 1847 and 9212 (61% of the total population) in 1897. (There would have been two more if my grandparents hadn&#39;t seen the light in 1895). During the Nazi occupation in 1942, virtually all the remaining Jewish population (6731 in 1939) was murdered. It&#39;s a troubled, tragic history.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not sure what it means to say that a town was wholly owned by Polish nobility. Did the Ostrogskis own all the land, or the land and some of the buildings? Did they administer the public works? The churches? Did they possess the surrounding farms?&#0160; Did they own, until they were freed in 1861, the serfs?&#0160; Most likely, each shtetl had its own particular form of ownership (the late medieval world was anything but standardized). Y P-S does not explain; perhaps he assumes it&#39;s common knowledge.</p>
<p>Starokonstantinov occasionally makes an appearance in <em>The Golden Age Shtetl</em>.</p>
<p>I had not realized how active my ancestors might have been in the vodka trade. &quot;In Starokonstantinov, the possession of Countess Rzewuska, about fifty [Jewish-owned] inns and taverns yielded 67 percent of the town revenues.&quot; (Query: how and when did the shtetl pass from the Ostrogskis to the Rzewuskis, who were a very prominent and wealthy Polish family)? As far as I can tell, the &quot;town revenues&quot; went directly into the hands of the Polish overlords. In 1827, &quot;Starokonstantinov Jews realized the that their efforts to prevent the draft of men for twenty to twenty five year terms in the Russian army [had failed], and the Jewish populace turned against their own kahal elders and attacked their houses.&quot; &quot;Local police had to summon an additional army unit to suppress the outburst.&quot; (The &quot;kahal&quot; was a committee of prominent Jewish citizens who were the nominal governors [under Polish supervision] of the Jewish population.) In the first half of the nineteenth century, the divorce rate among Jewish couples in Starokonstantinov, was 16 percent. In larger cities, it was even higher (in Letichev it was 47 percent). Y P-S attributes the surprisingly high rate of failed marriages to the relative freedom of Jewish women and to the breakdown of traditional constraints as the Jewish population became increasingly urbanized. A major fire in Starokonstantinov in 1835 hastened the shtetl&#39;s decline. Russian travelers found Starokonstantinov and especially its roads deplorable. &quot;A Russian army officer observed that Starokonstantinov is dirty beyond any measure: but &#39;if we bother ourselves to learn the reasons for this situation, we would perhaps find out that even the Jews, whom are usually blamed, have nothing to do with it.... To drive through the streets of the town is a real challenge, as there is no pavement. Stones once paving the road have long sunk into the soils. When it is raining, they do nothing but prevent movement.&#39;&quot; Mud season in Starokonstantinov must have been an annual challenge. Nevertheless, Starokonstantinovites were readers: a merchant estimated that in the shtetl there were &quot;about 20,000 books, mostly prayer books, bible and bible commentaries, tractates on the Talmud and the Kabbalah.&quot; Y P-S thinks that this number must be a great exaggeration. But it&#39;s on the record that a merchant named Pinhas Yosef Bromberg from Starokonstantinov brought twenty Hebrew books with him while traveling on business to St Petersburg.&#0160;</p>
<p>My great-grandfather was a participant in the commerce of Starokonstantinov. According to my father, he was a &quot;factor.&quot;&#0160; A &quot;faktor&quot; (Yiddish from German) was essentially a middleman. My ancestor had a horse and a wagon (perhaps, I allow myself to fantasize in a moment of self-aggrandizement, two horses and two wagons). According to tradition, he mostly dealt in grain, but factors such as he bought and sold whatever was available: wood, coal, ribbons, calico, mirrors, bolts and screws, vodka and wine. They did much of their business at fairs and Starokonstantinov was famous for its very prominent fair.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>On our prosperous Boulder Mall, where all the men are handsome, all the women are good-looking, and all the mendicants take Venmo, there are 44 separate and distinct signs that declare, <strong>No Pets</strong>. Such clear instructions do not inhibit our infatuated dog owners, who can&#39;t bring themselves to believe that the injunction applies to their particular o-so-lovable canine. They cannot fathom that not every recreational mall-walker is in love with Bowser. As a result, the No Pets law is widely and defiantly flouted.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a second mall rule: no amplified music. Acoustic guitars, string quartets, bluegrass bands, accordionists, and singers are all allowed and encouraged. But every once in a while, some itinerant assembles an appallingly large apparatus on our otherwise peaceful Mall and produces sounds that can be heard for half a mile. Rude, ear-shattering noises.</p>
<p>Canines and amplifiers are everyday commonplace violations. But yesterday, walking on the mall, we observed a remarkable and unprecedented novelty. Along comes a nondescript scruffy guy walking an oversized nondescript dog, and lo and behold, onto the beast is strapped a boombox. Honest to Pete, I&#39;m not making this up! The attached mechanism is a powerful one and it generates an extremely loud noise. Unidentifiable sounds, possibly though not certainly some sort of music.</p>
<p>A woofer with a woofer, so to speak.</p>
<p>The man and his faithful friend proceed shamelessly along the mall, bass notes vibrating the shop windows and oscillating my pancreas.</p>
<p>I was floored, frankly. One dog, one amplifier; two concurrent violations.&#0160;</p>
<p>And then I watched in amazement as the big ol&#39; dog dropped a big ol&#39; deuce. A double deuce, actually. Two long brown glistening, smoking turds. Lurking right there on the bricks, preparing to ambush the pretty white shoes of the next three-year-old princess-in-a-pink-tutu to come tripping by.</p>
<p>In our town, it&#39;s the inviolable custom that every dog owner carries a plastic bag and politely disposes of his pet&#39;s droppings. Not this guy. He just kept on walking, pretending that he didn&#39;t know what was going on at the end of his leash -- which was, as a I have said, 1) a pooch, 2) an attached amplifier, and 3) pooch poop. A jackpot -- a perfect trifecta.</p>
<p>Do I have a theory to account for such contemptible misbehavior?&#0160; Well, I&#39;ve been thinking and mulling and contemplating, and I&#39;m aware of the talk of the breakdown of civil society, but all I can come up with is this: some people are royal jerks.</p>

                                <p>At lunch yesterday, a friend of long standing mentioned that the conglomerate that now publishes his American politics textbook has hired a new employee, a vice-president for diversity and inclusion. It&#39;s a well-intended decision, I am sure, but it carries a potential downside. The new v-p has instructed my friend to make some changes to his prose. For example, he will no longer be allowed to report that Lyndon Johnson got his way by &quot;arm-twisting&quot; recalcitrant legislators. The metaphor, though commonly used back in the LBJ era, and still picturesque, is disrespectful to people who suffer from broken or withered arms and is especially discourteous to those who are missing one or both upper limbs. No more arm-twisting, therefore. My friend was also told that it is no longer permissible to say that in the U. S., &quot;the poor tend to vote at lower levels of participation than the general population.&quot; The new v-p insists that the phrase, &quot;the poor&quot; denigrates various people by reducing them to a mere category. &quot;The poor&quot; should therefore be updated and altered to &quot;&#39;people experiencing poverty.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>In our peaceful and prosperous midWestern town, we&#39;ve had a continuing and difficult debate about homelessness. Some while ago, our extremely correct local newspaper ceased to denominate those without regular domiciliary appointments as &quot;the homeless&quot; and began to call them &quot;people experiencing homelessness.&quot;</p>
<p>Such a circumlocution, I believe, though well-intended, misses the mark. The word &quot;homeless&quot; has a poignancy and immediacy that the bloodless bureaucratic euphemism &quot;people experiencing homelessness&quot; lacks. Rather than making homelessness more palatable; it makes it more painful.</p>
<p>Let us thank all the gods in the pantheon that Emma Lazarus did not write, &quot;Give me your people experiencing lassitude, give me your people experiencing poverty.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>I wonder what the v-p for inclusion would say about Jesus, who famously advised that &quot;when thou makest a dinner or a supper, invite not thy friends, nor thy brethren, neither thy kinsmen, nor thy rich neighbors; lest they also bid thee again, and a recompence be made thee. But when thou makest a feast, invite the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind.&quot; Such a forceful series of evocative nouns! But would &quot;the maimed,&quot; &quot;the lame,&quot; &quot;the blind,&quot; overleap the diversity and inclusion barrier and enter a 21st century textbook? I think not.</p>
<p>Although Jesus may have had some good ideas, he was definitely not &quot;woke.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s been six years since Dr. Metablog (aka Vivian de St. Vrain, aka The Modern Nostradamus) issued a set of predictions. His last collection, from 2016, earned a score of 100% correct, when every single one of his dazzling glimpses into futurity proved to be exactly accurate. An astonishing performance!!&#0160; Which is why The Modern Nostradamus once again won the Lifetime Platinum Award from the International Prophecy Society. Now, after a brief but pregnant retirement, Dr M returns to the prophecy lists and offers the following. Read and be dazzled, fit audience though few. Here&#39;s what&#39;s going to happen!</p>
<p>1)&#0160;&#0160; there will be unusual weather patterns in North America;</p>
<p>2)&#0160; &#0160;there will be a forest fire in one or more western American states;&#0160;</p>
<p>3)&#0160; &#0160;a famous Hollywood actress will sue for divorce; moreover, another (or possibly the same) star will become pregnant; another (or possibly the same) actress will gain or lose a great deal of weight;&#0160;</p>
<p>4)&#0160; &#0160;a politician will be accused of dishonesty;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>5)&#0160; &#0160;there will be either a monsoon, an airplane crash, or a capsized ferry in Asia;</p>
<p>6)&#0160; &#0160;there will be fluctuations in the stock market;</p>
<p>7)&#0160; there will be turmoil in the Middle East;</p>
<p>8)&#0160; a religious leader will be involved in either a financial or a sex scandal.&#0160; Or perhaps both;</p>
<p>9)&#0160; Mitch McConnell will continue to be a colossal asshole.&#0160;</p>
<p>You read it here first. Loyal readers: check back at the end of the year.&#0160; Let&#39;s see whether a senior but world-class professional augur still has enough on the oracle ball to foretell the future one more time.</p>

                                <p><img alt="Thomas Massie’s Christmas family photo. ‘The guy’s abominable but that’s what’s happening to the Republican party,’ said one critic." class="dcr-1989ovb" height="84" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10a72ec57e052d517d561ba5e545e7708ec17794/0_117_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=465&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=ec8e499616f425deef1d1f3eb0e3d3bd" width="140" /></p>
<p>Here&#39;s a Christmas-themed picture posted by United States Representative Thomas Massie of Kentucky. Note the cheerfully decorated tree behind them. Note also that each member of the shit-eating-grin faced members of the Massie family is sporting a military weapon. Massie himself, as befits the father of such a family, carries the piece of artillery that is by far the most threatening. He&#39;s so proud.</p>
<p>I must be out of the military-Kentucky loop, because when my friends send me Christmas cards, they will characteristically include a message such as &quot;peace on Earth, good will toward men, or perhaps something about &quot;joy&quot; or &quot;blessings.&quot; Massie&#39;s card says, &quot;Please Santa, send ammo,&quot; which is not, I believe, a traditional holiday greeting.</p>
<p>Massie&#39;s card is deliberately provocative. It&#39;s designed to piss off the libs. In your face, pinkos! But it&#39;s so blasphemous and misjudged that it might also offend mainline Christians. Goodness gracious, I hope so. Though frankly, I haven&#39;t heard much of an outcry from the pulpits.</p>
<p>But now it has come to pass that it&#39;s not just blue-staters that are offended. Massie has gone and pissed off the Lord himself -- who has retaliated with a series of tornadoes which have swept through Massie&#39;s home state. Can there be any doubt, any possible probable shadow of doubt, that the Ancient of Days has responded to the Massie family Christmas card with lightning and thunder? Vengeance is mine, I shall repay, saith the Lord. It&#39;s obvious -- although I am shocked to observe that I have not yet heard any megachurch preacher draw the undeniable conclusion. I&#39;m waiting.&#0160;</p>
<p>When I first set astonished eyes on the card, I guessed that Massie, though an important office holder, must be what I have heard called in Vermont a &quot;local yokel.&quot; Trash. A rube. An exterminator or mortician or gun-toting bar owner who lucked into Congress because no more respectable person chose to run. Because what person of intelligence, sensitivity, experience, or a modicum of education honors the spirit of Christmas with a display of assault weaponry?&#0160; Imagine my surprise when I looked up Massie and discovered that he has a raft of degrees and extraordinary prizes from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He&#39;s clearly brilliant (in a MIT kind of way). But even if he were a pure pocket-calculator I-don&#39;t-give-a-shit-about-anyone-but-myself libertarian nerds, shouldn&#39;t he have been exposed, in New England, to enough human beings of all sorts to recognize that his Christmas greeting is monumentally offensive not only to his fellows and (as we have seen) to the Lord of Hosts Himself?&#0160;</p>
<p>Or perhaps he knows that our tearful country is so riven that an irreligious display of such a sort will amuse and motivate his allies and torment his opposition. And will strike gold with political donors.&#0160;</p>

                                <p>Among my circle of friends, it is a shameful thing to be called &quot;house proud.&quot; It&#39;s a term to be avoided, even shunned. It&#39;s competitive and flaunts the wrong values. Conspicuous consumption. Vanity. &quot;I own a bigger house than you, and therefore I&#39;m a better person than you.&quot;&#0160; &quot;House pride&quot; is a very badddd feeling of the human heart. So therefore I was astonished when I opened a new edition of <em>Luxury Home Magazine</em> (which should be called <em>Conspicuous Consumption Quarterly</em>) to discover that in this publication shameless vanity is now not implied, hinted at, or disguised, but flaunted. The magazine&#39;s reiterated theme: &quot;Make your friends envy your trophy home.&quot; It says so in so many words!&#0160; Gasp!</p>
<p>And indeed, from the pictures and descriptions of these homes, it&#39;s clear that the advertised trophies are not designed o live in, but rather to let their owners wow their friends and demonstrate how wealthy (and wasteful) they can be.</p>
<p>Does anyone actually require a 15,000 square feet house with three kitchens, even if one of them is outdoors. &quot;Main kitchen boasts two islands, multiple refrigerators, freezers and sinks.&quot; And a wine cooler (in addition to the wine cellar). &quot;Five beds, eight baths, seven fireplaces?&quot; &quot;Massive vaulted ceilings with a towering three sided stone chimney?&quot; Also, a &quot;luxurious soaking tub, double-headed shower, and makeup vanity?&quot; Two &quot;indoor-outdoor pools?&quot; An elevator from the basement to the widow&#39;s walk?&#0160; &quot;Large tiered media room.&quot; Game room. Basketball court. A putting green. Five oversized garages with 20 foot windows?&#0160;</p>
<p>Also, &quot;breathability,&quot; whatever that is.</p>
<p>I&#39;m embarrassed that I&#39;m on the Luxury Homes&#39; mailing list and I&#39;m embarrassed, once again, to be a member of the species<em> homo sapiens</em>.</p>
<p>My advice to readers whose mouths water when they yearn for a trophy home: &quot;enough is as good as a feast.&quot;</p>

                                <p>I learned what was wrong and bad in the P S 217 schoolyard. At our corner of the world, where Coney Island Avenue crossed Newkirk, the guy at the bottom of the moral barrel was the &quot;sore loser.&quot; He was the guy who, when he missed an easy layup, always claimed, against the evidence, that he had been fouled. And when he lost a game, he picked up his basketball and took it home -- in order to prevent the rest of us from continuing to play. He was always whining, always complaining, always wronged. An unpleasant member of the community, disliked by most, hated by some, loathed by a few. A disruptive presence, only tolerated because he was rich enough to own the basketball or the baseball bat.&#0160;</p>
<p>No question but that the greatest sore loser in the history of the planet is our former president. What a pathetic whiner! He lost fair and square but he can&#39;t admit it, so instead he claims a nonexistent foul, or a series of fouls. He&#39;s out to change the rules to give himself the advantage. And he&#39;s willing to mess up the entire game if he doesn&#39;t get his way.&#0160;</p>
<p>He wouldn&#39;t have gotten the least smidgeon of respect in 217 schoolyard.&#0160;</p>
<p>What&#39;s wrong with the people who still support him? What are they thinking? How come they can&#39;t recognize him for what he is?&#0160;</p>
<p>Sore Loser.</p>

                                <div>The Tampa Bay Devil Rays now claim that they won the 2020 World Series against the Dodgers -- even though most of us saw the Dodgers win by a margin of 4 games to 2.&#0160; The Rays claim that in Game 5, two runs scored by Tampa Bay were nefariously credited to the Dodgers. The scoreboard, they claim, was designed and controlled by Hugo Chavez who &quot;flipped&quot; the runs. Although an audit conducted by Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred showed no such evidence of tampering, Tampa Bay and their increasingly rabid supporters continue to contend that &quot;the whole series was a hoax and a fix.&quot;&#0160; Mobs of fans, some outfitted in bizarre costumes, resist reviewing videotapes of the games, contending that the tapes have been altered by space lasers controlled by &quot;Rothschild interests.&quot; Tampa Bay fans plan to storm Dodgers Stadium in Los Angeles, rescue the trophy, and demand that their team be declared the winner -- &quot;or else.&quot;</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>Meanwhile, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers football team now says that it will accept the results of next Sunday&#39;s SuperBowl game &quot;only if we win.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;</div>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>For the last eleven years, I&#39;ve lived in a downtown Boulder condominium. I much enjoy living here -- it&#39;s age appropriate. The rooms are all on one floor; there&#39;s an elevator; underground parking for the new Subaru; no snow shoveling; hardly any upkeep. It&#39;s quiet inside and out -- but right around the corner, just a block away, is the semi-famous Boulder Mall, with all the urban stuff that one could want. A music venue. Restaurants, shops, a bank, a drugstore, a barbershop, and just a half mile to the west, the very resourceful Boulder Public Library. In season, a farmer&#39;s market. Tourists and natives peacefully strolling. A good place for a guy my age to &quot;hang.&quot;</p>
<p>There is, however, a small fly in the ointment. This past January, Ms. Reynolds, my consort and odalisque (we don&#39;t use the W word, or the H word either) bought a condo down the corridor from mine. As a result, both of us traverse the short distance (75 feet) between hers and mine multiple times a day before ending up in my place for dinner, perhaps a movie, and sleep. The difficulty is that there&#39;s a quirk in this building&#39;s heating system. The corridor is always frigid; for some reason that no one seems to understand, the air-conditioning, need it or not, is always turned up to 11. The temperature stands at 58F, summer and winter. The people who manage the building say that nothing can be done about the arctic blasts. Hard to believe, but apparently true.</p>
<p>We call our passage from one apartment to the other, &quot;braving the polar vortex.&quot; The corridor itself is &quot;the tundra.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>In an effort to remedy this situation, I have written the following letter to the authorities.&#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;Dear Managers of the Building:</p>
<p>Inasmuch as it has proven impossible to raise the temperature of the corridor higher than 58F, I propose that we attack this flaw with a new and, I dare to suggest, more imaginative strategy. If we can&#39;t raise the temperature, let us lower it. With a little effort we can get it down to a consistent 48F. We could then make some money by using the corridor as a sort of root cellar. I envision a series of individual wooden boxes, say, perhaps 6&#39; by 4&#39;, where residents at modest cost could store their beets, carrots, onions, and potatoes (bought in bulk at the Farmer&#39;s Market). It might even be possible to rent some of the boxes to outsiders and bring a little extra income into the building. What a marvelous (and ecologically sound) solution to our problem!!</p>
<p>Wait. On further thought, I have an even better idea. Let&#39;s lower the temperature another couple of degrees, to 37F, the ideal for storing dry-aged beef. The corridor could then be re-configured as a meat locker. I doubt it woulds cost more than $100 to install a series of hooks in the ceiling, from which residents (and outside renters) could hang their sides of beef. Everyone knows that dry-aged beef is premium eating. I think this could be a real money-maker for the property.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t see any possible objection to either of these ideas, but I&#39;d want the board to decide which one seems most promising and most lucrative.</p>
<p>And by the way, I noticed the other day that a pair of arctic foxes seem to have taken up residence in the corridor. We&#39;d probably have to do something about them before we hang the beef, or there could be complications.</p>
<p>Also, I might be mistaken but I think a saw an ermine skittering right near the elevator.&quot;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>The yips have been big news this week because Jose Altuve, Houston&#39;s golden-glove second baseman has made three throwing errors in two games. Glaring, costly errors. He&#39;s bounced balls to first base and to second base -- throws of twenty or forty feet which he has made successfully thousands of times in his outstanding career.</p>
<p>The &quot;yips&quot; is sports jargon for the sudden, inexplicable inability to make an ordinary or routine play. It&#39;s commonly used by golfers when they start missing short putts --but baseball has its famous yippers -- Steve Saxe, Chuck Knoblauch (both of them second baseman who have the shortest, easiest throws)&#0160; and now, possibly Altuve. Sometimes a good pitcher will lose his control and start to miss badly; the retired pitcher at the microphone will say, &quot;he&#39;s lost his release point,&quot; which is a yippish diagnosis without using the word. Athletes think that the problem is psychological but it&#39;s possible that the condition is merely neurological - a &quot;focal dystonia&quot; or muscle spasm in the wrist. Basketball yips? Yes, sometimes a good foul shooter will miss four or five in a row.&#0160;</p>
<p>I suspect that the yips may not be a sports-only syndrome.</p>
<p>Once, a decade or two ago, I was driving across the country on a four-lane and needed to brake. For some reason, my feet (I was driving a standard transmission so both feet and the clutch pedal were involved) couldn&#39;t remember which was the brake pedal. I flailed with both feet and was utterly panicked for about five long seconds. Then I came to my senses, put the correct foot on the correct pedal, and continued on in normal fashion. Life continued. But if I had crashed the car and killed myself, which was certainly a possibility, investigators would have thought that I had fallen asleep at the switch. They&#39;d have been wrong; it was just the yips -- a failure to perform a task that should have been entirely routine.</p>
<p>I wonder how many road disasters are caused by undiagnosed yippishness.</p>
<p>Do actors get the yips? Do musicians? Dentists?&#0160; Airline pilots? Surgeons (&quot;You know, I&#39;ve done that back surgery hundreds of times but three out of the last four, I&#39;ve sliced entirely through the guy&#39;s spinal cord&quot;).</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>The nation is in an uproar -- the Covid-19 pandemic, mass unemployment, racial reckoning, disorder in the streets, Russians sabotaging our elections, ignorant authoritarian leadership.</p>
<p>We ourselves are sheltering at home, and are healthy, thanks to the masks and the cooperation of friends and neighbors, but there&#39;s little hope of a getaway. We certainly can&#39;t travel. What to do for an escape? There&#39;s no frigate like a book, so it&#39;s time to read a long leisurely novel by Anthony Trollope.</p>
<p><em>The Small House at Allington </em>is the fifth of six in the Barsetshire series. Had I read it before? Certainly, but it doesn&#39;t matter. To read a Barset novel is to put on well-worn old clothes. Loose slippers. <em>The Small House</em> is comfort food. It&#39;s the mac and cheese of novels.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not 2020, it&#39;s 1863. Outside of Barsetshire, millions of working-class Englishmen are living in grinding, soul-destroying poverty. Cholera is rampant. India is being pillaged. Ireland is trying to recover from famine and mass emigration. There&#39;s a second Opium War in China. British ships are running the Union blockade of Confederate ports. But all is as ever in the perennial untouched Allington microcosm.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Should the Dales continue to stay in the dower house even though the squire is sometimes impolitic?&#0160; Should Adolphus Crosbie choose to marry Lily Dale (yes!) or Lady Alexandrina de Courcy (big mistake)? Will Plantagenet Palliser run off with Griselda Grantly -- don&#39;t do it, Planty Pall!&#0160; Should Lucy Dale accept a dinner invitation from the Earl de Guest? Why won&#39;t Isabella Dale agree to accept her cousin Bernard as a husband? -- everyone in the family thinks it&#39;s a good idea, except Bell herself, who prefers poor but faithful Dr. Crofts.</p>
<p>Political and economic problems do not intrude into the small world of the Small House. Finding a mate, keeping a mate, repairing a frayed relationship is its subject; equally important for men, is to locate a woman of means, so that one can support a comfortable style of life without stooping to real work.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Adolphus Crosbie, although far from our favorite, accurately describes the three things that he requires in a wife: that she be of a good family, that she have money, and that she be beautiful. Does Mr. Crosbie possess these qualities himself?&#0160; No. But he does have a handsome set of whiskers, which seems to be sufficient.</p>

<p>No question but that he&#39;s a serial liar: just think of the birther thing, the attendance at the inaugural, Sharpiegate, &quot;the best economy in the history of the world,&quot; that Hilary Clinton received 3 to 5 million illegal votes, &quot;total exoneration,&quot; the 16,000+ lies and misstatements since 2016 that the Washington Post has catalogued. Enough falsehoods to circle the earth several times, or more likely, stretch from here to Alpha Centauri.&#0160;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, all these falsehoods pale in comparison to the latest revelation.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>He repeatedly boasted that he was such a baseball star at the New York Military Academy that he could have gone to the majors. Someone finally investigated. Box scores from the 1950s show that he batted .138, with 3 rbi&#39;s and scored one run. Said one baseball guy, “You don’t hit .138 for some podunk, cold-weather high school playing the worst competition you could possibly imagine&quot; and go pro. “It’s absolutely laughable. He hit .138—he couldn’t fucking hit.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>OK, he lies about everything. But about baseball? Some things should be sacred. Off limits.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <div class="noprint" id="mw-head-base">It&#39;s not often that a figure of speech makes the headlines -- as happened this week with the rhetorical term &quot;sarcasm.&quot; At a press conference a couple of days ago, the present occupant of the White House, Donald J. Trump, whose use of language is occasionally infelicitous, let fly with a giant whopper. He announced that the horrid new coronavirus could be cured by (gasp!) an injection of bleach. When his foolish advice&#0160; attracted scorn, he backtracked by claiming that his words were merely &quot;sarcastic.&quot;</div>
<div class="noprint">&#0160;</div>
<div class="noprint">To put the blame on sarcasm is a transparent lie, of course, believed only by one person in the entire universe -- Trump himself -- although no doubt his brek-a-kek-keks of toadies will pretend that his analysis was pure genius.</div>
<div class="noprint">&#0160;</div>
<div class="noprint">But did he truly mean &quot;sarcasm&quot; -- a trope generally marked by a mocking tone of voice and &quot;a sharp, bitter, cutting or caustic expression, a contemptuous gibe or taunt in which hostility is disguised as humor.&quot; Trump seems to define sarcasm rather more loosely: to him in means &quot;I didn&#39;t say what I said yesterday and, besides, it&#39;s all the fault of the media.&quot; What a curious line of defense, and what a misuse of a rhetorical term!&#0160;</div>
<div class="noprint">&#0160;</div>
<div class="noprint">Besides, one should think twice before invoking sarcasm, because the term has a bad name among the psychologists, who consider it a &quot;maladaptive coping mechanism for those with unresolved anger or frustration.&quot; There&#39;s a class of people who employ sarcasm because they have &quot;certain forms of brain damage as a consequence of lesions in the right parahippocampal gyrus.&quot; I have no particular knowledge of Mr. Trump&#39;s parahippocampal gyrus, but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it&#39;s taken a bit of a beating these last few years.</div>

<div class="noprint">Sarcasm has even been banned by Trump&#39;s great friend Kim Jong-Un. No sarcasm in North Korea -- a rare instance of a figure of speech being consigned to a firing squad.</div>
<div class="noprint">&#0160;</div>
<div class="noprint">Besides, Trump is already the master of a number of the tropes of traditional rhetoric. There&#39;s<em> enellage, </em>a sentence that ignores the usual grammatical rules and conventions; s<em>olecism</em> and <em>tautology,&#0160;</em>gross violations of syntax and logic; <em>hyperbole,</em> or exaggeration, and its less well-known cousin, <em>adynaton, </em>a collection or list of impossibilities; <em>aposiopesis, </em>the sudden end of a sentence before completion; and <em>paraprosdokian, </em>the unexpected truncation of a clause. But all would agree that the figure of speech that Trump deploys most regularly is<em> prevaricatio.</em></div>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Dear T, O, E, L, L, C, and A:</p>
<p>A friend told us that when she entered Pomona College in 1961, it was the custom that all the newly arriving women (&quot;co-eds&quot; they were called in those dark days) were &quot;measured&quot; by the sophomore men. She said that the women were lined up and their measurements (height, weight, bust, waist, hips) taken and announced to the assembled spectators. This shameful blast from the past shocked and embarrassed me.</p>
<p>I&#39;m five years older than our friend, but I&#39;m glad to say that I never heard of any remotely similar goings-on at the college I attended. (Maybe such things happened in the backward, benighted frat clubs, but surely, I hope hope hope, not in my part of the campus). In fact, I was a bit skeptical of our friend&#39;s story -- it being so grotesque -- so I searched a Pomona alumni website for confirmation and found this picture. I&#39;m sorry to say that the evidence is incontrovertible. &#0160; &#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="   http://voices.pomona.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/FreshmanMeasuring1.jpg" style="display: inline;"><img alt="image from voices.pomona.edu" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef025d9b3562e4200c img-responsive" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef025d9b3562e4200c-800wi" title="image from voices.pomona.edu" /></a></p>
<p>Tale of the tape, 1961.</p>
<p>Crew-cut boy is smiling, and I think I understand why. He&#39;s almost touching shirtwaist girl&#39;s breasts. In those pre-Vietnam years, female virginity was still a mystical virtue, mechanical contraception (there were no pills) was near-impossible to obtain and prone to failure, pregnancy before marriage was a life-shattering disgrace, and abortion was illegal and sometimes fatal. It might be that taking the measure of the young lady&#39;s bosom was the sexual pinnacle of crew-cut boy&#39;s four years in college. Nevertheless, I&#39;m puzzled that shirtwaist girl is so amenable to the taping. Is she actually smiling? Doesn&#39;t she realize that she&#39;s participating in an absurd demeaning dehumanizing rite?&#0160;</p>
<p>I asked our Pomona friend how she dealt with the ritual. &quot;Well,&quot; she said, &quot;here&#39;s what I did. I went downtown and bought a large size inflatable bra. I put it on and blew it up to monumental proportions. I brought a pin to the ceremony. I planned to pop the bra just as I was being measured, but the thing was so tough it didn&#39;t deflate as planned. I wish it had. That was my protest. I should have done more. It was difficult to buck tradition. When things are customary, taken for granted, it takes a lot of strength to go against the system even when you know it&#39;s wrong.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>Here&#39;s another story, young &#39;uns, from the same era. In 1960, your grandmother, AGP, began teaching mathematics in Newton, Massachusetts. Her salary was $4200 a year, but if she had been a man, it would have been $4300. The district had two salary scales, one for men and one for women. I remember studying a printed schedule that had one column labelled M and one labeled F. The difference between M and F was small, but it increased with every year of experience. However small or large the discrepancy, it was still an insult and an injustice, designed as much to assert superiority and inferiority as to make an economic difference.</p>
<p>Both AGP and I knew it was wrong, but I&#39;m embarrassed to say that we did not protest. Before &quot;equal pay for equal work,&quot; it was taken for granted that Fs would be paid less than Ms. Why didn&#39;t we argue, agitate, organize?&#0160; Because we were paralyzed, I think, by the powerful forces of custom and convention.&#0160;</p>
<p>I wonder about crew-cut boy. Was he forever locked into 1960 attitudes or did he eventually come to enlightenment? What sort of relations did he establish with mature women? And did he, perhaps, have a daughter? Would he have advised her to attend Pomona College, and if he did so, did he try to ascertain whether first-year female students were still being measured?</p>
<p>I wonder also about the abuses in our society that we notice but tolerate because they are so embedded in the culture. And even more so, by the abuses we don&#39;t notice but will be clearly apparent in a generation or two. Which of today&#39;s events will look as antiquated and rearward in fifty years as that Pomona ritual?</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>The rooster came to our attention about a month ago. We heard him before we saw him. He was living at the edge of the forest, about one hundred yards from the house. After a few days he became bolder and we were able to catch a glimpse now and then. He&#39;s a Barred Rock, fully mature, with a bright red comb and superior wattles, but with woeful tail feathers. We don&#39;t know from where he came. We asked around but none of the neighbors is missing a rooster. We guessed: he&#39;s an escapee, or, perhaps his owner became tired of him and kicked him out of the truck, or (my favorite theory) he was in a rooster fight, lost his tail feathers and retired to the woods in shame. But in fact, we have no idea how he came to settle on our property.</p>
<p>Little by little he started to become more comfortable with us. He would spend his day in the flower garden, furtively eating insects. He was especially fond of earwigs. A good occupation, I thought. No harm except to the bugs. Eventually he came to tolerate our presence. He would sit a few yards away, studying me while I weeded. He gained our respect, because he managed to survive even though the forest is filled with foxes and fisher cats and weasels and coyotes and the air is patrolled by hawks. He liked to visit the donkeys and peck around their manure piles.&#0160; When he started to roost not in the forest but in the blueberry bushes close to the house I became concerned -- this may be more of a rooster guest than I need. And then he took up the habit of cock-a-doodle-do-ing at dawn just outside our bedroom window. And during afternoon nap time. And familiarizing himself with the vegetable garden, where he snacks on cucumbers. (He loves cucumbers.) He became ever more bold -- a few days ago he was just outside the kitchen, pecking on the glass door, hoping, I imagine, to be let inside. And when I didn&#39;t let him in, he left a large retaliatory splash of rooster dropping right at the doorway.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef0263e9a1ccdb200b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Screen Shot 2021-05-01 at 3.33.28 PM" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef0263e9a1ccdb200b img-responsive" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef0263e9a1ccdb200b-800wi" title="Screen Shot 2021-05-01 at 3.33.28 PM" /></a></p>
<p>We looked out of the small north window of our bedroom and there he was perched on the railing, peering in. A peeping-Tom rooster. (Did he catch an eyeful!!)&#0160;</p>
<p>One day a near neighbor telephoned: &quot;Your rooster is here.&quot;&#0160; &quot;He&#39;s not my rooster.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>And then he disappeared. For the first time in a month, there was no crowing at dawn.&#0160; OK, we thought, some predator got him. One of these days, we&#39;ll stumble upon a bunch of black and white feathers in the forest.</p>
<p>But then a friend who lives on Ira&#39;s Pinnacle told us that he had seen a pair of chickens on Hackett Hill Road about a half a mile up the road. He couldn&#39;t be sure, but he figured it must be &quot;your&quot; rooster and a hen.&#0160;</p>
<p>So that&#39;s where he&#39;s been!! He&#39;s a gallinaceous gallant gallivanting with the local ladies. I thought, good for him; I don&#39;t have to concern myself with him any longer. He&#39;ll go feral and start a family. He must not know about Vermont winters.</p>
<p>But not so. This morning he was back, solitary, crowing vigorously outside my window. His romance, if it were a romance, didn&#39;t work out. I can&#39;t imagine why because he&#39;s become quite a handsome bird. He personable, friendly and he&#39;s grown an an impressive new set of tail feathers. He&#39;s plump and shiny; his walk, once furtive, has become a decisive strut. There he is now, cock-a-doodling his head off in the patch of cucumbers.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Many a restaurant in New Orleans; and many visited by us during our latest stay.</p>
<p>Two divergent experiences. &#0160;Shaya, and Venezia.</p>
<p>Shaya:</p>
<div class="photo"><img alt="Shaya, New Orleans, LA" height="386" large-data-url="https://resizer.otstatic.com/v2/photos/large/23751171.jpg" onerror="error()" src="https://resizer.otstatic.com/v2/photos/large/23751171.jpg" title="Shaya, New Orleans, LA" width="386" /></div>
<p>Slick, elegant, ultra-modern, carefully designed. Waitpersons stylishly costumed and coiffed. Well-trained. Reservations mandatory. Customers: jacketed and tied, or on high heels. Price: whole wallet.</p>
<p>The place to go if you&#39;re looking for wood roasted Brussels sprouts with black harissa, tahini and sumac pickled onions. Or ikra made with paddlefish caviar and shallots. Or if you want your crispy halloumi with strawberries, mint and pistachio. Perhaps shakshoula made of tomato, Jerusalem artichokes, poached egg, chilies and chermoula. The roasted chicken is cooked with shawarma spices, heirloom carrots, and chickpea mujadara. Etc. Very enjoyable experience.</p>
<div class="menu-item f42dd212">
<div class="menu-item-title">Then there&#39;s Venezia. Not pronounced ven-ets-ia after the Italian style, but ven-ezh-a by local custom. Red-and-white checked tablecloths. Families, large and extended. Waitresses as wide as tall who call you &quot;honey&quot; or &quot;dearie.&quot; &#0160;Sausages, peppers, spaghetti with tomato sauce, shellfish. Excellent pizza. Sorry, no picture available on website. No website, actually. And, added bonus, Venezia is just down the street from famous historic Angelo Brocato (ice cream and pastries).</div>
<div class="menu-item-title">&#0160;</div>
<div class="menu-item-title">Guess at which restaurant I felt more at home.</div>
<div class="menu-item-title">&#0160;</div>
<div class="menu-item-title">New Orleans is a high contrast city where the Whole Foods sits directly adjacent to the Dollar General. Honest.</div>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Numerous European websites are reporting that Barron Trump, the 12-year-old son of United States President Donald J. Trump, has been betrothed to Katerina Kabaeva, the 11-year-old daughter of Vladimir Putin and &quot;first mistress&quot; Alina Kabaeva. &#0160;</p>
<p>White House spokesman Sarah Huckabee Sanders refused to comment on the report. But another member of the Trump administration, who spoke under the condition that his name not be revealed, said that, &quot;if the story is true, then it&#39;s a significant diplomatic coup for the United States and for the Trumps. &#0160;It would allow two great families, one Russian and one American, to link their fortunes. It&#39;s a significant step forward for Russian-American diplomatic relations. It could be the making of a dynasty.&quot;</p>
<p>It has also been reported that the betrothal agreement, negotiated by Trump lawyer Michael Cohen and former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, calls for the transfer of somewhat more than a billion dollars from the Russian bank&#0160;Vnesheconombank, or VEB, also known &#0160;as &quot;Putin&#39;s bank,&quot; to Trump Industries. VEB has previously been known to be an important investor in Trump properties. &#0160;What the Trump family offered in exchange is as yet unknown.&#0160;</p>
<p>The rumor that the spelling of &quot;Barron&quot; Trump&#39;s name has been changed to &quot;Baron&quot; Trump has not been confirmed.</p>
<p>A date for the wedding has not been announced.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>The White House announced today that &quot;naming rights&quot; to stretches of the Trump Wall across the southern U. S. border are up for sale.</p>
<p>Portions have been pre-sold. Among the corporations that will have their names in neon on the wall are Chick-Fil-A and Hobby Lobby. The largest single stretch has been claimed by Koch Industries, Inc. Together with its subsidiaries Invista, Georgia-Pacific, Molex, Flint Hills Resources, Koch Pipeline, Koch Fertilizer, Koch Minerals, Matador Cattle, and Guardian Industries, Koch will place signs on almost six hundred miles of wall. It is rumored that the National Rifle Association has contracted to name a large portion of the Texas barrier.</p>
<p>The White House did not say how much the corporations paid for the naming rights. &#0160;Charles Koch, in a rare interview, asserted that the cost was &quot;a good buy. &#0160;But it&#39;s not about money,&quot; he added, &quot;it&#39;s about patriotism.&quot;</p>
<p>Trump Industries has also claimed a few choices miles of the wall but has yet to make a payment.</p>

                                <p>United Airlines has announced that starting March 1, passengers will be charged for the use of on-board toilet facilities. &quot;Charges will be nominal,&quot; according to United spokesperson Alma Santistevan, &quot;just five dollars for the first five minutes and two dollars for every subsequent minute, but passengers must remember to bring their credit cards with them to the facility.&quot;</p>
<p>Toilets are now being equipped with card-operated locks but passengers may still use the facilities for free until the end of the month.</p>
<p>Last year, United carried 95,611,500 passengers. &quot;Even if each passenger uses the facilities just once a trip, we are looking at half a billion dollars of additional revenue with very little capital expense,&quot; explained Santistevan. &quot;Stockholders will be very very pleased.&quot;</p>
<p>United is considering additional charges for toilet paper and for paper hand towels. Barf bags will also require a small fee.</p>
<p>Other airlines are expected to follow suit.</p>
<p>United CEO Scott Brandon was asked if he anticipated passenger resistance. &quot;There will be some grumbling at first,&quot; he replied, &quot;but passengers will get used to it. After all, they&#39;ve accepted smaller seats, charges for water, rude service, unpredictable bumping, huge fees for cancellations and plane changes, luggage surcharges, pets stuffed into overhead bins and suffocated, as well as the occasional person dragged from his seat screaming. Besides, what choice do they have? They&#39;ve got to piss.&quot;</p>

                                <p>Donald Trump has taken credit for the rise in the stock market. &quot;The stock market hit yet another record high yesterday. There is great confidence in the moves that my Administration is making.” If he is responsible for the rise, then surely he is also responsible for the fall. It can be no accident, and can only be a signal from the other world, that Trump&#39;s market fell exactly 666 points last Friday. One trillion of market value was erased with the wave of the supernatural wand. Six hundred and sixty- six is &quot;the number of the beast&quot; in <em>Revelation.</em>&#0160;Inasmuch as everything happens for a reason, we must ask what the Lord is telling us. The 666 point drop undeniably demonstrates that DT is &quot;the man of sin&quot; who &quot;opposes and exalts himself above every god or object of worship&quot;&#0160;(<cite>2 Thessalonians 2:1). </cite><span style="line-height: 1.2em;">He is the false god who has erected his tower at 666 Fifth Avenue. Heed, O supporters of Trump, the words and acts of the Lord, for the man of the flaming hair is the egg of the serpent, the false prophet, the anti-Christ.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.2em;"> No possible probable manner of doubt.</span></p>
