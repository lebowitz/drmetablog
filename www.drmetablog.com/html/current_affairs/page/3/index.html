		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I&#39;ve now sometimes zoomed but&#0160;sometimes plodded&#0160;through seventeen hours of <em>Downton Abbey</em>.&#0160;The series is lovely to look at but also at various times lugubrious, false, and shamelessly gimmicky -- but apparently I&#39;m easily seduced.&#0160;Let me&#0160;confess: I fell for it, mostly, but always against my better judgment.&#0160;Let&#39;s face it, the primitive parts of my brain simply overwhelmed my higher critical faculties. I laughed and cried, even when I knew that I was being cheated and manipulated.&#0160;</p>
<p>My favorite parts:&#0160;Mr. Pamuk and his Nelson Rockefeller departure&#0160;(&quot;he came, and went),&quot; which took me totally by surprise, as did Anna&#39;s and Lady Grantham&#39;s resourceful disposal of the&#0160;corpse. Lady Sybil as a nurse, in part because she was doing useful work for the first time in her pampered&#0160;life, and&#0160;in part because she looked so fetching&#0160;in the&#0160;uniform. My favorite performers -- Maggie Smith, reprising her role in Gosford Park (a much superior&#0160;great house fiction), and Mr Carson&#39;s eyebrows, perpetually raised&#0160;in shock at&#0160;modern shenanigans.&#0160;</p>
<p>The series is pure, undiluted soap.&#0160;It is also, as they used to say in&#0160;<em>Variety,&#0160;</em>a &quot;costumer.&quot;&#0160;Query -- would I have spent seventeen hours watching a&#0160;television program set in a mansion in Dubuque, Iowa, in 2012 in which a soldier returns paralyzed from the wars and miraculously regains his mobility,&#0160;where terrible culinary disasters occur because the cook almost goes blind,&#0160;where granny shows her goodwill by losing a flower show, in which the family is traumatized when a daughter runs off with the chauffeur,&#0160;or where a presumably innocent servant is sentenced to death&#0160;for the murder of his wayward wife. I don&#39;t think so. I would have said, &quot;cornball soap opera&quot; and clicked back to the NBA.&#0160;Or to the advertisements for zirconite jewelry. And yet I went on. And on. And continued on even after <em>Downton Abbey&#0160;</em>not only jumped the shark but vaulted the great white whale, Moby Dick himself, when it introduced into the plot a bout of supposed amnesia. Amnesia! Is there anything soapier?</p>
<p>Or perhaps my reluctant fascination proves that&#0160;the traditional formulas retain their power.&#0160;Here&#39;s a formula of comedy:&#0160;&quot;artificial difficulties overcome.&quot;&#0160;In <em>Downton Abbey,&#0160;</em>Lady Mary and Matthew are destined for one another, and every viewer knows it, even as steaming piles of artificial difficulties are strewn and heaped in their path.&#0160;Shakespeare could slice through the impediments in two hours traffic on the stage, but here it&#39;s seventeen anguished hours until heir and heiress finally figure it out. And here&#39;s&#0160;another formula of comedy: always bring it to conclusion with a feast and a dance.&#0160;They did, and, sucker that I am,&#0160;I was elated. Even though I saw the scam coming a mile down the o-so-picturesque road&#0160;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I like to think that I have a sense of humor, but I just don&#39;t get this one-liner by Rick Santorum&#39;s Daddy Warbucks, Foster Friess. &quot;And this contraceptive thing, my gosh, it&#39;s so--it&#39;s  such--inexpensive, you know, back in my days, they used Bayer Aspirin  for contraception. The gals put it between their knees and it wasn&#39;t  that costly.&quot; So what&#39;s funny here? If the &quot;gals&quot; keep an aspirin between their knees, they can&#39;t have sex and therefore can&#39;t get pregnant? Is that it? Is that The Joke?</p>
<p>First of all, let&#39;s all chip in to send FF a copy of the Kama Sutra (or even an elementary how to do it manual), where he can find some exotic and some extremely obvious positions in which women can get pregnant and still keep their knees together.</p>
<p>But why aspirin? Why Bayer aspirin? What do I not understand? Why an aspirin between the knees rather than, say, a bible?&#0160; Or a book by Newt Gingrich? Or a copy of the <em>The Joy of Sex</em>.</p>
<p>Foster Friess says all this aspirin fun took place &quot;back in my day.&quot; I would like to say that FF is a year younger than I, and that I a) never heard the joke (if it&#39;s a joke) back then, and b) never heard tell of a single woman who used knee-aspirin as a contraceptive.&#0160;</p>
<p>I did some internet research on the aspirin-contraceptive connection and discovered that there&#39;s a story going around in high schools that taking three aspirin and drinking a Coke before intercourse will prevent conception. Advice to young people: do not bank on it.</p>
<p>Will the Santorum administration, immediately upon taking office in 2013, ban aspirin?&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Today it&#39;s Santorum, who has staked out positions to the right of the Pope, where there isn&#39;t all that much room. Yesterday it was Gingrich. Before that, in their turn, Perry, Cain, Bachmann.&#0160; Each month brings a new anti-Romney and just as inevitably, his/her decline.</p>
<p>The extremists who control the Republican party want a candidate who is strictly, or extremely, or &quot;severely&quot; conservative and who can still appear sane enough to be elected.</p>
<p>But it can&#39;t be done.&#0160; It&#39;s a hunt that&#39;s doomed to come up empty.</p>
<p>The &quot;base,&quot; whether fundamentalist or libertarian or drown-the-government-in-the-bathtub, has established a series of tests which make it impossible for their candidate to be both sane and sincere. There can be no such animal.</p>
<p>The candidate must reject evolution and profess to believe in some variety of creationism.</p>
<p>He must believe, or profess to believe, that global warming is a hoax -- a conspiracy theory devised by geologists and meteorologists and climate historians. The candidate must be profoundly anti-science and anti-rational.</p>
<p>He must believe in some variety of &quot;trickle-down economics,&quot; even though several rounds of tax cuts have benefited the rich at the expense of everyone else. (It hasn&#39;t been trickle down, it&#39;s been gush up.) He must believe that any attempt to remedy the situation is &quot;class warfare.&quot; And he must also believe that it&#39;s no problem that the richer are getting out-of-control richer and the poor are becoming poorer and more numerous.</p>
<p>He must believe that the mortgage crisis and the recession was caused by quasi-government entities like Fannie and Freddie and not by the speculations and peculations of de-regulated banks and brokers.</p>
<p>He must believe that the solution to the problem of illegal immigration is to build a larger, taller wall, even though for every wall there&#39;s a ladder and that there&#39;s not a leaf of lettuce that would be harvested or a roof patched in all of America without undocumented labor.</p>
<p>He must believe that gay people are gay by choice and aren&#39;t entitled to equal status under the law. How do they know? The bible tells them so.&#0160;</p>
<p>They must profess to believe that the invasion of Iraq, the worst foreign policy blunder in our history, was a good idea.</p>
<p>And they must believe that Barack Obama fronts a socialist-secular conspiracy, other members of which are the press, the universities, and the &quot;elite,&quot; who want more than anything else to take away their guns.&#0160;</p>
<p>Does this sorry bunch of Republican candidates believe all this nonsense, or do they pander to the base? Are they idiots or are they liars?&#0160; Fools or knaves? We report, you decide.</p>

                                <p>If the profoundly Christian seventeenth-century founders of our  country had a single favorite Biblical passage, it might be the one in which the  Lord (speaking through His minor prophet Amos) severely condemned the empty vanity  of holidays. &quot;I hate,&quot; said the Lord, &quot;I despise your feast days, and I  will not smell in your solemn assemblies.&quot; The Lord of Hosts  specifically enjoined against the attempt to placate him by sacrificing  animals (a matter of topical concern in Amos&#39; time). &quot;Though ye offer  me burnt offerings and your meat offerings, I will not accept them;  neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat beasts.&quot; Nor did  He rest with these easy-to-follow injunctions, but He went on to condemn  all musical tributes as well. Not for him any chants, glees or carols: &quot;Take  thou away from me the noise of thy songs; for I will not hear the melody  of thy viols.&quot; Our Puritan forefathers interpreted these lines  correctly and enthusiastically; they recognized that the Lord opposed not only ritual  sacrifice and music but all formal observance and rote piety. The  Ancient of Days made it abundantly clear that what moved him was not  empty ceremony but genuine morality. HIs solution: &quot;let justice run  down as the waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream.&quot; Taking these  uncompromising sentences as their guide, our founders dug in their heels  against the ostentatious celebration of all holidays, especially  Christmas. Instead, they did as they were enjoined: they looked into their hearts.</p>
<p>Would they not have been reduced to angry and impotent sobs by the  grotesque consumerism -- the burnt offerings and squeaking timbrels&#0160; --  that once again this Christmas season displace justice and righteousness?&#0160; Could there be  anything more loathsome either to Amos or to our devout ancestors than  &quot;Silent Night&quot; amidst shopping-mall tinsel and gimcrackery? Or than the attempt to gin up conflict or to gain a partisan political advantage by inventing a mythical &quot;war on Christmas&quot;?</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>

                                <p>Here in peaceful, progrressive Boulder, two commissioners&#39; seats are coming open next election. Commissioners are important officers: they directly govern the half of our citizens who live in unincorporated areas of the county, they employ 1800 people and administer a $300 million budget, they manage all the social services, and they set policy on land use, open space, transportation, etc. They also put out fires.</p>
<p>Even though we&#39;re six months away from the primary, campaigning is well under way. And should be. Deciding on he right county officer is important. We&#39;re a functioning democracy.</p>
<p>This afternoon there was a forum to allow the six candidates to answer questions and state their views.&#0160; But just as the meeting was called to order, we were &quot;occupied.&quot;</p>
<p>About fifty or sixty people filed into the room, took up places around the perimeter, interrupted the moderator and announced that they had a statement to make, which they did in a peculiar and theatrical manner. Their leader read a few words, and then the rest of the folks repeated the same phrase, in chorus. Their demands were well known: control the big banks, put an end to corporate dominance, stop the foreclosures, support the homeless, reduce pollution, prohibit fracking, end uranium mining, and prevent any GMO crops from being grown in Boulder County.&#0160;</p>
<p>Then they left. Just vanished.</p>
<p>And so we got back to work.</p>
<p>What was so odd is that every single one of the candidates stated positions that were at least as far to the left, and sometimes further to the left, than the Occupiers -- which makes me wonder whether these very sincere folks wouldn&#39;t be doing more good by helping us stuff the envelopes and do the lit drops and help with the GOTV. To tell the exact truth, I found it just a little offensive to be hectored so dramatically by political novices.</p>
<p>At very least, the &quot;Occupiers&quot; should give up the choral speaking, which sounds not like thoughtfulness but rather like authoritarian groupspeak. A little dictatorial.</p>
<p>As the political philosopher and social critic Doll Tearsheet long ago remarked, &quot;the word occupy... was an excellent good word before it was ill sorted.&quot;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>The number of Republicans who are waiting for&#0160;a signal from God about whether or not to run for president&#0160; of the USA continues to grow.&#0160;They&#39;re waiting and waiting and waiting.</p>
<p>And meanwhile, surprising is it may seem, God the Father revealed himself to&#0160;me -- me! --just last night. He woke me out of a sound&#0160;sleep (which is a kind of miracle in itself because I had taken a double dose of Ambien).&#0160;I have no idea why I was chosen as the Vessel of His Wisdom,&#0160;but, you know, God moves in mysterious ways.&#0160;I swear as I hope to go to Heaven that it was the one true God Who spoke to me.&#0160;</p>
<p>God said, and this is a direct, verbatim quote,&#0160;&quot;I do not want Rick Perry to run for President.&quot;&#0160;I asked Him&#0160;why, in His Infinite Majesty,&#0160;he was so opposed to a Perry candidacy.&#0160;He said (and here His Voice became so strong, so&#0160;&#39;out-of-a-whirlwind&#39;, that it actually rattled our windows --but they&#39;re old windows and the points and putty could stand replacing), &quot;because he&#39;s a doofus, and also because of he could only earn a &quot;D&quot; in the Shakespeare course at Texas A &amp; M. Imagine that. A &quot;D&quot; in Shakespeare?&quot; God was clearly outraged.&#0160;&quot;You are aware,&quot; he intoned, &quot;that according to Victor Hugo, &#39;after God, Shakespeare has created the most?&#39;&quot;</p>
<p>It was interesting to me&#0160;that God didn&#39;t look the way&#0160;He does in the&#0160;inspired Michelangelo ceiling, which is what I would have expected.&#0160;He looked more like Shazam in the old Captain Marvel comic books.&#0160;Old and bald, and kind of indistinct.&#0160;But it was definitely God.&#0160;I could feel it in my gut. Trust me.&#0160;</p>
<p>I asked Him if&#0160;He had any other&#0160;preferences in the upcoming election.&#0160;He sighed.&#0160;&quot;I don&#39;t want&#0160;either Bachmann or Palin&#0160;either.&#0160;They&#39;re&#0160;doofae.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;I wasn&#39;t surprised that God was so adamantine about B and P, because of their shallow religiosity and deficient knowledge of history,&#0160;but I was truly shocked that God called them by the faux-Latin feminine plural &quot;doofae.&quot; I mean, doofus isn&#39;t even a real Latin word, despite&#0160;its -us ending,&#0160;and so there&#39;s no singular feminine &quot;doofa.&quot;&#0160; I would have thought that God would have a better command of His Latinity. I was so taken aback that I forgot to ask Him how he felt about Newt, whom I myself would definitely prefer to be the Republican candidate. He&#39;s so adorable.</p>
<p>But the grammar of the Godhead&#0160;is beside the point.&#0160;The absolute true fact is that He&#0160;has spoken&#0160;quite plainly.&#0160;We mortals need to know no more but simply to walk humbly in His ways, which means that Perry and the two ladies should&#0160;take heed of this authentic Divine Intervention and decline to pursue elected office. For them to&#0160;continue to press forward, at this juncture and with this revelation, would be nothing short of blasphemy.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Neolithic Malta presents&#0160;an e<em>xemplum</em> and a warning.&#0160;The island&#0160;received its first human inhabitants, who probably arrived from Sicily,&#0160;some time around 5000&#0160;BC.&#0160;After about 3600 BC, trade and other links with&#0160; the outside world waned.&#0160;Over the next thousand years or so, the people of Mlata built seventeen&#0160;monumental stone&#0160;temples unlike any elsewhere in the Mediterranean.&#0160;</p>
<p><a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef014e895b24e4970d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Manajdra" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef014e895b24e4970d" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef014e895b24e4970d-800wi" title="Manajdra" /></a>&#0160;</p>
<p>These are the remains of one of the seventeen.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a view of another:<a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef01538f67cf2e970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Hagarqim" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef01538f67cf2e970b" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef01538f67cf2e970b-800wi" title="Hagarqim" /></a>&#0160;<br />There&#39;s something truly remarkable about these megalithic temples, but it&#39;s troubling that a marginal and isolated culture would make such a huge and&#0160;economically unproductive&#0160;investment.&#0160;Indeed, starting about&#0160;2300 BC, this native Maltese culture&#0160;went into precipitous&#0160;decline.&#0160;A major cause&#0160;seems to have been the extreme deforestation and soil loss when the population increased and resources were overused.&#0160;The best guess is that the Maltese experienced an economic and spiritual crisis.</p>
<p>They did not, alas, confront the&#0160;environmental problem; instead, the evidence suggests that the people, probably led by an oppressive priestly caste, continued to make greater and greater investments in religious worship, no doubt hoping that their gods would rescue them from their predicament. &quot;In the end their expectations were not met and crisis ensued from which it took centuries to recover&quot; (Barry Cunliffe, <em>Europe Between the Oceans</em>, [Yale, 2008], p. 172.) The population disappeared, the culture was extinguished and&#0160;Malta was&#0160;deserted until the arrival of Bronze Age peoples around 2000 BC.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s go over this ground and make sure that we understand. The neolithic&#0160;inhabitants of Malta temporarily increased their&#0160;population at the expense of massive enviromental degradation, and then, as the standard of living dropped, decided that the best way to deal with the crisis was&#0160;to make mammoth investments in&#0160;priests and temples (rather than, say, birth control and&#0160;sustainable forestry and agriculture).&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Is there a moral here.&#0160; We report, you decide.&#0160;But I believe that I can hear the&#0160;debate. &quot;We&#39;ve already built fifteen temples and it hasn&#39;t worked.&#0160;Perhaps we should try something new, like planting trees.&quot;&#0160; &quot;Nonesense, young radical.&#0160;We must look to faith. Faith will reward us.&#0160;One more temple, this one really huge.&#0160;More stones over here!&quot;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>It&#39;s election season once again.&#0160;I&#39;m thinking of making a run for city council in our progressive western town. Here&#39;s my revised&#0160;platform, voters.&#0160; &#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>1.&#0160; NO LEAF BLOWERS.&#0160; Rationale: it&#39;s a horrible noisy unecological machine that can easily be replaced with a broom.&#0160;And everyone knows that single-stroke engines are major polluters.</p>
<p>2.&#0160; ALL MALL PERFORMERS MUST BE JURIED.&#0160;Rationale:&#0160;no more off-key singing.&#0160;No more bad juggling.&#0160; No more ugly balloon animals.&#0160;No more noisy drummers or whining didgeredoos.</p>
<p>3.&#0160; EVERY RESTAURANT MUST KEEP A PIG.&#0160;Rationale:&#0160;a perfect, ecologically-sound solution to the waste food problem.&#0160;Come to think of it, let&#39;s require a piggery of all institutions with lunchrooms, such as high schools and hospitals.&#0160;Let&#39;s fatten up those porkers, turn them into bacon and savory spare ribs.&#0160;</p>
<p>4.&#0160; NO &quot;HOLIDAY&quot; LIGHTS.&#0160;Rationale:&#0160;waste of electricity and other scarce resources.&#0160;Global warming. Bad taste.&#0160;Bad theology.&#0160;Bauble-olatry.&#0160;</p>
<p>5.&#0160; NEW ANNUAL HOLIDAY:&#0160;Charles Darwin&#39;s birthday, February 12.&#0160;Rationale: uncontroversial celebration of a great thinker.&#0160;(I reject out of hand those extremists who propose to celebrate Darwin&#39;s birthday on December 25.&#0160;I&#39;m a uniter, not a divider.)</p>
<p>6.&#0160; NO MUSIC WRITTEN AFTER 1897.&#0160;Rationale:&#0160;obvious.&#0160;Why 1897?&#0160; Death of Johannes Brahms. Also, no amplified music of any kind in an automobile that is audible outside the vehicle.&#0160;Higher fines and jail terms hip hop and for excessively patriotic &quot;country.&quot;&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>7.&#0160; NO SMOKERS.&#0160; Rationale:&#0160; lung cancer, heart attacks, emphysema, ashes, disgusting odor, cigarette litter on the sidewalk.&#0160;Note:&#0160;not &quot;no smoking&quot;-- &quot;no smokers.&quot;&#0160;No going outside of city limits to light up and then re-entering.</p>
<p>8.&#0160; NO VISIBLE TATTOOS.&#0160;Why only &quot;visible &quot;tattoos?&#0160; Because whole-body inspections might be&#0160;considered intrusive by squishy civil libertarians.&#0160;Also, no nose rings, navel rings,&#0160;or other bodily piercings.&#0160;Except earrings.&#0160;I rather like earrings. But no more than&#0160;one per ear.&#0160;</p>
<p>9.&#0160; ANNUAL JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL PRAIRIE DOG SHOOT AND BARBECUE. Let&#0160;them kids exercise their Second Amendment rights;&#0160;eliminate them pesky varmints;&#0160; learn to cook. One platform position, three social benefits.</p>
<p>10. NO DOGS PERMITTED WITHIN CITY LIMITS.&#0160;Rationale:&#0160;fatal dog attacks, dog bites, barking dogs, squealing&#0160;dogs, ubiquitous dog &quot;waste,&quot; dogs carrying on in parks and open space, the goopy indulgence of dog &quot;guardians,&quot;&#0160;the ecological disaster of dog food.&#0160;But what about seeing-eye dogs, you ask?&#0160; Well, that&#39;s a slippery slope, ain&#39;t it.&#0160;Sorry folks, no dogs (except for purposes of vivisection). &#0160;</p>
<p>11.&#0160; NO MORE COLLEGE FOOTBALL.&#0160;Rationale:&#0160;I don&#39;t like college football.</p>
<p>12.&#0160; NO &quot;FACILITATORS&quot; WITH WHITEBOARDS OR FLIPCHARTS AT&#0160;MEETINGS.&#0160;Goodness gracious, am I ever tired of those things.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>That&#39;s about it.&#0160;I feel that I have my finger on the pulse of the electorate.&#0160;It&#39;s going to be a landslide.&#0160;Tell me that life won&#39;t be better as soon as we enact these new laws</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p><em>The New York&#0160;Time</em>s says&#0160;that former employees of Wells Fargo admit&#0160;that they &quot;systematically singled out blacks in Baltimore and suburban Maryland for high-interest subprime mortgages.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;&quot;These loans,&quot; Baltimore officials have claimed in a federal lawsuit against Wells Fargo, &quot;tipped hundreds of homeowners into foreclosure and cost the city tens of millions of dollars in taxes and city services.&quot;&#0160; Why did the bank act with such malice?&#0160; Because Wells Fargo &quot;saw the black community as fertile ground for subprime mortgages, as working-class blacks were hungry to be a part of the nation’s home-owning mania. Loan officers pushed customers who could have qualified for prime loans into subprime mortgages.&#0160;Wells Fargo employees picturesquely identified these transactions&#0160;as&#0160;&quot;ghetto loans&quot; made to&#0160;“mud people.”&#0160;</p>
<p>The city of Baltimore has filed a suit against Wells Fargo.&#0160;&#0160;&quot;The toll taken by such policies, Baltimore officials argue, &quot;is terrible. Data released by the city as part of the suit show that more than half the properties subject to foreclosure on a Wells Fargo loan from 2005 to 2008 now stand vacant. And 71 percent of those are in predominantly black neighborhoods.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#39;s called reverse redlining -- systematically marketing the most expensive and onerous loans to black customers.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>So here&#39;s the deal.&#0160; The city of Baltimore loses, the neighborhoods lose, individual families are financially crippled for a lifetime, and the CEO of Wells Fargo gets a 50% raise to $21,000,000 a year.&#0160;What a deal!&#0160;</p>
<p>What&#39;s going to happen to the suit?&#0160; It was filed in January, 2008.&#0160; Three years later, after a predictable spate&#0160;of legal wrangling, a federal judge has allowed the suit to go forward, but not before Wells Fargo &quot;succeeded in limiting the pretrial discovery the city has been able to get and in limiting the allegations and damages the city could claim if the case makes it to trial.&quot; A bank spokeswoman said Wells Fargo will “continue to defend ourselves vigorously.”</p>
<p>Here&#39;s what&#39;s going to happen.&#0160;The bank, which has far greater resources that the city, &#0160;will assign a couple of hundred lawyers to the case and wear down&#0160;Baltimore with various hair-splitting motions.&#0160;&#0160;Judges will retire and/or die. The case will be in the courts for an unknown number of Jarndyce and Jarndyce units of time.&#0160;After a generation or so,&#0160;when&#0160;most of the aggrieved will have long since left the earth,&#0160;Wells Fargo will settle for a slap on the wrist and pay a nominal fine, but admit to no guilt.&#0160;The bank will trumpet its vindication. Justice will not be served.&#0160; It will be bought.&#0160;</p>

<p>Can we possibly&#0160;imagine what will have happened to the many thousandes of&#0160;no-longer-occupied houses and to their one time oh-so hopeful purchasers?&#0160; Nothing good, trust me.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>While indulging a long, pleasant walk this morning, I happened upon a shop I had never before noticed.&#0160; It&#39;s called Juno&#39;s Studio of Contemporary Hair Artistry.&#0160; I ws curious as to whether a &quot;hair artistry studio&quot; was&#0160;what we called in the old days a &quot;barber shop&quot; or a &quot;beauty shop.&quot; I&#0160;tried to peek inside the shop&#0160;but the situation&#0160;was&#0160;a tad too &quot;architectooralooral&quot;&#0160;(in Mr. Joe Gargery&#39;s phrase) for me to feel&#0160; comfortable doing so.&#0160;Nevertheless, I was sufficiently intrigued&#0160;about &quot;contemporary hair artistry&quot; to visit&#0160;Juno&#39;s website. I am now&#0160;prepared to&#0160;&quot;share&quot; with my readership what I have learned. The following paragraph comes to you absolutely&#0160;<em>verbatim.&#0160; </em></p>
<p>&quot;Jules Juno’s passion for the hair industry pulses through her life and work at every turn and every look, as her creative spirit is continuously fueled by the rhythms, themes and movements of the subtle and deep rich nuances of the world around her -&#0160;from the street to the flora, feathers and fur of nature, to the lines of fashion&#0160;and art in all its forms. Aligned closely with the powerful totem of Raven and ready to celebrate newness in light of every full moon, she dwells in the magic of change and transformation. Often called the “Hair Shaman” and “Keeper of the Hair” by her devoted clients, Jules believes in the sacredness of being trusted to work her creative magic on the high chakra space of one’s head.&quot;</p>
<p>I can&#0160;tell you one person whose brilliant (though graying) mane&#0160;Juno&#39;s not going work her creative magic upon (even though&#0160;the hair industry pulses through every deep rich nuance of its rhythms, themes and movements). Mine, that&#39;s who&#39;s. Keep your ever-loving hands off my high chakra space, Hair Shaman!!&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Upon further investigation, Juno (her real name?) turns out to be a&#0160;disciple of&#0160;Minnesotan Horst Rechelbacher -- under whose tutelage she taught &quot;for a triune of years before&#0160;adventuring her creative genius as a platform artist.&quot;&#0160; In our town, she plans to &quot;keep the fires of inspiration burning and push the edges of hair design.&quot;</p>
<p>And while here, she will also&#0160;&quot;push the edges&quot; of New Age Bullshit.</p>
<p>By the way, what the heck is&#0160;a &quot;platform artist?&quot;&#0160; And what distinguishes a &quot;triune of years&quot; from &quot;three years?&quot;&#0160;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I have a favorite moment in <em>Diner </em>(1982), the first of Barry Levinson&#39;s quartet of Baltimore movies, and it&#39;s not the scene in which I made my silver-screen debut. It&#39;s when two of the working-class guys who hang out at the Fells Point hamburger joint find themselves taking a drive in the Maryland countryside. They happen upon a rich, well-tended young blonde woman riding an elegant horse (in her own spacious meadow). They stop the car try to chat her up but she&#39;s clearly out of their league. When she gallops off, one of the guys says to the other: &quot;Do you ever get the feeling that there&#39;s something going on that we don&#39;t know about?&quot;</p>
<p>I was thinking about that scene when I read that Moammar Ghaddafi&#39;s son Seif threw himself a birthday party at some spectacular resort in the West Indies and paid the pop singer Mariah Carey $1,000,000 smackerootis to sing four songs. You read it right -- one millions bucks. The article didin&#39;t say whether she had to pay for her own motel and continental breakfast and transportation but I&#39;m going to guess that expenses were extra.&#0160;</p>
<p>I tried to calculate whether I had earned $1M in my working life. I can&#39;t remember and I don&#39;t have the records, but I know that I started at $3600 and&#0160; by 1966 I was already pulling down $7800. I think that in my first decade of employment I earned well under $100,000. Yeah, I know, them was different dollars -- but still.</p>
<p>A working guy who makes $40,000 would take 25 years to earn what Mariah Carey took home for twenty minutes of effort.&#0160;</p>
<p>But it&#39;s not what she earned so much as what he paid. The Ghaddafi clan of brutes, lunatics, oil-bloated twits, and kleptocrats has been looting the Libyans for forty years. No wonder that the family is willing to commit mass murder to hold on to their hoard. (In his defence, Seif claimed that it wasn&#39;t him; it was his brother Muatassim.) Here&#39;s a question: how many years does it take your run-of-the-mill Libyan to earn $1M?&#0160;</p>
<p>I think that the average Libyan would understand the point of view of the diner guys. There&#39;s something going on out there, and it ain&#39;t all good.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I went to a forum, sponsored by local Dems, with our congressman. Fifty or sixty of my friends and neighbors were in attendance. Our congressman is a good person -- smart, informed, energetic, and progressive. He described the situation in the House of Representatives -- the difficulty of serving in the minority, especially when so many members of the majority side aren&#39;t serious about governing. The audience was sympathetic but there was an undercurrent of impatience. Why can&#39;t the Dems make it clear that cutting taxes and cutting the deficit are incompatible goals?&#0160; Why do the Dems always lose the messaging wars? Our congressman&#39;s answers were not always satisfactory to his liberal constituents.&#0160;</p>
<p>I understand his plight;&#0160; i&#39;s easy to stand outside and criticize. But I also felt that he didn&#39;t appreciate how damn dangerous these right-wing Republicans and tea-partiers have become. The gap between rich and poor is becoming larger and less ameliorable. We could lose our democracy to the corporations.</p>
<p>Afterwards, I asked him, semi-privately, if the new Republican congressman can be educated. Will they ever come to realize that governing is a hard job that can&#39;t be done with slogans and a simplistic ideology.&#0160; He didn&#39;t think much of my question and didn&#39;t answer it.&#0160;</p>
<p>I was filled with foreboding when I left for the forum. I returned home even more pessimistic about the future.&#0160;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Every little once in a while, a mountain lion creeps into the fold and snares a lamb, a calf, or a German shepherd. At even more infrequent intervals, a mountain lion attacks a human being (usually a child).&#0160; Whenever there&#39;s a human-lion interaction, there comes a deluge of letters to the local newspaper demanding that the authorities exercise “lethal control&quot; over the big cats. Killing catamounts is neither hard nor dangerous. They were hunted nearly to extinction in the nineteenth century. Dogs chase the animal up a tree. The brave hunter&#0160;takes aim and fires.</p>
<p>But Is it a good idea to extirpate the&#0160;mountain lion? In the United States, there’s an average of one death by mountain lion a year. Here in our county, there’s been one such death in the last hundred years. One is a very low number, especially when, in the country as a whole, snakes cause a dozen deaths each year, lightning claims seventy-five, bee and wasp stings a hundred. Dogs, when they’re not out hunting mountain lions, account for between twelve to twenty deaths a year – a couple of hundred a decade-- many of these, it&#39;s sad to say, infants in the crib. Given the numbers, It’s hard to believe that calls for the extermination of&#0160;mountain lions aren’t motivated less by facts than by fear.</p>
<p>Domesticated dogs are responsible not only for a dozen to a score of deaths, but also for an estimated 4 to 7 million (that’s right, million!) cases of dog-bite a year, almost 800,000 of which require medical attention. Dog bites cause 368,000 emergency room visits, or (do the math!) one thousand such visits a day.&#0160; The social cost of dog bites is estimated variously, but the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta claims that the direct medical costs of dog bites per year is $165 million, with many more millions in ancillary expenses.&#0160;</p>
<p>Mountain lions, which are relatively harmless, inspire terror, but dogs, which are far more dangerous, are our sacred cows -- loved, in my opinion, beyond all propriety. It’s hard not to cringe when otherwise sensible people – good decent people --tell me in all seriousness that Towser is a full member of their family, or that Fido is about to undergo surgery to replace a hip -- an operation the cost of which is more than the annual medical budget of whole villages in Africa or Asia. The run-of the-mill doggie in America enjoys a better diet and better medical care than half of the human beings on the planet -- a thoroughly indefensible skewing of resources. Dogs are not human beings, and it’s immoral sentimentality to treat them as such. It’s embarrassing.</p>
<p>The ancients, following Aristotle, divided their possessions into three categories: an object was an <em>instrumentum mutum</em>, an animal was an <em>instrumentum semivocale</em>, and a slave was an <em>instrumentum vocale</em>.&#0160; By eliding the differences between humans and animals, the Greeks and the Romans made slavery both easy and natural. Aristotle&#39;s notion underlay serfdom.</p>
<p>I used to worry that people who treated animals as humans would be tempted to treat humans as animals. But it&#39;s not so; the people I know who are sentimental about animals and &quot;animal rights&quot; are extraordinarily sensitive to human rights -- but then, perhaps my sample is skewed. All of my friends are sensitive to human rights; if they weren’t, they wouldn’t be my friends.</p>
<p>I wonder whether the love of dangerous dogs and the fear of the cats who are by and large indifferent to us isn’t an instinct acquired slowly over the last half million years. Our ancestors, armed, at best, with flint-headed spears, spent countless millennia at the mercy of feline predators larger, more powerful and more terrifying than 100-pound mountain lions (the extinct European lion, <em>panthera leo fossilis, </em>was taller, stronger, and and a foot and a half longer than the modern African lion). It was only some 50,000 years ago that an ancient Einstein conceived the idea of domesticating wolves and selecting their population for useful traits. Humans and proto-dogs started to cohabit; dwellings and caves came to be littered with coprolites. Co-evolution began, and over the course of time, dogs and humans came to be sensitive to each other&#39;s traits. Those early dogs were our first allies on this lonely, hostile planet. They could raise a ruckus when a couple or three lionesses prowled about the entrance to the cave.</p>
<p>We&#39;re indebted to dogs and so we tolerate their bad habits.&#0160; By the same token, we have inherited from our ancestors a primordial fear. Hence the over-hasty cry to exterminate the mountain lion.&#0160;</p>

                                <p>Certainly not either by inheritance or conversion or moral stance. Yet Sarah Palin seems to imagine that she&#39;s Jewish -- in a peculiar, one-dimensional way. It&#39;s not always easy to guess at what&#39;s going on in that soup of a brain, but is it possible to determine what Sarah means when she claims to be a victim of a &quot;blood libel?&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>The actual&#0160;targets of the &quot;blood libel,&quot; it is no secret, are not overpaid Foxy commentators but ordinary Jews who, according to pious medieval preachers, Henry Ford, Nazi propagandists, and contemporary Syrian statesmen, make it a practice to drain innocent babes of their blood, which they then bake into matzos.&#0160;</p>
<p>Here are the exact words in which Sarah invokes this hideous accusation: &quot;journalists and pundits should not manufacture a blood libel that serves only to incite the very hatred and violence that they purport to condemn.” It&#39;s a confusing sentence, hard to explicate. Can we be confident that Sarah is learned enough to know that &quot;blood libel&quot; is a phrase with a long and agonizing history?&#0160; Are the &quot;hatred and violence,&quot; which she claims are visited upon her, designed to recall the pogroms (and worse) that have been precipitated by the &quot;blood libel&quot;?&#0160; If her sentence is to be taken seriously, Sarah believes that she is the victim of an attack analogous to the worst kind of anti-Semitic ravings. Just as Jews are accused of killing Christian children, so has Sarah herself been unjustly accused of killing Representative Gabrielle Giffords. In her scenario, in her analogy, she herself, Sarah Palin, is the Jew.&#0160;</p>
<p>In her daily deeds, Sarah Palin does not seem to understand or embrace aspects of Jewish tradition such as compassion, the centrality of community, a deep reverence for education and learning, fierce and informed intellectuality, and robust philanthropy. Pure and simple, she sees herself as a victim -- a condition or state of mind, which, in my opinion, is not only incorrect but dangerous to the polity and to her own self-regard.</p>
<p>In short, she&#39;s scammed herself.</p>

                                <p>I&#39;ve been inspecting the entrails of slaughtered oxen and also observing the flights of birds.&#0160; I&#39;ve studied the movements of planets and tea leaves.&#0160; I can now announce my predictions for the coming year.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>1)&#0160; there will be unusual weather patterns in North America;</p>
<p>2)&#0160; a famous Hollywood actress will sue for divorce;&#0160; moreover, another (or possibly the same) Hollywood star will become pregnant; another (or possibly the same) actress will gain and/or lose a great deal of weight;&#0160;</p>
<p>3)&#0160; a well-known athlete will be accused of taking drugs;</p>

<p>8)&#0160; there will be turmoil in the Middle East;</p>
<p>9)&#0160; a religious leader will be involved in either a financial or a sexual scandal (perhaps both);</p>
<p>10) the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq will not end.&#0160;</p>
<p>You read it here first.&#0160; Not for nothing that I&#39;ve acquired the reputation of an inspired mystic, or shaman, or something.&#0160; Nostradamus redux.&#0160;</p>

                                <p>Just back from the post office, where I mailed the granddaughter her gift, a zester. What is a zester, you ask?&#0160; It&#39;s a kitchen device designed to remove the &quot;zest,&quot; that is, the outermost skin of a citrus fruit.&#0160; The granddaughter&#39;s zester is an inch and a half wide and thirteen inches long, including its five inch handle. Essentially, it&#39;s a hand-held grater, very useful if you&#39;re a cooking enthusiast. And why, you ask, would I venture out in 15F, snowy weather to mail the zester to California, when the grand-daughter could have put it in her backpack when she returned home? Because, I was creditably advised, the zester would certainly be confiscated by airport security.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>What have we come to, when, rightly or&#0160;wrongly, we seriously entertain the idea that an eleven-year-old child could hijack an airplane armed only with a zester?&#0160;&#0160;What would she do, abrade the pilot to death?&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>The Sons of Confederate Veterans celebrated themselves with a&#0160;$100-per-person Secession Ball on Dec. 20 in Gaillard Municipal Auditorium in Charleston.&#0160; The event centered on a play highlighting key moments from the signing of South Carolina’s Ordinance of Secession 150 years ago.&#0160; Jeff Antley, who organized&#0160;the event, said that the Secession Ball honors South Carolinians&#0160;who stood up for their rights.&#0160; “The secession movement in South Carolina was a demonstration of freedom,” said Antley. “What I’m doing is honoring the men from this state who stood up for their self-government and their rights under law.&quot;</p>
<p>Is the act of secesion a &quot;demonstration of freedom?&quot;&#0160;&#0160;What sort of freedom?&#0160; Let us now read from&#0160;South Carolina&#39;s Articles of Secession, which asserts that the federal government has impinged upon states&#39; rights.&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000bf;">&quot;The right of property in slaves was recognized [under the Constitution] by giving to free persons distinct political rights, by giving them the right to represent, and burthening them with direct taxes for three-fifths of their slaves; by authorizing the importation of slaves for twenty years; and by stipulating for the rendition of fugitives from labor. </span><br /><br /><span style="color: #0000bf;">We affirm that these ends for which this Government was instituted have been defeated, and the Government itself has been made destructive of them by the action of the non-slaveholding States. Those States have assumed the right of deciding upon the propriety of our domestic institutions; and have denied the rights of property established in fifteen of the States and recognized by the Constitution; they have denounced as sinful the institution of slavery; they have permitted open establishment among them of societies, whose avowed object is to disturb the peace and to eloign the property of the citizens of other States. They have encouraged and assisted thousands of our slaves to leave their homes; and those who remain, have been incited by emissaries, books and pictures to servile insurrection. </span><br /><br /><span style="color: #0000bf;">For twenty-five years this agitation has been steadily increasing, until it has now secured to its aid the power of the common Government. Observing the forms of the Constitution, a sectional party has found within that Article establishing the Executive Department, the means of subverting the Constitution itself. A geographical line has been drawn across the Union, and all the States north of that line have united in the election of a man to the high office of President of the United States, whose opinions and purposes are hostile to slavery. He is to be entrusted with the administration of the common Government, because he has declared that that &quot;Government cannot endure permanently half slave, half free,&quot; and that the public mind must rest in the belief that slavery is in the course of ultimate extinction. </span><br /><br /><span style="color: #0000bf;">This sectional combination for the submersion of the Constitution, has been aided in some of the States by elevating to citizenship, persons who, by the supreme law of the land, are incapable of becoming citizens; and their votes have been used to inaugurate a new policy, hostile to the South, and destructive of its beliefs and safety.&quot;</span></p>
<p>Yes, it&#39;s true.&#0160; Citizens&#0160;of some states have not captured&#0160;fugitive slaves or returned them to their owners, have denounced slavery as sinful, have elected a president who is hostile to the &quot;peculiar institution,&quot; and&#0160;have (horror of horrors! even granted citizenship to former slaves.&#0160;</p>
<p>The South Carolina document is extraordinarily clear.&#0160; Can anyone fairly doubt that&#0160;there would have been no secession and therefore no&#0160;need for a Secession Ball except in defense of slavery?&#0160; The&#0160;&quot;demonstration of freedom&quot; is nothing more than a celebration of the&#0160; freedom of one person to own another.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Nowadays, when slavery is no longer defensible, &quot;conservative&quot; South Carolinians are reduced to protecting their guaranteed right to make life difficult for&#0160;gays and immigrants.&#0160; And keep women in their places.&#0160; A far cry from their glorious past.&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;But they continue to&#0160;nurture that&#0160;nostalgia&#0160;for the great old antebellum days. &#0160; <br /><br /></p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Sometimes I can&#39;t make the slightest sense of what I read in the newspapers.&#0160; Here&#39;s an example.&#0160; But first some sheep news.</p>
<p>The desert bighorn sheep (<em>Ovis canadensis nelsoni), </em>smaller than the ordinary bighorn and&#0160;one of the rarest and most endagered our native mammals,&#0160;has been reduced to dry ranges in Nevada and California, near rocky cliffs in almost&#0160;waterless environments.&#0160;&quot;Hunting has been prohibited or controlled since the early 1900s, but much illegal poaching still occurs.&#0160; The subspecies <em>Ovis canadensis auduboni</em> of the Black Hills and adjacent areas has already become extinct.&quot;</p>
<p>Now the newspaper report.&#0160; The Longmont Times-Call celebrates a local heroine,&#0160;Ms. Sara Brandenburg.</p>
<p>&#0160;&quot;At&#0160;age 15, Brandenburg became the youngest female in the world to the earn the North American Grand Slam after shooting and killing four different species of North American wild sheep — a dall, a stone, a Rocky Mountain bighorn and a desert bighorn.&#0160; She shot a 230-pound dall sheep Aug. 17, 2009, in Alaska and pinned her final animal — a 220-pound stone sheep — in the Yukon Territory on Aug. 8, four days before her 16th birthday.The previous record-holder was a 32-year-old, according to the Grand Slam Club/Ovis.When she shot the stone sheep — the final one for her grand slam — tears poured down her face. “It’s a big emotional rush when you get it,” she said.&#0160;&#0160;While working on the record, Brandenburg, who is a sophomore at Longmont Christian School, missed two months of classes. She ended the year with a 4.0 grade-point average, in part because she hauled textbooks on hunts. Moments before shooting her desert bighorn sheep in Mexico’s Baja Desert, she was finishing algebra homework.&#0160; Her father, Rod Brandenburg, taught Sara and her older sister, Katey, 18, to hunt at an early age, instilling in them the same pioneer spirit his great-grandfather had when he moved from Germany to homestead in the 1870s in Westcliffe, Colo.&#0160;He estimated it cost about $120,000 to arrange for Sara to kill four sheep. When friends remark about the cost, Brandenburg says it was worth it.&#0160; “I couldn’t afford not to,” he said.&#0160; When he watched Sara shoot her final sheep, a wave of relief, exhilaration and admiration washed over him, he said.&#0160;&#0160;Last month, she took up archery and hopes to repeat the grand slam with a bow this time or advance to the Super 10 title, which is awarded to hunters who shoot and kill 10 North American big-game animals.&#0160; In addition to sheep, Sara Brandenburg also has shot and killed three antelopes, one white-tailed deer and one black bear, as well as a gemsbok, an eland, a wildebeest and a zebra during a hunting trip in South Africa.&quot;</p>
<p>I don&#39;t understand blood sports.&#0160; I find them repulsive and inhuman.&#0160;</p>
<p>Am I missing something?&#0160; The Brandenburg family values ($120,000 to kill four rare sheep) are disgusting, sociopathic, and barbaric.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;Are these people locked into&#0160;the Stone Age?&#0160;&#0160;</p>

                                <p>It had been a while since I last flew Frontier --the airline with the cute furry anthropomorphic talking mammals on their tails. There have been some changes -- all of them for the worse. There&#39;s now an extra charge for each piece of luggage. Those free meals are a thing of the remote past. So are the days when you would get the entire can of ginger ale or tomato juice. It&#39;s now a splash of juice in a cup of ice. No free TV -- you swipe your card, they swipe your cash. The seats are smaller, too. More rows,less leg room. Wasn&#39;t there a time when air travel was glamorous? Now it&#39;s just a big Greyhound in the sky, a warehouse on wings.&#0160;</p>
<p>Not only was my seat compressed, but the back didn&#39;t recline.&#0160; Somehow I had signed up for a seat that bordered on the emergency exit row. In earlier planes, such seats used to recline, but I&#39;m guessing that Frontier has gained a few inches by rendering the backs immobile -- at the cost of my comfort (but not at reduced cost).</p>
<p>Adding to the insult is an unapologetic sign on the back of the seat in front of me inscribed with the words NO RECLINE THIS SEAT. I wonder what language the author of this sign think he is using. Not English, that&#39;s for sure. &quot;No recline this seat&quot; does not even come close to parsing. What would it have cost Frontier to affix a sign that read &quot;the seats in this row do not recline.&quot; Where do they outsource their signs -- to Mars? No recline this seat!!&#0160; Come on, frontiersmen; you can do better than that. If you have no respect for me, at least have a little respect for the language. The talking animals speak better English.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>To the chief of sign-makers at&#0160;Frontier I say, &quot;No hire this job.&quot;</p>
<p>There was another sign for me to stare out while I sat there, miserably cramped, watching the clock. &quot;LIFE VEST UNDER YOUR SEAT.&quot;&#0160; Is Frontier banging the frugality drum a little too hard? The sentence might have read, &quot;Life vest IS under your seat.&quot;&#0160; How much could a trifling copulative verb cost?&#0160; If Frontier wanted to be truly prodigal, it could even have raised the cash to provide an indefinite article: &quot;A life vest is under your seat.&quot; Wow. A complete sentence!. What a concept!&#0160;</p>

                                <p>The 6&#39; 8&quot; Russian oligarch and billionaire Mikhail Dmitrievitch Prokhorov, chairman of the conglomerate Polylus Gold and president of the Onexim Group has acquired the New Jersey Nets. The Nets (or as they are sometimes known, the Swamp Dragons), are moving to Atlantic Yards in Brooklyn year after next, and Prokhorov wants to change the team&#39;s name to something more germane. It&#39;s a monumental challenge to find the correct moniker. After all, what Brooklynite would be content with Brooklyn Nets, especially when the New Jersey team carries with a storied history of failure, mismanagement, and dysfunction. Who can forget the sale, for a few paltry bucks, of Dr. J himself?</p>
<p>Should the Nets be renamed the Brooklyn Dodgers?&#0160;Too presumptuous by half.&#0160;In honor of Prokhorov, how about the Brooklyn Billionaires?&#0160;&#0160;Not fan-friendly.&#0160;Brooklyn Gold?&#0160;Brooklyn Samovars?&#0160;Brooklyn Borsht?&#0160;</p>
<p>My good friend Otis Jefferson Brown proposes Brooklyn Eagles. I think it&#39;s a brilliant idea. It has history, especially for those who remember the Brooklyn Eagle (once edited by Walt Whitman -- 5 &#39;11&quot;, 200); it has patriotism, it has style, and it lends itself to headlines -- &quot;Eagles Soar Once Again&quot;;&#0160; &quot;Eagles Tear Apart Hawks.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>Unless someone comes up with a better name, I&#39;m going with Brooklyn Eagles.&#0160;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>We all remember, and we&#39;re all still shocked and amazed that the late, unlamentable Jerry Falwell proclaimed that the 9/11 attacks on the US were caused by &quot;the pagans, and the abortionists, and the feminists, and the gays, and the lesbians.&quot; How to understand either the logic or the brain of such a thinker? We moderns tend to reason in terms of cause and effect, and cause and effect just doesn&#39;t cut it with Falwell. Was he thinking something like, feminists cause sin (a debatable proposition) and Al-Qaeda wants to cleanse us, so they run the airplanes into the towers. That would be unbelievable nonsense, even for Falwell. Here&#39;s another attempt to divine his mind: feminists are dangerous and evil and therefore the good old US of A has become Sodom/Gomorrah/Ephesus and the Big Guy in the Sky is offended and therefore he engaged Al-Qaeda to punish the US for its sins by enabling or permitting those young Saudi jerks to fly planes into the towers in order to persuade us to repudiate the feminists. Does that make sense? Very little.&#0160;</p>
<p>Similarly, Pat Robertson deduced that Hurricane Katrina was all about abortion. In this case, the Ancient of Days didn&#39;t even bother to enlist human agents. Noticing that there were abortions being performed in the US, he let loose the winds from the caves in which he had confined them and instructed them to bust up the New Orleans dikes and drown a lot of people. &#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Jerry and Pat are a pair of idiots, not only because they lack intelligence, but also because their view of the world is five hundred or a thousand years behind the times. They&#39;d be mainstream in dark/medieval Europe when Attila the Hun and Timur (or Tamburlaine) the Great competed for the title of Scourge of God -- the <em>flagellum dei. </em>They pillaged and burned and raped over vast areas of the world not because they were&#0160; imperialists and conquerors but because they were instruments of god. They wreaked vengeance on our sins. It was orthodoxy. Cause and effect? Sorry, not part of the picture.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>The fallacy <em>post hoc ergo propter hoc&#0160; -- &quot;</em>after this therefore because of this&quot;&#0160; -- means that just because B comes after A doesn&#39;t mean that A causes B. Just because an abortion is followed by a hurricane doesn&#39;t mean that the abortion caused the hurricane. Just because someone prays to one or another god and recovers from illness doesn&#39;t mean that the prayer caused the cure. The volcano isn&#39;t quiescent because we sacrificed the maiden. No religion, not a single one, can bear the light of <em>post hoc. </em>Fully honored, it puts them all out of business. Along with all the other varieties of magical thinking.&#0160;</p>
<p>All this hardly bears mentioning except that a couple of days ago, a &#39;senior Iranian cleric&quot; Hojatoleslam Kazem Sedighi, pronounced that very soon a massive earthquake will devastate the city of Teheran and that the earthquake will be caused by &quot;women who do not dress modestly. [Such women] lead young men astray, corrupt their chastity and spread adultery in society, which increases earthquakes.&quot; There&#39;s a chain of logic for you. A guy catches a glimpse of a lock of hair, or, god forbid, a bit of bosom, and boom -- earthquake.&#0160; But it&#39;s not his fault -- it&#39;s that his natural chastity has been compromised by them there female blandishments. Delilah all over again. Forget the movement of tectonic plates. The energy released in earthquakes isn&#39;t caused by subduction. It&#39;s ankles.The senior Iranian cleric has not correctly grasped the meaning of the demotic phrase, &quot;the earth moved.&quot;</p>
<p>Sedighi is a boob and is even more presumptuous and illogical than Pat and Jerry. The earthquake hasn&#39;t even occurred and he&#39;s already blaming it on the outfits. He&#39;s launched a pre-emptive strike on <em>post hoc.</em> His is a fallacy so monumentally illogical that hasn&#39;t yet earned a name.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>It&#39;s instructive that Shakespeare, writing before the age of reason and before the scientific revolution, offered a full debate on the subject. In <em>King Lear, </em>Gloucester takes the traditional view. Eclipses, like hurricanes, are filled with meaning. Gloucester does not hold with reason or with the logic that he calls &quot;the wisdom of nature.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no good to us: though the wisdom of nature can reason it thus and thus, yet nature finds itself scourged by the sequent effects: love cools, friendship falls off, brothers divide. In cities, mutinies; in countries, discord; in palaces, treason, and the bond cracked &#39;twixt son and father... We have seen the best of our time:&#0160; machinations, hollowness, treachery and all ruinous disorders, follow us disquietly to our graves.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>Gloucester&#39;s bastard son Edmund dismisses tradition and argues scientifically and rationally.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;This is the excellent foppery of the world, that, when we are sick in fortune -- often the surfeit of our own behavior -- we make guilty of our disasters the sun, the moon, and the stars: as if we were villains by necessity, fools by heavenly compulsion; knaves, thieves, and treachers, by spherical predominance, drunkards, liars, and adulterers, by an enforced obedience of planetary influence, and all that we are evil in, by a divine thrusting on. An admirable evasion of whoremaster man, to lay his goatish disposition to the charge of a star. My father compounded with my mother under the dragon&#39;s tail, and my nativity was under Ursa Major; so that it follows, I am rough and lecherous. Tut, I should have been that I am, had the maidenliest star in the firmament twinkled on my bastardizing.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>Gloucester is, in our terms, superstitious and simple, but he&#39;s also orthodox and reverent. Edmund is realistic and rational, but he is also as loathsome a villain as Shakespeare ever created. Shakespeare is a late medieval writer, which is why he should not necessarily be looked to for moral advice but rather for great poetry, great stories, and aesthetic bliss.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the &quot;excellent foppery of the world&quot; has become the province of fundamentalists of all stripes.&#0160;</p>

                                <p>The most famous, I think, must be Itzhak Perlman, who is the earth&#39;s most versatile and distinguished violinist -- and is also father of five next-generation members of the musical tribe. Almost as widely known but perhaps not so spectacularly talented, is Rhea Perlman, better known as Carla Tortelli, mother to many. The most brilliant of the clan, and certainly the most eccentric, is Grigori Yakovlevich (&quot;Grisha&quot;) Perelman, the mathematician who solved Poincare&#39;s conjecture and then refused both the Fields Medal (the Nobel Prize of mathematics) and the $1 million Clay Millennium Prize. Grisha demonstrated what most of us simply take for granted: that any closed three-dimensional manifold where any loop can be contracted to a point is really just a three-dimensional sphere. There&#39;s also Ron Perelman, a consummate and ruthless corporate raider, once the richest man in America, now, alas,&#0160; fallen to 18th -- nor any longer contracted to nonce-wife #4, Ellen Barkin. The most amusing of all Pearlmans is surely Brooklynite S. J. Perelman, screenwriter of two great Marx Brothers vehicles -- <em>Horse Feathers </em>and <em>Monkey Business.&#0160;</em>The most reprehensible of the cousinhood is certainly Lou Pearlman, accomplished Ponzi-artist and the mogul behind the bubble-gummy Backstreet Boys, whom he used and possibly sexually abused to the tune of $300 million -- and who is now serving a 25-year term in federal prison.&#0160;Infinitely more respectable is the composer and conductor Martin Pearlman, who learned his trade at Cornell and who is a harpsichordist as well as&#0160;the founder of the <em>Boston Baroque. </em>Nor should any Pearlman census overlook Ron Perlman, aka Amoukar the Ulam, who many years ago quested for fire. Nor sportwriter Jeff Pearlman, pitcher Jon Perlman, writer Edith Pearlman, film critic Cindy Pearlman; nor the great rhetorician of a prior generation, Chaim Pearlman.</p>
<p>And also: standing at the top of the heap in the world of fiction is&#0160;<em>The Wire&#39;s&#0160;</em>incorruptible Maryland Assistant State Attorney, Rhonda Pearlman.</p>

                                <p>Last night, one of our dinner guests said that at least we no longer have to worry about &quot;pre-existing conditions.&quot; Persnickety about language as always, I pointed out that the phrase &quot;pre-existing condition&quot; was a ridiculous piece of jargon. What is meant is &quot;existing conditions?&quot; A condition can&#39;t exist before it exists.&#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;Aha,&quot; said another of my guests, a Lutheran minister,&quot;now you&#39;ve opened a theological questions.&quot; He was referring to the disputed doctrine that the existence of Jesus preceded his incarnation in the womb.&#0160;</p>
<p>But if &quot;pre-existence&quot; is only taken seriously by theologians and by insurance executives, then I&#39;m going to stand on my claim that the phrase is both obscurantist or bureaucratic and should be discarded from common use. &quot;Existing&quot; is sufficient.</p>
<p>Moreover,&#0160;the&#0160;notion&#0160;that insurance should be granted to the healthy but denied to the ill is a more dangerous travesty than the&#0160;mystification of&#0160;&quot;pre-existence.&quot;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>A sorority girl fell off the roof of her house last week.&#0160; She was, of course, staggeringly drunk. She messed herself up pretty badly but she will live. Accidents of this kind happen regularly in our college town. Kids fall off roofs, kids drive drunk and kill someone or themselves, or kids just binge-drink themselves to death. It&#39;s regrettable that we&#39;ve become accustomed to such stories. I think it&#39;s the saddest thing: a family raises a child for twenty years, sends him or her off to college with great hopes -- and two weeks later the kid has crashed the car, fatally, or choked to death on her own vomit.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>As a result of this latest incident, the neighbors have been engaged in an internet war. One noisy faction insists that it&#39;s our policies that are at fault -- that kids drink themselves to oblivion because alcohol is legally prohibited until age twenty-one. If alcohol were legal, the argument goes, students would then do their drinking in a controlled environment, such as an adult-supervised party or a bar with rules on over-serving, and they wouldn&#39;t indulge in private. It&#39;s a paradoxical argument -- alcohol would be safer if it were not prohibited.</p>
<p>After a great deal of back-and-forth and uninformed argumentation, one of the neighbors, an epidemiologist who has actually studied the problem, presented some data. That when New Zealand lowered the drinking age from 21 to 18, binge drinking and accidental deaths increased. That binge drinking is higher in European countries, some of which allow alcohol at age 16, than in the U.S. That underage drinking declines, sometimes by as much as 40%, when rules are enforced. That when alcohol is less available, alcohol consumption decreases, and conversely, when it is made more available, consumption increases. That the unformed brains of teen-agers are particularly subject to being addled by alcohol.&#0160;</p>
<p>The advocates of lowering the drinking age were unmoved by the evidence. One resident, whom I will call BB, wrote in to say this: &quot;Surely, had this 20 year old woman been of legal drinking age, she would have been in the regulated environment of a drinking establishment and not at an underground party. The likelihood of her being overserved in that regulated environment and then ending up drunk on the roof of her sorority would be considerably diminished. Unlike Dr. F&#39;s and others&#39; studies, this is a real life study that happened right down the street. Let&#39;s open our eyes and start to learn from these events.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;BB&#39;s takes the position that we can ignore the data, forget the scientific studies, and replace them with his interpretation of this particular event. BB&#39;s is a good example of what is called &quot;anecdotal thinking.&quot; But anecdotes, standing alone, are not evidence nor can they replace the systematic gathering of evidence and statistics. Meanwhile, another neighbor of long standing, KW, answers the evidence with his own simple argument: we all drank when we were young, there were laws in place then but we ignored them, nothing will ever change, why make it hard for kids, let them drink at 18. KW is not much more logical than BB. He argues ahistorically, quite oblivious to the fact that alcohol is used differently in different cultures and in one culture a different times in history.&#0160;</p>
<p>BB says, it&#39;s cold today, there can be no such thing as global warming;&#0160; KW says, there&#39;s always been weather, and it&#39;s always been warm</p>
<p>When I was a teacher, I tried over and over again to explain to my freshmen that a) you can&#39;t build an argument on an anecdote, and b) that the experience of an individual is not necessarily universal -- that to gather data, to consider the context, and to apply logic were the hallmarks of the educated individual. Neither BB and KW, both of whom, I believe, graduated from college, ever took the first step in their freshman &quot;critical thinking&quot; class. They have their views, and they&#39;re not going to let facts get in their way.&#0160;</p>
<p>Is it relevant that both BB and KW are Republicans?&#0160; I believe it is.</p>
<p>But what should we do about alcohol abuse?&#0160; It&#39;s an intractable problem we&#39;re not going to solve it immediately, but we have an instructive analogy in the case of tobacco, where in the U. S, the consumption of tobacco has declined significantly. We decreased tobacco use by a) prohibiting advertisements that made smoking glamorous and alluring, b) increasing taxes, c) disseminating information on lung cancer and low birth weights, etc, and d) by making tobacco less available. We could try the same with alcohol, where billions are spent by distilleries and breweries to make make alcohol use seem sophisticated and ennobling. Instead, we could discuss incarceration rates, fetal alcohol syndrome, homelessness, domestic violence, puking in the streets and choking in the bed. We could limit the number of bars and alcohol outlets. We could make drinking more expensive by raising the taxes to cover the civic cost in police, judiciary, accidents, and prisons. We could tax wine less and hard liquor more. We could rigorously enforce existing drinking-age laws. We could also encourage the use of less dangerous drugs.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>In addition, we could try to improve our educational system, so that when the neighbors came to talk about alcohol abuse, they could conduct their discussion with respect for fact and logic.&#0160;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Package to mail, so off I go to the post office. When I arrived, eight people are on line ahead of me. I took my place. There were only two clerks on duty and let me tell you they were not breaking any speed records. They were moving as though through mucilage. If I had to guess, I&#39;d say that they were working at just above the speed in which all molecular motion ceases. Their pace seemed carefully calibrated, as if in answer to the implicit question, &quot;what&#39;s the least possible amount of energy I can expend and still retain my job?&quot;&#0160; There was some grumbling on the line: &quot;Only two clerks on duty!&quot; It took me twenty-five minutes but I completed my transaction. When I left, there were ten people behind me, letters or packages in hand, shuffling and stamping their collective frustrated feet.</p>
<p>How much time wasted?&#0160; Well, here were nineteen productive citizens taking twenty minutes or half an hour to do five minutes worth of work. You do the calculation. If there had been another clerk, and if the clerks were to move at normal human speed, I would have been in and out in a flash. Multiply the TWF (time waste factor) by all the post office stations in urban America. What an astonishing, third-world loss of productivity.</p>
<p>The post office has been essentially privatized. It&#39;s not allowed to run a deficit, so it cuts back on services and continues to raise the cost of mailing an envelope. And makes people wait.&#0160;</p>
<p>But it retains from its former incarnation the lifetime-employment uncivil-service mentality. It combines the worst of free enterprise with the worst of public ownership. It&#39;s a truly remarkable solution to the implicit question, can we design a completely dysfunctional bureaucracy?</p>
<p>About a decade ago, some idealistic postmaster-general announced a campaign to serve every customer within ten minutes of arrival. To that end, a large clock was set in a prominent spot in the every office in the land (in ours, just where the line commences).&#0160; A big PR fuss was made. About a year later, all the clocks were quietly removed.&#0160; I wonder, where did they go. Does the USPS maintain an old clock warehouse somewhere in central Nebraska? Or were they discarded? Or taken home by the local postmasters. In any case, the campaign was a total disaster. The system did not move.&#0160;</p>
<p>The USPS didn&#39;t even do a good job of removing the clocks. When I stand in line, I stare at a wire sticking out of the wall where a clock used to hang.&#0160; I stare at it for ten minutes, for twenty minutes, for half an hour....</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>From our window, looking left across the street, we can see a squat old cinder-block building that sits diagonally on its corner lot.&#0160; I remember when it housed a gas station, then a taqueria, and afterward, for at least a decade, an import rug store that was always &#39;going out of business,&#39; until, contrary to all expectations, it went out of business. The building lay vacant for a year or so, but now it&#39;s found a new purpose. It&#39;s a medical marijuana &quot;dispensary.&quot; (Marijuana, when used for the relief of pain or nausea, is legal in Colorado).&#0160;</p>
<p>When we&#39;re curious, and willing to make the effort, we watch the arrival of the chronically afflicted patients. The are uniformly youthful and they come by car, on foot, on bicycle, on skates or skateboard or scooter. The only vehicle in which they don&#39;t arrive is the wheelchair.&#0160;</p>
<p>In fact, neither &quot;our&quot; dispensary nor any other dispensary bothers to pretend that their product (aka stash) is anything but recreational. GreenLeaf Farmacy, for example, advertises Kief Hash! at $25/gram. Boulder Wellness Center offers &quot;High Quality Medical Marijuana: Tinctures, Vaporizers, Ointments, Teas, and More.&quot; TopShelf Alternatives competes at $10/Gram and with &quot;your choice of 34 home grown strains. Edibles include Mile High Ice Cream.&quot; DrReefer specializes in &quot;clones.&quot; Boulder MM Dispensary is &quot;an upscale establishment with high quality medicine.&quot;&#0160; Colorado Patients First, &quot;where compassion for patients and quality of medicine comes first,&quot; offers &quot;Sour Kush, Big Blue, Opium, AK-47, Maui Mist, Jack White, and Pot of Gold.&quot; For each painful disease, apparently, its own uniquely targeted variety of ganja. To judge by the exuberance of the clientele, the &quot;medicines&quot; must be alleviating tons of pain.</p>
<p>How did it happen?&#0160; Some years ago, voters approved an amendment to the state constitution legalizing the medical use of marijuana. The argument was compelling (and I voted for it).&#0160; Marijuana mitigates chronic pain and also minimizes the nausea that accompanies chemotherapy. Until this year, the state&#39;s Department of Public Health had limited individual physicians to five such suffering patients. But then a judge ruled that the constitutional amendment did not impose such limits, and, in the words of John Milton, &quot;all hell broke loose.&quot;</p>
<p>There&#39;s no zoning (as with liquor outlets), no sin tax (because marijuana is a prescription drug), and no decorum.</p>
<p>&quot;The latest data from the Medical Marijuana Registry maintained by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment shows that as of Dec. 15, 2009,&#0160; a total of 820 licensed physicians had authorized medical marijuana for 15,800 patients. Of those 820 physicians, just 15 accounted for 73 percent of total patients, and just five have authorized 49 percent of all recommendations.&quot; There are now more than eighty marijuana dispensaries in our town. (There are just ten traditional pharmacies.) It makes one wonder about the size of the underground economy.&#0160;</p>
<p>It&#39;s the Wild West -- unregulated, unbridled capitalism!&#0160; It&#39;s a growth industry!&#0160;</p>
<p>It&#39;s also massively hypocritical.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Why don&#39;t we just legalize marijuana, and then regulate and tax it the way we do liquor and tobacco? Of course, neither liquor nor tobacco pays its way -- the social cost of both drugs well exceed their revenues -- but that&#39;s a topic for another day.&#0160;</p>
<p>There are bills in the legislature to regulate the marijuana industry and everyone knows that within a year there will be tight new restrictions. But until then, we will much enjoy the scene at the corner store.&#0160;</p>
<p>[Update March 15, 2023.&#0160; Pearl Maneli writes:&#0160; MMJ, as it&#39;s often called, is now legal in Colorado, but the store visible from our window no longer sells it; the building has been transformed into an upscale i.e. expensive pizzeria.]</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Reading at one of our local Starbucks, I was, as is often the case, lost in my book. But I looked up when a late 20s-early 30s blonde and bearded man sat down at a table across the way. I noticed that he was holding his cup of coffee in an odd way. And then I realized that where his right hand should have been there were a pair of stainless steel hooks. Sad, I thought. And yet he seemed cheerful and optimistic. I wondered if I would be in such good spirits if I had lost a hand in an accident. I went back to reading, but looked up again when he fumbled with the sleeves of his jacket. And then I saw that he had no left hand either. Instead, a&#0160; pair of hooks, left and right, where hands and fingers should be. What terrible accident could have caused a young man to lose both hands, I wondered. Perhaps I was more sensitive than usual, but I was moved almost to tears as I watched him manipulate his coffee and his napkin and his muffin with his mechanical prosthetics. Soon his young and attractive girlfriend joined him. She came on aluminum crutches. &quot;Must have broken her foot,&quot; I thought. Then I saw that there was no foot and that she had only one leg.</p>
<p>I&#39;m slow, but I figured it out at last.</p>
<p>Soldiers. Home from Iraq. Bombs -- IEDs --&#0160; took off his hands and her leg. They met at a rehabilitation hospital. Fell in love. They&#39;re trying to start life over again.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not ashamed that I turned away and started to cry.</p>
<p>&#0160;And then grief converted to anger.&#0160;</p>
<p>That damned useless war! That idiot ignoramus Bush! That villain Cheney!. Those two megalomaniacs, and their co-conspirators,&#0160; who started this war -- they&#39;re sitting pretty right now, aren&#39;t they? But these young folks right next to me -- they&#39;re not sitting so comfortably. They&#39;ve paid the price.</p>
<p>Belatedly, I wish them all the joy that life can offer. As for crazy George and strutting Dick, there&#39;s no penalty that they can pay, there&#39;s no retribution sufficient -- but if their pernicious bodies would rot half a centimeter a day, why, that would be a start.</p>

                                <p>The woman with whom I&#39;ve shared the last fifty-plus years has developed an alarming new symptom.&#0160; She disappears in markets.</p>
<p>We&#39;ll be together, innocently pushing the basket in the vegetable section, for example, and I&#39;ll wander off to fetch some cream cheese and a half-gallon of milk.&#0160; When I return, she&#39;s gone.&#0160; Nowhere to be found.&#0160; I walk up and down the neighboring aisles.&#0160; Nothing.&#0160; She&#39;s completely dematerialized.&#0160; I walk up and down, back and forth, vainly searching.&#0160; </p>
<p>After a twenty minutes, or half-an-hour, she&#39;s back, but teleported to an&#0160;an entirely different part of the store.&#0160;&#0160;She doesn&#39;t even know that she has vanished.&#0160; Sometimes she pretends that it&#39;s I who has disappeared.&#0160;&#0160; </p>
<p>I can understand that she could lose herself in the acre-and-a-half King Soopers, or in the McGuckin prairie, or on the vast Costconian steppe.&#0160; But in Bradford&#39;s minuscule P &amp; C?&#0160; Or in Bradford&#39;s Main Street, comprised as it is of far fewer square feet than any mid-size contemporary&#0160;Walgreen&#39;s?&#0160; No, there&#39;s more here than meets the eye.&#0160; This is no natural process.&#0160; Something supernatural is going on. </p><p>It took some serious reflection before I came to the realization that it&#39;s a clear case of abduction by aliens.&#0160; There is no other credible explanation.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve given a name to the disorder.&#0160; I call it Spousal Transient Alien Abduction Syndrome, or STAAS.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve made some inquiries, and it seems that STAAS is not a condition found only in my family.&#0160; In fact, it&#39;s quite common.&#0160; More than four-fifths of the people that I questioned had experienced recent instances of STAAS.&#0160; Curiously, it&#39;s much more frequently discovered in long-marrieds than among the recently-hitched.&#0160; And less common among women than men.&#0160; In fact, men tend to disappear for longer periods of time than women. </p>
<p>Moreover, just as might be expected, not a single one of the disappeared remembers that he (or she) had ever fallen into the ungentle hands of aliens -- which is certain proof that the abduction took place, inasmuch as it is well known that these extraterrestrial beings possess the ability to scrub human&#0160;brains and obliterate memory.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know what can be done to arrest the spread of this alarming syndrome. Perhaps a Federal task force.</p>
