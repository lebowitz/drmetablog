                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Today I went to see a new doctor, a specialist.&#0160; His&#0160;receptionist sits behind a&#0160;sign that reads&#0160;&quot;Co-payment must be made at the time of service.&#0160; Failure to pay the co-payment will result in an additional charge of $10.&quot;&#0160; I took a seat&#0160;to wait and to fill out&#0160;various forms -- and to&#0160;be apprised of a&#0160;&quot;policy change&quot;:&#0160;&#0160;&quot;A patient who misses an appointment without canceling 24 hours in advance will be charged $45.&quot;&#0160; I read a little further:&#0160; &quot;Extended telephone conversations will be subject to a charge of $15.&quot;&#0160; </p>
<p>I know that doctors&#0160;have to make a living and I don&#39;t begrudge them a decent wage.&#0160; But goodness gracious, must they&#0160;transform themselves into shameless nickel-and-dimers?&#0160; </p>
<p>I want to have confidence in my doctor.&#0160;&#0160;I&#0160;want to think that he&#39;s the heir to Aesculapius, Hippocrates,&#0160;and Jean Hersholt.&#0160;I don&#39;t want to think that&#0160;he&#39;s a money-hungry &quot;provider&quot; whose primary aim, transcending all others (especially healing), is to squeeze me for a buck here and a buck there.&#0160; </p>
<p>Which is in fact what I did think.&#0160; Not a good first impression, Dr. Provider! </p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I hate to fetch the mail nowadays because there are so damn many importunate communications from doctors, hospitals, from medicare, and from insurance companies.&#0160; Even though I&#39;m in relatively good health and need only routine servicing, each&#0160;time I visit a doctor the system manages to generate one piece of paper after another -- most of them written in codes that are almost entirely inexplicable.&#0160;&#0160;Could anyone have devised a more lunatic, more inefficient health-care system?&#0160;</p>
<p>The other day I received a letter from Great<span id="fck_dom_range_temp_1255539685156_692"></span>-West Healthcare, my &quot;supplemental carrier,&quot;&#0160; to this effect: </p>
<p>&quot;We recently reviewed one of your claims and discovered that we mistakenly sent you a ben<span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Arial;"></span>efit check for $31.80.&#0160; We now realize that payment should have been sent directly to your provider.&#0160; We have&#0160;reprocessed the claim to&#0160;pay the provider.&#0160; Therefore, this letter is a request for the $31.80 paid to you in error.&#0160; Please send&#0160;a check for $31.80 to the&#0160;address on the back of this letter.&#0160; If you have any questions, please contact our service center at the number on the front of your health plan ID card.&#0160; Thank you.</p>
<p>Of&#0160;course, there was no address on the back of the letter, so I could not respond.&#0160; </p>
<p>But if there had been an address, this is what I would have said:</p>
<p>Dear Great-West Healthcare:</p>
<p>Thank you for you letter of August 10.&#0160; I will be happy to refund the $31.80.&#0160; However, I have no record of this transaction, so before I pay you,&#0160;I need the&#0160;following data. </p><p>A copy of a cancelled check for the amount that you claim to have sent me.&#0160; </p>
<p>Evidence that you have actually paid the funds to the unnamed &quot;provider.&quot;&#0160; This evidence should be in the form of a cancelled check but if the $31.80 was sent as an electronic deposit, a notarized affidavit from an officer of the &quot;provider&quot; will be ample.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call me at my home phone number, which can be&#0160;conveniently found&#0160;in the local telephone book or&#0160;obtained online, so that I can play you some nice elevator music while you languish on&#0160;indefinite hold.</p>
<p>Thank you. Your call is important to us.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Even as my hearing deteriorates, I become more and more disturbed by excessive noise.&#0160; For example: coffee shops, which in any sensible world, would be oases of tranquility, have become positively uninhabitable. When I visit such a place, I do so either to talk with a friend or to read silently.&#0160; I do not go to be assaulted by what the tattooed, benose-ringed young staff fancies to be &quot;music&quot; -- grating sounds amplified to 11 on the Nigel Tufnel scale.&#0160; And then last week I went to a baseball game at one of the new stadiums where they have embraced to the ultimate the philosophy of&#0160; the &quot;total entertainment package,&quot; which means bright blinking lights, almost constant &quot;music,&quot; and exhortations on the giant scoreboard to &quot;Get Loud.&quot;&#0160; But baseball, more than any other sport, requires thought and concentration.&#0160; It&#39;s a subtle game, not enhanced by distractions. And yet it seemed that very few of the spectators around me were actually paying attention to the events on the field.&#0160; The noise forbade it.&#0160; When our side&#39;s left fielder played a routine fly ball into a single -- an act which would have provoked indignation and jeers at the low-tech Ebbets Field of my youth -- the crowd remained preternaturally silent, reserving its roars for the inter-inning &quot;kiss-cam&quot; and similar travesties.</p>
<p>Do we truly enjoy or are we simply inured to the noise that has become so constant at the old ball game, in the restaurant, or even on the leafy suburban street, where the egregious leaf-blower has become an oppressive commonplace. (Why do we not ban a mega-decibel machine that is less efficient than the time-honored and virtually silent broom)? </p>
<p>The noise of machines and the noise of amplified sound is a relatively new phenomenon.&#0160; Until 1650 or so, no such sounds oppressed our ears. There was the occasional thunderstorm, and there were church bells, and there was the clatter of horse and coach on cobblestone streets&#0160; -- but there was nothing comparable to the sea of noise in which we daily swim. Our ancestors lived for a million years in a world that we would judge to be virtually silent.&#0160; There were no factories, no trucks, no airplanes overhead, no electric guitars and, inasmuch as 95% of the people were village-dwelling agricultural workers, not even large crowds.&#0160; The noise that we routinely endure is unprecedented and unnatural.&#0160; And unhealthy as well.&#0160; </p>
<p></p>

<p>&#0160;</p>

<p>&#0160;</p>

<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Do you really comprehend</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">how beautiful your smile is?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Have you been told lately</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">how warm your eyes, and how they softly glow</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">with the special nature of your soul?</span></p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The rarest of all commodities in this world is love.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">You already had</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">a full tank of love</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">in the emotional bank account.</span></p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Since our first meeting there in&#0160;&#0160;the wind-swept</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">somewhat open air</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">dance spot in Punta del Este,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I felt that you had that same rare attribute.</span></p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">You have a level of sophistication that is so</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">fitting</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">with your beauty.</span></p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">You have the ability to give magnificently gentle kisses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I love the curves of your hips.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I love your tan lines.</span></p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">You have a particular grace and calm that I adore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">In the faded glow of night&#39;s light</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">that we spoke of</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">at the steakhouse.</span></p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; -IV-</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">This soul-mate feel</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I alluded to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">is real.</span></p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">How this lightning strike snuck up on us </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I am still not sure.</span></p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">My heart wants to get on a plane tonight to be in your loving arms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">My head says how do we put the genius back in the bottle</span></p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The bottom line is two fold.</span></p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I&#39;ve never understood money.&#0160; It doesn&#39;t do you any good until you spend it, and once you spend it, you don&#39;t have it anymore.&#0160; </p>
<p>I never understood income, either.&#0160; I was employed for most of my life at a frugal, let&#39;s call it, state university.&#0160; I earned much less money than friends in the &quot;private sector&quot; or the trades, but it didn&#39;t seem to matter much.&#0160; I never missed a meal, I sent my kids to good colleges, and I enjoyed&#0160;the security of knowing that I wouldn&#39;t be laid off.&#0160;&#0160;Meanwhile, I spent a good hunk of my life reading books and talking about literature with young people.&#0160; On the whole, it seemed like a good deal.</p>
<p>I did have some resentments, however, one of which was the disparity in salary between faculty and adminstrators.&#0160; If we were all working in the same place, why should the guy who ran the student union, or who managed &quot;public relations,&quot; or who lobbied the legislature, or who was in charge of campus parking or admissions, or who coached the linebackers,&#0160;or who was second assistant vice chancellor for this-or-that receive a salary twice or three times as large as mine?&#0160; I never grasped the reason.</p>
<p>But then I discovered that the real money in the University system wasn&#39;t in these areas.&#0160;&#0160;It was in managing the University&#39;s portfolio.&#0160;&#0160;A few years ago,&#0160;Harvard Magazine reported that the managers of its endowment were receiving&#0160;annual salaries of $8,000,000 to $10,000,000 -- or about 100 times what I was pulling down.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>But, it was reported, they earned these phenomenal salaries because they were such financial geniuses -- and their genius could be judged by&#0160;the enormous growth of the endowment.&#0160;</p>
<p>I have to say that I was sceptical.&#0160; I remembered one of my father&#39;s maxims:&#0160;&#0160;&quot;when the stock market is&#0160;going up, everybody&#39;s a genius.&quot;</p>
<p>Then I received a letter from Harvard&#39;s President, reporting on the steep decline in the value of the endowment.</p>
<p>In a fit of pique, I wrote to President Faust (her real name).</p>
<p>Dear President Faust:&#0160; when the stock market was flying, the managers of Harvard&#39;s endowment were geniuses and were paid&#0160;astonishingly high salaries.&#0160; Now that the endowment has lost 30% of its value, do you plan to a) lower the salaries of endowment managers to realistic levels,&#0160;and b) ask them to recompense the university for their absurd&#0160;past overcompensation ?&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Yours, Vivian de St. Vrain &#0160;(Ph.D. 1966)&#0160;</p>
<p>I didn&#39;t expect an&#0160;answer, but after several months, I received the following letter, which, truth to tell, I regard as rather cold and perfunctory.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Thank;">Dear Dr. St. Vrain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Thank;">Although I cannot comment on matters of employee compensation, I understand and appreciate your concern for Harvard’s wellbeing. <span>&#0160;</span>Please be assured that the endowment management remains entirely focused on supporting the University’s most fundamental education and research priorities.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Drew Faust</span><br />&#0160;<br />Whoa.&#0160; Back o&#39; the hand to poor Vivian.</p>
<p>OK, that&#39;s it.&#0160; In retaliation, I&#39;m striking Harvard out of my will.&#0160;President Faust will&#0160;have to find someone else to endow that new administration building.</p>

                                <p>&quot;Physical pressure&quot; is entirely too vague -- goodness gracious, it could refer to something no more serious than a firm handshake -- and as a result it&#39;s impossible even to guess what&#39;s being euphemized. &quot;Abuse&quot; is similarly hazy. Verbal abuse?&#0160; Spousal abuse? Gosh, it&#39;s hard to say. &quot;Harsh methods&quot; and &quot;harsh tactics&quot; offer more of a clue, except that nowadays the word &quot;harsh&quot; can be used semi-comically, as in the teen-age &quot;oh, that&#39;s harsh.&quot; You don&#39;t want inadvertent comedy when you&#39;re inventing prize-winning euphemisms. But &quot;harsh&quot; has more heft when used in combination with other adjectives, as for example &quot;harsh interrogation methods&quot; and &quot;harsh interrogation techniques.&quot; The three-word phrases sound as though they&#39;ve been translated from the original German, always a plus when language is being corrupted. &quot;Rough treatment&quot; is not very imaginative. I definitely prefer &quot;abusive treatment,&quot; and &quot;abusive techniques.&quot; &quot;Coercive interrogation&quot; has a nice ring -- and it leaves a lot of room for the imagination. &quot;Brutal treatment&quot; and &quot;brutal methods of interrogation&quot; -- well, what&#39;s the point? Once you start using words like &quot;brutal&quot;, you might just as well just abandon euphemism altogether and say &quot;torture,&quot; for goodness sake. &quot;Enhanced interrogations&quot; and&#0160; &quot;enhanced interrogation techniques&quot; effectively combine euphemism and bureaucratese. It&#39;s a stroke of genius to take the word &quot;enhanced,&quot; which ordinarily denotes an improvement, and transfer it to the world of thumbscrew and electric shock. &quot;Enhanced&quot; is much more effective than its alternative &quot;extreme,&quot; as in the widely used but colorless &quot;extreme interrogation methods.&quot; My personal favorite is &quot;advanced interrogation techniques,&quot; in which the word &quot;advanced,&quot; customarily employed to describe progress in civilization, has been thoroughly perverted to refer to primitive, barbaric practices. &quot;Advanced interrogation techniques.&quot; Now that&#39;s what I call a world-class euphemism! Credit another success to our government and to our compliant journalists.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>

                                <p>I couldn&#39;t bear Rick Warren.&#0160; I have no tolerance for the unctuosity of preachers, and Rick&#0160;busted all&#0160;standing&#0160;records for unctuosity.&#0160;&#0160;I thought he was entirely too Christian -- if there is one event that should be absolutely ecumenical, it&#39;s an inauguration.&#0160; Also embarrassing was Elizabeth Alexander&#39;s poem -- poetry by the yard, absolutely prosy, undistinguished, predictable, and read in such a pretentious I-am-a-poet-all-hail-poetry-and-me voice that&#0160;I had to leave the room.&#0160; The&#0160;Perlman-Yo-yo Ma thingy left me cold.&#0160; Why not play some proven piece of celebratory music,&#0160;especially since Aaron Copland had already&#0160;made a major work out of&#0160;&quot;simple gifts.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;Three cultural low points, as far as I am concerned, but all of them redeemed by Aretha Franklin&#39;s hat.&#0160;Praise&#0160;to Luke Song, its designer, and all&#0160;hail the queen of soul,&#0160;the queen of hats,&#0160;and also the&#0160;absolute and utter&#0160;triumph of&#0160;undiluted, unparalleled African-American churchladyness.&#0160;The hat made the whole day worthwhile.&#0160; </p>
<p>I also liked Obama&#39;s speech and Bush&#39;s helicoptering the hell out of there.&#0160;&#0160; And wheel-chair bound Dick, who hurt his back trying to smuggle out&#0160;boxes of top-secret stuff that he should have left behind.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Hey, Barack, do you want my advice for 2012?&#0160; In a nutshell: less religion, more hats.&#0160;&#0160;</p>

<p>B&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; &quot;Ann Coulter is a Man.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;This one puzzled me a bit because it didn&#39;t say whether&#0160;Ann was born a man or had recently been surgically tranformed into one.&#0160; In any&#0160;case, I&#39;m not all skeptical about the accuracy of the assertion.&#0160;&#0160;What else&#0160;could account for the fact that Ann&#0160;(or Andrew, let us now call him/her)&#0160;acts and speaks like an ignorant, show-offy, foul-mouthed, testosterone-fueled teen-age boy?&#0160; </p>

                                <p>Just before pulling the blankets over me, I watched (via You Tube) the Iraqi journalist wing not one but both his shoes at the Duck Most Lame. Not much of an arm, I thought, but a symbolic act of courage nevertheless. A few hours later, waking from troubled sleep, I realized that my dreamatorium had been working overtime. I had imagined a White House press conference where at a signal all the correspondents, led by Helen Thomas herself, unzip, untie, unvelcro and hurl whatever was on their feet at the Great Incompetent. He weaves and bobs, takes one on the shoulder.&#0160; Everyone is on board but Fox, whose &quot;correspondents&quot; lace up even tighter. Next&#0160; thing you know, regular citizens start packaging pairs of old shoes and mailing them to &quot;W, The White House, 1600 Pennsylvania.&quot; Huge mounds of shoes fill a nearby warehouse; the secret service refuses to estimate the total but reporters guess fifty cubic yards. Someone creates a Facebook application &quot;One Million Strong to Hurl Shoes at George W.&quot;&#0160; Everyone visiting El Lamo is now asked to remove shoes before meeting with him; but then, what do you know, people start throwing their smelly socks. I dreamed of political buttons: &quot;I&#39;m Shoeless for George.&quot; And songs: &quot;I Threw A Shoe at You Know Who.&quot;&#0160; A website springs into existence: send ten dollars from anywhere in the world and we&#39;ll leave a pair of old shoes at the front gate of the White House. It&#39;s a democratic movement: all shoes are equal. Sneakers, loafers, Blahniks, boots, moccasins, babouches, buskins, pattens, galoshes, scarpines, clogs, air georges. A protest movement with real soul.&#0160; &#0160;</p>

                                <p>Sam Cooke&#39;s &quot;A Change is Gonna Come&quot; condenses centuries of tangled racial strife into a brief lyric. The song begins in rural, impoverished, perhaps southern, America: &quot;I was born by the river, in a little tent.&quot;&#0160; Then, with a glance at the old man river who just keeps rolling, it alludes to African-Americans as on-the-lam outsiders: &quot;Just like the river, I&#39;ve been running ever since.&quot;&#0160; The third stanza, now shifted to an urban location, refers specifically to the insult of segregation (shortly before writing the song, Cooke had been barred from a Shreveport hotel): &quot;I go to the movies and I go downtown;/ Somebody keep telling me, don&#39;t hang around.&quot; The second stanza is surprisingly confessional for a man who had started his career in gospel and had sung lead for the Soul Stirrers;&#0160; it&#39;s about loss of faith. &quot;I don&#39;t know what&#39;s up there, beyond the sky.&quot; Nevertheless, despite all the reasons for losing heart, including the lack of support from brothers of different political factions, Sam retains an uncompromisIng optimism: he will &quot;carry on, yes I will.&quot; The song is a miniature allegory of a triumph over separation and persecution. It celebrates endurance, perseverance, fortitude in the face of long odds.No wonder that Barack Obama adapted Cooke&#39;s affirmative &quot;Yes I will&quot; into &quot;Yes we can.&quot;</p>
<p>Sam Cooke himself didn&#39;t get to the promised land; he was shot, under &quot;mysterious circumstances&quot; in December of 1964. &quot;A Change is Gonna Come&quot; was released posthumously.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I&#39;m enchanted that our new president chose to cite -- or &quot;sample&quot; as they say in the world of pop music -- one of my favorite, and one of the most important of the songs of the 1960s. Here&#39;s the borrowed sentiment, delivered in Chicago on November 4, just after Obama cleared the electoral hurdle: &quot;It&#39;s been a long time coming, but tonight, because of what we did on this day, in this election, at this defining moment, change has come to America.&quot; The big O&#39;s citation is to the refrain of Sam Cooke&#39;s great anthem, &quot;A Change is Gonna Come&quot;: &quot;It&#39;s been a long time coming/ But I know a change gonna come, oh yes it will.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>Those who know their Sam Cooke will appreciate Obama&#39;s sentence. To the Cooke-innocent, the &quot;change&quot; is a new administration and new policies. To the Cooke-knowledgeable, the &quot;change&quot; to which Obama refers is a tectonic shift in American racial politics.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>So I&#39;m reproducing Sam Cooke&#39;s lyric right here.&#0160; If you&#39;re one of my coevals, you probably know the song by heart. If you don&#39;t know it, you should. If you&#39;re curious, you can see and hear Sam and Otis Redding and a host of others sing the song on You Tube. Here&#39;s the lyric.&#0160; It&#39;s one great, inspiring song.&#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;I was born by the river in a little tent</p>
<p>And just like the river I&#39;ve been running ever since.</p>
<p>It&#39;s been a long time coming.</p>
<p>But I know a change is gonna come.</p>
<p>It&#39;s been too hard living, and I&#39;m afraid to die.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know what&#39;s up there, beyond the sky.</p>
<p>(refrain)</p>
<p>I go to the movie and I go downtown</p>
<p>Somebody keep telling me, don&#39;t hang around.</p>
<p>(refrain)</p>
<p>I go to my brother, I say help me please,</p>
<p>But he winds up knocking me down on my bended knees.</p>
<p>(refrain)</p>
<p>There&#39;s been times that I thought I couldn&#39;t last long,</p>
<p>But now I think I&#39;m able to carry on.</p>
<p>It&#39;s been a long time coming,</p>
<p>But I know a change is gonna come, o yes it will.&quot;</p>
<p>Talk about the ability to say a lot in a little.&#0160; O yeah!</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Today&#39;s essaylet is being composed thirty thousand miles above ground, somewhere over, it appears from up here, Utah. I&#39;m flying on Southwest Airlines, the Trailways of the sky -- no frills, no food, no nothing. No passengers to speak of, either. Big ol&#39; three-quarter-empty jet plane. &quot;Nobody&#39;s flying nowadays,&quot; a stewardess told me. Chalk up another one for W.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">Air travel was in its florid adolescence when I was a boy. Propeller-driven planes flew over Flatbush every two minutes on their way to Idlewild (latterly JFK). But not with me or anyone I knew on board. I can&#39;t imagine who traveled by plane in those days -- probably only the Filthy Rich, certainly no one from the old neighborhood. In the late 1950s, I remember hearing rumors that there were Cornell undergraduates so wealthy that they regularly made the journey from NYC to Ithaca in the air (while I crawled upstate on a smelly Greyhound that left the Port Authority at midnight and made &quot;rest stops&quot; at East Stroudsburg, Scranton and somewhere in the southern tier before arriving on Aurora Street at 8 in the morning). My very first airline flight (it was on an expense account) took place in 1960 on a 12-passenger Mohawk from Ithaca to NYC. I was one wide-eyed gawker, let me tell you. There were very few flights for me during the 60s but by the 70s, I was more prosperous and air travel became semi-routine. Airlines had once been an upper-class preserve, and there was still some leftover graciousness, especially on the long haul to Europe. Menus and decent food and complimentary wine. But little by little, flights became more expensive and less elegant. Is it my imagination or have they magically shrunk the size of the seat? I recall a particularly bad run of luck when I was routinely placed in a middle seat, surrounded on both sides by plump widestance armrest-hogging smokers.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&#0160;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">The extinction of the cigarette is a plus, but it&#39;s hard to think of another improvement. Nothing to look forward to<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> air-travel-wise </span>but &quot;consolidation,&quot; fewer flights, smaller seats, negative frills, and grubbier planes. The great age of the airplane has gone the way of the steamship and the railroad. No more dress up, no more glamor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> Just as well, I think, or would be if the decline of service were reflected in a decline of prices. <br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&#0160;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">There&#39;s no </span>first class on Southwest<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span>-- although what would it matter to me? I never once sat in a first-class seat -- not a single time. In fact, in all honesty I must admit that I indulge a bit of class resentment that there should be any distinction of classes. Although I wouldn&#39;t mind if someone offered me something more gracious than one of those nasty mini-bags of over-salted pretzels -- the kind&#0160; you have to be an experienced safe cracker to break into.</p>

                                <p>I&#39;m jubilant that, come January 20, we&#39;ll once again have a president whose brain waves are dancing, who can bring an English sentence to completion, and who understands that America consists of much more than the Bushian roster of Fortune 500 executives, evangelicals, know-nothings, high school dropouts, gay-bashers, neocon imperialists, dittoheads, gun nuts, military contractors, upward redistributionists, fetus-worshipers and health insurance profiteers. The new president will abandon the present system of government (trust the market -- capitalism is always right!) and return us to the world of evidence and reason. Quite the revolution, isn&#39;t it?&#0160; And speaking of revolutions, the new president, if you haven&#39;t heard, is black (or to be more accurate, black-and-white, which is this country still means, in defiance of all logic, black). How splendid to bury a long-standing racial taboo. Nothing makes me prouder than that we&#39;ve elected an African-American, Kenyan-Kansan president. With a brain.&#0160;</p>
<p>The election of Barack Obama brought me back to hometown Brooklyn of sixty-one years ago. I was eight years old on April 15, 1947, when Jackie Robinson &quot;broke the color barrier.&quot; It was Jackie on first or Jackie running the bases that alerted me to the idea that I lived in a conflict-riven society. We (family, friends, neighbors, writers for the <em>Brooklyn Eagle</em>) were enthusiastic about Jackie, but there were those reactionaries and bigots in other cities who were convinced that their world had just come to an end. No question but that the advent of Jackie Robinson was the major formative political experience of my early childhood -- even though it was decades before I could fully appreciate its cosmic significance.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>In my mind, and I think in the minds of others of my generation, there&#39;s a direct line from Jack Roosevelt Robinson to Barack Hussein Obama. Two smart, skilled performers; two ferocious but very cool competitors. Two very courageous gentlemen.Two barriers busted all to smithereens.Two milestones in American history. Never the latter if hadn&#39;t hadn&#39;t been for the former.&#0160; &#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Jackie&#39;s fabulously athletic body fell apart early and he died young of diabetes. He was born in 1918, and if he had been blessed with longevity, he would have been ninety years old today.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>Wouldn&#39;t that have been a pretty picture -- Jackie Robinson, frail, gray, stooped, leaning on his cane, but still in possession of that marvelous knowing glint in his coal black eyes, sitting right there on the platform in front of the United States Capitol, a tear on his cheek while Barack Obama holds up his hand and swears to protect and defend the constitution of the United States of America. I see it oh so clearly in my mind&#39;s eye. It gladdens my fond old heart.&#0160;</p>

                                <p>The Republicans have voluntarily transformed themselves into a regional and agrarian party. If the Democrats play it as it lays, they have the opportunity to create a permanent Democratic majority -- permanent into the foreseeable future, that is.&#0160;</p>
<p>McCain was the candidate of a geographical region, not of the nation. How many votes did the Arizona Jekyll/Hyde senator win that were outside of the old Confederacy (reminder: the Confederate States of America were, in order of their secession, South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Texas, Arkansas, North Carolina, Virginia and Tennessee. The &quot;border states&quot; of Missouri and Kentucky did not legally secede but were allied with the Confederacy)? These states constitute the heart of McCain&#39;s support. Of his 162 electoral votes, 113 came from the southern pocket.&#0160; he rest came from the otherworldly Mormon states of Utah and Idaho (9 votes) and from impoverished agrarian states, many of them suffering from declining populations, such as the Dakotas, Nebraska, Kansas, and Montana. In the entire country, the only areas where McCain in 2008 ran ahead of Bush in 2004 were some of the all-white rural counties in the old confederacy and Oklahoma and an occasional retrograde county in undeveloped western Pennsylvania and West Virginia. If anyone in America found Palinity appealing, it was people in the poorest, least educated parts of the continent&#0160; -- and also in the atypical Alaskan kleptocracy.</p>
<p>The Democrats made inroads into the new old south because northern Virginia&#39;s Washington suburbs and the research triangle area of North Carolina have joined the new century, and because Florida is a haven for northeastern migrants.&#0160;</p>
<p>The Democrats are the party of the future: multicultural, educated, international, young, high-tech, entrepreneurial, secular. The Republicans are the part of the past:&#0160; geriatric, racist, melanin-deprived, Bible-thumping, rural, poor, less well educated. Their day is over and gone.&#0160;</p>
<p>The &quot;pundints&quot; (as McCain calls them) want Obama to govern from the middle. I agree, except that I think that he should govern from the middle of New York, New England, the upper middle west, and the far west -- not a middle somewhere between Virginia and Mississippi. Obama should make an effort to educate the denizens of the American backwater, but if it&#39;s necessary to drag them kicking and screaming into the 21st century, then so&#0160; be it. But the United States of America can no longer allow itself to be shackled to a mean, recalcitrant, atavistic, pre-Darwinian southland.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not longer red state versus blue state. It&#39;s all blue except where it&#39;s all white.</p>

                                <p>My election day was much like that of many Americans, I betcha. In the morning, out walking the neighboring precincts, to knock on doors and rouse up the occasional procrastinator. I was greeted for the most part by enthusiastic thumbs-up Obama voters but also by apologetic laggards whom I forced to swear holy oaths that they would hustle down to the polling place &quot;right now.&quot; I encountered one sour young woman who told me that she was so tired of being urged to vote that she was sorry that she had voted. I was on good behavior and did not respond that there was a lot more at stake than her convenience. Later in the day, after the mandatory septuagenarian nap, I talked with a candidate for county commissioner and together we made a last check of the polls. Then to a downtown restaurant where partisans had gathered to await the results. I was nervous as a cat when at first Virginia showed up in the red column and I couldn&#39;t relax until Ohio came in blue. Then, moderately joyful, off to a friend&#39;s house to watch the long parade of blue states. Lots of shouting and applause. At last the polls closed on the California coast and the US was once gain in the care of a person with brains, education, and values that I could recognize. Then home to watch McCain gracefully concede and Obama accept. Broken sleep, but this morning up early to search the archives for the flag and the flagpole. Right now Old Glory, looking might relieved and cheerful, is flying above all the Obama/Biden and Dem yard signs. A great lift to the world&#39;s spirits, and to mine.&#0160;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>These last few weeks, I've been reading political news obsessively.&nbsp; Not just the NYTimes and the WaPo, but the left-wing blogs as well:&nbsp; Politico and Daily Kos and HuffPo and TPM.&nbsp; I follow the local political gossip on ColoraoPols.&nbsp; I check the latest polls on Pollster and 538, searching for trends and differentials.&nbsp; Worse still, I'm up in the middle of the night almost every night:&nbsp; what's the latest news from North Dakota, Montana, Florida?&nbsp; I keep up to date on senatorial and house races all over the country especially where the red candidate is a horror or is running a particularly loathsome campaign:&nbsp; Dole, McConnell, Bachmann, Sununu, etc.&nbsp; My days (and my nights) are no longer my own. </p>

<p>I'm not the only one.&nbsp; Many of my friends are doing the same thing.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Not without reason.&nbsp; I believe that the republic is at stake.&nbsp; If McCain/Palin is elected, I fear for the century and for the country and for the planet.</p>

<p>On days when I do something for the Dems (knock on doors, deliver those flyers that they presume to call &quot;literature,&quot; fold-and-stuff) I sleep better.&nbsp; But I won't be at peace until Virginia is in the Democratic column.&nbsp; Only then will I breathe easy.&nbsp; Who knows, maybe I'll be able to get through the night without logging on to the internet to learn exactly how many points Obama is ahead in PA according to Gallup and Rasmussen and Harstad and CBS.</p>

<p>I ran into my friend Mike S. a few days ago.&nbsp; He had just been to the doctor about his high blood pressure.&nbsp; While he was all wired up he started chatting with the nurse about Sarah Palin.&nbsp; His blood pressure shot up 40 points.</p>

<p>I wonder what's going on with mine.&nbsp; </p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>An &quot;orphan precinct&quot; is one that lacks a regular committee and chair. We have one nearby, and I&#39;ve been recruited to walk the neighborhood and deliver GOTV flyers to registered Dems. I&#39;m natively shy and I hate knocking on doors, but there are votes to be had and lordy-mercy don&#39;t we need every single one. The neighborhood in question is near to the university, high-density, undergraduates mostly -- 98% of the people on my lists are under 25 years old. But the squalor! Here are these beautiful old 1910s and 1920s arts and crafts bungalows, or the remnants of them, and they&#39;ve been allowed to go to seed, or way past seed -- bricks unpointed, wood unpainted, porches sagging, screen doors ripped and hanging off.&#0160; And then the beer cans, the cigarette butts, the newspapers that have been decaying in their plastic sleeves for half a year. Garbage strewn everywhere, foul odors. It&#39;s disgusting, an affront to the decent citizenry. Who are these children?&#0160; How can they live in such cisterns of filth?</p>
<p>I was working myself up into quite a fit until I started to think about the conditions in which I lived when I was in college, back there in the just-barely-post-diluvian 1950s. I didn&#39;t drink alcohol, even then, or smoke cigarettes, but I lived amongst as much dirt and disorder as any modern undergraduate could manage. When I concentrate my mind, I remember the floor of my room littered with every garment I possessed. Every sock and every shirt grey with dirt, sweat, food droppings. I remember an ancient tattered rug that was not swept or vacuumed a single time in two consecutive semesters. I remember a bathtub that was so foul that it was shunned by the roaches. And am I right (my apartment mate Otis J. Brown might be able to confirm this) that we found two hundred empty Coke bottles strewn around Terry Cannon&#39;s room <u>after</u> he had cleaned up and moved out. And also that our back stairs were littered with a thousand dog droppings, around which we maneuvered in and out, not thinking that such pollution was a circumstance that we might think to remedy.</p>
<p>Is it possible that these degenerate kids are no filthier than their venerable grandfathers? Gives one pause. Well, who cares, really, just so long as they get their pathetic drunken butts in gear and vote for Obama.</p>
<p>Incidentally, for anyone who cares: I&#39;m now compulsively neat and cleanly.</p>

                                <p>Out here in the west, social services are administered by the county commissioners.&nbsp; At a candidate forum last night, libertarians running for commissioner opposed a .05% (i.e. a penny on a $20 purchase) extension of a sales tax that would go to support battered women, the alcohol recovery facility, mental health, walk-in clinics for the poor, etc.&nbsp; &nbsp;The libertarian argument: &quot;charity&quot; should be voluntary.&nbsp; When the government collects taxes, it will be elected officials not &quot;the people&quot; who decide which &quot;charity&quot; to support. </p>

<p>It's a truly grotesque argument.&nbsp; Of course elected officials (democratically-elected officials) decide.&nbsp; Its their job;&nbsp; we've delegated it to them.&nbsp; We elect officials to to decide how to spend all public revenue.&nbsp; What exactly is the problem?</p>

<p>Moreover, I know of not a single instance in which a complex society such as ours has been able to support the less able and less fortunate with strictly private charity.&nbsp; It hasn't happened and it's certainly not going to happen soon.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Is private giving morally superior to public intervention, as the libertarians assert?&nbsp; I don't know that it is.&nbsp; Most of us express our commitment to the general welfare by paying our share of the burden.&nbsp; </p>

<p>I can only conclude that the libertarians, at least the ones that I heard last night, live in an alternative and wholly theoretical universe.&nbsp; They're in thrall to a foolish and impractical ideology -- one that renders their actions unintentionally hard-hearted and cruel.&nbsp; </p>

<p>And what makes them so damn angry, intolerant and insulting?</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Although I'm not a particularly sociable individual, I have friends all over the U.S and a few in other parts of the planet.&nbsp; I have friends of various interests and complexions and ethnicities and ages and of both (or all) the genders.&nbsp; Although religion is said to be great divider, and I'm not in any sense a believer, I have maintained rewarding and intimate relationships with people who are regular churchgoers -- even with some who are devout beyond ordinary devotion.&nbsp; But there's one class of people with whom I share no friendships -- I have not a single friend who is a Republican.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

<p>I don't that think it's merely a question of opportunity or proximity.&nbsp; I think that there are such fundamental differences between the way Republicans and Democrats see the world that it's nearly impossible to create a basis for friendship between the two groups.&nbsp; A while back, we traveled to Bulgaria.&nbsp; There were some thirty people in the group, who, within a day or two, had sorted themselves into two distinct clans. In the bus: Repubs together, Dems together.&nbsp; In the restaurants, same thing.&nbsp; Walking, talking, visiting the museums and archaeological sites -- the same.&nbsp; It was a clear case of mutual affinity and mutual repulsion. </p>

<p>There were no overt political discussions, no debates on the issues. What, then, were the cues to which we (and everyone else) responded?&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

<p>At heart, I think, It's the difference between those who see the world as necessarily competitive and those who think that it can be cooperative.&nbsp; The crucial sign is the way that people think of money and taxes.&nbsp; As soon as someone started to talk about his money, I became wary.&nbsp; When the same person complained about his taxes, I knew that he was never going to be my friend.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>A Republican responds positively to a candidate who announces that he's going to let people &quot;keep more of their own money in their own pockets.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;The phrase &quot;your own money&quot; gives me the willies.&nbsp; I don't think that anyone makes money on his own -- he makes it because there's an enormous public investment over many hundreds of years that has created&nbsp; the opportunity to &quot;make money.&quot;&nbsp; Our taxes have supported this titanic effort.&nbsp; I think that the&nbsp; standard of living of many Americans -- certainly of those who can afford to travel to Bulgaria -- is high enough that they can think about improving the living standard of others,&nbsp; and stop thinking first of their own pockets.&nbsp; People who have enough and yet continue to prioritize their pockets are simply selfish.&nbsp; </p>

<p>It's the difference between a Hobbesian universe -- a war of all against all -- and a universe in which competition is no more real than altruism.&nbsp; &nbsp;Republican electioneering is designed to appeal to the worser side of human nature, not the better, the more community-minded side.</p>

<p>Hobbes believed that men were so depraved and competitive that they required authoritarian government to keep them in check.&nbsp; Is that why Republicans are so tolerant of government intrusion into their personal lives?&nbsp; And why they profess liberty but continue to fall in love with simplistic heavy-handed nationalists?&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Rutherford B. Hayes, whose biography (by Hans J. Trefousse) I have just read, was a an intelligent, well-meaning, but not very imaginative president.&nbsp; It's a blemish on his record that he compromised his principles and allowed ex-Confederate leaders in the southern states to install Jim Crow policies that would take a hundred years to undo.&nbsp; He should have fought much harder.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Hayes' most famous sentence dates from his 1877 inaugural address: &quot;He serves his party best who serves his country best.&quot;&nbsp; It's an admirable principle -- and one that that has been thoroughly violated by Mr. Bush and the pack of clowns and schmegeggies that he has installed to ruin our government.</p>

<p>After Hayes left office, he wandered to the political left.&nbsp; Although as president he had intervened to crush the railroad strikes, he later came to believe (according to Trefousse) that &quot;the taxation system was unfair, taking a much smaller share of the estates of millionaires than of ordinary people.&quot; &quot;The real difficulty,&quot; Hayes wrote, &quot;is that vast wealth and power reside in the hands of the few and unscrupulous.&nbsp; Hundreds of laws are in the interest of these men and against the interest of the workingmen.&nbsp; Lincoln was for government of the people.&nbsp; The new tendency is for government 'of the rich, by the rich, and for the rich.'&quot;&nbsp; </p>

<p>These are words of remarkable pertinence.&nbsp; It woult appear that we haven't moved very far from the mark -- the more shame to us.&nbsp; If Hayes had said these same words today, he would not doubt have been accused of fomenting &quot;class warfare.&quot;&nbsp; (Class warfare: redistributing money from rich to poor.&nbsp; Normal state of affair (not class warfare):&nbsp; taking money from the poor to give to the rich.)</p>

<p>Otis, I'm sorry to say,&nbsp; does not grasp the precedent.&nbsp; Of course he's not a rocket scientist, because he's not educated or practiced in that difficult field.&nbsp; However, he is certainly qualified, by the principle of expertise by proximity, to become the head of NASA, for which position I urge him to immediately apply, especially if he attended high school with Sarah. </p>

<p>Is each and every Alaskan equally qualified to be Vice President?&nbsp; Of course they are, but with a caveat.&nbsp; Those who live in the western part of the state are obviously more knowledgeable and are to be preferred to dwellers in the Alaskan interior.&nbsp; Eastern Alaskans have not achieved more significant expertise by proximity than what would prepare them to serve as trade representative to the Yukon, or perhaps, ambassador to Canada.&nbsp; </p>

                                <p>Sarah Palin is like Jesse Ventura; she's a &quot;novelty&quot; governor.&nbsp; Every once in a while, Americans like to stick it to the pols by electing an amateur.&nbsp; It shakes things up for a while.&nbsp; Sarah Palin is a joke, but now McCain has endangered our beloved nation by taking her seriously. Here's a scenario:&nbsp; McCain is elected, he dies or is taken out by a conspiratorial maniac, and there's a dangerous small-minded, uneducated, right-wing fringe religious-bigot demagogue in charge of the nuclear stockpile. </p>

<p>Governing is the most difficult of all arts, and yet Americans seem to think it's a snap.&nbsp; When you take your car in to be fixed, you want an experienced, knowledgeable mechanic, not, not an actor or an athlete.&nbsp; I'm yet to meet a person who wants his impacted wisdom tooth treated by a citizen dentist.&nbsp; But to run the government -- let's just hire anyone at all.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

<p>I'm reading Milan Kundera's excellent novel, <em>The Joke</em>.&nbsp; It's set in 1950s Czechoslovakia, and like all novels of the communist era, portrays a world in which the government is in the hands of mediocre people chosen and promoted not for brains, wisdom, or talent but for ideological orthodoxy.&nbsp; t's a system that's doomed to failure, but it's exactly the system that has now been imposed on this country by the Bush administration, which regularly hired graduates of Patrick Henry and Liberty --ideologically pure right-wing colleges -- over applicants of genuine distinction.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Republicans oppose affirmative action when it works to the advantage of the underrepresented, but they are its greatest proponents when it comes to political correctness.&nbsp; Major examples (there are zillion minor ones) are such disasters as Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, Justice Clarence Thomas, and now likely Vice President Sarah Palin.</p>

                                <p>What is the absolute worst catastrophe of the Bush presidency? Choose one (or more, I guess, if you can&#39;t make up your mind) or append your very own disaster.&#0160;</p>
<p>1.&#0160; The completely botched New Orleans mess (incompetent Bushies in critical offices, carelessness, implicit racism).</p>
<p>2.&#0160; The attorney-general scandal (incompetent immature Bushies in critical office, subversion of the constitution, elevation of party loyalty above loyalty to the country).</p>
<p>3.&#0160; Compromising of the civil service (appointments based on ideology rather than merit, suppression of informed opinion).</p>
<p>4.&#0160; War on the environment (incompetent Bushies in high places, suppression of scientific evidence, politicization of science).</p>
<p>5.&#0160; Torture -- or &quot;enhanced interrogation techniques&quot; -- of suspects (subversion of the constitution, illegal legal memos, clandestine government).</p>
<p>6.&#0160; Collapse of housing market (under regulation, false optimism, indifference, atavistic economic policies).</p>
<p>7.&#0160; Skyrocketing of national debt (tax policy favorable to the very rich, war on the cheap).</p>
<p>8.&#0160; Medical policy that rewards insurance companies, penalizes patients and doctors.</p>
<p>9.&#0160; Collapse of the dollar.</p>
<p>10&#0160; Energy policy (secret, favorable to big oil, indifference to conservation).</p>
<p>11. Iraq war (endless, fraudulent, expensive in treasure and lives, counter-productive).</p>
<p>12.&#0160; Failure to capture Bin Laden (stupidity, obsession with Iraq).</p>
<p>13.&#0160; Compromising of the judiciary (appointment of loyal Bushies, extreme right-wingers, ideologues).</p>
<p>That&#39;s my top thirteen,&#0160; but I&#39;ve drawn it up without much thought, off the top of my head.&#0160; I&#39;m sure that I&#39;ve left out some big ones.&#0160;</p>

                                <p>Hatemongering right-wingers have been using Obama's name to attack him.&nbsp; It's only-slightly-disguised bigotry.&nbsp; Obama sounds like Osama, Hussein is the late, unlamented&nbsp; dictator, while Barack is strangely foreign and rhymes with Iraq.&nbsp; It's primitive tribalism --a way of calling Barack &quot;foreign&quot; or &quot;un-American&quot; without actually using the words.&nbsp; Although Obama generally calls himself &quot;Barack Obama,&quot; foxnewsistas and McCain surrogates like to chant, &quot;Barack Hussein Obama.&quot;&nbsp; You can hear them waiting for the audience to hiss.</p>

<p>In response, supporters of Obama have adopted Hussein as their own middle name. There's a good article in <em>The New York Times:&nbsp; (</em>June 29, 2008: &quot;Obama Supporters Take his Name as their Own&quot;).&nbsp; &quot;I am sick. of Republicans pronouncing Barack Obama’s name like it was some sort of cuss word,” one commentator&nbsp; wrote in a manifesto titled “We Are All Hussein.”</p>

<p>So today, Vivian de St. Vrain joins the movement and proudly announces that henceforth the proper designation is &quot;Vivian Hussein de St. Vrain.&quot;&nbsp; It has a nice lilt, doesn't it?&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

<p>Go Blue!&nbsp; Go Dems!&nbsp; Go Barack!&nbsp; Yes we can! Yes we can! </p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>My Internet consultant, who is forty-something years old, signed me up on Facebook.&nbsp; He said that I needed to understand how communication takes place between young folk in the modern era.&nbsp; He also thought that I should assemble some Facebook friends.&nbsp; </p>

<p>He himself concedes that in Facebook years he is an oldster.&nbsp; &quot;You're on Facebook?&quot; say his astonished junior colleagues and employees, not shy to hint that he's a bit long in the tooth for an activity so totally 'with it' as social networking.&nbsp; Hey, what about ancient me?&nbsp; A generation and an electronic revolution older, I allow my pre-Cambrian self to be Facebookized.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>It's a new world.&nbsp; A &quot;Facebook Friend&quot; is not to be confused with a real friend.&nbsp; In the traditional universe (mine), relationships were either intense or diffuse.&nbsp; You can enjoy a few important relationships or spread yourself over many -- say, twenty or thirty -- that are superficial.&nbsp; It's taken me a lifetime to acquire and sustain a very small number of genuine, intense friendships.&nbsp; But young people seem to diffuse their emotional attachments, as I discovered by browsing the Facebook site.&nbsp; They form networks of three or four hundred or eight hundred fellow Facebookers.&nbsp; No doubt but that these young folks possess memories far more retentive and perspicuous than mine -- but what can it mean to have relationships that number in the hundreds?&nbsp; &quot;Facebook Friend&quot; can signify nothing more than someone whose path has crossed your own sometime, somewhere.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Nevertheless, it's intriguing to be in instant communication with a more-or-less compatible cohort.&nbsp; I must say, however, that there are practical limits to the grandparental Facebookish experience.&nbsp; Real friends of my own years not only suffer from limited computer literacy but are natively grumpy and therefore indifferent to social networking.&nbsp; They're basically Internet hermits.&nbsp; When I stumble upon the page of coevals who are Facebookers (perhaps, like me, because a young friend or grand-daughter took pity on their Facebooklessness), what generally appears -- along with a generic subsitution for an actual photograph, which they don't have the skills to post -- is a dispiriting message such as &quot;Frank has no friends.&quot;&nbsp; As a result, almost all of my &quot;Friends&quot; are a generation or two younger than I -- which makes me feel pseudo-youthful but also as though I've crashed the party but I'm not dancing. </p>

<p>I tried an experiment.&nbsp; I solicited (is that the word?) Friendship with Zoe, just entering our local university and whose father I've known since 1969.&nbsp; She has not &quot;confirmed me.&quot;&nbsp; I also approached, timidly, Sam K., who's in high school abroad.&nbsp; I've been good friends with his grandparents for most of a lifetime.&nbsp; Sam also declined to confirm me.&nbsp; (&quot;Confirm&quot; -- the proper Facebook locution -- seems both too religious and too 'rite of passage' for me.)&nbsp; I also tried Rebecca M., a junior in college -- no confirmation.&nbsp; Is it possible that these young people don't want one of Gramp's friends to know who's writing what on whose Wall?</p>

<p>There seems to be some sort of competition among Facebookers to acquire the most Friends.&nbsp; I'm as competitive as the next guy, but, handicapped by my years, I'm stuck at thirty-five Friends, which is absolutely zip zilch in the galaxy of Facebook amical achievement.&nbsp; Moreover, I must confess that one of those thirty-five Friends is a 6&quot; foam donkey named Lefty who is the miniature mascot of a Democratic consulting firm.&nbsp; Zooming ahead, Lefty has left me to choke on his donkey-dust.&nbsp; The&nbsp; donkey has one hundred and twenty-four Friends, all of them, no doubt, intimate. </p>

                                <p>The new clerk at the local Aubuchon has a green Mohawk.&nbsp; The non-Mohawk part of his head is clean-shaven.&nbsp; The clerk looks to be about twenty years old.&nbsp; &nbsp;He couldn't tell me in which aisle to find a S-hook.</p>



<p>I'm surprised but not offended by the Mohawk.&nbsp; I wonder, though, how the would-be clerk dressed for his interview?&nbsp; Did he come in full war paint, or did he secure the job looking like Joe HighSchool and then later switch to the foppish hairstyle?&nbsp; Or was the regional manager, or whoever pulled the trigger on the hiring, more tolerant than your run-of-the-mill mid-level corporate executive.&nbsp; Hey, maybe green Mohawks don't cut into profits?&nbsp; I'd guess so, but perhaps I'm wrong.&nbsp; Vermont's a tolerant state.</p>

<p>Unlike tattoos, Mohawks can be ephemeral.&nbsp; In six week, green Mohawk guy could revert to being plain old Thurston Sleeper.&nbsp; But a green Mohawk is a curious, labor-intensive affectation.&nbsp; it takes work to keep it erect and keep it green.&nbsp; To me it says that the clerk is far more interested in making a fashion statement than in doing his job.&nbsp; He's in the epater le bourgeois business -- but it's M. Bourgeois who's going to come to the hardware store searching for just the right kind of wood chisel.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

<p>When we first came to this town, back in 1968, Aubuchon was the second-line hardware store.&nbsp; Everyone who wasn't just passing through shopped at locally-owned Gove and Morrill, which carried three or four times the number of items as Aubuchon, including all the hard-to-find stuff that nowadays you can only locate on the Internet.&nbsp; Moreover, Bart Morrill and Lester Wakefield knew how to fix everything.&nbsp; Not only would they gladly learn and gladly teach, but they had a bit of a machine shop in the basement and would whip up the odd part when necessary.&nbsp; Now they're both long gone and so is their store and the new guys at the Aubuchon don't know nothing&nbsp; -- although they're gussied up in ways that Bart and Lester could never have dreamed.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>The new waitress at The Perfect Pear sports the usual nose ring but she also displays a hefty piece of bone in her left ear lobe.&nbsp; It looks, to the unsophisticated eye, like the tooth of a small shark. </p>

                                <p>A new and useful word is &quot;greenwash,&quot; which is what happens when a can of ozone-destroying chemicals comes to be decorated with cute bunnies. Corporations have perfected this kind of propaganda: it&#39;s cheaper to portray the company as green than to cap that smokestack.</p>
<p>The Bushies have brought greenwashing to politics and given us Clear Skies (which clears the skies of birds) and Healthy Forests (which would more accurately be called Healthy Seedlings, because that&#39;s all that remains after the forest has been clearcut).</p>
<p>Anti-environmental candidates frequently cover themselves in greenwash. Here&#39;s a particularly flagrant example. Former U. S. representative Republican Bob Shaffer, who scored just 5% on the League of Conservation Voters&#39; scale and has been targeted as one of 2008&#39;s &quot;dirty dozen,&quot; is running for an open Senate seat in Colorado. In addition to being in Jack Abramoff&#39;s pocket, Shaffer supported the Cheney-led initiative that gave $33 billion in tax breaks to big oil. He opposed incentives for developing alternative fuels and dug in his heels against fuel efficiency standards for automobiles.</p>
<p>Schaffer was Vice President of an oil company, Aspect Energy.&#0160; Here&#39;s his brief biography on Aspect&#39;s website.</p>
<p>&quot;Bob Shaffer is Vice President for business development at CHx Capital, LLC, where he is involved with a variety of energy, mining and education projects. Additionally, Bob is actively involved in international business development activities for Aspect Energy, including sourcing and development of international oil and gas exploration opportunities for the Company.&quot;</p>
<p>Hold on.&#0160; That <em>WAS</em> his biography until a couple of days ago. Now that he&#39;s been nominated for the Senate, his history has been greened up. Here&#39;s the substitute paragraph:&#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;Bob was involved in a variety of wind power investments, international energy opportunities, and education projects. Bob worked to improve the US Wind Industry. Specifically, he worked to increase entrepreneurial opportunities for small business owners by ensuring that wind-specific tax credits could be utilized indirectly by wind developers classified as small business owners. Bob helped educate Congress about the benefits of wind power including its positive impact on the environment, job creation, and its importance in making the United States less dependent on foreign sources of oil.&quot;</p>
<p>Truly amazing. One day he&#39;s prospecting for foreign oil;&#0160; the next day he&#39;s a fanatical supporter of windpower.</p>
<p>Ooh, ooh, ooh, what a little greenwash can do.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>We’re in Alameda, California, for ten days, visiting the grandchildren and also their parents. The big news here is that the Alameda public schools are in a money crunch. The root cause is Proposition 13, the granddaddy of pernicious tax-limiting amendments (we have one in Colorado, too -- it’s paralyzed us). The immediate precipitant of the Alameda crisis is Governor Schwarzenegger’s plan to balance the budget by cutting brazillions of dollars out of the education budget. Public-spirited citizens in the island city have responded by proposing a supplementary “parcel tax” -- most people say property tax –- of $120 per &quot;parcel&quot; of real estate to help the school district survive these dark days. To me, the tax supplement is an imperfect but obvious fix.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span>Public schools must be supported, and if the state shirks its responsibility, local effort must ride to the rescue.&#0160;</p>
<p>There’s the usual testy opposition: too much fat in the budget; teachers are overpaid; school board is incompetent; bad planning. I know enough about public education&#39;s lean diet not to be swayed.</p>
<p>What gets my goat is that some of the arguments against the supplement are just plain mean. Here’s an example. A local curmudgeon named Guy Smith has written a guest opinion in the Alameda Journal under the heading: “Make Parents Pay for Child’s Education,” His gist: “It is no longer appropriate to tax childless homes for public education.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> And also:&#0160; p</span>eople who support such taxes suffer from “collectivist mentalities.&quot;</p>
<p>And here I thought that the American constitution had in its preamble a phrase about promoting the “general&quot; and not just the individual welfare. No doubt<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span>Mr. Smith would stigmatize Madison and Jefferson as early collectivists.</p>
<p>The argument that the childless need not contribute to education is flimsy<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span>-- so slight that it’s hard to believe that it’s argued in good faith and is not just a rationale for skinflintism. Does Mr. Smith think that he shouldn’t pay for the fire department or the police department, except on the days that he happens to use them?</p>
<p>Does he think that he doesn’t profit from the educational system because he has no children in school. He can read and write. Did he teach himself?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span>He’s sitting at a computer, designed by someone with an education. His chair and his table and his coffee and the cup out of which he drinks his coffee were designed or planned or imported or constructed or distributed by people who could read and write and figure. Take away the learning of his predecessors and members of his own age-cohort and Mr. Smith would be out there chasing squirrels with a flint hand-ax. And whining about the cost of the clan-supplied flint.&#0160;</p>
<p>The essence of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span>Mr. Smith’s argument is selfish and narcissistic<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span>-- “I’ve got mine – you take care of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span>yourself.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span>It’s shallow, vulgar libertarianism.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a shame that these nay sayers need to be reminded that we’re all in this together. We’re interconnected -- a tissue of tessellations.</p>
<p>Even Mr. Smith must know, deep in his heart, that when he promotes the general welfare, he improves his own lot.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> In fact, the </span>parcel tax will be the best investment he’ll ever make.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>At the precinct <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2008/02/what-happened-i.html">caucus</a> last month, I was chosen to be a delegate to the county assembly.&nbsp; The assembly is where we Dems nominate candidates for county-wide offices (and do a lot of other business, using procedures that are obscure to veterans and incomprehensible to first-time attendees).&nbsp; Yesterday, we filled the Skyline High School auditorium with 1600 delegates, at least three-quarters of whom were young, impatient pro-Obama initiates.&nbsp; It was exciting and even more chaotic than usual.</p>

<p>All of the local Dem incumbents were re-nominated without opposition, but there were some open and contested seats: a state senator, a university regent, and, the big one, a congressman (our longtime representative Mark Udall is making a run for the U. S. Senate).&nbsp; And also the Clinton-Obama showdown, but that event wasn't held at the morning county assembly but reserved for the afternoon county convention, to which I was not credentialed.</p>

<p>I was in place at 7:15 A.M, handing out leaflets and stickers for Rollie Heath, a candidate whom I'm supporting for state senator.&nbsp; Politicking inures you to rejection.&nbsp; Some delegates for the other candidate, Cindy Carlisle, wouldn't accept my piece of paper; they acted as though it would compromise their integrity to read or even to touch my pamphlet.&nbsp; Sometimes they were downright and inexcusably rude, even though we're all Dems and all in the same family. </p>

<p>The new attendees didn't seem to realize that before we could get to Obama, we had to carry out the business of local government.&nbsp; I heard occasional grumbling and a lot of puzzlement and confusion.&nbsp; But in compensation there were some rousing addresses:&nbsp; Ken Salazar, our middle-of-the-road Senator, adapting to his audience, emphasized his liberal side.&nbsp; I'm skeptical of Salazar, but better a centrist Democrat than a benighted Republican.</p>

<p>Eventually we voted.&nbsp; The morning results were predictable.&nbsp; My candidate for state office came in second but qualified for the party primary, which is in August.&nbsp; The race will be a marathon.&nbsp; But the good news is that whoever wins the nomination won't have a Republican opponent -- the other side is punting on state senator.&nbsp; The Repubs are also surrending the congressional seat, where Fitz-Gerald won over Polis;&nbsp; there will be a three-way Democratic primary (Shafroth is &quot;not going the caucus route&quot; but petitioning on -- I said that it's&nbsp; complicated).</p>

<p>In the afternoon, Obama had a smashing 3-1 win over Clinton.</p>

<p>Here's the million-dollar question:&nbsp; will the Obama enthusiasm carry over to the general election?&nbsp; Will the young 'uns who turned out yesterday still be around in October to donate, to walk the precincts, stuff the envelopes, make the phone calls?&nbsp; Or are they just in it for the glamor of the moment?&nbsp; Colorado's now in play; it's a swing state.&nbsp; We could go blue. But not unless Bush-disgust, Obama-love translates into weeks and months hard work.</p>
