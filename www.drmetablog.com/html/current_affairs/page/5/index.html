		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>It&#39;s election season once again.&#0160;I&#39;m thinking of making a run for city council in our progessive western town. Here&#39;s my new platform, voters.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>1.&#0160; NO LEAF BLOWERS.&#0160; Rationale: it&#39;s a horrible noisy unecological machine that can easily be replaced with a broom.&#0160;And everyone knows that single-stroke engines are major polluters.</p>
<p>2.&#0160; ALL MALL PERFORMERS MUST BE JURIED.&#0160;Rationale:&#0160;no more off-key singing.&#0160;No more bad juggling.&#0160; No more ugly balloon animals.&#0160;No more noisy drummers or whining didgeredoos.</p>
<p>3.&#0160; EVERY RESTAURANT MUST KEEP A PIG.&#0160;Rationale:&#0160;a perfect. ecologically-sound solution to the waste food problem.&#0160;Come to think of it, let&#39;s require a piggery of all institutions with lunchrooms, such as high schools and hospitals.&#0160;Let&#39;s fatten up those porkers, turn them into bacon and savory spare ribs.&#0160;</p>
<p>4.&#0160; NO &quot;HOLIDAY&quot; LIGHTS.&#0160;Rationale:&#0160;waste of electricity and other scarce resources.&#0160;Global warming. Bad taste.&#0160;Bad theology.&#0160;Bauble-olatry.&#0160;</p>
<p>5.&#0160; NEW ANNUAL HOLIDAY:&#0160;Charles Darwin&#39;s birthday, February 12.&#0160;Rationale: uncontroversial celebration of a great thinker.&#0160;(I reject out of hand those extremists who propose to celebrate Darwin&#39;s birthday on December 25.&#0160;I&#39;m a uniter, not a divider.)</p>
<p>6.&#0160; NO MUSIC WRITTEN AFTER 1897.&#0160;Rationale:&#0160;obvious.&#0160;Why 1897?&#0160; Death of Johannes Brahms. Also, no amplified music of any kind in an automobile that is audible outside the vehicle.&#0160;Higher fines and jail terms hip hop and for excessively patriotic &quot;country.&quot;&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>7.&#0160; NO SMOKERS.&#0160; Rationale:&#0160; lung cancer, heart attacks, emphysema, ashes, disgusting odor, cigarette litter.&#0160;Note:&#0160;not &quot;no smoking&quot;-- &quot;no smokers.&quot;&#0160;No going outside of city limits to light up and then re-entering.</p>
<p>8.&#0160; NO VISIBLE TATTOOS.&#0160;Why only &quot;visible &quot;tattoos?&#0160; Because whole-body inspections might be&#0160;considered intrusive by squishy civil libertarians.&#0160;Also, no nose rings, navel rings,&#0160;or other bodily piercings.&#0160;Except earrings.&#0160;I rather like earrings. But no more than&#0160;one per ear.&#0160;</p>
<p>9.&#0160; ANNUAL JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL PRAIRIE DOG SHOOT AND BARBECUE. Let&#0160;them kids exercise their Second Amendment rights;&#0160;eliminate them pesky varmints;&#0160; learn to cook. One platform position, three social benefits.</p>
<p>10. NO DOGS PERMITTED WITHIN CITY LIMITS.&#0160;Rationale:&#0160;fatal dog attacks, dog bites, barking dogs, whining dogs, ubiquitous dog &quot;waste,&quot; dogs carrying on in parks and open space, the goopy indulgence of dog &quot;guardians,&quot;&#0160;the ecological disaster of dog food.&#0160;But what about seeing-eye dogs, you ask?&#0160; Well, that&#39;s a slippery slope, ain&#39;t it.&#0160;Sorry folks, no dogs (except for purposes of vivisection). &#0160;</p>
<p>11.&#0160; NO MORE COLLEGE FOOTBALL.&#0160;Rationale:&#0160;I don&#39;t like college football.</p>
<p>12.&#0160; NO &quot;FACILITATORS&quot; WITH WHITEBOARDS OR FLIPCHARTS AT OFFICIAL MEETINGS.&#0160;Goodness gracious, do I ever hate those things.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>That&#39;s about it.&#0160;I feel that I have my finger on the pulse of the electorate.&#0160;It&#39;s going to be a landslide.&#0160;Tell me that life won&#39;t be better as soon as we enact these new laws.&#0160;</p>

                                <p>HRC, who is essentially a centrist Democrat, is widely perceived as a divisive and polarizing figure. Why so?&#0160; Because she&#39;s a woman, because she&#39;s married to Bill, but mostly because&#0160; for twenty years now, unscrupulous Republicans have been investigating, castigating, and smearing her. Is there a more vilified politician in the world? She&#39;s a murderess, a lesbian, an adultery-enabler, a frigid bitch... etc. etc.&#0160;</p>
<p>Barack Obama is not perceived as a divisive and polarizing figure, but only because Karl Rove and his cruel band of conscienceless propagandists haven&#39;t yet gone to work on him. I guarantee that right at this very moment there&#39;s a room full of &quot;conservative&quot; operatives who are brainstorming the most vile imaginings about Obama. Think Willie Horton, think swiftboat. They are forging documents, photoshopping pictures; they&#39;re developing sick fantasies about Obama&#39;s sex life, his wife, his children, his parents, his patriotism, his education, his finances, and certainly, his religion. Don&#39;t dare to imagine that racism is dead; the Rovistas will give it new life.&#0160;</p>
<p>And don&#39;t think that you are able to anticipate the attack. It will be disgusting beyond anything that ordinary people are capable of inventing. And it will be cloaked by 527s or disseminated anonymously or leaked.&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>And then Obama too will become a divisive and polarizing figure.&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>The big news is that our caucus drew unprecedented hordes of voters.&nbsp; Our site is the local elementary school.&nbsp; We're a &quot;super-site&quot; -- seven precincts in one building.&nbsp; In the past, we'd have ten or a dozen or at an absolute maximum thirty attendees per precinct.&nbsp; Tonight, at 7pm, when we were supposed to come to order, there were still long lines of folks of all ages waiting patiently to register. Eventually, the super-site drew 707 people! When our precinct was finally able to get organized, there were an astonishing 129 people in the room -- breaking all records by a multiple of four or five.&nbsp; We voted 92 for Obama, 37 for Clinton and we divided our delegates 4-2.&nbsp; &nbsp;It was exhilarating to see so many unfamiliar young faces.&nbsp; It was also, as dem events are likely to be, chaotic, amusing, and enthusiastic.&nbsp; </p>

<p>I asked new attendees what brought had them out.&nbsp; I received two answers.&nbsp; Most frequently, George Bush, who, I was told, has driven the country into a ditch, broken the treasury, ruined the civil service, shredded the constitution, exhausted the military, ruined the environment, packed the judiciary, fought a senseless unnecessary, and endless war, and put loyalty to his wing of the party ahead of loyalty to the country.&nbsp; The second reason:&nbsp; Barack Obama.&nbsp; No question but that Obama has given people in our precinct new hope.</p>

<p>My conclusion:&nbsp; Colorado is looking good for the Democrats in November.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Diligent readers of this blague will recall that last January, I made a series of daring forecasts about the year 2007.&nbsp; It's now time to review my projections and evaluate my record.&nbsp; I'm proud to say that a panel of independent experts has confirmed that I hit the jackpot.&nbsp; I scored an 8 out of 8, 100%, A+.&nbsp; I'm now a fully accredited prophet.</p>

<p>These were my 2007 predictions:&nbsp; </p>

<p>&quot;1)&nbsp; there will be unusual weather patterns in North America;</p>

<p>2)&nbsp; a famous Hollywood actress will sue for divorce;&nbsp; moreover, another (or possibly the same) Hollywood star will become pregnant; another (or possibly the same) actress will gain and lose a great deal of weight;&nbsp; </p>

<p>3)&nbsp; a well-known athlete will be accused of taking drugs;</p>

<p>4)&nbsp; a politician will be involved in a sex scandal;</p>

<p>5)&nbsp; questions will be raised about America's food supply;</p>

<p>6)&nbsp; there will be either a monsoon, an airplane crash, or a capsized ferry in Asia--perhaps all three;</p>

<p>7)&nbsp; there will be fluctuations in the stock market, and, finally, </p>

<p>8)&nbsp; there will be turmoil in the Middle East.&quot;</p>

<p>Did I score big-time,or what?&nbsp; Note especially #4.&nbsp; How did I know that &quot;wide-stance&quot; would become a household phrase?&nbsp; &nbsp;Boggles the imagination.&nbsp; Moreover, stock market fluctuations have been greater than even I could have hoped for (same with Mideast turmoil).&nbsp; Concerning athletes and drugs, just think &quot;Barry Bonds&quot; and &quot;Mitchell Report.&quot;&nbsp; I knocked that one out of the park. </p>

<p>Is everyone ready for my 2008 predictions?&nbsp; </p>

<p>I'm staying with 1-8.&nbsp; But I'm going out on a limb with #9:&nbsp; &quot;A religious leader will be involved in either a financial or a sexual scandal (perhaps both).&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;And #10:&nbsp; &quot;Questions will be raised about the accuracy of the vote count.&quot;</p>

<p>You read it here first.&nbsp; Loyal readers: check back at the end of 2008.&nbsp; Let's see if Dr. M. can top his scintillating successes of 2007.&nbsp; </p>

                                <p class="EC_MsoNormal">In 1895, my grandparents wisely left the abysmal, backward Ukraine and struck out for the new world. Nine years later, my father was born in a cold-water flat in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn. The date of his birth: December 22, 1904, exactly at the winter solstice. &quot;And they called his name, Emanuel, God with us.&quot; If he had been born in the old country, before the Russian authorities imposed legal cognomina upon us, he would have been named Emanuel ben Isaiah--his father&#39;s name appended to his own as a patronymic.</p>
<p class="EC_MsoNormal">Despite his traditional moniker and his commitment to the essence of Judaism, my father was fiercely hostile to the irrationalities of religion. His view -- and my grandfather Isaiah&#39;s even more strongly--was that for a thousand years our lineage had been kept in poverty and darkness not just by the czars but also by the rabbis. In politics, my father and grandfather began as socialists and became New Dealers; in philosophy, they rejected theological doctrine and were among the children of the enlightenment whom Moses Mendelssohn had led to the promised land of evidence and reason. I doubt that any of my ancestors knew Karl Marx&#39;s sentence that &quot;the criticism of religion is the beginning of all criticism,&quot; but they acted as if they had absorbed it from the cradle. My brothers and I were taught to resist religious exclusivity, superstition, and ceremony.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p class="EC_MsoNormal">We now have a religious controversy in our peaceful, progressive, and largely secular western town. A group of orthodox Jews have petitioned the city council for permission to construct an <em>eruv</em>. What is an <em>eruv</em>?&#0160; It’s a “symbolic boundary that allows orthodox Jews to carry things, including their own children, outside their home during the Sabbath.&quot; (Carrying is considered work, and orthodoxy&#39;s strict interpretation of religious law prohibits any sort of sabbatical labor.) A latter-day <em>eruv </em>is constructed out of fishing line that is strung on utility poles; curiously, it may incorporate functioning electric and telephone wires.</p>
<p class="EC_MsoNormal">I know that my forbears detested <em>eruvim </em>and similar expressions of irrational piety. I myself am not enraged by these useless but harmless superstitions.&#0160; Constructing an <em>eruv </em>does not endanger our species; it&#39;s not like opposing contraception or prohibiting stem-cell research. An <em>eruv </em>consoles the believers and doesn&#39;t much bother the rest of us. Yet if there is a spirit in the sky, which I very much doubt, I would hope that he would not be so small-minded as to issue ukases about carrying infants on Saturdays; infants should be carried as much as they want, which is just about everywhere and always. And if any god were so narrow as to promulgate an inside/outside-the-home rule, I would hope that he would be intelligent enough not to be flummoxed by such transparent trickery as hanging mylar filament on poles.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p class="EC_MsoNormal">I have no intuitive conception of god, but I think that the orthodox trivialize our shared longing for transcendence when they sanctify such petty practices. It would be far more pious for the orthodox to take every nickel spent to appease the Ancient of Days and bestow it on a poor Jewish family from Tashkent.&#0160; If these folks can&#39;t locate eligible Jews, there are Hondurans and Sudanese a-plenty who deserve their attention. When the orthodox re-direct their enthusiasm and their resources toward truly charitable enterprises, they will honor the universal immigrant experience and they will also practice the very worthy Jewish virtue of compassion. Constructing an eruv is a foolish waste of time and fishing line.</p>
<p class="EC_MsoNormal">Here&#39;s my father&#39;s view:&#0160; &quot;It took us hundreds of years to fight our way out of the ghetto and they want to put themselves back in jail. If the rabbis had their way,&quot; he would say, &quot;Mahler and Bernstein and Gershwin would play accordion in a klezmer band in Bialystok, Einstein would balance the books for a caftan maker in Kiev, and a hundred and fifty Jewish Nobel Prize winners would spend their days davening in some dirty dim synagogue in Vilna.&quot;</p>
<p class="EC_MsoNormal">I think it’s in a Wallace Markfield novel that an old Jewish guy confronts a group of twenty-something Jewish hippies/slackers in Miami Beach. After a heated discussion, he admonishes them:&#0160; &quot;And don&#39;t ever be ashamed that you’re Jewish. It’s enough that I’m ashamed that you’re Jewish.&quot;</p>
<p class="EC_MsoNormal">Which is pretty much how I feel about the <em>eruvistas</em>. Well, not exactly ashamed. Embarrassed, perhaps, by their superstitious infatuation with the &quot;dark backward and abysm of time.&quot;&#0160;</p>

                                <p>It&#39;s public knowledge that Bush recently underwent a colonoscopy, but the doctors&#39; reports have not been widely disseminated. It appears that, in addition to the polyps, way up high, lodged against the pyloric sphincter, was found the entire head of Attorney-General Alberto Gonzales. Until this discovery, it was not generally known that Gonzales&#39; head was missing; according to received Washington wisdom, it was only his brains. A second smaller mass, puzzling at first, has now been definitively identified as the nose of Senator Joseph Lieberman (I-Conn).</p>
<p>(August 16)&#0160; Spike Schapiro adds: &quot;Not the whole story. Bush&#39;s head was also found in there. It had been missing since late in his last term as Texas Governor.&quot;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>In the previous post, I recorded two archetypes of &quot;Loyal Bushies&quot; -- the <strong>Moronotron</strong> and the <strong>Henchdoofus. </strong>Here&#39;s another one.</p>
<p>The <strong>Spoiled Rich Prick</strong>. Typically, the SRP attended boarding school at Phillips something-or-other or at St. Somebodies in New Hampshire. Although he learned nary a thing, and his SATs were under 1000, he was admitted to Yale (which his father, grandfather, and great-grandfather attended) and in his senior year was tapped for membership by Numskull and Boners. The SRP went on to study at the Harvard Business School, where he graduated dead last in his class. Although eligible for the draft, through his father&#39;s influence he was able to secure a place in the National Guard, from which he was frequently absent-without-leave.&#0160; For a decade or so after Harvard, the SRP was distinguished for booze, cocaine and drabbing. Friends of the family set him up in a business, which failed, and then bought him out for many millions. Then the SRP&#39;s father decided that he was too incompetent to enter the family business, so he had him elected governor. He still holds high political office and is famous for his laziness, rhetorical incompetence, anti-intellectualism, partisanship, ignorance, truculent stubbornness, petulance and bonehead errors in matters of national consequence.&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="color: #3333ff;">Spike Schapiro comments:&#0160; &quot;Thanks for this portrait. I guess you had Dan Quayle in mind.&quot; </span></p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Here are two types of &quot;civil&quot; &quot;servants&quot; prominent in the Bush era.</p>
<p>A.&#0160; The <strong>Moronotron.&#0160;</strong>Just under 30 years old, he/she (let&#39;s say she) comes from a large family of home-schooled children, five of whom are still active in the LifeForce Harvest Church of Milan, Ohio, pastored by the Reverend Mike. Family trauma (one of her brothers committed suicide; another had to be disowned when he moved to San Francisco with his friend Gabe; that her mother recently entered alcohol rehab has only strengthened her faith. She graduated from Brethren College, where students and faculty bask in an &quot;authentic relationship with the Lord,&quot; with an honors degree in Christian Communication. After Brethren, she attended law school at Regent University, where she chaired the debate team and counseled pregnant teens. She was making fundraising calls for the Santorum campaign in 2004 when she was offered the position of assistant undersecretary for policy in HHS -- her roommate&#39;s cousin was a fraternity brother of a &#39;prayer partner&#39; of Lynne Cheney&#39;s aunt Sylvia&#39;s husband. As White House liaison, she &quot;relayed&quot; information from the President&#39;s &quot;closest advisers&quot; to the Secretary. Now undersecretary of HHS, she oversees 160,000 employees and a budget of 800 gajillion dollars. She is unmarried and doesn&#39;t date, enjoys Fruit Loops, and someday, when her life is less busy, hopes to travel to third-world countries to bring good news to the unenlightened.</p>
<p>B. The <strong>Henchdoofus.</strong>&#0160;He is now close to 60, a graduate of the Chadron State College in Chadron, Nebraska, with a degree in marketing. At Chadron, he captained the cheerleading squad and made a complete recovery from the illnesses (depression, fatigue, etc.) that made it impossible to for him serve in the military during the Vietnam era. He joined Exxon Mobil right out of college. He had worked his way up to a moderate-sized cubicle when he left to head up Patriotic Americans For Clean Energy (wholly funded by Exxon). PACE lobbied for a &quot;balanced approach to offshore oil drilling.&quot; In 2000, President Bush appointed him chair of the Advisory Council of the Food Safety and Inspection Service. In 2001, he founded a K Street lobbying firm called ACS Associates which had as its principal client the American Melamine Council. ACS (from which his wife Christine continues to draw a $30,000 monthly stipend) is often credited with the resurgence of profits of both the melamine and the pet-food industries. He was recently appointed Undersecretary for Nutrition Policy in the Department of Agriculture. He&#39;s a dedicated environmentalist and hunter, and enjoys the wilderness in his SUV, his ATV, and especially in his Arctic Cat Panther 360 snowmobile equipped with an ATN 24x75LU peak performance titanium night vision telescope mounted on a Remington X-40 high-powered assault rifle.</p>

		<a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2007/04/novelists_must_.html">A Bad Case of Irony Overload (IO)</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>O m&#39; god. I&#39;m having a serious attack of Irony Overload. This is no joke. In the last few days, the news has been saturated with extreme instances of Natural Irony. It&#39;s dangerous stuff. Left unchecked, you know, IO can progress to Morbid Cynicism (MC), which is terminal. The cases to which I refer are not your run-of-the-mill family-values preacher caught pants-down with a male prostitute. These are more colorful, more exotic performances.</p>
<p>Paul Wolfowitz, World Bank prexy and ferocious campaigner against corruption and nepotism, &quot;directed&quot; that his very own girlfriend or house mate or whatever she might be called, be hired at a handsome tax-free salary at a State Department agency where she&#39;s to be guaranteed superior evaluations and inordinately large salary increases. It&#39;s a variety of cronyism that we can call &quot;nepotistical irony.&quot;</p>
<p>Another: Robert E. Coughlin, deputy chief of the criminal division of our very own US of A Department of Justice, which is overseeing the investigation of Jack Abramoff, suddenly needs to spend more time with his family when investigators scrutinize his financial relationship to Kevin Ring, an Abramoff stooge. What are the odds? The investigator supervising his own investigation! There&#39;s enough irony in this story to fill a barrel with monkeys or, alternatively, an industrial size hen house with packs of famished foxes. And there&#39;s more to the story. Last year, the very same Robert E. Coughlin received, at the hands of Alberto Gonzalez himself, the highly coveted Attorney-General Award for Fraud Prevention.</p>
<p>And just yesterday, when I thought that my IO index couldn&#39;t rise any higher, Global AIDS Ambassador and Deputy Secretary of State Randy (actual name!!) Tobias, a big abstinence guy and the overseer of a program designed to help men in poor countries &quot;develop healthy relationships with women&quot; resigned &quot;for personal reasons&quot; when it was revealed that he had been regularly dialing up an &quot;escort service&quot; that sent shady ladies to his home.&#0160; Asked &quot;if he knew any of the alleged call girls,&quot; Randy replied that in &quot;he didn’t remember them at all. He said it was like ordering pizza.&quot; Women are like pizza?&#0160; To a man whose mission is &quot;to help men in poor countries develop... etc., etc.&quot;&#0160; In the face of such a revelation, how&#39;s an ordinary guy supposed to keep Morbid Cynicism at bay.&#0160;</p>
<p>By the way, Randy T. has chosen to go with the Ted Haggard defense. Yes, he frequented prostitutes, but not for sex, only for massage.</p>
<p>So here we go again, dear readers. Pop quiz, multiple choice. Your back is hurting and you need a massage. Whom do you call?&#0160; Two choices:&#0160; a) massage therapist, or b) a notorious madam.</p>
<p>If you answered A, you win a lifetime membership in the Committee to Stamp out Morbid Cynicism.&#0160; If you answered B., you receive a lucrative patronage appointment in the Department of Justice plus a secret e-mail account with the Republican National Committee.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>OK, it&#39;s time to get going. Could we put the house lights on, please. Here&#39;s the first question. Raise your hand if you think that the loss of 5.000,000 e-mails by the White House was simply an accident. That it was unintended. Anyone?&#0160; Yes, I see a couple of hands in the back, and there&#39;s someone here on the left. I guess most of you think it was &#39;accidentally-on-purpose.&#39; Fine. OK now, here&#39;s another question. The White House claims that Karl Rove didn&#39;t use the Republican National Committee e-mail address to bypass the records act, but just simply to keep politics and government business separate. If you believe that, please raise your hand. I&#39;m not seeing any hands at all -- oh yes, there&#39;s someone, and there&#39;s someone else near the center aisle. There&#39;s two hands -- no, I&#39;m sorry, three.&#0160; Ready for another question?&#0160; The President is willing to let his advisers talk to congressional investigators, but not under oath, not publicly, and with no transcript. If you believe that he&#39;s not trying to hide something, raise your hands, please. Did I make that question clear? Let me say it again. If the president&#39;s argument is persuasive to you, raise your hand. If you think he&#39;s just protecting himself and his advisers, keep your hand down. Hands? I see two on the left, and one there in the back. Same person as before, I think. OK now, -- next question. Karl Rove&#39;s lawyer admits that Rove systematically erased his e-mails, but only because he thought that they were preserved elsewhere. Anyone believe that one? &#0160;Please raise your hand. Nobody?&#0160; OK, there&#39;s someone down here. Sorry, I almost missed you, ma&#39;am. So we have only one person who believes that story. Ready for another question?&#0160; Attorney-General Gonzalez says that he would never fire anyone for political reasons or to interfere with an investigation in progress. Do I have any hands on that one? No, none at all?&#0160; Interesting?&#0160; I&#39;ll wait. Still nobody? Let me try another question. Anyone here believe that Gonzalez is a tool of Rove and that he does exactly what Rove tells him to do?&#0160; OK, now we&#39;re finally getting some response. I thought no one was paying attention. Looks like about two-thirds, maybe three-quarters of you. Maybe more. We only have time for one last question.&#0160; Anyone here convinced that Karl Rove is a vicious liar who deserves to hang by his thumbs in a Gitmo prison, please raise your hand. Whoa, almost everyone. Please, I can&#39;t keep count if you raise both hands. Just one hand, please. Look, shouting isn&#39;t necessary&#0160; -- I just need to count the hands. What&#39;s that you say?&#0160; I can&#39;t hear you -- there&#39;s so much noise. Oh, you think he should hang by his nuts. Very good. OK, thanks a lot, everybody. Thanks for your cooperation. That was very helpful.&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;</p>

                                <p>Why doesn&#39;t Dick Cheney put a bullet in his brain?&#0160; It would do him (and his reputation) a world of good. What could possibly stand in his way?&#0160; Once he sprinkles the ratsbane on his porridge -- and, of course, leaves behind a detailed and humble letter of apology --&#0160; he will begin to free his soul of sin and to enjoy some piece of mind. When he has fallen on his sword, his lackeys and toadies will be able to claim that while he was a black-hearted knave, at least he wasn&#39;t a shameless black-hearted knave. They can try to persuade us that although he was egregiously and dangerously wrong, he was, like another suicide, Othello, &quot;great of heart.&quot;&#0160; But if Cheney continues in his surly, obstinate, unapologetic lip-curling silence -- why then, he&#39;ll go down in the books as an unrepentant demi-devil like Iago (&quot;From this time forth I never will speak word&quot;).&#0160;</p>
<p>Cheney has brought disgrace upon our beloved nation and upon himself.&#0160; Using faked spy data, he suckered the ignorant, feckless Decider and almost the entire Congress into invading Iraq. His war has been a monumental disaster. &quot;Full of scorpions [should be] his brain.&quot;&#0160; At this moment of writing, Cheney is guilty of killing 3260 American soldiers and maiming (by official count -- who can possibly guess at the truth?) 24,314 others. If Cheney has even the most rudimentary of consciences, on it lays the heavy burden of 60,000 to 100,000 Iraqi souls. The Dickster has cost America $414 billion dollars, loss of prestige and the squandering of oceans of good will. Like Anthony, he &quot;has lived in such dishonor/ That the gods detest [his] baseness.&quot;&#0160; But Antony took the proper course. When Cheney dispatches himself -- &quot;after the high Roman fashion,&quot; let&#39;s hope -- he&#39;ll have taken the first step toward rehabilitating himself and the nation. For him not to do the deed would be ignoble.&#0160;</p>
<p>Dick:&#0160; I know that you&#39;re hunkering in your bomb-proof shelter. I know that you&#39;re up late at night, sleepless with guilt. You&#39;re cruising the internet, perchance googling &quot;Cheney + suicide,&quot; and you&#39;re wavering in your purpose. Dick -- take my considered advice. I&#39;m thinking of your place in history. At this point, &quot;you have no friend,/ But resolution and the briefest end.&quot;&#0160; You&#39;ll immediately feel better.&#0160; It&#39;s a no-brainer.&#0160; Go for it.</p>
<p><em>April 10.</em>&#0160; Spike Schapiro comments:&#0160; &quot;Dr. M. -- I&#39;ve read your exhortation to suicide and also Otis Brown&#39;s Comment (see below).&#0160; You are, as usual, falsely optimistic, but OJB is right on target.&#0160; Cheney can&#39;t off himself because a) he&#39;s shameless and b) he&#39;s a total coward, and c) he has no self-knowledge and d) he can&#39;t point a shotgun. You cite the precedents of Othello and Anthony but they&#39;re both great spirits and therefore irrelevant.&#0160; Cheney is a slug.&quot;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Just when it appears that our corporately-owned pseudo-local newspaper (the <em>Daily Camera</em>) has hit rock-bottom-nadirhood, it plummets to still another new low. It&#39;s a bottomless cistern.&#0160;</p>
<p>We&#39;re suffering through a horrid local murder. The <em>Camera </em>is covering the story with rare enthusiasm -- trying to elevate it to JonBenet Ramsey celebrity status.&#0160; (It&#39;s the Linda Damm murder. You can look it up <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2007/03/an_imperfect_mu.html">here.</a>)</p>
<p>Some days there&#39;s no news.&#0160; But that doesn&#39;t stop <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2006/10/our_local_newsp.html">Al Manzi</a> and his troops. Let&#39;s try to guess at the four-column headline on the front page of the edition of March 28. Hint: It wasn&#39;t the Iranian capture of British sailors, which might lead to a wider war in the Levant;&#0160; it wasn&#39;t AG Gonzalez kayaking the disinformation rapids;&#0160; it wasn&#39;t the Senate repudiating the Smirker by setting a deadline on Iraq. Nope. Here it is, folks. It&#39;s (drums and trumpets):&#0160;<strong>FINDING A NEW HOME:&#0160; LINDA DAMM&#39;S DOG ADOPTED BY LONG-LOST FRIEND.&#0160;</strong>Linda Damm&#39;s dog!&#0160; Excuse me, but this &quot;news&quot; is not the truth that is going to set us free. This is poverty-stricken intellectually vacant journalism.&#0160;</p>
<p>The story itself is heart-rending. One human life has been lost and several others are ruined. And our newspaper can do no better than run a report on Linda Damm&#39;s dog!&#0160; Have the publisher and his reporters no dignity, no sense of proportion, no shame? &#0160;No ethics. I&#39;m embarrassed to be a reader of this newspaper;&#0160; I&#39;m embarrassed to be a fellow-citizen of its publisher.</p>
<p>Is it true that crude, yellow, lachrymose sensationalism still sells newspapers?&#0160; I guess so.&#0160;</p>
<p><em>March 31</em>.&#0160; I received the following from Spike Schapiro, a friend of my youth.&#0160; As usual, Spike is unhappy with what I&#39;ve written.&#0160; <span style="color: #006633;">&quot;</span><span style="color: #3333cc;">Viv, you&#39;ve lost your bearings.&#0160; You&#39;ve been living in wussy Boulder so long that your brain has turned to tofu. I&#39;d heard that everyone out there was a fey vegan, but I didn&#39;t believe it until I read the Damm dog story in your local rag. Let&#39;s get this straight. Dogs are not placed in &quot;foster homes&quot; -- they&#39;re sent to kennels; they&#39;re not &quot;adopted&quot;, they&#39;re bought and sold; and they don&#39;t have &quot;guardians&quot; -- they have owners.&#0160; Have you people lost the ability to make distinctions? Do you treat all animals as if they were human infants?&#0160; The <em>Camera </em>reporter can&#39;t tell the difference, that&#39;s for sure. I have ten bucks that says that she&#39;s twenty-two years old, graduated with a degree in communication from some off-brand college (probably Bible U.), and prides herself on her &quot;spiritualism&quot; -- by which she means &quot;spirituality.&quot;&#0160; Plus she volunteers with Squirrel Rescue.&#0160; </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #3333cc;">Viv, my friend, get back to your roots! The Camera&#39;s story isn&#39;t just egregious journalism -- it&#39;s immoral trash. Try to recall the intersection of Newkirk and Coney Island, where there wasn&#39;t the luxury for such foolish, fatuous sentimentality.&quot;&#0160; </span></p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Leonardo Sciascia&#39;s laconic and precise &quot;metaphysical mystery&quot; <em>The Day of the Owl (Il Giorno della Civetta, </em>1961) is set in unwholesome, Mafia-dominated Sicily.&#0160; Captain Bellodi and Sgt. Major Ferlisi, dedicated and intelligent police officers, investigate a series of horrific crimes. Their trail leads to the local boss, Don Mariano Arena, but further searching opens the possibility that an &quot;honorable deputy&quot; and a cabinet minister also may be implicated. We&#39;ll never know the whole story -- Bellodi is recalled to Bologna and Ferlisi transferred to Ancona, and the investigation languishes.</p>
<p>In Bush&#39;s America, Congressman Duke Cunningham is convicted of accepting bribes; further investigation appears to implicate &quot;Dusty&quot; Foggo, third in the hierarchy at the CIA. It&#39;s also possible that senior White House officials might be involved&#0160; -- but Carol Lam, the efficient U. S. attorney in charge of the case, is suddenly relieved of her position. The investigation languishes.&#0160;</p>
<p>And also: Jack Abramoff is sent to jail for perjury. The trail of corruption once again appears to lead to the White House -- but the prosecutor, Noel Hillman, is offered a federal judgeship and the investigation grinds to a halt.</p>
<p>At the end of <em>The Day of the Owl</em>, Captain Bellodi, though exhausted and disillusioned, resolves to return to Sicily. He will, it seems, try again. Sciascia&#39;s unhappy novel offers a small ray of hope. It seems to say that it is wrong to succumb to hopelessness and despair in the face of political abuse. A useful moral, I think.</p>

		<a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2007/03/authorship-1.html">Another Folly: the "Shakespeare Authorship Question."</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">This guest entry was contributed by Pauline Harlem, the internationally-acclaimed author of <em>The Wonderful World of Anagrams (</em>New York, 2006).&#0160; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&#0160;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&quot;Just last week, the <em>Washington Post</em> published a pair of articles on &quot;who wrote Shakespeare&#39;s plays.&quot; The one claimed that Shakespeare&#39;s plays were written by Edward de Vere, the seventeenth Earl of Oxford; the other re-asserted the traditional view that William Shakespeare wrote William Shakespeare&#39;s plays. By juxtaposing the two articles -- one for, one against -- the <em>Post </em>is guilty of outrageous anti-intellectualism.The authorship of the Shakespeare plays is not an open question. It&#39;s as if the <em>Post </em>were to offer its readers two articles, one in support of evolution and the other in favor of new-earth creationism. Just as the matter of evolution is a settled question, so the authorship of the plays is not -- and never has been -- in any sort of doubt. The true believers who keep stirring the pot are faith-based cranks, fanatics, and conspiracy theorists who ignore the usual rules of evidence and reason.&#0160; Shame on the <em>Post </em>for giving them a voice!</p>
<p>The nay-sayers discard the historical record and ask this question: is it likely that Shakespeare, with his small-town background and (it&#39;s claimed) limited education, could have written plays that demonstrate a sophisticated knowledge of the law, the court, geography, seamanship, etc?&#0160; As to the matter of likelihood, who could possibly disagree?&#0160; Of course it isn&#39;t likely that these extraordinary plays would have been written by anyone -- but it happened nevertheless. It&#39;s also unlikely that the theory of relativity would have been developed by a civil servant in a Swiss Patent Office; it&#39;s extremely unlikely that the most transcendent music ever written would have been composed by a man who was totally deaf; it&#39;s beyond belief that an autodidact living in intellectual isolation in Madras could single-handedly recreate a big hunk of modern mathematics; it&#39;s more than incredible that a hermit-like lens-grinder living in self-imposed intellectual exile would be one of the western world&#39;s most innovative and progressive philosophers. What is &quot;likely&quot; and what actually happens are two entirely different kettles of fish -- especially when genius is concerned. Despite the unlikeliness, Shakespeare existed and he wrote plays and poems.&#0160; His name is on thirty-six of the plays and his friends and colleagues and contemporary admirers testify not only to his existence but to his accomplishments. Among the thousands of books and the corridors of unpublished manuscripts and records that survive from his time, there&#39;s not a scrap of information to hint that the plays weren&#39;t his. Not a scrap, not a jot, not an inkling, not a tittle.&#0160; Nothing.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>The fallacious claims of the Oxfordians, Baconians, Elizabethians, Rutlandians, et. al. have been refuted time and time again. Here&#39;s a representative sample of the quality of the argument&#0160; -- it&#39;s from the recent <em>Washington Post </em>article. &quot;[It&#39;s unlikely that Shakespeare wrote the plays because he] never left England -- but sixteen of the plays are set in Italy or the Mediterranean.&quot; Persuasive? In what universe must authors travel the world in order to set their plays outside of England?&#0160; Certainly not in the world of Shakespeare and his fellow playwrights. Did Christopher Marlowe travel to Malta in order to compose <em>The Jew of Malta</em> or to the Asian steppe to astonish the world with the Scythian shepherd or to Wittenberg to trouble the orthodox with <em>Doctor Faustus?&#0160; </em>Thomas Kyd never left England, but managed to startle theater-goers with <em>The Spanish Tragedy</em>.&#0160; Ben Jonson never made his way to Italy, but he had no trouble putting <em>Volpone </em>in Venice. John Ford, no traveler, set <em>&#39;Tis Pity She&#39;s a Whore</em> in Parma. John Webster&#39;s two great plays <em>The Duchess of Malfi</em> and <em>The White Devil</em> are set in Italy, a country on which Webster never set eyes. Thomas Middleton&#39;s masterpiece, <em>The Changeling</em> takes place Alicante, in Spain -- but Middleton was a Londoner who never went abroad.&#0160; And so on and on, endlessly. Like his friends and competitors, Shakespeare wrote out of books. He, and they, pillaged the literature for promising stories. If the story happened to have originated in Italy, that&#39;s exactly where it remained. The playwrights were not geographers or social historians and they created not real but literary places.&#0160; Marlowe&#39;s Germany and Middleton&#39;s Spain and Webster&#39;s Italy are no more German or Spanish or Italian than Shakespeare&#39;s Belmont is Belmontian or for that matter, W. S. Gilbert&#39;s <em>Mikado</em> is Japanese.&#0160; Did Shakespeare need to travel to Denmark to write <em>Hamlet</em> or to Vienna to write <em>Measure for Measure?&#0160; </em>It&#39;s nonsensical to think so.&#0160; It&#39;s an argument without a scrap of merit. It&#39;s not honest.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">But is it even a fact that that sixteen of Shakespeare&#39;s plays are set in &quot;Italy or the Mediterranean.&quot; Only by a stretch. Do the sixteen plays include <em>Othello, the Moor of Venice</em> -- four acts of which occur in Cyprus?&#0160; And is the argument that Shakespeare or some other author had to travel to off-the-beaten-Elizabethan-track Cyprus in order to write it?&#0160; Do the sixteen include <em>A Midsummer Night&#39;s Dream, </em>nominally set in Athens but in fact stuffed with English tradesman and English fairies?&#0160; Or <em>The Comedy of Errors</em>, which takes place, in part, in ancient Ephesus in Asia Minor. Or <em>Pericles </em>in Antioch?&#0160;<em>The Tempest </em>occurs on an enchanted island which is called Bermuda but seems to be somewhere between Naples and Libya. Would a playwright need to traverse the Mediterranean in order to bring Ariel and Caliban to life?&#0160; Is it any sort of argument that plays set in the great age of Rome (<em>Julius Caesar, </em><em>Antony and Cleopatra, Titus Andronicus, Coriolanus) </em>required a playwright to abandon his careful reading of North&#39;s Plutarch for a time-travel&#0160;trip to ancient Italy?&#0160; Shakespeare no more had to cross the Alps to write his sixteen plays than he had to board a time machine to dark age Scotland to write <em>Macbeth </em>or teleport himself to ancient Britain in order to write <em>King Lear </em>or <em>Cymbeline.</em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><em>&#0160;</em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">The author of the <em>Post </em>article knows these facts. He knows that the travel argument, and the other tissue-thin assertions that he advances, have been refuted over and over again.&#0160; But like all faith-based controversialists, he does not withdraw or concede or counter. He merely repeats and repeats and repeats, because his personal conviction is prior to and more important than either evidence or reason.&#0160; He&#39;s not conducting a legitimate search for truth; instead, he is in thrall to an irrational and deeply-held conviction. Facts will be bent to support his extra-logical hypothesis. His intellectual processes mimic the creationists, the holocaust-deniers, the flat-earthers. Such minds are not reachable -- but there&#39;s not the slightest reason for a respectable newspaper to give them space.&quot;</p>
<p><span style="color: #3399ff;">Thanks, Pauline. I couldn&#39;t have said it any better myself.&#0160; V.</span></p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>From the get-go, our internationally-renowned neighborhood scandal, the JonBenet Ramsey murder, had TV movie written all over it.&nbsp; It had upper-class sheen, infant-beauty-pageant perversity, and tantalizing whodunnitness.&nbsp; Our latest local murder lacks all such glamor.&nbsp; The characters are sad, dumb, and pathetic and, to make matters worse, everyone already knows whodidit.&nbsp; Fodder for what sort of film?&nbsp; The answer should be screamingly obvious to movie aficionados. </p>

<p>Here are the facts as they have been extensively reported locally.&nbsp; Tess Damm (note transparent symbolism of name), an in-and-out-of-trouble somewhat trashy 15-year-old, persuades her boyfriend, Bryan Grove, to kill her alcoholic and abusive mother Linda.&nbsp; Bryan obediently does the deed by stabbing Mom Damm in the &quot;throat and mouth.&quot;&nbsp; The kids, however, don't have a clue how to dispose of the body, so they stow it in the back seat of the Subaru.&nbsp; While it festers, the young 'uns cavort.&nbsp; Neighbors tell reporters that that &quot;the teens were seen coming and going at all hours of the night, 'car-surfing' through the neighborhood and blaring loud music.&quot;&nbsp; After a raucous month of celebration in which they spend the $4000 in Mom's bank account, the murderers come to the realization that it might be good idea to dispose of the evidence.&nbsp; They solicit the aid of third young malefactor.&nbsp; (Possible dialog:&nbsp; <em>Bryan:&nbsp; </em>&quot;Hey dude, want to, like, help us get rid of a, like, corpse.&quot; <em>Jared:&nbsp; </em>&quot;Cool.&quot;) They head out to the Erie landfill, but the car gets stuck in the mud and so they return home.&nbsp; The next night, they try again: they drive to a local cemetery (a stroke of pure cinematic genius!) but because the ground is frozen, they can dig only one or two feet into the ground.&nbsp; The bury the body, but, panicked that the shallow grave will be noticed, they return the next night, exhume Mom and return her to the Subaru.&nbsp; At this point, just as the story is becoming weirder than weird, an &quot;anonymous tipster&quot; notifies the police and thereby cries &quot;cut&quot; to the youthful criminals.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p>It's probably too morbid and half-baked for a broadcast TV movie, but can anyone deny that the story is made to order for Joel and Ethan Coen?&nbsp; Some typical Coen Brothers elements:&nbsp; truly sleazy characters; rampant brainlessness;&nbsp; the inability of the participants to look even a few moments into the future;  gruesome details;&nbsp; gratuitous blood and gore;&nbsp; very, very, black humor;&nbsp; and, finally, the opportunity to satirize American <em>mores</em>.&nbsp; What could be more perfect?&nbsp; &nbsp;It's a Coen Brothers world after all.&nbsp; Can the argument be taken a step further?&nbsp; The adventures of Tess and Bryan and Linda couldn't possibly have occurred until Joel and Ethan had made and exhibited <em>Blood Simple</em> and <em>Fargo.&nbsp; </em>The murder -- and the macabre and superbly noir series of actions that follow -- would not have been possible without a literary precedent.&nbsp; Once gain, Life can do no better than slavishly tread in the Footsteps of Art.&nbsp; </p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>It appears to be the case that martyrs of a certain persuasion will be rewarded in the afterlife with the ministrations of seventy-two virgins. It would take a theologian of extraordinary skill to explain why acts of violence should be rewarded with sexual indulgence. I raise a far less knotty question: if the aim is bliss, then why virgins?&#0160; Why not women of experience and expertise? Benjamin Franklin, the most practical of our Founding Fathers, was dogmatic on this nice point: shun the callow in favor of women who&#39;ve been around the block, because &quot;every Knack... by Practice [is] capable of improvement.&quot;&#0160; I think that B-Frank would agree that there is something about the virgins-for-martyrs deal that&#39;s kind of, how shall I say, impractical or counter-intuitive or even, dare I say, kinky.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a second theological conundrum. What is the reward when the martyr is herself female? I must presume that she will be blessed with seventy-two male virgins -- if not, there&#39;s a very serious afterlife asymmetry. Not to reward females who give themselves to the cause would be a statement that the culture of religious martyrdom does not support sexual equality, which I can hardly bring myself to believe. But in the case of female martyrs, the matter of sexual expertise is further exacerbated. Specifically, of what conceivable value are seventy-two knackless male virgins? If we postulate that each male virgin is good for between ten and fifteen seconds of actual intercourse, it follows that they will be consumed at the rate of four to six every minute, which means that on average a martyress, however patient, would enjoy a sum of only twelve or so minutes of pleasure (setting aside time for re-mounting and repositioning), which is surely insufficient exercise to produce a meaningful let alone heavenly experience.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>Nor will it be all that great for the male virgin at the end of the queue who has to settle for sloppy seventy-seconds.&#0160; &#0160;</p>

                                <div class="commenthead">Evangelicals all over American can relax. The crisis has passed. The Reverend Ted Haggard has been cured!</div>
<div class="commentbody">
<p>It took three long weeks, but the four ministers who were appointed to counsel the disgraced former New Life minister report that Haggard is now &quot;completely heterosexual.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>How do they know? Did he pass a test? Did they make him look at pictures of a) muscular male prostitutes, and b) fancy ladies -- and then check his arousal rate?&#0160; Did the Reverend Ted buy a new gun rack for his truck? Has he started watching NASCAR? Is Gayle pregnant again? What gives?</p>
<p>The Reverend Tim Ralph, one of the gang of four, produced the following thoroughly incoherent analysis. &quot;It was the acting-out situations where things took place. It wasn&#39;t a constant thing.&quot; I construe &quot;things took place&quot; to refer to whatever Ted did with the brawny masseur. I construe Reverend Tim&#39;s sentences to mean: &quot;Things took place when they took place. At other times, they didn&#39;t take place.&quot; Very insightful, very reassuring. But since Reverend Tim and his friends have succeeded so well and so rapidly with Haggard, don&#39;t they owe something to all the other struggling-against-their-own-gayness evangelicals (and Roman Catholic priests) out there. Shouldn&#39;t they franchise this cure? There&#39;s a huge market.</p>
<p>Some questions. A) Do the four ministers truly believe that Haggard is &quot;completely heterosexual?&quot; If they do, their knowledge of human life is shallow beyond belief. If they don&#39;t, they&#39;re frauds of a high order of fraudulence. B) Do the ministers think that we regular walking-round non-evangelicals swallow their stories? Do they care?&#0160; C) Do they think that New Life congregants believe them?&#0160; D) Are New Life congregants completely brainwashed?&#0160;</p>
<p>A skeptical note. It&#39;s reported that the Reverend Ted settled with the New Life Church for a sum of money. By the terms of the agreement, neither he nor the church are allowed to say exactly how much treasure is involved. Moreover, Reverend Ted has agreed to leave Colorado Springs. Cynical old me thinks that it&#39;s nothing more than an old-fashioned payoff: you get out of town and never darken our doorstep again, and here&#39;s a bunch of cash. Stick around and we can do nothing for you. Dollars to donuts there&#39;s a no-litigation-on-either-side agreement as well. It&#39;s all so very uplifting, so very spiritual.&#0160;</p>
<p><em>February 17.&#0160; </em>I received this jaundiced e-mail from my friend and correspondent Spike S. &quot;You&#39;re entirely too easy on these clowns. Ted&#39;s clearly bi-sexual, and he&#39;ll always be. But here&#39;s the deal they made: the ministers said, we&#39;ll declare that you&#39;re heterosexual, but only if you get out of Colorado. Their only agenda is to make sure that the mega-million dollar New Life church stays solvent, and they can&#39;t manage it if Ted&#39;s around. They&#39;ll pay for Reverend Ted&#39;s master&#39;s in psychology -- no doubt from some off-brand bible college -- and he&#39;ll take up a new career re-programming and therefore screwing up young gay fundamentalists. And what about the Reverend&#39;s drug problem?&#0160; Wasn&#39;t he a member of, what do they call it, the First Methedrine Church, or is he a Crystal Methodist? How long, anyone want to guess, before Ted falls off either or both of these wagons? I&#39;ll give him a year and a half, max.&quot;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>The Aged Parent, who&#39;s ninety-four, received a curious letter from AARP MedicalRX Plans. MedRX is the insurance company that we&#39;ve chosen to use as part of the Bush drug plan for the old folks. In point of fact, the benefit hasn&#39;t been very significant, especially since we fell into the infamous &quot;donut hole.&quot;&#0160; We pay AARP MedRX monthly by means of deductions from the Aged P&#39;s social security check.</p>
<p>The AARP letter to which I refer was neither cordial nor pleasant. It said this: &quot;Our records show that you owe $108.00 for your AARP MedicalRX Plan premium.&#0160; This outstanding amount is for premiums due before you changed your payment method to automatic deduction from your social security check.&quot;&#0160; The letter also included a threat:&#0160; &quot;Failure to pay this outstanding balance could result in the cancellation of your coverage.&quot;</p>
<p>I immediately suspected that the AARP claim to a hundred bucks of the Aged P&#39;s money was absolutely false.&#0160; We initiated payment the very first month that the plan came into effect and we always paid by deduction. There was no possibility that the Aged P was in arrears. So I called AARP MedicalRX Plans to find out the real story. First there was the usual song-and-dance: &quot;If you are calling about... Press 1.&#0160; If you are calling about... Press 2.&quot;&#0160; I pressed all the correct numbers and was put on hold for ten or so minutes. I listened to some crappy elevator music. &#0160;At last, a cheery voice.&#0160; &quot;This is Anastasia. How can I help you this morning?&quot;&#0160; &#0160;I explained the problem. &quot;May I put you on hold?&quot;&#0160; &quot;Sure.&quot; More crappy music, interrupted by, &quot;Please continue to hold. Your call is very important to us.&quot;&#0160; My call was so important that I was told it was important every twenty seconds for another ten minutes. At last, Anastasia returned.&#0160; &quot;Do you remember that last summer you received a letter saying that Social Security had sent you $108.08 in error?&#0160; Me:&#0160; &quot;Yes, I do. I had several letters from Social Security to that effect.&quot;&#0160; Anastasia.&#0160; &quot;Well, the money that Social Security sent to you was supposed to have been sent to us at AARP Rx.&#0160; It was accidentally mailed to you.&quot; &quot;I remember.&#0160; But then I wrote a check to Social Security. I returned the $108.08 to them as they requested.&quot;&#0160; Anastasia:&#0160; &quot;Well, what happened is that Social Security never sent the money to us.&quot; Me:&#0160; &quot;So then your quarrel isn&#39;t with me. It&#39;s with Social Security.&quot; Anastasia:&#0160; &quot;Exactly right. We&#39;re trying to get the money from Social Security. It&#39;s been a major confusion. We&#39;ve been working on it for months.&quot;&#0160; Me:&#0160; &quot;So then I don&#39;t owe you any money at all.&quot;&#0160; Anastasia: &quot;No, you don&#39;t.&#0160; Just ignore the letter.&quot;&#0160; Me:&#0160; &quot;Ignore the letter?&#0160; Why would you send a letter to me that you expect me to ignore?&#0160; Why am I wasting my time trying to figure out what your threatening letter is supposed to mean?&quot;&#0160; Anastasia:&#0160; &quot;Well, you&#39;re not alone. We&#39;ve sent out over a million of these letters.&quot;&#0160; Me (somewhat exasperated now):&#0160; &quot;You&#39;ve sent a million letters that you know are erroneous and misleading.&#0160; You&#39;ve threatened a million old people with loss of insurance coverage. Why?&quot;&#0160; Anastasia:&#0160; &quot;It&#39;s because the computer is programmed to automatically send out letters when there&#39;s a premium that hasn&#39;t been paid.&quot; &#0160;Me: &quot;Why can&#39;t you reprogram the computer. How hard can it be?&#0160; I&#39;m sure it would be a lot cheaper than sending out a million letters. And then you wouldn&#39;t have to deal with hundreds of thousands of telephone complaints.&quot; Anastasia (testily):&#0160; &quot;Sir, I&#39;m not in charge of the computers.&quot;&#0160; Me:&#0160; &quot;Tell me, what do you do about the old people who don&#39;t understand your letter but figure they&#39;d better pay you or they&#39;ll lose their coverage?&#0160; Do you return their checks?&quot;&#0160; Anastasia.&#0160; &quot;I don&#39;t know.&#0160; That&#39;s not my department.&quot;&#0160; Me:&#0160; &quot;Thank you very much.&#0160; It&#39;s been a gigantic pleasure talking with you.&quot;&#0160; Anastasia.&#0160; &quot;Is there anything else we can help you with today.&quot;&#0160; Me:&#0160; &quot;Can&#39;t think of thing.&quot;&#0160; Anastasia:&#0160; &quot;Have a nice day.&quot;</p>
<p><em>February 2.</em> Later, I tried to decide whether AARP Medical RX is incompetent or corrupt. It&#39;s a tough call. On the side of corruption: if they sent out a million letters and received $100 from 10% of the recipients, they would have $10,000,000 as, in effect, an interest free loan. But in theory they&#39;d have to return the money eventually.&#0160; While there would be administrative costs, it would still be a profitable gamble. On the side of incompetence:&#0160; It probably costs a dollar to print and mail a letter, so AARP has already wasted one million dollars and will squander more on time spent trying to repair the damage. That&#39;s a lot of misspent effort.&#0160; So I lean toward incompetence.&#0160; However, if in the end AARP retains the money from the old folks and also keeps the money from social security, then there would be no question but that it&#39;s conscienceless malfeasance.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I&#39;ve been staring into my crystal ball, sorting through chicken bones, tea leaves and the Tarot cards, observing the flights of birds, inspecting the entrails of sacrificed animals, and diddling with the Ouija board. Now I&#39;m ready. Here are my widely-anticipated predictions for the year 2007.</p>
<p>1)&#0160; there will be unusual weather patterns in North America;</p>
<p>2)&#0160; a famous Hollywood actress will sue for divorce; moreover, another (or possibly the same) Hollywood star will become pregnant; another (or possibly the same) actress will gain and lose a great deal of weight;&#0160;</p>
<p>3)&#0160; a well-known athlete will be accused of taking drugs;</p>
<p>4)&#0160; a politician will be involved in a sex scandal;</p>
<p>5)&#0160; questions will be raised about America&#39;s food supply;</p>
<p>6)&#0160; there will be either a monsoon, an airplane crash, or a capsized ferry in Asia--perhaps all three;</p>
<p>7)&#0160; there will be fluctuations in the stock market, and, finally,</p>
<p>8)&#0160; there will be turmoil in the Middle East.</p>
<p>There it is right on the page in black and white. No taking it back now. Eight major predictions. I know that I&#39;m going way out on the proverbial limb, but I feel confident -- not vain or proud, mind you -- of my abilities as a forecaster. Let&#39;s all remember to check back at the end of the year and see how well I&#39;ve performed.&#0160; If I come through, I&#39;ll rank up there with the true greats of the prognosticating game: John the Revelator, Nostradamus, the <em>National Enquirer, </em>and Pat Robertson.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Thoughts about Elmer Gantry, Sinclair Lewis&#39;s fraud of a preacher, were still reverberating in my brain when I read in <em>The New York Times</em> the outrageous stranger-than-fiction story about the &quot;nationally renowned evangelical preacher,&quot; Darlene Bishop. Reverend Bishop, who pastors the 4000-member Solid Rock Church in Monroe, Indiana, and has a famous-in-certain-circles TV program, apparently convinced her wealthy songwriter brother that she could miraculously cure his throat cancer. She failed to do so, he died a painful death, and now the dead brother&#39;s children are suing to reclaim a share of the estate which Darlene somehow contrived to inherit. It&#39;s a Gantryesque tale -- though one that&#39;s more sordid than even Sinclair Lewis, who hated demagogic religiosity with a rare passion, could possibly have invented.</p>
<p>I was sufficiently intrigued by <em>The Times&#39; </em>story to visit Darlene Bishop&#39;s website, where she&#39;s posted a spiritual autobiography of sorts.&#0160; Here&#39;s the crucial paragraph:&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p><span style="color: #3333ff;">Being that Darlene was raised so poor she began to try to fill the void inside of her with shopping. She bought 2 Cadillacs and 18 fur coats in one year. Finally, one day she came in from a shopping excursion and as she pulled out all the dresses to show her eldest daughter, Jana pointed to one and stated, &quot;Mom you already have that dress.&quot; Sure of herself, she replied, &quot;Oh, no I don&#39;t.&quot; So Jana led her upstairs to her closet and dug the dress out from the collection of many only for Darlene to find that she did already have one of the dresses hanging there with the tags still attached. At this, she realized it was not working. The big house, the diamonds, fur coats, collections of designer clothes, none of it was filling the emptiness residing in her inner most being. She threw herself on the floor sobbing and declared, &quot;Lord, I want more of you! I just want you. And I&#39;m going to seek you until I find my true place in the kingdom.&quot;&#0160; From then on, instead of going shopping Darlene would delve into the Word of God.</span></p>
<p>I read Darlene&#39;s conversion narrative with conflicting feelings. On the one hand, it exudes authenticity. It&#39;s so unapologetic and downright and un-literary that it can&#39;t possible be contrived. On the other hand, it&#39;s appallingly trite. Darlene doesn&#39;t experience the &quot;dark night of the soul&quot;; instead, she shops. She doesn&#39;t go through a spiritual crisis; she discovers that she&#39;s bought the same dress twice. Nor is she overwhelmed with the beauty and majesty of the Lord. &quot;Instead of going shopping Darlene would delve into the Word of God&quot;; that is to say, and I don&#39;t mean to be snide, she started to shop at a bigger and better mall. In a way, her very triteness serves as a guarantee of her authenticity.&#0160;</p>
<p>Darlene&#39;s story also reminded me, once again, that I&#39;m just not on the same wavelength as many of my fellow Americans. I don&#39;t think that either shopping or delving can give meaning to life. And yet Darlene Bishop is a celebrity of American religion, who, people believe, can perform miracles.</p>
<p>And what about Darlene&#39;s wonder-working power? In her books and on her website, she claims that she cured her own breast cancer. Did she?&#0160; I&#39;m skeptical. According to <em>The Times, </em>when Darlene was on the stand testifying under penalty of perjury, she confessed that &quot;no doctor ever diagnosed the breast cancer.&quot; Instead, &quot;she thought that she had cancer in 1986 and that it was cured.&quot; Here&#39;s a pretty howdy-do. Darlene imagined she had cancer and then imagined that it disappeared -- and on such a basis she proclaims a miracle. In my book, that&#39;s setting a mighty low threshold for divine intervention.&#0160;</p>
<p>On the website, there&#39;s nary a word about her brother&#39;s death or about the lawsuit, but there&#39;s some fine, excruciating detail about the miracle. Unlike the account of her rampant shopoholia, this story is not one bit credible: it&#39;s either delusion or fabrication -- and I think the latter.&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">I had been preaching on faith for six weeks, when one night while laying in the bed the devil said to me, &quot;If you don&#39;t stop preaching like this, I&#39;ll kill you&quot; and without hesitation, I replied, &quot;You&#39;re not big enough, devil&quot;. He said, &quot;Feel your right breast&quot;. When I felt my breast, I felt a lump the size of a silver dollar....&#0160; Soon the whole bottom half of my breast became a solid mass. The pain would be so bad some nights that I could only sleep a few minutes at a time. It was as if someone had put hot coals of fire in my breast.</span></p>
<p>Let&#39;s get this straight. Darlene experienced hot coal pain in her breast, and didn&#39;t take herself to the emergency room. She&#39;s not only a fake;&#0160; she&#39;s dangerous. What sort of example does she set to the Solid Rock congregants (and to her readers and her TV-watchers)? &#0160;&quot;Let&#39;s pause here for a Solid Rock public service announcement: if you experience excruciating pain, under no circumstances consult your physician.&quot;</p>
<p>What should you do for that burning coal feeling?&#0160; <span style="color: #0000ff;">For pain medicine, I would write down scriptures on little pieces of paper and place them in my bra.&#0160; </span></p>
<p>Are we to believe that the medieval remedies are still practiced in twentieth-century Indiana?&#0160; Egad.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">This went on for nearly four months until eventually my breast began to hemorrhage. I had to put nursing pads in my bra to prevent the blood from coming through my clothes. Some nights I would bleed all night and wake up with my gown and bed sheets covered in blood.&#0160;</span><span style="color: #0000ff;">Until one day, as I was hunched over the sink, my tears splashing into the bloody water, I heard Him speak my name in an audible voice. He said, &quot;Darlene!&quot;&#0160; I rose up and cried, &quot;Yes Lord&quot;. He said, &quot;Because you&#39;ve continued in my Word and not leaned on the arm of the flesh, as of this day you&#39;re healed.&#0160; Go! Proclaim it!&#0160; </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #003333;">David Hume, whose &quot;On Miracles&quot; is still the definitive analysis, says that when we evaluate a supposed miracle, we discount the testimony of a person &quot;who has an interest in what he affirms.&quot; Darlene has built a megachurch and a flourishing business and has inherited her brother&#39;s estate on the basis of this supposed cure. Enough said.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #003333;">But what about the Solid Rockers?&#0160; Can&#39;t they see through such palpable nonsense?&#0160; Are they mesmerized or stepfordwived?&#0160; Is there any hope that they -- and other victims of similar hocus-pocus -- will some day get their brains in gear again? &#0160;Not bloody likely.&#0160; </span></p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Sexnews from the mosquitosphere: &quot;if larvae of <em>Aedes stimulans</em> are raised at 75F, about half become males and half become females. But if they are raised at 84F, only 9F higher, they all become almost complete females.&quot;&#0160; Almost complete females?&#0160; What&#39;s the meaning of &quot;almost complete?&quot;&#0160; Either they&#39;re male, or they&#39;re female.&#0160; Doesn&#39;t the good book say that &quot;male and female created he them?&quot;</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the surprising scoop. &quot;Larvae that would have become males lack the big bushy antennae of the normal male and have mouth parts and external genitalia that are indistinguishable from those of a &quot;real&quot; female. Furthermore, &quot;feminized&quot; males have no testicles or other internal male organs of reproduction, but they do have ovaries and other internal female organs of reproduction. Some feminized males have even mated with normal males and been inseminated, but they laid no eggs.&quot;</p>
<p>All this mosquito sex science comes from entomologist Gilbert Waldbauer, author of <em>A Walk Around the Pond (</em>Cambridge [Harvard], 2006).</p>
<p>Professor Waldbauer claims to love his insects but he is unmoved by the plight of the 84F feminized males. Can there be sadder words in <em>Aedes </em>households all over the warming earth than &quot;they laid no eggs?&quot;&#0160; It&#39;s poignant, perhaps even tragic.</p>
<p>How do the mosquitoes themselves feel about attenuated antennae and awkward genitalia?&#0160; If Waldbauer had looked with a more compassionate eye, he would have noticed that &quot;normal&quot; males of the 75F variety wave their big bushy antennae and point and laugh at the feeble mini-antennae of the wannabe females. He would also have noticed that wannabe females are stigmatized and often depressed because they are so frequently picked on by &quot;normal&quot; males, who regularly direct loud, scornful, threatening whines at the antennae-impaired.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a crisis of values in mosquitoland. Many &quot;normal&quot; males are fundamentally convinced that the wannabes have made a conscious choice to mimic females and that water temperature has absolutely nothing to do with it. Some among the &quot;normal&quot; males -- the more enlightened -- propose that with the right kind of counseling and prayer, the mimics can be reclaimed. But other &quot;normal&quot; males hate, simply hate, the males who consort with the feminized wannabes. They condemn as unnatural all intercourse between the normal and the feminized, and they proclaim the actual act of insemination to be the work of the devil.</p>
<p>I myself wonder why the &quot;normal&quot; males get themselves into such a twist.&#0160; I&#39;m tempted to think that they protest too much -- that they themselves secretly lust after the feminized males.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll ask the expert, Professor Waldbauer. If he doesn&#39;t know, I&#39;ll get a second opinion. Perhaps the Rev. Ted Haggard would like to share his insights.&#0160; &#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Yesterday, we dug out our grand old American flag and flew it from the holder that I had improvised after 9/11. We flew it to celebrate two great changes: a) the Democratic triumph in Tuesday&#39;s election, which restored a bit of our faith in representative government, and b) the end of the arrogant reign of Donald Rumsfeld, the principal mover (except for the cowboy-in-chief himself) of this foolish, disastrous adventurism in the Middle East. We&#39;re hoping for a return to common sense in America, but we&#39;re not entirely optimistic&#0160; -- the guy who&#39;s in charge doesn&#39;t read, can&#39;t admit he&#39;s ever made a mistake, and takes his marching orders from a) Rove, b) his gut, and c) his narrow, parochial version of the great signifier in the sky&#0160; -- in what order of priority no one knows.&#0160;</p>
<p>Rumsfeld should have been out on his ass years ago. He had lost the respect of the soldiers, certainly of the generals, the congress, and, as we now know from the election results, of ordinary Americans everywhere. However, until yesterday he could still patronize and mystify the journalists, and he could still issue instructions to those beneath him in the chain of command.&#0160; And generals obey even when they despise the person issuing the orders.</p>
<p>In 1606, Shakespeare described the psychological relations between the generals and their civilian commander. Of Macbeth, Angus says that &quot;Those he commands move only in command,/ Nothing in love.&quot; That is, they do what they&#39;re told, but they hate doing it. Here&#39;s the full transcript of Angus&#39;s remarks: &quot;Now does [Macbeth] feel/ His secret murders sticking on his hands;/ Now minutely revolts upbraid his faith-breach;/ Those he commands move only in command,/ Nothing in love: Now does he feel his title/ Hang loose upon him, like a giant&#39;s robe/ Upon a dwarfish thief.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#39;s hopeless to expect that Rumsfeld would recognize that the mantle of Secretary of Defense hung upon him as Angus describes Macbeth&#39;s (or, as does, <em>a fortiori</em>, the presidential mantle upon its own wearer) -- there&#39;s not sufficient insight or perspective or self-knowledge around the White House these days. But <em>we</em> know exactly what Angus meant, and we know that some of our so-called leaders are nothing more than dwarfish thiefs.&#0160; &#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>(&quot;Minutely&quot; means &quot;every minute&quot;;&#0160; &quot;Now minutely revolts upbraid his faith-breach&quot; means &quot;every minute a revolt [by one of his former followers] pays Macbeth back for his own breach of faith, i.e. assassinating Duncan.)</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>It&#39;s the scandal of the month that Republican Representative Mark Foley solicited sex from adolescent male congressional pages in the same years that he headed the House Caucus on Missing and Exploited Children and made his reputation for his work on legislation targeting sexual predators.</p>
<p>Foley has been universally condemned for his &quot;hypocrisy,&quot; as well he should be. It&#39;s especially piquant that his castigation of a much-reviled-by-moralists former president has resurfaced to embarrass him and to amuse the rest of us: &quot;It&#39;s vile. It&#39;s more sad than anything else, to see someone with such potential throw it all down the drain because of a sexual addiction.&quot; What kind of rationalizing maneuvers were going in the Foley mind when the Congressman uttered these words about Bill Clinton?</p>
<p>Foley&#39;s &quot;hypocrisy&quot; is anything but unique.&#0160; Shakespeare nailed the phenomenon centuries ago. In one of his great wisdom-in-madness moments, King Lear sees beneath the surface: &quot;Thou rascal beadle, hold thy bloody hand!/ Why dost thou lash that whore? Strip thine own back;/ Thou hotly lust&#39;st to use her in that kind/ For which thou whipp&#39;st her.&quot;</p>
<p>Every few weeks or so, it&#39;s discovered that one of our very own American beadles is enthralled by the exact sin against which he inveighs. There&#39;s the anti-pornography campaigner who has accumulated some unusual apparatus in his clammy basement; the anti-vice TV preacher caught with a shady lady in a by-the-hour motel on the Memphis strip;&#0160; the anti-gay state legislator photographed dancing in a downtown bar that caters only to men; the radio talk-show host who wants to send drug-users up the river for life but is himself addicted to hillbilly heroin; the flabby propagandist for virtues who pulls all-nighters at Atlantic City blackjack tables.&#0160; ll of them are hypocrites, I suppose, but in my view &quot;hypocrisy&quot; is a label that has no explanatory value.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not as though people set out to become hypocrites. It&#39;s not an aspiration or a chosen career path. There&#39;s no Hypocrisy 101.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not an anti-vice campaigner or a psychologist and have no particular claim to expertise in this area, but I don&#39;t believe that people like Foley are cloven-footed sociopaths.</p>
<p>Nor do I hold to the theory that it&#39;s simply protective coloration: &quot;if I scream loud enough no one will suspect me.&quot; That shabby dodge has long since worn through; who else do we suspect nowadays if not the loudest shouters?</p>
<p>I think the migration to hypocrisy must be very gradual. The Foleys of this world are driven by the flesh. Their vice becomes their obsession. I believe that they try to turn that obsession, that vice, in a positive direction.&#0160; Let&#39;s say a person is fascinated by adolescent boys;&#0160; he can then take on the cause of sexual exploitation and he can manage his compulsion in a socially acceptable manner. He can study it, observe it, catalog it; he can stay in close touch with the temptation but not succumb to it; he can in fact turn his vice into virtue. It&#39;s an excellent game plan.&#0160; It&#39;s a healthy compensatory reaction.</p>
<p>I&#39;m sure that there are anti-vice campaigners who employ such tactics successfully. But there are others who, in moments of weakness, do succumb. Now they&#39;re in a tricky psychological pickle.&#0160; Who better to appreciate the damage to adolescents than the person who has made a professional study of the outcomes?&#0160; So now Foley and the others know in their hearts that they are truly hateful. Perhaps they persuade themselves that their power makes them invulnerable. Meanwhile, they redouble their efforts to help the exploited; they pass legislation and start foundations.&#0160; And so the gulf between their professed beliefs and their private practices becomes deeper and deeper. Good deeds and evil deeds become inextricably entwined.</p>
<p>In the story, Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde (a child-molester) inhabited the same body.</p>
<p>I think that what must happen next is that self-loathing kicks in, big time. And as we all know, self-loathing and self-betrayal are twinborn. So the Foleys among us cooperate in their detection.&#0160; They engage in riskier and riskier behavior until they are exposed. Because, in fact, they want to be exposed. As Lear says, they &quot;strip [their] own back[s].&quot;&#0160; Because once they&#39;re exposed and the punishment commences, they can then set out on the path of redemption, which, I&#39;m absolutely convinced, they crave as much or more than they crave the pleasure of their vice.&#0160;</p>
<p>When La Rochefoucauld said that &quot;hypocrisy is the tribute that vice pays to virtue,&quot; he acknowledged that the term &quot;hypocrisy&quot; did not explain anything--that it&#39;s an incidental by-product of human frailty.</p>

		<a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2006/10/our_local_newsp.html">Death and Dying in Boulder, Colorado</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Our local newspaper, the <em>Boulder Daily Camera</em>, has announced a new policy. No longer will obituaries be considered news. They&#39;ve been turned over to the classifieds and will be written by friends or relatives of the deceased and placed by funeral homes. Bottom line: deaths are now an opportunity for revenue enhancement.&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>I&#39;d always taken it for granted that keeping track of who&#39;s born, who&#39;s married, and especially who dies constitutes a considerable part of the mission of a local paper. Such events are bread-and-butter matters -- part of the soul of the community.&#0160;</p>
<p>The <em>Daily Camera</em> is certainly not where we find out what&#39;s happening in the big world -- it&#39;s woefully inadequate in that regard, although it does pick up and truncate a few pieces off the wire. The <em>Camera</em>&#39;s sole reason for being is that it covers local news, and by doing so allows Boulder&#39;s citizens to feel that they have something in common.&#0160;</p>
<p>But in fact the <em>Camera</em> only masquerades as a local paper. It&#39;s a holding of the folksy-titled Prairie Mountain Publishing, which is a joint venture of E. W. Scripps Co., the newspaper conglomerate, and the MediaNews Group (MediaNews itself owns the <em>Denver Post</em> and four other Colorado papers;&#0160; Prairie Mountain also owns the <em>Colorado Daily</em>). There&#39;s nothing local about the <em>Camera</em> and there&#39;s no reason for its absentee owners to care two cents worth who lives or dies in Newlands or South Boulder or Wonderland Hills. The <em>Camera</em>&#39;s job is to extract as much money as possible from Boulder and to forward the cash to Prairie Mountain Publishing.</p>
<p>The Prairie Mountain overlords have placed a new publisher, Al Manzi, at the <em>Camera</em>; Manzi is a corporate lifer. I&#39;m reliably informed that he came with specific instructions to up the <em>Camera</em>&#39;s profits.&#0160;</p>
<p>And so, obituaries are now on a pay-to-play basis.</p>
<p>How is it that there have been absolutely no complaints about the new policy?&#0160; Boulder is a contentious, argumentative city.&#0160; It would be reasonable to expect that the <em>Camera&#39;s</em> letters-to-the-editor columns would be saturated with protest, but there&#39;s been nary a word. Why?&#0160; Because Manzi has instructed the editorial staff not to publish any letters that protest the new policy. It&#39;s good to be the publisher.&#0160;</p>
<p>Here are some proposals for Al Manzi.&#0160; Why stop with obituaries?&#0160; Or with wedding and anniversary announcements, which are obviously fair game. Letters to the editor: why not?&#0160; Why should a newspaper give free space to community opinion. Let those who can pay, pay. And editorials. Why should there be editorials when there can be advertorials?</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a phrase to remember:&#0160; &quot;revenue center.&quot;&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>In today&#39;s paper, there&#39;s an announcement that the Camera&#39;s editor, Sue Deans, who has local roots, has resigned. Could it be that her departure is related to Manzi&#39;s policy changes?&#0160; Would anyone be astonished to discover so?&#0160; &#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Every American should read Khaled Hosseini&#39;s <em>The Kite Runner </em>(Riverhead, 2003) -- but for its political relevance, not its literary achievement. The novel is set in Afghanistan, which is one of the few countries where recent American foreign policy hasn&#39;t been entirely incompetent and disgraceful, so to read it feels reassuring and even patriotic. Inasmuch as we&#39;re engaged in a never ending war in Afghanistan, every one of our fellow citizens should have an idea why we&#39;re there and what we&#39;re doing. It&#39;s not at all obvious -- Afghanistan doesn&#39;t have a single drop of oil.&#0160; Americans should know how bad the Taliban was and might become again, and also why we should remain vigilant against any rabid fundamentalist theology--even ones that are near and more domestic than Islam.</p>
<p>In <em>The Kite Runner, </em>the conflict between Afghanistan&#39;s dominant Pashtuns and the exploited Hazaras reminds us that there are countries that are far more absurdly tribal than our own.</p>
<p>Even though I learned a great deal from this novel, I feel that as a work of art, T<em>he Kite Runner </em>is profoundly disappointing. It came highly recommended to me and I set out to fall in love, couldn&#39;t.&#0160; It&#39;s an overpraised work. It&#39;s advertised as written in &quot;hard, spare prose&quot; (I&#39;m quoting from the back-cover blurb), but in fact it&#39;s written in prose without any style at all -- and worse still, every paragraph or so there&#39;s a sentence that must make a discriminating reader cringe. The novel is very weak in characterization: aside from the autobiographical narrator, there&#39;s only one figure of any dimension --Baba-- and all the rest are flat as pancakes. The novelist is particularly bad with women, who are never more than wallpaper. The child Sohrab, in whom so much is invested, speaks an idiom that no living child has ever spoken. Has the author ever had a conversation with a real boy&#0160; The plot is filled with obvious contrivances, artificial cliff-hangers, and (goodness gracious!) a climactic fist-fight. And while I appreciate the author&#39;s love of his native country, it doesn&#39;t seem at all honest to attribute Afghani problems to &quot;Arabs, Chechens, and Pakistanis.&quot; In this novel, the Taliban is represented by a character who is half-German, a sociopathic admirer of Hitler, and (we eventually discover) a pervert who preys on little boys. He&#39;s a grotesque villain who seems to have wandered into an ostensibly serious novel from a James Bond melodrama. Why can&#39;t the author face the fact that the the Taliban are home-grown Afghani fascists? He would have given us a stronger novel if he had done so.&#0160; &#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I was not a committed moviegoer as a youth -- punchball, basketball, softball, stickball in the street all having more appeal. But often enough, on a Saturday, especially when the weather was bad, there were double-feature matinees at the Leader Theater on Coney Island Avenue.&#0160; =Admission for children was fourteen cents when I first started attending; I think that by the time I reached high school the price had risen to as much as a quarter. It was a harmless way to spend a long afternoon. The theater was usually over-crowded with noisy ragamuffins who threw popcorn at each other during the love scenes. There was an impotent &quot;matron&quot; with a flashlight who had the frustrating job of maintaining a modicum of order.</p>
<p>Musicals mystified me-- I remember waiting for the dance numbers to end so that we could get on with the plot. I loved westerns and detective stories and tolerated, though I was frightened by, the war movies.</p>
<p>In the cavalry-and-Indian movies (Stentorian voice :&#0160; &quot;In the Years Following the Civil War...&quot;) there was a recurring scene that made quite an impression on me. Indians have attacked an &quot;isolated farmhouse&quot; or a wagon train. The colonel who has just come from West Point to take command of Fort Apache or Fort Bragg or Fort Collins summons the wizened scout who has spent his life on the frontier. The fresh-faced colonel tells the experienced old buckaroo that he&#39;s heard that there are Indians camped down by the bend of the river, and that he&#39;s going to send a detachment of troops to teach them a lesson. The scout looks at the arrow that the colonel shows him, and says, &quot;But colonel, them Indians down by the Brazos (or Snake or Powder or whatever river it happened to be that particular Saturday matinee) are Comanche; this here&#39;s a Kiowa arrow.&quot;&#0160; But the bull-headed, ignorant colonel won&#39;t listen. As far as he&#39;s concerned &quot;they&#39;re all injuns,&quot; so he orders an attack, and soon the whole frontier is in flames and before the movie comes to an end, settlers are hatcheted and the Kiowas are decimated.</p>
<p>Now I&#39;m sure that George Bush went to see the same movies as I did. But he couldn&#39;t have grasped their point; it was far too subtle for his intelligence. He must have thought that the stubborn colonel analyzed the situation correctly when he said that &quot;injuns is injuns,&quot; because nowadays&#0160; we have a foreign policy that says, if we&#39;re attacked by Al-Quaeda, let&#39;s just turn around and revenge ourselves on the Iraqis. After all, Arabs is Arabs. The result: the entire frontier is in flames.</p>
<p>There was a recurring scene in the war movies as well. An American soldier, or a French resistance fighter, has been captured by the Germans. He refuses to talk; won&#39;t spill any secrets.&#0160; The German colonel says to him: &quot;ve haf ways of making you talk. I&#39;ll haf to turn you ofer to <em>him.&quot; </em>And then the camera would focus on an obvious sadist in an SS uniform, licking his lips. Next there was a brief but terrifying shot of the captive sweating and screaming.&#0160;</p>
<p>In dozens of films, the villainous Germans routinely employed torture. Americans and their allies, on the other hand, were brave and upright and honorable and played by the rules.</p>
<p>I can guarantee that at this moment there are movies being made all over the world in which the colonel is American and the sadist is CIA. And these films are going to be watched on Saturday afternoons by generations of children.</p>
<p>What has George Bush done to us?&#0160; What have we allowed him to do?</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>More outrageous even than &quot;mission accomplished&quot; is the absurd claim that, during 2006, our very own president, George W. Bush, has read fifty-three books. It&#39;s a fool&#39;s game to try to re-invent the class dunce as an intellectual, but they&#39;re trying.</p>
<p>There&#39;s some incriminating <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2006/08/30/video-bush-explains-his-_n_28367.html">videotape</a> floating around the &quot;internets&quot; in which POTUS, heretofore known to devour only the box scores, boasts that he&#39;s an &quot;ek-a-lek-tic&quot; (his pronunciation!) reader. Not only has he been laying into Camus, he&#39;s also read &quot;three Shakespeares.&quot; He&#39;s both full o&#39; shit and unidiomatic. Native speakers of English don&#39;t say &quot;three Shakespeares&quot;; they say they&#39;ve read &quot;three Shakespeare plays.&quot;&#0160; Next the Great Decider will tell us he&#39;s just hustled over to the Kennedy Center where he listened to three Bachs.</p>
<p>The White House press office has supplied the names of two of the plays to which Bush lays claim&#0160; -- <em>Hamlet</em> and <em>Macbeth</em>. Was there a third play?&#0160; If there was, it&#39;s name, like the third murderer and the fabulous WMDs, is lost to history.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>If W. had actually turned the pages of <em>Hamlet</em> and <em>Macbeth</em>, he might have noticed that in both plays, a bad man has become head of state by extralegal means.&#0160; Claudius poured a bit of poison into the ears of Hamlet&#39;s father and Macbeth stabbed Duncan. Neither ruler thrives in his ill-gained position, and neither has been able to repent his evil deed. Claudius can&#39;t bring himself to pray and Macbeth&#39;s way has fallen into the sere and yellow leaf. Fat chance that our unelected president would notice the parallel to his own situation -- or that he would be moved to repentance and renunciation. In the world of literature, there&#39;s justice:&#0160; Claudius is run through with a sword and Macbeth is beheaded. No such luck in real life.</p>
<p>And what about the mysterious third play that the Uniter claims to have read?&#0160; If he were looking for parallels to his own career, he could flatter himself by reading one of the three plays that dramatize the life of King Henry V, in which a scapegrace prince reforms, gives up alcohol and screwing around, and becomes the conqueror of France. The parallel is inexact, because Henry enjoyed some traits of character that George distinctly lacks: courage, eloquence, and the willingness to endure the same hardships as the soldiers who serve under him. A better parallel to George II is the succeeding Henry-- Henry VI-- a pious, immature, weak man unable to control his powerful advisers.</p>
<p>In truth, the character in the thirty-seven &quot;Shakespeares&quot; whom Bush most resembles is neither Claudius, Macbeth, nor either of the Henrys, but Lepidus in <em>Anthony and Cleopatra</em>. Shakespeare depicts Lepidus as a man who&#39;s happened into a position far beyond his natural abilities. He&#39;s way over his head in the Second Triumvirate, not at all of the stature of the heroic but flawed Anthony or the efficient, masterful Caesar. Even the servants recognize that Lepidus is simply bush-league. One of them tells the audience that &quot;to be called into a huge sphere, and not to be seen to move in&#39;t, are the holes where eyes should be, which pitifully disaster the cheeks.&quot;&#0160; This is a bit of Shakespearean obscurity certainly beyond the budding intellectuality of incurious George. It means simply that Lepidus must fill a position as huge as a Ptolemaic sphere, but he can&#39;t because he&#39;s tiny and makes no impression at all, and as a consequence his circle is as vacant as an eye-socket that lacks an eye. Shakespeare does not think well of Lepidus and soon allows him to be carried off the stage, drunk. So much for morally and intellectually pitiful men who try to play with the big boys!&#0160;</p>
<p>Bush might be even less than a Lepidus, who, when he&#39;s not drunk, speaks plainly enough. Perhaps a better comparison is to one of Shakespeare&#39;s braggart soldiers, like Parolles in <em>All&#39;s Well That Ends Well</em>, or to one of the malapropizing clowns -- as for example <em>Much Ado About Nothing</em>&#39;s Dogberry.&#0160; Dogberry is given to such Bushlingo <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2005/11/some_of_bushs_m.html">moments</a> as &quot;is our whole dissembly appeared&quot; and &quot;be vigitant.&quot;&#0160; And <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2005/12/more_on_malapro.html">other</a> illiteracies.&#0160; But it was beyond even Shakespeare to imagine a world in which a clown could become head of state.&#0160; To him, such a reversal of the natural order would have been unthinkable.&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">From 1947, when Jackie Robinson broke the barrier, until 1957, when Walter O’Malley hijacked the franchise to Los Angeles and cut the heart out of Brooklyn, the <em>Dodgers</em> represented the best of America.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>While the United States remained legally segregated by race and fractured by religion and ethnicity, it was the <em>Brooklyn Dodgers</em> who offered the nation a vision that was more inclusive and more just.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span>One year before Harry Truman issued an executive order banning segregation in the armed forces, eight years before Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat on a Montgomery bus, eighteen years before the enactment of federal statutes protecting the right to vote, the <em>Brooklyn Dodgers </em>hired Jack Roosevelt Robinson to play first base. And on an unforgettable day in April in Cincinnati, when racist fans hurled taunts at Robinson, Pee Wee strolled over and put his arm on Jackie’s shoulder.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span>It was an iconic moment and one that transformed not just baseball, and sports, but the world.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&#0160;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>The boys of summer made us proud to be democratic, proud to be Americans.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> All good men were Brooklynites, at least some of the time. Moreover, </span>the <em>Dodgers</em> were talented:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;they won </span>five pennants during those years, and, in 1955, they won the world championship.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>Half a century later the <em>Dodgers </em>are still the most loved, most chronicled, most mythologized team in history.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&#0160;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">What will be written about the <em>Colorado Rockies </em>fifty years from now?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span>The Rockies’ watchword is not inclusion but exclusivity. They are a team not of destiny, but of narrow sectarianism.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>They search for and hire players of “character”-- which means players of their particular &quot;Christian&quot; denomination.&#0160;Their general manager, Dan O’Dowd, is thoroughly delusional.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>&quot;You look at some of the moves we made and didn&#39;t make. You look at some of the games we&#39;re winning. Those aren&#39;t just a coincidence. God has definitely had a hand in this.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>A hand in what?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span>In a history of failure?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span>In a losing record?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span>Last place in their division once again?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; God takes sides in baseball games?&#0160;</span>Either God is bush league with bat and glove or O’Dowd is a one helluva sloppy theologian.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&#0160;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">O’Dowd, along with club president Keli McGregor and manager Clint Hurdle, join together for telephone prayer sessions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>Is it possible that they hold on to their jobs not because they are capable of assembling a winning team, but because they subscribe to the same beliefs as owner Charlie Monfort (“I believe God sends signs, and we&#39;re seeing those&quot;)?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&#0160;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">Baseball is not about religion. It’s about 95-mile-an-hour fastballs, about hard sliders, about come-from-behind ninth-inning victories.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span>Colorado taxpayers didn’t fund three-quarters of the cost of Coors-–Coors!!! -- Field so that evangelical ballplayers could testify to their faith.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&#0160;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">And what a curious faith! The Rockies depart from established Christian thinking and veer toward the banal new cult of “prosperity gospel.” Reformation Calvinism had asserted that an omnipotent deity elects some for salvation and consigns many more to damnation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>Believers sometimes understood material success to be a sign (but never, ever a reward) of salvation. The <em>Rockies</em>’ unChristian theology turns Calvinism upside-down and defies common sense when it proclaims that faith leads directly to base hits. (As a matter of fact, “prosperity gospel” seems to work better for the capitalist owners than for the players.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>The team loses, but the franchise increases in value).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&#0160;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">There&#39;s no hint of supernatural intervention in the <em>Rockies</em> unremarkable record. If the <em>Rockies</em> were to run away from the opposition, it would indeed constitute a &quot;miracle&quot; -- but a miracle only in the common secular sense of the word. It would be a miracle indeed if an incompetent skinflint ownership could somehow stumble into success.</span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&#0160;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">Are the <em>Colorado Rockies</em> the most foolish, fatuous, and vain organization in the mountain west?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span>Not in the least.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;There&#39;s a </span>church in Broomfield that has a website where “you can send your prayers and encouragement for the Rockies by clicking here.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;Click for Christ. Good Lord!</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&#0160;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">I wonder if the <em>Rockies</em></span> ever knew, or if they would like to learn, who it was who said “do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.&quot; If they could answer this question,they&#39;d be in a position to recognize that there&#39;s less real religion in the entire history of the <em>Colorado Rockies</em> than in five seconds of Reese and Robinson.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>In my post on the Templeton prayer study, I did not mention the outcome least congenial to prayer enthusiasts: not only did prayer do no good, it also caused real harm. “A significantly higher number of the patients who knew that they were being prayed for — 59 percent — suffered complications, compared with 51 percent of those who were uncertain [whether or not they were being prayed for”].&#0160;</p>
<p>How could it happen that prayees did worse than patients who were just let alone?&#0160; Dr. Charles Bethea, co-author of the Templeton study and cardiologist at the Integris Baptist Medical Center in Oklahoma City proposed that &quot;it may have made [patients] uncertain, wondering am I so sick they had to call in their prayer team?&quot;&#0160; It&#39;s a possible scenario -- it’s no secret that depressed and anxious patients do worse than happy ones. But the “patient is anxious” explanation doesn’t work for those who didn’t know that they were on the receiving end of prayers.&#0160; Among the group of unwitting prayees, “18 percent suffered major complications, like heart attack or stroke, compared with 13 percent in the group that did not receive prayers.”&#0160; Researchers offered no hypothesis for this unanticipated result except to say that it was a chance outcome.</p>
<p>So let us review: when prayees know that they’re being prayed for, their decline is a product of anxiety; when they don’t know that they&#39;re being prayed for, their decline is the result of chance. In both cases, the unwanted phenomenon is explained by natural rather than supernatural causes.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Let us now imagine that the study produced contrary results and that the prayees had lower rates of complications than the unprayed. Would there not have been banner headlines in newspapers and on Fox proclaiming that prayer has been proven to be effective remedy for the complications of surgery?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The error in logic is enormous and obvious. When prayer fails, it&#39;s for natural reasons. If and when prayer succeeds, it&#39;s because of supernatural intervention. It&#39;s a flagrant double standard where a symmetrical standard should be mandatory. If prayer succeeds because of divine intervention, it&#39;s only logical that it must fail because of symmetrical supernatural intrusions -- because, for example, malificent demonic forces located the prayer providers, hijacked their prayers mid-flight, and turned good into evil. It&#39;s a difficult hypothesis to prove, it&#39;s true, but it&#39;s exactly as credible as the ideas that are put forward by prayer science.&#0160; &#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>According to <em>The New York Times</em> (3/31/2006), the world of prayer science is all in a dither. A new study has apparently demonstrated that &quot;prayers offered by strangers had no effect on the recovery of people who were undergoing heart surgery.&quot; The study was a big, expensive deal: ten years of work at a cost of $2.4 million (contributed by the ever-zealous Templeton Foundation, a powerful supporter of prayer research). The details are utterly and weirdly fascinating. &quot;Researchers monitored 1802 patients at six hospitals who received coronary bypass surgery. The patients were broken into three groups. Two were prayed for; the third was not. Half of the patients who received the prayers were told that they were being prayed for; half were told that they might or might not receive prayers. The researchers asked the members of three congregations -- St. Paul&#39;s Monastery in St. Paul; the Community of Teresian Carmelites in Worcester, Mass.; and Silent Unity, a Missouri prayer ministry near Kansas City -- to deliver the prayers, using the patients&#39; first names and the first initials of their last names. The congregations were told that they could pray in their own way, but they were instructed to include the phrase &quot;for a successful surgery with a quick, healthy recovery and no complications.&#39;&quot; The shocking result: &quot;researchers found no difference between those patients who were prayed for and those who were not.&quot; Prayer, it would appear (or intercessory prayer as this variety is called), does not change things.&#0160;</p>
<p>I admire the dedicated men and women of science who put heart and soul into this project, but with all due respect, I must question both their conclusions and their protocols. For starters, the inference that prayer doesn&#39;t work is far too broad. Inasmuch as the scientists engaged only Christians to pray, all that they proved was that Christian prayer doesn&#39;t work. It&#39;s marvelously ethnocentric to suggest that just because Christians tanked, other religions could not succeed. It was Bailey Smith, the President of the Southern Baptist Convention, who authoritatively proclaimed that &quot;God does not hear the prayer of a Jew.&quot; And yet, in a stunning theological upset, the scientific evidence now proves that God Almighty does not hear the prayers of Christians. But such a conclusion is itself far too hyperbolic. In actual fact, all that the study established is that God did not hear the prayers of three particular groups of prayer-providers. It&#39;s certainly a black mark against the Teresian Carmelites and their friends, and it will be a cold day in hell before they see another Templeton prayer contract, but there&#39;s nothing to say that Southern Baptists, even Bailey Smith himself, with his private line to the Almighty, might not have had more sway with the Great Jehovah.</p>
<p>If the researchers had not been so blindly and thoughtlessly ethnocentric, they might have solicited the prayers of people of various faiths, especially those praying to different gods. Or even better: they might have assembled disparate groups of prayer providers. In one set, for example, there would be a Catholic, a Jehovah&#39;s Witness, and a Hindu; in another, a Muslim, a Wiccan, and a Methodist; in a third, a Scientologist, a Baptist, and a Muggletonian. Although the number of possible permutations is intimidating, the cause is noble: to determine impartially which of these groups can best cut the prayer mustard. It&#39;s wrong to put the entire burden on Christians. Scientists need to mix and match the various religions so that they can discover the most effective synergistic combination, or as it might better be called, the appropriate prayer cocktail.</p>
<p>In addition, the study is guilty of flagrant mishandling of dosage. There was simply no control over the amount of prayer that was administered. Just as traditional medicines come in cubic centimeters, prayer comes in units of time. Let&#39;s say that one person praying for one minute yields one prayer unit.&#0160; Pending further study, there&#39;s no way to establish exactly how many prayer units a heart patient might need. For a bypass, fifty prayer units might be a minimum dosage, but perhaps twice or three times as many units might be necessary to alleviate the symptoms of a hallucinator of witches, extraterrestrials, or other supernatural beings. It&#39;s entirely possible that the prayers in this study failed simply because they didn&#39;t meet a minimum prayer-unit threshold. Moreover, it&#39;s important not to over-prescribe. For all we know, excessive prayer might precipitate iatrogenic illnesses. And it&#39;s also a question of efficiency: once an optimum dosage can be established, prayer providers can go about their business and not waste their time generating superfluous and expensive prayer units.</p>
<p>Moreover, prayer scientists seem to have given no serious consideration to the group power of prayer providers. Given the present abysmal state of prayer science, it&#39;s still unknown whether prayers are more effective when delivered by just one or a very few providers, or in large choruses. Jews seem to think that a <em>minyan</em>, or quorum, is ten, but hard science has not confirmed this number. It&#39;s therefore imperative to experiment with different size groups in order to establish a proper medical-<em>minyan.</em> This is not easy, or inexpensive, but it&#39;s essential.&#0160; It would indeed be unfortunate if it turns out that a thousand prayer providers are necessary to improve the condition of just one bypass patient, but good golly, the Ancient of Days works in mysterious ways, and it&#39;s not for us to question His prayer needs.</p>
<p>There are some other areas in which more scientific rigor is required. A)&#0160; different diseases: just because prayer didn&#39;t work for bypasses doesn&#39;t mean it won&#39;t work for scrofula. Perhaps some diseases are more prayer-responsive than others. B) fervor: prayer science has made the naive error of assuming that all prayer providers are equal. Yet the unalterable laws of random distribution determine that some people will pray more effectively than others. In point of fact, it&#39;s entirely likely that some prayer providers will be more effective with one disease than another. If I were a patient, I&#39;d be mighty bent out of shape (and might even seek legal recourse) if I were assigned a prayer provider who had a proven track record with ulcers but who amounted to zilch for my hip replacement.&#0160; C) identification: prayer providers were given only the first name and initial of their prayee. But &quot;Bob S.&quot; is entirely too vague-- there might be hundreds of &quot;Bob S&quot;&#39;s all over the world undergoing bypass surgery at any given time. How the blue blazes is the Lord of Hosts supposed to know which particular &quot;Bob S&quot; is meant?&#0160; Fortunately, there&#39;s an easy solution to this problem. Prayer providers should continue to pray for Bob S., but just remember to add the last four digits of his social security or major credit card number.&#0160;</p>
<p>I&#39;m not the only person disappointed with this study. According to the <em>Times</em>, &quot;Bob Barth, the spiritual director of Silent Unity, the Missouri prayer ministry, said the findings would not affect the ministry&#39;s mission. &#39;A person of faith would say that this study is interesting,&#39; Mr Barth said, &#39;but we&#39;ve been praying a long time and we&#39;ve seen prayer work, we know it works, and the research on prayer and spirituality is just getting started.&#39;&quot;&#0160; Bob B&#39;s assertion that &quot;prayer works&quot; is anecdotal thinking and has absolutely no merit whatsoever, but I can&#39;t imagine a single person who wouldn&#39;t agree with him that prayer science is &quot;just getting started&quot;-- and also that it has a long bumpy road to travel. Fortunately, the Bush administration invested over $2 million of our tax revenues in prayer research, with more in the pipeline, so some revolutionary breakthroughs in the spiritual sciences soon might be achieved.&#0160; We&#39;ll be waiting.</p>
