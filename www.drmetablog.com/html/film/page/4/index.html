                                <p>Goodness gracious! I should have known that the two films were distant cousins -- after all, Woody Allen&#39;s film (one of his very best, and certainly his most genial) ends with an extended tribute to&#0160;Groucho&#0160;in which everyone wears phony mustaches and pretends to puff on stogies. But not having taken a look at <em>Horse Feathers </em>in twenty or thirty years, I&#0160;failed to realize how much Woody had borrowed. How&#0160;could I have forgotten&#0160;that <em>Everyone Says I Love You&#0160;</em>extracts&#0160;and transforms two songs from <em>Horse Feathers: </em>&quot;I&#39;m Through With Love&quot; as well as its&#0160;own title song. And of course&#0160;it shares its&#0160;liberated and episodic&#0160;series-of-skits structure not only with Groucho but with all vaudevillians. Not to mention a willingness to throw logic to the winds or under the bus for the sake of a gag. <em>Everyone Says I Love You&#0160;i</em>s&#0160;a lovely,&#0160;gentle film (much more mild than its raucous unsubtle predecessor).</p>
<p>Its exhilarating choreography is very distinctly not indebted to anything in the earlier film.</p>
<p>Some ambitious scholar could&#0160;write an illuminating&#0160;essay on Woody&#39;s Marxism.&#0160;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I finally got around to watching <em>In America, </em>a film which won all sorts of awards in 2002 and which I ordered from Netflix after it appeared on someone&#39;s best films of the decade list. It&#39;s a fine movie, especially if you enjoy piping your eye from dawn to dusk. Always susceptible, I cried a full quart. Samantha Morton, familiar from her role as Hattie in <em>Sweet and Lowdown, </em>is endowed with the most expressive face in the history of cinema, and the director of <em>In America</em>, Jim Sheridan, is smart enough to take advantage of her features.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>The story is not unfamiliar -- immigrants in America, culture-clash and assimilation, poverty and a bit of triumph at the end.&#0160; he film skirts dangerously close to cliche and occasionally falls over the precipice -- I&#39;m sorry but I&#39;ve seen too many movies in which an emotionally-stunted hero waits until the final frame before he breaks into tears.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p><em>In America </em>is at heart a drama about replacing the dead child. Johnny and Sarah Sheridan lost a boy to a brain tumor and they&#39;ve been off balance ever since.&#0160; They&#39;re not going to be whole until they make another baby. Sarah&#39;s pregnancy is precarious and the parturition difficult, and in a contrived piece of hoakum, the baby doesn&#39;t begin to thrive until the suffering soul of a dying friend is mystically infused into her.</p>
<p>No thought is given (nor should it be) to the poor baby, whose whole life will be colored by her entrance into the world as savior and redeemer and who will be freighted with expectations that she will never be able to fulfill.&#0160;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p><em>Pretty Poison </em>was released in 1960 to excellent notices. I remember adding it to the must-see list. But I didn&#39;t get around to it at the time, probably because the film wasn&#39;t widely distributed. But <em>Pretty Poison&#0160;</em>stuck in my mind -- or rather it was the combination of&#0160;Anthony Perkins and Tuesday Weld that excited my interest.&#0160;During the VHS years I made another attempt to see the movie, but it was&#0160;apparently stuck in some sort of royalty-and-ownership dispute and&#0160;never made it onto tape.&#0160;And then another twenty years elapsed and I tried again, this time typing the name into my Netflix queue, and, <em>mirabile dictu, </em>there it was.&#0160; So at last, after fifty years,&#0160;a cd&#0160;of <em>Pretty Poison </em>appeared in the mailbox.&#0160;</p>
<p>It&#39;s a fine film, well worth the wait.&#0160;I don&#39;t know what I would&#0160;have thought&#0160;about it in 1960,&#0160;but in 2010 it seems&#0160;like&#0160;a late variant of 1950s&#0160;<em>film noir</em> and an important but unacknowledged way station on the road from <em>Double Indemnity </em>to<em>&#0160;Body Heat.</em>&#0160;It offers a&#0160;dangerous <em>jeune fille fatale</em> in the high school cheerleader Mary Ann Stepanek, some great plot twists, and a creepy young man who&#39;s not as clever as he thinks (very similar to his lineal descendant, the fatuous lawyer Ned Racine). The photography, all sunlit and cheerful, disguises the noirish themes and keeps the audience off balance. The screenwriter, Lorenzo Semple Jr., was, if I remember correctly, just emerging from the McCarthy blacklist, which may be why the film stresses cold-war themes -- spies and sabotage and the like. Can it be accidental that, in the last year of the Eisenhower administration, a well-meaning but ineffective government employee as given the name Azenauer?&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>At the very time Tuesday Weld, scion of an ancient Massachusetts family performed in this film, I was taking courses in Cambridge, in Weld Hall. How could anyone not be struck by her great name? Tuesday Weld is linked, in my mind, not only to the Saltonstalls, Peabodys, and Lodges but also to Billy Sunday, Rick Monday, Joe Friday, January Jones, Fredric March, May West, June Jones, August Busch, Susan Sontag, Domenico Scarlatti and Jeudi Garland.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>English teachers are such colossal jerks, at least whenever they appear in movies. A case in point is <em>Smart People</em> (2008), which is the second-best academic movie ever made in Pittsburgh (<em>Wonder Boys </em>is superior). <em>Smart People </em>offers us a Carnegie-Mellon Professor of English, played by a shambling Dennis Quaid, who is a depressed, angry, uncommunicative, and miserable being, and who insults and patronizes both his students and his family. He&#39;s the perfect embodiment of traditional and persistent American anti-intellectual stereotypes. Book-learning has turned him into a mere grammarian, a pedant, who must learn about &quot;real life&quot; from his rolling-stone, improvident, frequently-stoned but streetsmart brother. <em>Smart People </em>is constructed around stereotypes that were exhausted when Shakespeare created Holofernes and Sir Hugh Evans more than four hundred years ago.&#0160;</p>
<p>I&#39;ve known a lot of English teachers -- some good, some bad -- but I&#39;ve yet to encounter the shallow stereotype.</p>
<p>English teachers make their way into a disproportionately large number of movies. There are two reasons for this phenomenon. The first is that the writer of the film wants to illustrate some thematic point, so he brings his characters into a classroom where a pompous old fart or fartess can provide some cheap laughs while explicating a poem or novel that is tangentially related to a point the film is trying to make. The second reason is pure revenge. In films in which English teachers figure, there&#39;s often --almost always, in fact -- a young man whose writing is unappreciated by the narrow-minded professor. In <em>Smart People, </em>he&#39;s the son of our own nasty hero, and his sparkling poem is published in the <em>New Yorker </em>while his indifferent father is still waiting to hear whether his critical-theory manuscript has been rejected yet once again. This character -- the brilliant but unappreciated young poet or playwright or novelist -- stands in for the writer or director of the film, who is saying, in filmspeak, &quot;look at me now, you colossal jerk. I&#39;m making movies and you&#39;re still back in high school or at State U., grading freshman term papers. So there!!! That&#39;ll teach you to give me a C+.&quot;</p>
<p>By the way -- <em>Smart People </em>is an intelligent, well-written film. I heartily recommend it.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>We enjoyed <em>In Bruges </em>for its black humor, its witty profanity, and the unpredictability of its plot (that is, until the mandatory chase scene).&nbsp; And especially for the lovely views of medieval Bruges, an old Hanseatic town.</p>

<p><em>In Bruges </em>contains a film-within-a-film which is described by Chloe, the handsome drug dealer and thief, as an imitation or a homage or a 'nod of the head' toward <em>Don't Look Now, </em>Nicholas Roeg's scary-as-hell Julie Christie-Donald Sutherland masterpiece.&nbsp; I've been racking my poor brains, trying to decide whether there's a meaningful connection between the two films -- or whether the writer-director Martin McDonagh is just planting red herrings.</p>

<p>Bruges and Venice (where the earlier film is set) are old, architecturally rich, becanalled towns and both directors make much of their warm civic atmosphere.&nbsp; The plots of both films are initiated by the deaths of young children.&nbsp; In each film, an important character is a dwarf who is, one case, the perpetrator of violence and in the other its victim.&nbsp; That's all that I can come up with at the moment, so I'm leaning to the red-herring theory. But I'd be interested in other people's views.</p>

                                <p>On two occasions this year the Williamsburg Bridge (from Manhattan to Brooklyn) has made a guest appearance in the plot of my life.</p>
<p>In January, as faithful readers know, we set up shop in <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2008/02/upper-west-side.html">Manhattan</a>. One day we strolled over the bridge from the Lower East Side to the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn. The bridge is a splendid monument of nineteenth-century technology and the view from above is spacious and commanding. It&#39;s a restless, busy path from one side to another; all around you, automobiles, subway trains, bicyclists, runners, baby carriages -- the works. NYC in a Victorian nutshell.&#0160;</p>
<p>Then, a few days ago, came the news of the death of Jules Dassin. Dassin is famous for <em>Never on Sunday </em>and <em>Topkapi, </em>but as movie-lovers know, he was a polished director of films noirs during the 1940s -- before Nixon, McCarthy, and the blacklisting boys drove him into exile. We decided to embark on a Jules Dassin festival and tribute right here on our very own giant TV. Our first choice was <em>Naked City </em>(1949), a highly un-subversive <em>policier, </em>markedly patriotic but disturbing because all the bad guys are vaguely &quot;ethnic.&quot; The climactic scenes of <em>Naked City </em>were shot in the Lower East Side (just where the Williamsburg Bridge hits Delancey). The murderer/wrestler/harmonicat Willie Garzah attempts to flee. A voice shouts, &quot;he&#39;s on Norfolk near Rivington.&quot; Right where we had just a few months ago wandered! It&#39;s right off the bridge! And then Garzah panics and tries to escape by running across the Williamsburg into Brooklyn. Police in pursuit, squad cars, pistols, shouting, shots. Garzah climbs the girders--the very same girders, which, just a few months before, I had decided to honor my acrophobia by not climbing. And then he&#39;s wounded, and, as always in the movies, falls theatrically to his death.</p>
<p>It&#39;s peculiar, isn&#39;t it, when a store or a street-corner that you know in real life appears in the movies. Does it mean that film tells the truth, is real, or does the celluloid appearance provide us with some evidence that our own life is genuine? Why should the movies sometimes seem more substantial than the reports of our own five senses? How can art validate life? And at the same time, don&#39;t we feel a little cheated--in the sense that our privacy--our uniqueness--has been violated and the things and stuff that are personal to us have been delivered over to an unappreciative anonymous world? It&#39;s odd and disorienting when a familiar non-fiction bridge plays a supporting role in a fictional film.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p><em>Naked City </em>is a good, solid, intriguing piece of work, well-paced and well-written. I&#39;m not entirely happy with the way it treats women or the working-classes, but then, many such films are far more culpable. I liked best the authentic, unstaged street shots of Manhattan as it was sixty years ago. Delancey Street was nostalgic and poetic (although the shop signs, then lettered in Hebrew, are now mostly Chinese).</p>
<p>The Williamsburg Bridge, solid and substantial, has weathered the years extremely well. It&#39;s well positioned to star in many another film.&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I can&#39;t recommend Marion Meade&#39;s <em>The Unruly Life of Woody Allen</em> (New York, 2000), which I too hastily snatched off the library shelf. Written at the tabloid height of the Woody-Mia-Soon-yi fracas, it masquerades as a biography but in truth it&#39;s nothing more than scandalmongery.&#0160; <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 3.75pt; margin-right: 3.75pt;"><span style="color: black; font-family: &#39;Trebuchet MS&#39;;">Before it gets down in the dirt, however, <em>Unruly Life </em>offers<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>a quick summary of Allen’s life, a matter of which I was largely ignorant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>Of course I knew that Allen was a Brooklyn boy who grew up in the old neighborhood. Allen Koenigsberg attended P. S. 99 on East 10 Street near Avenue K (where my cousin Louie was also a student). In addition, I knew, from Louie, that P. S. 99&#39;s principal was Eudora Fletcher and that, in the very inventive chameleon movie, Woody gave Ms. Fletcher&#39;s name to the psychiatrist who takes Zelig under her wing.&#0160; </span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 3.75pt; margin-right: 3.75pt;"><span style="color: black; font-family: &#39;Trebuchet MS&#39;;">But cousin Louie did not know, or did not bother to tell me, that Allen was a frequent patron of the Kent Theater on Coney Island Avenue and that it&#39;s rumored that it was at the Kent that the interior scenes in <em>The Purple Rose of Cairo</em> were filmed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> I&#39;ve seen <em>Purple Rose </em></span>recently and if it wasn&#39;t the Kent, it sure looks like the Kent of my memory. The Kent, along with its sister theater, the Leader, was one of my own <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2006/09/the_leader_thea.html">childhood</a> <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2007/04/what_we_read_in_1.html">haunts</a>. In fact, it was my father’s aunt Manya, substitute cashier, who sometimes sat in the box office and took my quarter.&#0160; <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 3.75pt; margin-right: 3.75pt;"><span style="color: black; font-family: &#39;Trebuchet MS&#39;;">It was not at the Kent but at the Jewel Theater on Kings Highway that Allen encountered Ingmar Bergman for the first time. Well, not exactly Bergman himself. It was Harriet Andersson disrobing in <em>Summer with Monika </em>that seems to have caught Allen&#39;s attention.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> <em>Unruly Life </em></span>reports that Allen sat “with eyes bulging” to watch this and other early Bergman films.&#0160; </span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 3.75pt; margin-right: 3.75pt;"><span style="color: black; font-family: &#39;Trebuchet MS&#39;;">Allen’s protruding orbs brought to mind the impact that those shocking 1950s Scandinavian films had on the days of my early adolescence. It was at the Kent (aunt Manya must not have been on duty that day) that I once watched a Danish film in which there was a very brief flash of a woman in naked silhouette. All I can remember is that I sat through to watch the picture again -- it might even have been a double feature -- and that by the time the silhouette appeared a second time, my poor bladder was so swollen (I was afraid to leave my seat for fear of missing the moment) that it was about to rupture. How embarrassing it would have been to die of an aneurysm of the urinary tract simply to catch a glimpse of Harriet Andersson or one of her friends.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 3.75pt; margin-right: 3.75pt;"><span style="color: black; font-family: &#39;Trebuchet MS&#39;;">In the 1950s, naked bodies were simply not on view.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> Never at all, at least not in my slice of the universe. </span>I doubt that anyone from the post-Vietnam, post-sexual-revolution generation can imagine how nude-deprived were those severely repressed years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> Bodies, women&#39;s bodies, were so rare and mysterious that a brief and evanescent flash of shadowed skin, circa 1953, could remain in the memory for more than fifty years. </span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 3.75pt; margin-right: 3.75pt;"><span style="color: black; font-family: &#39;Trebuchet MS&#39;;">Which is why I retain the warmest feelings for Coney Island Avenue&#39;s Kent Theater. </span></p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p><em>Away From Her </em>explores the infinitely sorrowful subject of early-onset Alzheimer's. Fiona Andersson, in her vigorous mid-sixties, has begun to lose her way and to forget names; she stores the frying pan in the refrigerator. She thinks that she’s “beginning to disappear.” Fiona’s plight is worrisome to every human being but it is especially disturbing to people of her own and of Julie Christie's generation.</p>

<p>Here in our home we still manage to find appropriate places for the cooking utensil, mostly.&nbsp; Nevertheless, things happen. We set out to purchase six items at the market and come home with just three. We have three errands to perform and we arrive back home with two of the tasks undone. We put the camera in a special secure place and then spend a couple of hours searching for it. Keys and lists and books and tickets regularly evaporate or disintegrate or dematerialize.&nbsp; Are these forgettings normal or are we en route to something that is too horrible to contemplate?</p>

<p>We exercise, we eat carefully, we gulp those horrid <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2008/02/john-milton-and.html">fish oil</a> boluses. Perhaps these defensive procedures have value. Perhaps we'll be the ones to dodge the Alzheimer bullet.&nbsp; Perhaps we won't.</p>

<p>It doesn’t help that we spend many hours a week at the facility where the Aged Parent is incarcerated. We encounter people just like Fiona -- or the remnants of them -- every day.&nbsp; They're hollow shells, slumped in the wheelchair or poking at the boiled-to-mush food. The angry ones, the ones with dead eyes, the ones who moan all day long, “help me.” Better the Seconal and applesauce, the ice floe, or the bullet in the brain than to live in such horrible oblivion.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>In <em>Away From Her, </em>Julie Christie is entirely persuasive as the alzheimered Fiona. But let me ask you, friends of a certain age-cohort, is it really possible that that gray old lady was Julie Christie? Here’s a woman I’ve known for forty-five years, ever since she was Liz for thirty incandescent seconds in <em>Billy Liar</em> -- and feckless Billy was too much of a jerkass coward to run away with her. Julie and I have had a long (albeit entirely one-sided) relationship.&nbsp; I was dazzled by her when she was the voracious Diana Scott in <em>Darling </em>and I feared for her when she was Laura Baxter in Nicholas Roeg’s scary-as-all-hell <em>Don't Look Now.&nbsp; </em>She was my favorite Gertrude. But Fiona Andersson is outside any recognizable trajectory;&nbsp; she's too raw, too dislocating to my tender sense of the way things ought to be.&nbsp; No, Julie will always be Liz to me.&nbsp; I've held on to that first image for most of my adult life.</p>

<p>I have no intention of progressing to the &quot;second floor,&quot; or to sunset village or to memory lane or to however they euphemize the place that they put the folks with clogged synapses, but, if I should find myself in such a state, let's hope that it won't be Fiona but Liz to whom the brain clings.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Woody Allen's <em>Sweet and Lowdown </em>is a sentimental love story with an unhappy ending.&nbsp; Like most of Allen's works, it has become a far better work of art with a few years on its back than it seemed on first viewing (1999) -- probably because audiences habitually come to the Woodman's films with the mouth set for wisecracks and one-liners.&nbsp; Woody's films grow on you;&nbsp; some day, when the fuss has died down, their emotional range and artistry will be better recognized.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

<p>The lovers in <em>Sweet and Lowdown </em>are Emmett Ray, who talks constantly but says very little, and Emmett's girlfriend Hattie, who is mute but miraculously expressive.&nbsp; Emmett is a shallow, vain, brittle, damaged bit of goods who exempts himself from emotion and human connection with the assertion that he's an &quot;artist.&quot;&nbsp; Hattie is said to be dull-witted but whether she is or not we don't know.&nbsp; We do know that she's a woman of great appetites: for sex, for food, for music.&nbsp; Emmett cannot acknowledge that she's his best audience and he runs like the wind when it's revealed that she loves him.&nbsp; The climax of the film is inarticulate: all Emmett can manage is &quot;I've made a mistake.&quot;&nbsp; Viewers, however, can easily fill in the gaps. </p>

<p>It's a fine and lovely movie, well worth the re-seeing if only for the music and the affectionate re-creation of the 30s jazz scene.&nbsp; And also for the acting.&nbsp; Sean Penn twists his face into an expression of perpetual dissatisfaction.&nbsp; His Emmett Ray, except for a redeeming moment or two, is horrid and knows it.&nbsp; On the other side of the coin, Samantha Morton is transcendent as the vulnerable but resilient Hattie.</p>

<p>See <em>Sweet and Lowdown </em>for what it is.&nbsp; It's not a farce;&nbsp; it's not raucus.&nbsp; Don't look to it for more than it offers or for something other than it offers.&nbsp; It's sufficient unto itself.&nbsp; </p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I had trace memory only of Delmer Daves&#39; 1957 <em>3:10 to Yuma, </em>a film that I had not seen since the days of my youth. In my mind it was bracketed with a much better morality-play western, <em>High Noon </em>(1952). I am, frankly, a little vain that I was able to recall that Van Heflin played the Gary Cooper part of the good man deserted by fearful townspeople while the clock ticks toward the climactic arrival of the Iron Horse and while Frankie Laine strums and sings off-screen. Of course, so much detail had evaporated from the ol&#39;&#0160; tired brain that the return to the 1950s was, once again, well, not mind-blowing, but certainly eye-opening.</p>
<p><em>3:10 to Yuma </em>is a remarkably spare noirish western -- not a classic, but respectable and well-made. At its heart is the near-friendship that develops between the bad guy Ben Wade as acted by smooth and charming Glenn Ford, and his captor, the god-fearing impoverished settler Dan Evans, played by the ever-gruff Van Heflin (reprising his role in <em>Shane)</em>. As the two (Wade and Evans) test each other, an odd mutual respect springs up between them. Wade has money and authority and the perennial appeal of lawlessness while Evans is grounded in his ranch and his family.&#0160; Each envies the other. The relationship is imperfectly delineated and as a result the ending of the film is huddled and unsatisfying.</p>
<p>Slipping the DVD of the brand new <em>3:10 to Yuma </em>into the machine, I thought, ah, here&#39;s a chance to remedy the original. This time, get that off-kilter relationship between Wade and Evans right;&#0160; clarify the ending. I wanted a suspenseful film rich in psychological insights. I couldn&#39;t have been more disappointed. James Mangold&#39;s reworking of <em>3:10 to Yuma</em> is bigger, noisier, and a ton more expensive than the original. It adds a lot of ruckus:&#0160; a fight with Indians, a barn-burning, feuding townsfolk, a pair of sadistic monomaniacal killers, a gruesome bullet extraction that belongs on the surgery channel, a cursed pistol, thirty seconds of gratuitous torture, and most of all, hundreds of fatalities. In terms of melodrama and gunfire, there&#39;s certainly much more bang for the buck, but the characters themselves are flatter and less interesting and the climax, problematical in the first <em>3:10 to Yuma, </em>is totally botched and incoherent. An opportunity squandered!</p>
<p>And yesterday I saw the acclaimed <em>Michael Clayton, </em>an eastern western. This time the bad guy is a woman, chief counsel to a nasty polluting international conglomerate. Will the good man, Michael Clayton, under financial and emotional siege, resist temptation and stand up for the right, like Gary Cooper and Van Heflin and Humphrey Bogart before him? What do you think? Will it spoil anyone&#39;s appreciation of <em>Michael Clayton </em>if I hint that George Clooney finds his place in the long line of inarticulate American heroes?</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the paradoxical upshot: there&#39;s less of the old <em>3:10 to Yuma </em>in the new <em>3:10 to Yuma </em>than there is old <em>3:10 to Yuma </em>in the new <em>Michael Clayton.</em></p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>We watched, don&#39;t ask me why, the most recent Jason Bourne extravaganza&#0160; -- <em>The Bourne Hyperventilation </em>I believe it was called. So-called &quot;action&quot; pictures are not my cup of tea. In my view, it&#39;s a genre that is far too deeply infatuated with its own cliches. <em>The Bourne Mystification </em>was not only prefamiliar but also unusually tricky to follow. It consisted of swatches of flashback interspersed with vigorous but interminable fight and chase sequences. The &quot;action&quot; was delivered in a multitude of stitched-together one- and two- second slices, which, even on the small screen, were vertiginous and almost barfitudinous.</p>
<p><em>The Bourne Hyperbole </em>is a multiple car-chase movie. How many time do we need to revisit this cliche? Cars spinning out of control, cars shouldering each other for a place on the highway, cars ramming into each other, cars becoming airborne, cars landing on their sides, cars weaving into the oncoming lane, cars on sidewalks, sirens blaring, hoods flying open, windows shot out, guys shooting pistols at each other while driving one-handed at 100 mph -- interspersed with one-second glances at the speedometer, one-second glances of a foot on a brake -- all followed by the inevitable noisy, multiple-vehicle crash where the nasty hired killer winds up dead while our invincible hero emerges with only minimal, symbolic scathe. Is there anything in movies today that is more hectic, more predictable, or more boring?&#0160;</p>
<p>Let me ask my readership this art-versus-life question -- what is the ratio of your own participation and/or observation of real-life car chases compared to the number of car chases that you&#39;ve seen in movies?&#0160; Am I the only twentieth-century American who has never been shot at or pursued? Never seen a fleeing Oldsmobile pass just inches in front of the oncoming semi? Yet I&#39;ve experienced the film version of that very scene scores -- perhaps hundreds -- of times.&#0160;</p>
<p>I think that in the next century, when movies will be studied by historians eager to understand the great age of petroleum-based transportation (as well as the golden age of film), our descendants will take it for granted that it was absolutely ordinary for pedestrians out for a Sunday stroll to be driven from the sidewalk by an out-of-control vehicle (usually a commandeered taxi trailed by a gaggle of motorcycle cops). They will think that in our century, there was never a time that a fruiterer put that last orange on top of his pyramid of oranges that some sort of vehicle didn&#39;t barrel into the display. They will know that any time, day or night, every plate glass showroom window in North America was liable to have a station wagon hurtle through it. Often in slow motion.</p>
<p>So here&#39;s my proposal for a new rating system for movies. In addition to the three or four stars, let&#39;s announce in advance how many car chases we are going to experience&#0160; -- or better still, exactly how many cars were destroyed during the making of the film. It would certainly help me choose my entertainment if I were to learn that <em>The Bourne Yesterday </em>was a three-star, two-car chase, 197 exploded vehicles film.&#0160;</p>
<p>While we&#39;re changing the rating system, I have another idea. Let&#39;s also have a Cute Puppy warning.&#0160; I&#39;m thinking of that scene where the hero and heroine finally make it to bed and there&#39;s a reaction shot of Cute Puppy putting his paw over his eyes. I never, ever, want to see that one again. Agreed: no more car chases, no more Cute Puppies. Life will be richer.</p>
<p>One further exercise: let us divide the number of cases of amnesia encountered in film by the number of cases of amnesia encountered in real life. And the answer is: it&#39;s impossible to divide by zero.&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160;</p>

<p>&quot;Dear Dr. M.:&#0160; you&#39;re directly on target when you claim that Woody Allen and Philip Roth are the same person, but you&#39;ve unaccountably omitted to mention the most pressing evidence.The year: 1972. Philip Roth published <em>The Breast, </em>a fantasy about a writer transformed into one. Woody Allen released <em>Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex, </em>in which a giant female breast wreaks havoc upon the countryside.&#0160; Obviously, both &quot;Roth&quot; and &quot;Allen&quot; had recently read Gogol&#39;s <em>The Nose </em>and Kafka&#39;s <em>Metamorphosis</em>. Just as obviously, &quot;both&quot; of &quot;them&quot; were struggling with some seriously unresolved maternal issues. How fascinating that both of their boundless cups of creativity &quot;runneth over&quot; so to speak, in such similar ways. A coincidence? Hardly.&#0160;</p>
<p>By the way, both &quot;Roth&#39;s&quot; and &quot;Allen&#39;s&quot; contributions are embarrassingly false and flat.&quot;</p>
<p>Dr. M. responds:&#0160; &quot;You know, Professor Hollingsworth, I think I support your breast remarks. I&#39;d been aware of both of these upwellings of mammariness but I never put two and two together. If Roth/Allen aren&#39;t doppelgangers, they&#39;re certainly developing along twin tracks.</p>
<p>And let me add my own reservations:&#0160; the short stories by Gogol and Kafka are untouchable contributions to world literature.&#0160; Both writers create astonishing fantasies; they also manage to skewer the particularities of, in the one case, czarist Russia and in the other, early twentieth-century Prague. Frankly, neither Roth&#39;s nor Allen&#39;s breasts are anywhere nearly as full or pointed.&quot;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Yesterday I considered the near-incest situations of Philip Roth and Woody Allen.&nbsp; In Roth's <em>My Life as a Man, </em>Roth's shadow Nathan Zuckerman marries Lydia Kettering and when she commits suicide he takes up with Monica, who is Lydia's sixteen-year-old daughter by a previous marriage.&nbsp; When Lydia turns twenty-one, Zucerkman proposes marriage but she, wiser than her step-father, declines.&nbsp; I do not know whether Zuckerman's borderline incest had a precedent in Roth's real life.&nbsp; I do know that Roth's doppelganger Woody Allen eventually married Soon-yi Farrow Previn and that he has adopted two children with her.&nbsp; (The woodman now has five offspring in his complex family, including two adopted and one created in the downright way with Mia Farrow.&nbsp; Child-averse Roth seems to have avoided paternity.) </p>

<p>While reading <em>My Life as a Man </em>I've also been watching movies by Nicholas Ray.&nbsp; Last night I saw <em>In a Lonely Place </em>(1950) with Humphrey Bogart and Gloria Grahame.&nbsp; I recommend it to all who love film.&nbsp; It's tough and intelligent, filled with great dialog, brilliant lighting, excellent music and stylish direction.&nbsp; Trust me, It will hold your interest and give you something to admire.&nbsp; Gloria Grahame steals the show;&nbsp; she's just as good and much more subtle than Humph.</p>

<p>I didn't know anything about Grahame's career and life, so I looked her up on the standard databases.&nbsp; Her life was so unusual that I might even try to track down a biography.</p>

<p>With the Roth/Allen/incest theme on my mind, I discovered these facts about Gloria Grahame.&nbsp; In 1948, Grahame married director Nicholas Ray and gave birth to a son who was named Timothy.&nbsp; She and Ray were divorced;&nbsp; in 1960, Gloria married Anthony Ray, Nicholas Ray's son, and subsequently gave birth to two more boys, Anthony Jr. and James.&nbsp; &nbsp;She had biological children by both father and son and has therefore left incest-flirters Roth and Allen in her dust.&nbsp; What an achievement!</p>

<p>Query:&nbsp; Tim, Anthony Jr, and James are half-brothers -- but are they also uncle and nephew?&nbsp; &nbsp;Half-cousins?&nbsp; Cousins?&nbsp; &nbsp; I never fully grasped the theory of relativity.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>&#0160;<br /><a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef01539118f99f970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Newkirk" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef01539118f99f970b image-full" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef01539118f99f970b-800wi" title="Newkirk" /></a>This Here is a <a href="http://brooklynpix.com/photoframex1.php?photo=photo1/F/flatbush11.jpg&amp;key=FLATBUSH%2011">photograph</a> of Coney Island Avenue, the grim commercial thoroughfare along which I crept to school unwillingly like snail between the years 1944 and 1952. The unknown photographer who left us this record stood at the corner of Newkirk Avenue, just in front of the P. S. 217 schoolyard, and pointed his camera north toward Ditmas Avenue. It&#39;s the east side of the street; on the west side stood a used-car lot and a gas station, where, if the view were more panoramic, signs reading &quot;Veedol&quot; and &quot;Mechanic on Duty&quot; would have been visible.</p>
<p>It takes only a few seconds of detective work to date the photograph. In the center is the marquee of the Leader Theater, which advertises the 1947 release <em>It Happened in Brooklyn</em>, a soldier-returns-home musical with Frank Sinatra, Kathryn Grayson, Peter Lawford, and especially Jimmy Durante, who was clearly the neighborhood favorite.&#0160; The second feature, <em>Undercover Maisie</em>, a <em>policier </em>with Ann Sothern and Barry Nelson, was released in the same year. (The double bill was standard -- and at 14 cents for kids and a quarter for adults, a darn good value). It&#39;s early autumn not only because the ivy and, in the distance, a Norway maple are still in full leaf, but because the Casa del Rey advertises High Holy Day services (the orthodox congregation&#39;s synagogue on 18th Avenue had not yet been constructed). I would guess that the large traffic sign that dominates the frame has something to do with the fact that the old trolley tracks had recently been removed. The shops near the Leader are too small to identify, but I remember Singer&#39;s drug store, Safier&#39;s candy store, a shoe repair place, a small liquor store owned by P. V. Melia, and Joe Montuori&#39;s barber shop.&#0160; At the moment the camera snapped, I was eight years old, in Mrs. Sherwood&#39;s third grade class at P. S. 217.&#0160;</p>
<p>The architecture is hodge-podge -- the featureless apartment house and shops, the vaguely deco Leader, and then, closer to the camera, the what-the-heck-is-it-doing-there Moorish Casa del Rey (for weddings and other gatherings;&#0160; I passed it thousands of times but never once entered).</p>
<p>The man at the right of the frame, jingling his car keys in the pocket of his voluminous slacks, stares at the camera unenthusiastically.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a dreary picture, I&#39;m afraid. Gray. A nondescript street in a nondescript neighborhood.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>I&#39;m trying, but I just can&#39;t seem to work up the requisite nostalgia for the old country.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>For the life of me, I cannot remember whether I read <em>Scaramouche</em> because I was entranced by the movie, or whether it was the other way around, and I surrendered my 16 cents to the Leader Theater because I had already fallen in love with Rafael Sabatini&#39;s historical romances. I know that I gorged myself on huge helpings of Sabatini -- not only <em>Scaramouche</em> and <em>Captain Blood,</em> but everything else in the rich collection of the McDonald Avenue library. <em>Scaramouche</em>, first published in 1921, enjoyed a second burst of popularity when the Mel Ferrer-Stewart Granger Technicolor swashbuckler hit the screens in 1952. I&#39;ve now re-read the novel, and while it lacks the magic that it had for my 13-year-old self, and, moreover, is awkwardly plotted, and stilted, and thin, and obvious, it&#39;s nevertheless an engaging adventure story. The central figure is the dashing and resilient Andre-Louis Moreau, who survives crisis after crisis with a witty, devil-may-care <em>sprezzatura</em>. The novel itself overlays elements of picaresque (on-the-lam Moreau becomes an itinerant actor, then a fencing master, and finally a politician) onto a traditional romance plot (in the novel&#39;s final pages, our bastard hero discovers that he&#39;s an aristocrat by birth). At heart it&#39;s yet another version of the secret-sharer<em>, doppelganger</em>, Jekyll-Hyde plot so common a hundred or so years ago. Moreau is haunted by his wicked double, the Marquis Gervais de la Tour D&#39;Azyr, with whom he competes for not one but two different women&#0160; -- one fallen and one pure, as was the custom in those days. D&#39;Azyr claims that Moreau has been &quot;the evil genius of his life,&quot; but he&#39;s got it backwards: he&#39;s Moreau&#39;s evil twin. In the thrilling climax, so-called, Moreau wins Aline de Kercadiou -- the upper-class paragon whom both he and his double desire. The novel is set during the French Revolution, but the historical context is dimly realized&#0160; -- a much paler embodiment than <em>The Tale of Two Cities, </em>which, like <em>Scaramouche, </em>is also a novel of doubles (remember Charles Darnay and his dissipated friend Sidney Carton!).&#0160; A dyspeptic reader might assert that the novel is nothing but dilute Dumas; it would be hard to challenge such an opinion.</p>
<p>The film, which I remembered fondly, was a bitter disappointment. It&#39;s appallingly, embarrassingly bad. There&#39;s some good theatrical dueling, but the plot is a mess, the dialog is ghastly, the humor infantile, and the acting vaudevillian. Eleanor Parker is hopeless as a cliche &quot;spitfire&quot; who alternately kisses and smacks around her admirers; however, a young and <em>rondelet </em>Janet Leigh, swathed in whole hectares of taffeta, manages to redeem the part of Aline. All the characters, even Aline, wear their hair in the oddest configuration: highly artificial, upswept white wigs. They look like well-groomed sheep. I suppose it&#39;s too late to shoot the hairdresser.</p>
<p>The Sesquipedalian Sibilance Society would like to extend its appreciation to Mr. Sabatini for popularizing the word &quot;spadassinicide,&quot; which is much-used in the novel. It&#39;s from Fr. <em>spadassin, &quot;</em>assassin,&quot; and from the Latin verb meaning, &quot;to kill.&quot;&#0160; Etymologically speaking, spadassinicide ought to denote a person who murders murderers, but the author uses it to mean a person who kills by taking advantage of the etiquette of the duel. It&#39;s a handsome old neologism, although not easy to work into everyday conversation.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>From the get-go, our internationally-renowned neighborhood scandal, the JonBenet Ramsey murder, had TV movie written all over it.&nbsp; It had upper-class sheen, infant-beauty-pageant perversity, and tantalizing whodunnitness.&nbsp; Our latest local murder lacks all such glamor.&nbsp; The characters are sad, dumb, and pathetic and, to make matters worse, everyone already knows whodidit.&nbsp; Fodder for what sort of film?&nbsp; The answer should be screamingly obvious to movie aficionados. </p>

<p>Here are the facts as they have been extensively reported locally.&nbsp; Tess Damm (note transparent symbolism of name), an in-and-out-of-trouble somewhat trashy 15-year-old, persuades her boyfriend, Bryan Grove, to kill her alcoholic and abusive mother Linda.&nbsp; Bryan obediently does the deed by stabbing Mom Damm in the &quot;throat and mouth.&quot;&nbsp; The kids, however, don't have a clue how to dispose of the body, so they stow it in the back seat of the Subaru.&nbsp; While it festers, the young 'uns cavort.&nbsp; Neighbors tell reporters that that &quot;the teens were seen coming and going at all hours of the night, 'car-surfing' through the neighborhood and blaring loud music.&quot;&nbsp; After a raucous month of celebration in which they spend the $4000 in Mom's bank account, the murderers come to the realization that it might be good idea to dispose of the evidence.&nbsp; They solicit the aid of third young malefactor.&nbsp; (Possible dialog:&nbsp; <em>Bryan:&nbsp; </em>&quot;Hey dude, want to, like, help us get rid of a, like, corpse.&quot; <em>Jared:&nbsp; </em>&quot;Cool.&quot;) They head out to the Erie landfill, but the car gets stuck in the mud and so they return home.&nbsp; The next night, they try again: they drive to a local cemetery (a stroke of pure cinematic genius!) but because the ground is frozen, they can dig only one or two feet into the ground.&nbsp; The bury the body, but, panicked that the shallow grave will be noticed, they return the next night, exhume Mom and return her to the Subaru.&nbsp; At this point, just as the story is becoming weirder than weird, an &quot;anonymous tipster&quot; notifies the police and thereby cries &quot;cut&quot; to the youthful criminals.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p>It's probably too morbid and half-baked for a broadcast TV movie, but can anyone deny that the story is made to order for Joel and Ethan Coen?&nbsp; Some typical Coen Brothers elements:&nbsp; truly sleazy characters; rampant brainlessness;&nbsp; the inability of the participants to look even a few moments into the future;  gruesome details;&nbsp; gratuitous blood and gore;&nbsp; very, very, black humor;&nbsp; and, finally, the opportunity to satirize American <em>mores</em>.&nbsp; What could be more perfect?&nbsp; &nbsp;It's a Coen Brothers world after all.&nbsp; Can the argument be taken a step further?&nbsp; The adventures of Tess and Bryan and Linda couldn't possibly have occurred until Joel and Ethan had made and exhibited <em>Blood Simple</em> and <em>Fargo.&nbsp; </em>The murder -- and the macabre and superbly noir series of actions that follow -- would not have been possible without a literary precedent.&nbsp; Once gain, Life can do no better than slavishly tread in the Footsteps of Art.&nbsp; </p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I was not a committed moviegoer as a youth -- punchball, basketball, softball, stickball in the street all having more appeal. But often enough, on a Saturday, especially when the weather was bad, there were double-feature matinees at the Leader Theater on Coney Island Avenue.&#0160; =Admission for children was fourteen cents when I first started attending; I think that by the time I reached high school the price had risen to as much as a quarter. It was a harmless way to spend a long afternoon. The theater was usually over-crowded with noisy ragamuffins who threw popcorn at each other during the love scenes. There was an impotent &quot;matron&quot; with a flashlight who had the frustrating job of maintaining a modicum of order.</p>
<p>Musicals mystified me-- I remember waiting for the dance numbers to end so that we could get on with the plot. I loved westerns and detective stories and tolerated, though I was frightened by, the war movies.</p>
<p>In the cavalry-and-Indian movies (Stentorian voice :&#0160; &quot;In the Years Following the Civil War...&quot;) there was a recurring scene that made quite an impression on me. Indians have attacked an &quot;isolated farmhouse&quot; or a wagon train. The colonel who has just come from West Point to take command of Fort Apache or Fort Bragg or Fort Collins summons the wizened scout who has spent his life on the frontier. The fresh-faced colonel tells the experienced old buckaroo that he&#39;s heard that there are Indians camped down by the bend of the river, and that he&#39;s going to send a detachment of troops to teach them a lesson. The scout looks at the arrow that the colonel shows him, and says, &quot;But colonel, them Indians down by the Brazos (or Snake or Powder or whatever river it happened to be that particular Saturday matinee) are Comanche; this here&#39;s a Kiowa arrow.&quot;&#0160; But the bull-headed, ignorant colonel won&#39;t listen. As far as he&#39;s concerned &quot;they&#39;re all injuns,&quot; so he orders an attack, and soon the whole frontier is in flames and before the movie comes to an end, settlers are hatcheted and the Kiowas are decimated.</p>
<p>Now I&#39;m sure that George Bush went to see the same movies as I did. But he couldn&#39;t have grasped their point; it was far too subtle for his intelligence. He must have thought that the stubborn colonel analyzed the situation correctly when he said that &quot;injuns is injuns,&quot; because nowadays&#0160; we have a foreign policy that says, if we&#39;re attacked by Al-Quaeda, let&#39;s just turn around and revenge ourselves on the Iraqis. After all, Arabs is Arabs. The result: the entire frontier is in flames.</p>
<p>There was a recurring scene in the war movies as well. An American soldier, or a French resistance fighter, has been captured by the Germans. He refuses to talk; won&#39;t spill any secrets.&#0160; The German colonel says to him: &quot;ve haf ways of making you talk. I&#39;ll haf to turn you ofer to <em>him.&quot; </em>And then the camera would focus on an obvious sadist in an SS uniform, licking his lips. Next there was a brief but terrifying shot of the captive sweating and screaming.&#0160;</p>
<p>In dozens of films, the villainous Germans routinely employed torture. Americans and their allies, on the other hand, were brave and upright and honorable and played by the rules.</p>
<p>I can guarantee that at this moment there are movies being made all over the world in which the colonel is American and the sadist is CIA. And these films are going to be watched on Saturday afternoons by generations of children.</p>
<p>What has George Bush done to us?&#0160; What have we allowed him to do?</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>When I was no more than a hemidemisemiquaver, I would listen attentively as my mother sat at her old Hardman piano and sang ditties by Gilbert and Sullivan. I believe that the first song I ever learned “by heart” was “I’m called Little Buttercup” with its still mysterious “pretty polonies.” In 1947, when the D’Oyly Carte company made its first post-war American tour, I was taken to see a performance of <em>H. M. S. Pinafore</em>. I was utterly transported. No subsequent theatrical experience has worked equivalent magic. I still think that it’s a little miracle that I saw with my own rapt eyes such legendary Savoyard stalwarts as Ella Halman, Darrell Fancourt, and Martyn Green.</p>
<p><em>Pinafore</em> was the only stage play that I saw until I was past adolescence and out of the house. What could have prompted such uncharacteristic extravagance on my parents&#39; part? Whatever the cause, the result was that my infatuation with Gilbert and Sullivan&#39;s operas was early established. The attachment was difficult to sustain because there was no family phonograph; moreover, those thick, heavy albums of 78s would have broken the budget. I was fortunate to possess a tattered old anthology of G&#0160; &amp; S songs from which I would pick out tunes as best I could.</p>
<p>In college I had a roommate who was a genuine savoyardophile and who arrived with a &quot;hi-fi&quot; and an extensive collection of ‘long playing’ records. I took advantage of his resources and his knowledge. During the fifties and sixties I attended performances of the full G &amp; S repertory in various amateur and semi-pro productions-–even a rare <em>Utopia Ltd</em>. at the Loeb Drama Center in Cambridge. I also acquired a treasured collection of D’Oyly Carte and Glyndebourne performances on vinyl. During the seventies and eighties, I couldn’t clean the house or cook a meal without the assistance of Sir Arthur. But turntables and 33s went the way of 78s, and then the vinyl itself came to be sequestered in plastic tubs in the basement.</p>
<p>I was G &amp; S-less for a decade or so, but <em>Topsy-Turvy (1999)</em>, the great Mike Leigh film, rekindled an unfaded love. Now, sixty years after my first <em>Pinafore</em>, I’m compiling a new collection of recordings (everything’s out there on CD if you’re patient). I now own reissues of classic D’Oyly Carte recordings and also of a sparkling <em>Mikado </em>by the Welsh National Opera. In the fall, the entire collection will be transferred to the iPod. Who would have guessed that I&#39;d have gone through four or five new technologies in my lifetime? And yet the song remains the same.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">What is the attraction? Gilbert and Sullivan, I think, gave me early authorization to be silly. The operas licensed criticism of oppressive or irrational social norms. Everything was fair game. Inasmuch as I was raised in a rigidly conformist society, the G &amp; S precedent was a great liberation. I’m absolutely convinced that a great big hunk of my sense of humor was formed around a Gilbertian core.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When I was a boy, it was the clever patter songs that most struck me. They’re still good, and some are brilliant. Bunthorne’s soliloquy in <em>Patience</em>, in which he confesses that “he’s not fond of uttering platitudes/ In stained glass attitudes” is as fully on target now as it was in 1881. Simply substitute tired modish Derridadaism for the &quot;high aesthetic line,&quot; and “the meaning doesn’t matter if it’s only idle chatter of a transcendental kind” jumps right out at you.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">But nowadays, it’s not Gilbert&#39;s free-standing wit but Sullivan&#39;s glorious ensembles that cause the shiver of delight. Instances: <em>Iolanthe&#39;s </em>“Oh, many a man in friendship’s name”<em>; </em>Ko-ko, Pooh-Bah, and Pish-Tush singing “To sit in solemn silence in a dull dark dock”; in <em>Ruddigore, </em>the trio “In sailing o’er life’s ocean wide,/ No doubt your heart should be your guide/ But it is awkward when you find/ A heart that does not know its mind.” And many others, including, certainly, the quartet from <em>Yeoman of the Guard</em>: “Strange adventure, maiden wedded/ To a groom she’s never seen.” Still another transcendent moment: the high silliness in <em>Pirates</em>, when the assembled choruses kneel to sing the resplendent, ridiculous: &quot;Hail poetry, thou heaven-born maid… &#0160;All hail, divine emollient.&quot; I think that the touchstone of all touchstones is a truly wondrous brief duet in <em>Iolanthe, </em>when the lovesick Lords Tolloler and Mountararat, tenor and baritone, rejected by Phyllis, who chooses a simple shepherd over their dignities, leave the stage singing &quot;Neath this blow/ Worse than stab of dagger/ Though we mo-/ Mentarily stagger,/ In each heart,/ Proud are we innately,/ Let’s depart, dignified and stately.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In addition to the satire, and the splendid music, G &amp;S also supplies great big helpings of joy. G &amp; S manage to persuade me, at least for the duration of the play, to give credence to “rapture, rapture,” and that “pleasures come in endless series,” and “joy unbounded,” and “laughing song and merry dance,” and “happier than any/ A pound to a penny,/ A lover is when he/ Embraces his bride.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There’s much to deplore in Gilbert’s creations: nasty racism, an insufferable obsession with class (embraced even as it appears to be refuted), jingoism, which is sometimes satirized but often (as in the faux-japonisme of <em>The Mikado</em>) unconsciously accepted, as well as the constant distasteful bludgeoning of middle-age women. But just as we forgive Shylock in order to embrace King Lear, so we must suspend our moral indignation to revel in the best of Gilbert.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Last week, two of the grandchildren visited for a few days. We rented the DVD of the Central Park Kevin Kline-Linda Ronstadt <em>Pirates. </em>The kids were attentive, engaged. Next time they visit: more Gilbert and Sullivan. Perhaps we can plant a savoyardian seed.&#0160; &#0160;</p>

		<a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2006/05/whats_the_deal_.html">What's the Deal with Mike Yamagita?</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p class="MsoNormal">In <em>Fargo</em>, a tightly structured film, the extraneous Mike Yamagita episode might easily have been cut.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Here’s the story (Fargophiles may bypass the plot summary). Mike is a high-school classmate and possibly an old boy friend of Marge Gunderson. He telephones Marge when he learns that she’s the police chief investigating the Brainerd triple homicide. When they&#0160; meet in a hotel bar in Minneapolis, Mike makes a half-hearted pass which Marge decisively rebuffs. Mike then reveals that he had been married to a mutual friend, Linda Cooksey, but that Linda died of leukemia. Because he’s lonely and, it would appear, because he’s embarrassed to have crossed the line with Marge, he breaks into sobs. A couple of scenes later, Marge is on the phone with a girl friend. She is surprised to learn that Mike never married Linda, that Linda is very much alive though she had been “pestered” by Mike for over a year, and that Mike’s been having psychiatric problems.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Mike Yamagita excursion doesn’t easily connect to the gruesome botched-kidnapping main story. What, then, is its reason for being?.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Coens like to toy with audience expectations. When we first hear Mike on the phone, we recognize the same flat upper-Midwest accent with which we&#39;ve become familiar -- and so, we&#39;re taken aback to discover that Mike is Asian-American. But is it a gimmick or does it matter?&#0160; Mike himself plays against type. Almost everyone in the film (although not Carl Showalter, the excitable talkative funny-looking guy who&#39;s destined for the wood-chipper) is laconic and stoical. Mike&#39;s bawling opposes him to both the stereotypical impassive Asian as well as to the stereotypical low-key Swedish Lutheran. But can his display of sentiment be trusted? Mike is no less insane than Gaear Grimsrud, the psychopathic killer, but he’s addled in a sweeter way. He wants desperately to be part of a family. It&#39;s because of this longing that he harasses Linda Cooksey and fantasizes a romance with Marge. In its own Coenesque way, <em>Fargo</em> is a film that extols families. Although the Lundegaards are not a good model, Marge and Norm are emphatically in the process of creating a good and decent family. So perhaps, taken all together, the Mike Yamagita episode adds an unexpected quirky element to the film, challenges ethnic assumptions, and reinforces, in a &#39;funny kind of way,&#39; <em>Fargo&#39;s </em>family values.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Mike Yamagita subplot also deepens the character of Marge Gunderson. Although she’s interested in Mike--she primps for their &quot;date&quot; -- she’s not a bit flirtatious. There must be hundreds of <em>policiers</em> in which the tough cop engages in gratuitous sex, but Marge is not that kind of policeperson. When she confines Mike to his side of the table, she reinforces her status as the moral center of an otherwise amoral film. But Mike catches her off guard and she’s not nearly as discerning in fancy duds as she would be if she were in uniform. The <em>Fargo </em>screenplay describes Mike as “bald, paunching.” (The coinage “paunching” must mean “becoming paunchy.”) By changing direction and casting the handsome Korean-American actor Steve Park,-- a native of Vestal, New York, by the way -- in the role of Mike Yamagita, the film makes him less pathetic and more sexual. While Marge does resist, she’s curious enough about him to make it her business to investigate. She ably balances restraint with curiosity.&#0160;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Finally, there’s a broad sketchy parallel between the Mike Yamagita sequence and the main action of the film. Jerry Lundegaard attempts a scam that eventually kills his wife; Mike Yamagita attempts a similar scam when he tries to insinuate himself into Marge’s life by, so to speak, &#39;killing&#39; his own imaginary wife. Marge thwarts both scams.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Three different approaches, then: one about Mike, one about Marge, and one about plot parallels. But has the heart of this mystery been plucked?&#0160; Do we now know what Mike Yamagita is doing in <em>Fargo?&#0160; </em>I don&#39;t think so. Is there anyone out there in the cinemablogosphere who can improve on these suggestions?</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>It&#39;s been a Krzysztof Kieslowski festival here the last few days. We&#39;ve watched, two times each and with concentrated and astonished attention, Kieslowski&#39;s <em>Trois Couleurs </em>films:&#0160;<em>Bleu, Blanc,</em> and <em>Rouge.&#0160;</em>Individually (which is how we viewed them in 1993-94 when they first appeared) they&#39;re splendid; taken together, they&#39;re an even more wonderful achievement.&#0160;</p>
<p>Kieslowski tells complicated stories with economy and precision; I don&#39;t know any filmmaker who can make every corner of the frame count for so much. It must be his training as a maker of documentaries that accounts for the rich, factual surface of his narrative. And yet his <em>chosism</em> -- his thing-ism -- is always in the service not of plot only but of the enigma as well. Kieslowski knows what accomplished novelists also know -- that an object, studied closely, becomes a metaphor. The three films share a common theme -- that it&#39;s impossible to find happiness outside of society&#0160; -- but the presentations are so various and imaginative and the characters so rich that philosophical questionings are as unobtrusive as they are omnipresent.</p>
<p>Kieslowski swore off directing when he finished <em>Rouge</em>, but had apparently relented and had started on another trilogy (<em>Heaven, Hell, Purgatory)</em> when the heart attack killed him. But there&#39;s the earlier work; we&#39;ll track backwards to watch, once again, <em>The Decalogue</em> and <em>The Double Life of Veronique.</em>&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;<em>&#0160;</em></p>

                                <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">In my experience, film memories are generally sharper than book memories. Film images crowd out the words. An exception is&#0160;<em>The Caine Mutiny</em>. I remembered the novel very well, and I was astonished that the film version, which I saw last night and must have seen in 1954 or thereabouts, had almost completely evaporated from my increasingly porous mind. I thought that I remembered something in black-and-white, but this film is in very bright colors. &#0160;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&#0160;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">Perhaps my memory faded because the movie can&#39;t hold a candle to the novel.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&#0160;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">Some of my many reservations:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>a) the actors are just too darn old.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>The novel is about young men, dislocated in early maturity, coming to terms with harsh new experiences. But the sailors who are supposed to be in their early twenties were played by Van Johnson (38), Fred MacMurray (46), and Jose Ferrer (45). Captain Queeg, who should be about thirty years old, was Humphrey Bogart, who was 55 and looked it, and who had, in fact, been wounded in World War I. The casting completely compromises the story and skews naive into conspiratorial. Robert Francis, who played Willis Seward Keith, was in fact twenty-four;&#0160; because he&#39;s so much younger than his shipmates, he looks more like their mascot than their contemporary. B) the romance between Keith and May Wynn (Marie Minotti in the novel), which is marginal or decorative rather than intrinsic in the novel, occupies far too much time in the film, and considerably dilutes the tension. C) the ship model that’s used in the typhoon scene was ludicrously inadequate. D)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> the </span>ethnic tensions that are a source of complexity in the novel are elided: May Wynn is no longer an Italian Catholic, so it’s impossible to understand exactly why Keith vacillates about marrying her; Barney Greenwald (the defense lawyer) is no longer Jewish. Simpler, in this case, is not better.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&#0160;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">It seems that the U. S. Navy wouldn’t cooperate with the project until the writers made certain changes in the script.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>It would be fascinating to learn how much of the film was censored, and for what reasons. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span></p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p><em>Laura </em>is a stylish noir whodunit that holds up well even after the passage of sixty years. It is cleverly written and handsomely cinematographed but it also comes with some murky psychological baggage that may or may not make sense. At the heart of the enigma is Waldo Lydecker (played by Clifton Webb). He&#39;s so head-over-heels in love and so ferociously jealous of Laura (the ingenue Gene Tierney) that he&#39;ll resort to anything, even murder, to keep her from other men. The premise is good whodunit fare, but it would make more obvious sense if Lydecker weren&#39;t both old and gay.</p>
<p>Clifton Webb was fifty-five when the picture was made, but he looks and acts ten or fifteen years older. He may be a bachelor, but he&#39;s not an eligible one. There&#39;s a rumor that Webb had a clause in his contract with Twentieth-Century Fox that barred the company from alluding to his homosexuality, but the prohibition, if it existed, didn&#39;t stop him from playing Lydecker with a pronounced gay affect. He&#39;s fussy, he&#39;s bitchy, he&#39;s a queen -- in short a stage homosexual in every aspect except that he&#39;s not obviously interested in men. (Well, almost never;&#0160; he does expose himself to the detective Mark McPherson [Dana Andrews] when he steps out of the bathtub and asks McPherson to throw him a robe.)</p>
<p>One clue to Lydecker&#39;s character occurs in the first scene. He&#39;s spying on the detective, who&#39;s wandering around Lydecker&#39;s apartment, browsing an extensive collection of fragile <em>objets d&#39;art</em>. McPherson goes to pick up a piece of glass and Lydecker calls out &quot;Careful, that&#39;s very valuable&quot; (I&#39;m quoting from memory). From this incident we learn two things: Lydecker is a collector of beautiful works of art, and he&#39;s willing to let people look but not touch. This same attitude controls his relations to Laura: he cherishes her beauty, he molds her in a Pygmalion-like way, but he&#39;s also hyper-protective. For him, she becomes an untouchable work of art (the portrait of Laura, on which the camera focuses so obsessively, is the metaphorical signifier of her place in his mental world). His cool sexuality (he&#39;s perfectly content with twice-a-week dinners) and his age (he&#39;s more interested in fathering Laura than in making love to her) are less significant than his pygmalionism.&#0160;</p>
<p>By transforming Laura into a work of art, he attempts to preserve her virginity. He therefore shoos away her potential lovers: he destroys the career of Jacoby, the painter, by writing a vitriolic attack on him; he collects revealing information about the southern gigolo Carpenter (Vincent Price), and he competes with McPherson. It&#39;s a neat turn that to do so he becomes a detective himself -- loitering in the snow outside Laura&#39;s apartment, eavesdropping behind a post in a night club, etc. Eventually he comes to understand that he can&#39;t preserve Laura&#39;s &quot;purity;&quot; it&#39;s then that the film turns to violence. After all is lost, he gives away the game when he says to McPherson, with horror, &quot;I suppose you&#39;ll have a disgustingly earthy relationship&quot; [i.e. with Laura].&#0160;</p>
<p>It&#39;s fascinating that McPherson, though he has all the outward marks of the macho gumshoe, is himself tepid about sexuality, lacks charisma and emotion, and that the film allows him and Laura only one slight awkward peck of a kiss.The detective is not a creature of passion, but he may be, like Lydecker, a lover of art; it&#39;s revealed that Laura&#39;s portrait will be auctioned and that McPherson has put in a bid on it.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
