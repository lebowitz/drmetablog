		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>The (<a href="https://myshtetl.org/shtetl_en.html">website</a>) &quot;My Shtetl -- Jewish Towns of Ukraine&quot; gathers information about Starokonstantinov -- &quot;Old Constantine&quot; -- the town from which, in 1895, my courageous grandparents emigrated to America. The site is in Russian but it can be mechanical translated into awkward but intelligible English.</p>
<p>Some of my friends of European extraction have been able to return to the old country villages where their families originated, but that option is not available to me. Trust me, there&#39;s no pilgrimage to Starokonstantinov in my future -- even if the town happens to survive the Russian invasion and the rockets. My grandparents did not bring to Ellis Island happy memories and nostalgia or pique my curiosity with warm fuzzy memories of their earlier years. Nevertheless, Starokonstantinov provokes my curiosity. For how many decades did my ancestors live in this so-obscure-to-me town?&#0160; How did they manage to survive?</p>
<p>One of the compilers of the My Shtetl website, Yevgenii Schneider, has unearthed a report on Starokonstantinov written in 1884 by a certain N. I. Zuts, a lieutenant in the 45th Azov Infantry Regiment. Why or for whom these paragraphs were written I have no idea, but some of it largely duplicates information that I have <a href="45th Azov Infantry Regiment">previously </a>posted. According to Lieutenant Zuts, Starokonstantinov was founded in 1505 as the village of Kolyshchentsy in a grant from the king of Poland to one Ivan Labunsky. On January 5, 1561, Labunsky&#39;s descendants sold Kolyshchentsy to Prince Konstantin Ostrozhsky. Three months later, Ostrozhsky was permitted by the king to found a city first called Konstatinov, then Novokonstantinov, and finally in 1632 renamed Starokostiantyniv. A castle was constructed in 1571. In 1620, the city passed into the possession of the princes Zaslavsky, and in 1682, to the princes Lubomirsky. Starokonstinov became part of Russia in 1793.</p>
<p>(It seems to be the case that Ukraine was a largely unpopulated or underpopulated frontier until a few hundred years ago. When and why did my people decide to try their luck on this vast semi-empty plain?)&#0160;</p>
<div>Zuts expresses frustration that it hard to count Jews because of &quot;the special conditions of their life, which is generally distinguished by great mobility and inconstancy with respect to place of residence: in the city there are many Jews who live permanently or for a very long time due to their trade and other affairs and are not included in the city population. Jewish houses, not being the property of one person, and sometimes constituting the property of several families, cannot serve as data by which, even desirably, with a small error, it would be possible to determine the number of their inhabitants. When concluding marriages among themselves, many, even the majority of Jewish families, accepting a son-in-law for a year, two, three or even five years, depending on the marriage conditions and the son-in-law&#39;s property status, subsequently move to other localities.&quot;</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>The good lieutenant seems genuinely mystified by the communal customs of the Jewish population. Zuts admires one aspect of Jewish life: &quot;the charity of the Jewish residents is expressed primarily in the fact that poor Jews receive help from the wealthier ones. Independently of this, there is a Jewish Hospital in the city, located in a house built with public funds and maintained with money donated by two wealthy Jews, Israel Epstein and Abraham Krasnoselsky.&quot;</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>And Zuts adds this very interesting detail of Jewish life. &quot;All Jewish houses are built almost according to the same plan and the same model, having the character of a guest house, i.e. on both sides of the corridor there is a row of rooms; each room has a door into the common corridor and is also connected to the neighboring rooms by doors, mostly double-leaf. Consequently, each room has 3 doors and only the corner rooms have 2 doors.&quot; Zuts describes what is familiar to me as a &quot;shotgun house&quot; -- a style not at all rare in the new world but apparently exotic to the lieutenant.<br /><br />The website also contains a few pictures of houses typical of Jewish inhabitants. As far as I can tell, these are recent photographs of older homes in various states of repair.</div>

<p>The website does not make it clear who, if anyone, is living in these houses today.<br /><br />In addition, Evgeniy Schneider appends a brief history of the Jewish community of Starokonstantinov. I&#39;ve transcribed it.</p>
<div id="wb_staroconstantinovText3">&quot;Jews have lived in Starokostiantyniv since the end of the 16th century. In 1629, there were 130 Jewish families (about 25% of the total population), and the community was the second largest in Volyn. During the Khmelnytsky period, the Jews of the city and the surrounding area took refuge in the fortress. On the Ninth of Av, the Cossacks broke in and killed everyone. Starokostiantyniv was also destroyed several times by the Haidamaks in the early 18th century. But Jews continued to settle there, and in 1765, 1,801 Jews were registered in the city and its surrounding area. In 1802, the number of Jews was 2,053. In 1827, when Tsar Nicholas I issued an order to mobilize Jews into the Russian army, serious unrest broke out in Starokostiantyniv. In 1847, there were 6,611 Jews in the community, and in 1897, 9,212 (60.7% of the total population). Most of the local Jews were Hasidim, followers of the tzaddikim of the Chernobyl and Sadagora dynasties. In 1911, the city&#39;s population was about 20,000, including 11,800 Jews. With the establishment of Soviet power in Volyn in 1920, the Jewish community was disbanded. By 1926, there were 6,934 Jews in the city (41.3% of the population). There was a secondary school with instruction in Yiddish.<br />At the end of 1931, there were 4,837 Jews in the city (about 33% of the population), of whom more than a quarter were deprived of the right to vote (&quot;disenfranchised&quot;).&#0160; The Germans occupied Starokostiantyniv on July 8, 1941. In late August 1941, the Jews were confined to a ghetto. The Jewish population of Starokostiantyniv and its environs was exterminated in a series of actions from August 1941 to November 1942.&#0160; Today, the town has a small Jewish community, &quot;Shalom.&quot; In 2012, it had 80 members.&quot;&#0160; A tragic story.</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>The website posts another picture that intrigues me. It&#39;s an old photograph, probably from the the turn of the last century, of Jewish workers in what is called a &quot;cigarette factory.&quot; I know that when Isaiah came to America, in 1895, he made his living rolling cigars. I just wonder if he followed a trade that he had begun in Starokonstantinov. Would he, perhaps, have recognized any of these contemporary, doomed Jewish workers?</div>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>It&#39;s humiliating for me to confess that until a few weeks ago I had never heard of the Piacenza Liver, which is a life-size bronze Etruscan replica of the liver of a sheep, and unquestionably European civilization&#39;s most heralded metal liver. How could I not have known?&#0160;</p>
<p>The PL was unearthed in 1877 and dates from the first century BCE. Here&#39;s a picture of this most important artifact:</p>
<p><a class="mw-file-description" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Piacenza_Bronzeleber.jpg"><img class="mw-file-element" data-file-height="1266" data-file-width="1914" decoding="async" height="172" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Piacenza_Bronzeleber.jpg/260px-Piacenza_Bronzeleber.jpg" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Piacenza_Bronzeleber.jpg/390px-Piacenza_Bronzeleber.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Piacenza_Bronzeleber.jpg/520px-Piacenza_Bronzeleber.jpg 2x" width="260" /></a></p>
<div class="isv-r PNCib ViTmJb BUooTd" data-cb="3" data-cl="0" data-cr="0" data-ct="6" data-deckid="RKnxVg0oRgj_3M" data-hveid="16" data-id="5gGvlglMMzBy6M" data-oh="375" data-ow="640" data-rel="1" data-ri="10" data-sc="1" data-tbnid="5gGvlglMMzBy6M" data-tw="293" data-ved="0CBAQxiAoCmoXChMI8KP9i-O3hAMVAAAAAB0AAAAAEBo" role="listitem">
<div class="fR600b islir">Because my knowledge of sheep livers is so appallingly slim, and because most readers of this blague are not doubt similarly ignorant, let me quote an expert description of the object: &quot;In the Etruscan model, the liver is reversed, with the convex part of the gallbladder pointing down. On the right side of the gallbladder, we find a pyramid-shaped structure that was referred to as the processus pyramidalis corresponding with the caudate lobe in humans. On the other side of the gallbladder, we see a protrusion that was called the processus papillaris corresponding with the paracaval part of the caudate lobe.&quot; In other words, it&#39;s one heck of an accurate liver model. Yet It is not its fidelity to the shape and form of a sheep liver that makes the PL so crucial: it&#39;s the markings and inscriptions on its face. As you can see, the surface of the PL is divided into segments, on each one of which is inscribed a word or two in the long-extinct Etruscan language.</div>
<div class="fR600b islir">&#0160;</div>
<div class="fR600b islir">This find is obviously not one of your run-of-the-mill uninformative liver sculptures. It&#39;s brimming with meaning. Let us recall that Etruria was an advanced and prosperous civilization that dominated northwestern Italy from about 800 BCE to 500 BCE until it&#0160; gradually fell under the sway of the ambitious militaristic Romans. In the ancient world, Etruscans were famous not only for their arts and commerce, but also for their skill in consulting the gods through the process of haruscopy -- divination by examining the liver of a sacrificed sheep. The Etruscans passed along this accomplishment to the Romans who rarely made important decisions without the advice of the gods, which they acquired through the medium of a professionally certified haruspex. Inasmuch as the Romans, employing haruscopy, ruled the world for a thousand years, the power of the sheep liver-and-haruspex team cannot but be acknowledged.&#0160;</div>
<div class="fR600b islir">&#0160;</div>
<div class="fR600b islir">I have no idea, nor do scholars of the Etruscans, know when or why haruscopy originated. Etruscan civilization is replete with mysteries and moreover the Etruscan language is not fully understood. It&#39;s an &quot;isolate&quot; -- like Basque --an island in a sea of Indo-European languages to which it bears no relation. Etruscans arrived in Italy a long time ago -- long before they possessed a written language. When? From where did they come? How did it happen that they became proficient in haruscopy?&#0160; No one knows and there are not even any decent theories -- it&#39;s all lost in the dark backward and abysm of time.</div>

<div>Readers of a skeptical bent will wonder, what special powers are incorporated in the liver of a sheep?&#0160; Why not the pancreas or the spleen? Some might even ask, why a sheep?&#0160; Why not, for example, goats?&#0160; Goats are far more intelligent than sheep, and it stands to reason that a goat liver would house more prophetic oomph than the liver of a mouflon or an urial. For that matter, why is haruscopy to be preferred to less messy systems of augury such as ornithomancy, which utilizes the flights of birds, or ceraunoscopy, which works by the study of lightning and thunder. No bloody sacrificing required in either case. Livers, in my opinion, though I&#39;ve never come face to face with a sheep&#39;s, are kind of gross and not for the squeamish. But as William Cowper told us many years ago, &quot;God moves in a mysterious way,/ His wonders to perform&quot; and although Cowper was not specifically referring to the multiple gods of the polytheistic Etruscans, his words certainly apply. So divination by liver it was and has remained so. Whether or not the Romans would have conquered the world without the Etruscan facility with sheep livers is impossible to say.&#0160; &#0160;</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>A closer look at the PL reveals that each demarcated section is inscribed with a series of Etruscan letters. Inasmuch as Etruscan is an extinct language that has been only deciphered in part, the words are not fully understood.&#0160; Although Etruscan is almost impossible to translate, it&#39;s easy to transliterate, because the script is written in a version of the alphabet devised by some Phoenician genius and then passed along to the Euboean Greeks and then on to the Etruscans and to the Romans and eventually to us.&#0160;</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>Here&#39;s the most recent transcription of a part of the outside ring of words on the PL.</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" class="LAA3yd">&#0160;</div>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="LAA3yd">Kind of impenetrable, is it not?&#0160; Almost entirely opaque with only a few good guesses. But, alas, that&#39;s the sorry state of Piacenza Liver knowledge. Scholars are agreed that the markings are the names of the various gods -- each associated with a section of the live. It follows that the PL is a teaching instrument, a show-and-tell. It&#39;s not difficult to picture a veteran learned haruspex instructing his or her aspiring students to study the PL closely. Any peculiarity or disorder or irregularity in the liver would reveal much to a gifted haruspex.&#0160;&#0160;</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>It&#39;s shocking to me that the tourist-oriented website of the city of Piacenza advertises its Duomo, a 12th century Romanesque church, its Passerini-Landi Library, and the Palazzo Farnese, a 16th century great house, but offers not the slightest mention of its foremost liver (which is housed in the palazzo). An inexplicable omission.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>In the course of my lifetime, the telephone has gone from relatively rare to ubiquitous, from wall to pocket, and from rotary dial to cell. From no intelligence whatsoever to smart and then to very smart. Revolutionary changes.</p>
<p>When I was growing up in Flatbush, our family was prosperous enough to have a telephone (not everyone did), but the device was only employed for local calls, never for &quot;long distance.&quot; Non-local calls were prohibitively expensive and were only for deaths. To be called to the phone by long-distance was ominous.</p>
<p>Before the innovation of seven-digit dialing, we were Windsor 6-2077. Sometime after WWII, our exchange was altered from WI 6 to GEdney 6. To me, this was an early indication that the world was unstable and would be filled with ups and downs. One day we were a Windsor, a royal house, and the next day we were a Gedney, a brand of dill pickle.&#0160;</p>
<p>Every telephone in existence looked exactly like this one.&#0160; The idea that they would ever look otherwise was inconceivable.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef02b7516fe99d200b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Screen Shot 2023-02-08 at 9.55.22 AM" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef02b7516fe99d200b image-full img-responsive" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef02b7516fe99d200b-800wi" title="Screen Shot 2023-02-08 at 9.55.22 AM" /></a></p>
<p>For a month of so in the late 1950s, I had a job operating an old-fashioned switchboard at the Sears warehouse on Utica Avenue -- definitely my most satisfying telephone-related experience, lifetime. Ah that lovely click when the plug fully entered its receptacle! A delight!&#0160; The one I sat at looked almost exactly like this:</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef02b751944807200c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Screen Shot 2023-02-08 at 3.58.27 PM" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef02b751944807200c image-full img-responsive" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef02b751944807200c-800wi" title="Screen Shot 2023-02-08 at 3.58.27 PM" /></a></p>
<p>In my short time at the console, I became quite a proficient operator, only cutting off important calls a handful of times. It&#39;s hard to believe that such an antiquated-looking machine was still in use when I was a lad.</p>
<p>We must also recall the almost extinct telephone booth -- often out of order, because someone wielded a crowbar to make off with nickels and dimes. And smelly. Plus, one never had the right change when needing it most.&#0160; I do not mourn the passing of the phone booth.</p>
<p>When we moved to Vermont in 1968, the Topsham Telephone Company had not yet switched to seven digit dialing. Our home number was high-prestige 21, but we were jealous of the family whose number was 9. Ours was a four-party line -- also a thing of the past. I wonder whether my grandchildren have ever heard the phrase &quot;party-line.&quot;&#0160; Or &quot;rotary dial,&quot; for that matter.</p>
<p>When AT&amp;T was deregulated and the market was thrown open to innovation, there came a great explosion of telephone styles. Phones blossomed into many odd colors and configurations. For a while, we owned one of these:</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef02b7516fec5a200b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Screen Shot 2023-02-08 at 11.12.49 AM" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef02b7516fec5a200b image-full img-responsive" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef02b7516fec5a200b-800wi" title="Screen Shot 2023-02-08 at 11.12.49 AM" /></a></p>
<p>The Simpson phone was not my initiative but that of one of the younger members of the family.</p>
<p>But more change was in the works. The prediction that there would be pocket phones in the future seemed fantastical science fiction-y.&#0160; All phones had to be connected with wires -- otherwise how could the sound get out of the wall and into the handset. I scoffed.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef02b685273136200d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Screen Shot 2023-02-08 at 11.06.28 AM" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef02b685273136200d image-full img-responsive" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef02b685273136200d-800wi" title="Screen Shot 2023-02-08 at 11.06.28 AM" /></a></p>
<p>Nowadays, everyone carries a cell phone. But it&#39;s not just a phone -- it&#39;s a computer. It does everything -- perhaps too much. There is substance to the frequently heard complaint that some individuals, especially young &#39;uns, relate more readily to their cell than to the person sitting next to them. It&#39;s a paradox: with more potential communication comes more loneliness. I myself must admit that there&#39;s a fascination to the cell phone that is disarming.&#0160; I&#39;m trying not be allow myself to be addicted. But there is something wonderful about a machine that lets you not only speak with but to actually see your daughter, who is a thousand miles away. Not a trick that a rotary phone could perform.</p>
<p>Not to be an alarmist or a Luddite, there&#39;s a serious downside to the cell. It seems as though the machine&#0160; might be reorganizing youthful brains-- with unknown consequences,</p>
<p>Scenes like this one have become scarily familiar:</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef02b685273d6d200d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Screen Shot 2023-01-31 at 9.31.38 AM" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef02b685273d6d200d image-full img-responsive" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef02b685273d6d200d-800wi" title="Screen Shot 2023-01-31 at 9.31.38 AM" /></a><br /><br />Look up, children, look up! Please look up!</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Ukraine has been invaded and whole cities have been obliterated by the Putin dictatorship. It&#39;s tragic. Once again, I&#39;m overwhelmingly grateful that my grandparents chose to pack up and leave the blighted Ukraine. It&#39;s a decision that has looked better and better with each passing year.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>My father&#39;s family came from a Ukrainian &quot;shtetl&quot; called Starokonstantinov, or Alt Konstantin (&quot;old Constantine&quot;). As a youth, I overheard but did not understand conversations in Yiddish about a place that my grandparents called (phonetically) Xusantine-gebernia, where the X stands for a non-English deep guttural fricative. Seventy years ago I paid little attention to my eastern European ancestry. Now I&#39;m fascinated.</p>
<p>Where is Starokonstantinov?&#0160; What is a &quot;shtetl?&quot;</p>
<p>I&#39;ve just read Yohanan Petrovsky-Shtern&#39;s new (2014) and highly pertinent history, <em>The Golden Age Shtetl (</em>an oxymoronic title if there ever was one). Y P-S defines a shtetl as &quot;an East European market town in private possession of a Polish magnate, inhabited mostly but not exclusively by Jews, and subject to Russian bureaucracy.&quot; Starokonstantinov, he claims, was a &quot;quintessential shtetl.&quot; &quot;My&quot; ancestral shtetl lies in the western part of Ukraine, about 50 miles south of a line drawn between Lviv and Kyiv. Nowadays, it has a population of about 30,000 souls.</p>
<p>I know that my grandfather&#39;s people lived in Starokonstantinov from the middle of the nineteenth century, but I have no idea when they first arrived -- it might have been years or centuries before. The town itself is not an ancient foundation. It enters history only in the late 16th century when a Polish noble named Konstanty Ostrogski built himself a castle (which still survives) and took ownership of the surrounding area. Starokonstantinov was a &quot;private town&quot; -- meaning that it was owned by the Ostrogski family for several hundred years. In its first years, Starokonstantinov was included in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In 1569 it became part of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. In 1793, and for many years, even after my ancestors had struck out for the new world, it was a possession of the Russian Empire. Now it&#39;s in the independent Ukraine, and hoping to remain so.</p>
<p>The history of Starokonstantinov is marked by a series of tragedies prior to the one now in progress. An early disaster was the Battle of Starokonstantinov in 1648, which was a key event in the Chmielnicki Massacres of 1648-49. Eastern rite Cossacks broke into the fortified town and killed all of its 130 Jewish families and as many Polish Roman Catholics as they could find. During the early part of the 18th century, the Haidamack massacre of Uman by Cossacks spilled over into other Ukrainian shtetls, including &quot;mine.&quot; And then beginning in 1881 came the series of pogroms -- anti-Jewish peasant riots provoked and tacitly supported by the Russian officialdom. In Starokonstantinov, there were 6611 Jews in 1847 and 9212 (61% of the total population) in 1897. (There would have been two more if my grandparents hadn&#39;t seen the light in 1895). During the Nazi occupation in 1942, virtually all the remaining Jewish population (6731 in 1939) was murdered. It&#39;s a troubled, tragic history.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not sure what it means to say that a town was wholly owned by Polish nobility. Did the Ostrogskis own all the land, or the land and some of the buildings? Did they administer the public works? The churches? Did they possess the surrounding farms?&#0160; Did they own, until they were freed in 1861, the serfs?&#0160; Most likely, each shtetl had its own particular form of ownership (the late medieval world was anything but standardized). Y P-S does not explain; perhaps he assumes it&#39;s common knowledge.</p>
<p>Starokonstantinov occasionally makes an appearance in <em>The Golden Age Shtetl</em>.</p>
<p>I had not realized how active my ancestors might have been in the vodka trade. &quot;In Starokonstantinov, the possession of Countess Rzewuska, about fifty [Jewish-owned] inns and taverns yielded 67 percent of the town revenues.&quot; (Query: how and when did the shtetl pass from the Ostrogskis to the Rzewuskis, who were a very prominent and wealthy Polish family)? As far as I can tell, the &quot;town revenues&quot; went directly into the hands of the Polish overlords. In 1827, &quot;Starokonstantinov Jews realized the that their efforts to prevent the draft of men for twenty to twenty five year terms in the Russian army [had failed], and the Jewish populace turned against their own kahal elders and attacked their houses.&quot; &quot;Local police had to summon an additional army unit to suppress the outburst.&quot; (The &quot;kahal&quot; was a committee of prominent Jewish citizens who were the nominal governors [under Polish supervision] of the Jewish population.) In the first half of the nineteenth century, the divorce rate among Jewish couples in Starokonstantinov, was 16 percent. In larger cities, it was even higher (in Letichev it was 47 percent). Y P-S attributes the surprisingly high rate of failed marriages to the relative freedom of Jewish women and to the breakdown of traditional constraints as the Jewish population became increasingly urbanized. A major fire in Starokonstantinov in 1835 hastened the shtetl&#39;s decline. Russian travelers found Starokonstantinov and especially its roads deplorable. &quot;A Russian army officer observed that Starokonstantinov is dirty beyond any measure: but &#39;if we bother ourselves to learn the reasons for this situation, we would perhaps find out that even the Jews, whom are usually blamed, have nothing to do with it.... To drive through the streets of the town is a real challenge, as there is no pavement. Stones once paving the road have long sunk into the soils. When it is raining, they do nothing but prevent movement.&#39;&quot; Mud season in Starokonstantinov must have been an annual challenge. Nevertheless, Starokonstantinovites were readers: a merchant estimated that in the shtetl there were &quot;about 20,000 books, mostly prayer books, bible and bible commentaries, tractates on the Talmud and the Kabbalah.&quot; Y P-S thinks that this number must be a great exaggeration. But it&#39;s on the record that a merchant named Pinhas Yosef Bromberg from Starokonstantinov brought twenty Hebrew books with him while traveling on business to St Petersburg.&#0160;</p>
<p>My great-grandfather was a participant in the commerce of Starokonstantinov. According to my father, he was a &quot;factor.&quot;&#0160; A &quot;faktor&quot; (Yiddish from German) was essentially a middleman. My ancestor had a horse and a wagon (perhaps, I allow myself to fantasize in a moment of self-aggrandizement, two horses and two wagons). According to tradition, he mostly dealt in grain, but factors such as he bought and sold whatever was available: wood, coal, ribbons, calico, mirrors, bolts and screws, vodka and wine. They did much of their business at fairs and Starokonstantinov was famous for its very prominent fair.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I&#39;ve been reading about the origin of spinning and weaving -- specifically E. J. W. Barber&#39;s <em>Prehistoric Textiles</em> (Princeton, 1991), a comprehensive and exhausting survey of everything that was known about the subject thirty years ago. I&#39;m dazzled -- in part by the author, who turns the story into an adventure, but even more so by our brilliant neolithic ancestors. Some among our forbears, starting perhaps 30,000 years ago, looked at this plant, common flax,&#0160;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linenme.com/us"><img alt="flax plant - linen fabric" class="aligncenter wp-image-242" height="360" src="https://www.linenbeauty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/flax-plants-linen-fabric.jpeg" title="linen plant - linen fabric" width="540" /></a></p>
<p>and figured out how to turn it into linen -- a complicated, many step process. How did they even begin to imagine such a transformation? Did they examine the plant and say, hey that looks like it will make a nice shirt or a pair of pants? To arrive at such a concept seems like an act of almost preternatural intelligence. After all, there was no template or model. It&#39;s not as though there were other fabrics made from other plants fibers. Flax into linen was a first. There were predecessors. Clothes, I imagine, in the form of animal skins or furs, must have been in use. I&#39;ve read that reeds and other plant materials had been plaited into baskets and nets. But flax into linen was not at all obvious. We can be proud of our ancestors.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a picture of the oldest recovered linen garment: the so-called Tarkhan Dress, which was found in a cemetery near Cairo in 1913 and radiocarbon-dated to between 3482 and 3102 BCE, or 5 and a half millennia ago. It&#39;s quite stylish and isn&#39;t in much worse shape than some of the favored garments in my own personal wardrobe.</p>

<p>This standing stone might look like an ordinary piece of granite, but it has a rich history. If you look very closely, you can almost see the two deep holes that have been drilled into it. Though it&#39;s now merely a garden ornament, decorating a perennial border, it was once a working fence post. Hinges would have been hammered into the holes.</p>
<p>We found this post up on the hill, deep in the second-growth forest, very close to the remains of what was either a well or a cesspool and beneath the giant senescent maple that must date from pre-Colonial times.</p>
<p>There&#39;s also a second megalith, also drilled but not visible in this picture, that now guards a parallel perennial border. Long ago, the two posts flanked an old farm road but the wooden gate that once stood between them had already rotted and disappeared fifty years ago when I first happened upon the posts.</p>
<p>The area where the post stood is surrounded by numerous substantial stone walls that once delineated the boundaries of various fields. Tom Roberts, who farmed the property from 1926 to 1967, told me that he grew apples and potatoes on the hill. There&#39;s no need for a gate for potatoes, so the posts must date from a previous era when the land was used to pasture sheep.</p>
<p>We decided to honor the posts by placing them in a more prominent position, so one day we loaded them into the bucket of the Deere tractor and brought them down. We dug a hole about a third the length of the post, chained it to the bucket, and lowered it into place. NGP is getting to be mighty skillful at maneuvering the tractor. The posts are handsome in their new situations. Robins like them too, as places to perch.</p>

<p>I read all 599 pages of Neil Price&#39;s just-published <em>Children of Ash and Elm,</em> a detailed history of the Vikings, and I&#39;m mighty proud of myself for persevering.&#0160; It&#39;s a long book bristling with details and data. The author, an archeologist, has made his own original contributions to Viking research. To produce this synthesis, he seems to have read every relevant article and monograph of generations of scholars. An impressive feat. I wonder, how much will my intermittently faulty memory retain?&#0160;</p>
<p>Has my understanding of the Vikings changed? Yes, I think it has. I knew that the Vikings were famous for cruelty, plunder, pillage and rape, but I had no idea that they were so deeply involved with human sacrifice and slavery.&#0160; &quot;The Vikings,&quot; says Price, &quot;were not only slavers, but the kidnapping, sale, and forced exploitation of human beings was always a central pillar of their culture.&quot; Slaving was &quot;the main element&quot; of commerce with Russian and Ukraine. The chapter on Viking slavery is grim reading indeed. It won&#39;t make you proud of your species.&#0160;</p>
<p>Here are a couple of Viking slave collars</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I&#39;ve just read Tim Birkhead&#39;s biography of <em>The Wonderful Mr Willoughby, The First True Ornithologist</em> (London, 2018). Birkhead&#39;s thesis is that Francis Willoughby was not merely a bird watcher, but an innovative, diligent, and imaginative scientist, the founder of a new area of knowledge.&#0160;</p>
<p>Ornithology when Willoughby (1635 –1672) started to look at birds was astonishingly primitive. For example, students did not even agree that birds migrated. Perhaps, as Aristotle had suggested, they hid in holes during the winter. Perhaps they transmuted from a species that departed to a species that arrived. With no observers in southern lands and no rapid communication, it&#39;s not surprising that it was hard to imagine that birds flew south in the fall and returned in the spring. Even now, when all is revealed, migration still seems, at least to me, to be mysterious, miraculous, and wondrously improbable.&#0160;</p>
<p>Before the &quot;new philosophy put all in doubt,&quot; the assumption that governed all &quot;science&quot; was that the natural world should be studied for evidence of divine wisdom -- a practice which blinkered understanding and limited speculation. The questions that people asked about birds were therefore not particularly challenging. They asked which ones were good to eat, which ones could be kept in cages, and which ones had medicinal value.&#0160;</p>
<p>The first task of new ornithology was simply to take a census. What birds live here, by what names are they called, and how should they be classified? &#0160;In the non-standardized late medieval world, most birds bore regional or demotic names, and sometimes the same name was attached two or more species of birds. It took a while before the ars-foot came to be recognized and conventionalized as the great-crested grebe and to earn the official designation Podiceps cristatus. It was the same with the such regionally-named birds as the annet, bald buzzard, the Bohemian chatterer, the copped douker, the coulterneb, the didapper, the dun-diver, the fern-owl, the flusher, the gid, the glead, the gorcock, the ox-eye, the pickmire, the puit, the puttock, the pyrag, the rock ouzel, the scarf, the skout, and the witwall? &#0160;It remained to be demonstrated that the &quot;yarwhelp&quot; &quot;was in fact the East Anglian name for the bar-tailed godwit and was to be distinguished from the similar black-tailed godwit.&quot; That the sea-pie was an oystercatcher. That the elegug was a guillemot. &quot;The sea-swallows they there (on Caldey Island) call spurs, and the razor-bills are called elegugus.... This name elelgug some attribute to the puffin, and some to the guillem[ot]; &#0160;indeed they know not what they mean by this name.&quot; Nomenclature was a thicket.</p>
<p>Willoughby was an energetic surveyor and classifier. But as he became more familiar with bird life, he started to ask questions of genuine scientific interest. What is the function of the tomial tooth? Do all birds of the same species have the same color iris? How many birds have rictal bristles? Do birds who lay two eggs produce one male and one female? Do female birds ever have two ovaries and two oviducts? Can birds hold on to their eggs at will, or are they laid involuntarily? How do birds survive the cold of winter? Why do birds molt?</p>
<p>While these are not necessarily the questions of a modern ornithologist, they certainly represent a new beginning. Many thanks to Birkhead for bringing Willoughby to our attention.</p>
<p>How sad that the first true ornithologist died at age thirty-six.&#0160;</p>

                                <p>Many years ago, sometime during the previous millennium, I was taken to an African game park -- elephants, rhinoceroses, giraffes, and lions (the hippos were AWOL). It was astonishing to see these huge beasts. I didn&#39;t realize at the time that it was semi-miraculous that these creatures had survived to our day, even in a de facto zoo, when so many other massive animals had recently gone extinct. When <em>homo sapiens</em> arrived on the scene, say 50,000 years ago, there were many animals that would have made a zoo park several orders of magnitude more remarkable that the one I visited. Why did these beasts go extinct? &#0160;Disease, habitat change, and competition are likely culprits but it&#39;s hard to deny that our predatory ancestors must take some of the blame. &#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Yes, the game park had lions, but it would have been infinitely more exciting if it housed not only the African lion, but the European lion&#0160;<span style="line-height: 1.3;">which was half again as large and which survived lately enough to be well known to the Greeks.</span></p>

<p>Other big cats were also missing: the famous saber tooth, everyone&#39;s nightmare, as well as the American false cheetah, a cheetah-like cougar weighing 190 formidable pounds. I would also have liked to see the thylacine, the so-called &quot;marsupial lion&quot; or sometimes &quot;Tasmanian tiger&quot; which survived until 1936, late enough to be photographed.<a class="irc_mil i3597" data-noload="" data-ved="2ahUKEwitucqSuubfAhUSO30KHYjZAxIQjRx6BAgBEAQ" href="https://www.news.com.au/technology/science/animals/not-science-fiction-any-more-the-tasmanian-tiger-could-soon-be-back-from-extinction/news-story/b26dcb89e8c28f1232b5153e2c2c07e7" jsaction="mousedown:irc.rl;focus:irc.rl" rel="noopener" tabindex="0" target="_blank"></a></p>

<p>I would also have liked to see a cackle of European hyenas. Even more, the two-ton short-faced Bear, with whom our paleolithic ancestors competed, which was three times the size of a modern polar bear. The equally large ground sloth, even the bones of which are impressive.</p>
<p><a class="image" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Megatherium_americanum_Skeleton_NHM.JPG"><img alt="Megatherium americanum Skeleton NHM.JPG" data-file-height="2560" data-file-width="1920" height="293" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/Megatherium_americanum_Skeleton_NHM.JPG/220px-Megatherium_americanum_Skeleton_NHM.JPG" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/Megatherium_americanum_Skeleton_NHM.JPG/330px-Megatherium_americanum_Skeleton_NHM.JPG 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/Megatherium_americanum_Skeleton_NHM.JPG/440px-Megatherium_americanum_Skeleton_NHM.JPG 2x" width="220" /></a></p>
<p>And the sloth lemur, the size of a big male gorilla. The Irish deer, as big as a moose, with an outsized, out-of-proportion rack. Then there were the elephant-like animals: the Columbian mammoth of the American southwest, smaller than its modern African cousin, but with astonishingly curved tusks. The wooly mammoth, surviving until just 3700 years ago on Wrangel Island off the Siberian coast. The straight-tusked elephant, two or three times the size of modern African elephant. The North American mammoths. And also Cuvier&#39;s gompothere, which looks like an elephant but isn&#39;t one, but which was seven feet tall at the shoulder and which lasted until about 14,000 years ago:</p>

<p>And along with them, the morningstar-tailed glyptodon, a five thousand pound armadillo:&#0160;</p>

<p>I would have loved to cast my eye on the diprotodont, the largest known marsupial, which weighed in at three tons and lived until 45,000 years ago</p>
<p><a class="bia" data-ved="2ahUKEwjNg7TkheLfAhUM1oMKHYi3AWYQ_B0wE3oECAQQBg" href="https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/Diprotodon_optatum.jpg/220px-Diprotodon_optatum.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diprotodon&amp;h=165&amp;w=220&amp;tbnid=HPkNwKxSjAYwbM:&amp;q=giant+diprotodon&amp;tbnh=150&amp;tbnw=200&amp;usg=AI4_-kSgHJvlChfL4u8a6oKOnhAgJpw2Ew&amp;vet=1&amp;docid=VNT4Bj14we5RRM&amp;itg=1&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjNg7TkheLfAhUM1oMKHYi3AWYQ_B0wE3oECAQQBg" id="HPkNwKxSjAYwbM:" jsaction="fire.ivg_o" role="link" tabindex="0"><img alt="Image result for giant diprotodon" class="rISBZc M4dUYb" data-atf="3" height="150" id="dimg_4" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef022ad3ccd444200b-pi" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diprotodon" width="200" /></a></p>
<p>The wooly rhinoceros, as large as a diprotodont. The sivathere, an odd-looking &#0160;giraffid. The tree kangaroo. The short-faced kangaroo, three times the size of any living kangaroo.</p>
<p>And right there in Vermont, rustling and stomping in the forest, were the stag moose and Jefferson&#39;s ground sloth and the long-nosed peccary and Harlan&#39;s musk ox and the Vero tapir and the giant beaver, all recently gone. (You wouldn&#39;t have wanted to come face-to-face with a giant beaver. Or swim in its pond, if it made ponds. You&#39;d be better off listening to it slapping its tail in a game &#0160;park.)</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 4: A scaled cartoon showing the size of the largest Giant Beaver, relative to an adult human.

<p>&#0160;And then there were some true avian oddities worth taking a gander at:&#0160;the flightless moas of New Zealand, the female at 440 pounds, two-and-half times the size of the male. The cursorial owl, a three-foot tall flightless owl, which pursued its prey afoot. Haast&#39;s eagle, with a wingspread of seven and a half feet. The&#0160;five hundred pound Elephant Bird, which survived in Madagascar until a thousand years ago.&#0160;</p>
<p>And then the tarpan, the warrah, the toxodon. Strangest of all,&#0160;macrauchenia, a three-toed ungulate not closely related to anything alive today, which looked something like a humpless camel with a droopy snout and which was around until about 10,000 years ago.&#0160;</p>

<p>It would have been quite a show if these animals had survived. Well worth the price of admission.&#0160;</p>

                                <p>Dear Talia, Oliver, Ella, Lola, Luke, Caleb, and Asher:&#0160;</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a picture of your great grandmother, Anne Krull Goss (1912-2009) with her siblings.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef022ad3ad65eb200d-pi"><img alt="Akgsibs1" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef022ad3ad65eb200d img-responsive" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef022ad3ad65eb200d-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Akgsibs1" /></a><br />Anne is the pretty young blonde woman, second from the left. She&#39;s the oldest.</p>
<p>The picture was taken during the World War II years, &#39;42 or &#39;43. On great grandma&#39;s right is her brother Jack, whose tank was hit by cannon fire. He was the only survivor of his crew and spent many months recuperating in an army hospital. On her left is Hy, who was exempted from service, if I remember correctly, because his business was declared an essential industry. On Hy&#39;s left is your great-great aunt Frieda. Frieda&#39;s fiance (a soldier who was named Aubrey, but I don&#39;t know anything else about him) was killed in Europe. On Frieda&#39;s left is Mendy, the youngest, who was a bombardier on a B-24.</p>
<p>The war disrupted many lives, not only those who served but those who stayed at home. &#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been lucky -- too young for Korea and too old for Vietnam. I hope you are similarly lucky. &#0160;Better than that -- &#0160;I hope these endless wars in which we&#39;re engaged (in Afghanistan and Syria right now) come to an end.</p>
<p>Grandma Anne contributed 1/8 of your genetic inheritance. The people depicted here might seem to come from the remote past, but be aware that they&#39;re in you, part of you.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I&#39;ve been reading about the death of Alexander at the beginning of the Hellenistic period. It&#39;s all new to me, and much of it is fascinating, especially about cultural matters, but there&#39;s also page after page of difficult-to-retain accounts of warfare and of particular battles. Here&#39;s an example of the kind of material that takes up three-quarters or perhaps even 80% of the book. &#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;The two armies faced each other quite conventionally, with the phalanx composed mostly of Lysimachus&#39; and Cassander&#39;s troops confronting Antigonus&#39;&#0160; phalanx. On their right, Seleucus and Lysimachus stationed a vast mass of Seleucus&#39; &#0160;light infantry; on the left was their heavy cavalry commanded by Seleucus&#39; son Antiochus. &#0160;Confronting Antiochus was Demetrius in command of Antigonus&#39; &#0160;heavy cavalry. As the battle commenced, Demetrius and his cavalry charged Antiochus and drove the enemy cavalry off. Demetrius proceeded to commit the worst blunder a cavalry leader can commit: he over-pursued, leaving the main battle well behind, instead of turning to attack the enemy infantry from behind. As soon as Demetrius had disappeared in the distance, Seleucus brought forward four hundred war elephants and placed them as a screen between Demetrius and his path back to the battle. Meanwhile Lysimachus&#39; phalanx came to grips with that of Antigonus, and Seleucus led his light cavalry in an outflanking maneuver to attack Antigonus&#39; infantry from behind....&quot; &#0160;Etc.&#0160;</p>
<p>Exactly what is at stake in this war? The historian (Richard Billows, <em>Before and After Alexander</em> [New York, 2018]) leaves us rather in doubt. He puts no emphasis on the usual economic or ideological issues; the struggle seems to be entirely about personalities. Will the kingdom be ruled by Lysimachus or Demetrius, by Antiochus or Antigonus? &#0160;It doesn&#39;t seem to matter, either to me or to the historian.</p>
<p>But what of the soldiers? &#0160;Whether on one side or the other, they&#39;re likely to be impaled by the dreaded Macedonian larissa, trampled by horses, or squished by elephants. For what purpose?</p>
<p>I think that at one point in my life I might have been intrigued by these dynastic struggles, but now, what I feel most strongly is sympathy for the ordinary soldier and sorrow for the stupidity of my species.</p>

It&#39;s a fishy sauce that any sensible modern apple-pie-loving American would avoid at all costs. Trust me, you would not want to slaver your bacon cheeseburger with garum. &#0160;</p>
<p>To make garum, the innards -- the guts -- of fish (whitebait, anchovies, mackerel, tuna, etc.) were stacked between layers of salt and herbs and left in the sun for several months. Honest to Pete!! The result, which must have been malodorous and horrid, was then strained and bottled, or rather, poured into amphorae for transport.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t believe me? Here&#39;s a direct quotation from a 10th century Byzantine manual: &quot;the intestines of fish are thrown into a vessel and are salted; and small fish especially atherinae, or maenae or lycostomi are seasoned in the sun, and frequently turned; and when they have been seasoned in the heat, the garum is thus taken from them. A small basket of close texture is laid in the vessel filled with the small fish already mentioned, and the garum will flow into the basket.&quot; Sounds dreadful, you must admit. And I don&#39;t even know, and I don&#39;t know that anyone knows, exactly what sort of monsters of the deep are designated by the words atherinae and lycostomi.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a picture of a ruined garum factory in Baelo Claudia in Spain. The remains of such factories can be found all over the Mediterranean world. I myself have toured one near Pompeii. Garum factories were set as far as possible from centers of population because they, er, stunk.&#0160;</p>

<div class="magnify">Garum was the ancients&#39; ketchup. What could they have been thinking?</div>
<div class="magnify">&#0160;</div>
<div class="magnify">Strange to say, there&#39;s a etymological link between ancient fish sauce and modern ketchup. <span style="line-height: 1.2em;">In the 1600s, there existed a Chinese concoction that was called, depending on the dialect, a</span><span style="line-height: 1.2em;">kôe-chiap or kê-chiap,&#0160;</span><span style="line-height: 1.2em;">guī zhī, or&#0160;</span><span style="line-height: 1.2em;">gwai</span><span style="line-height: 1.2em;">&#0160;zap;&#0160;</span><span style="line-height: 1.2em;">all these apparently translated as &quot;the brine of pickled fish.&quot; By the early 18th century, the sauce had arrived in the present day region of Malaysia and Singapore, where it came to the attention of hungry, hardened &#0160;English colonists.The Malay word for the sauce was kicap </span><span style="line-height: 1.2em;">(pronounced &quot;kay-chap&quot;). </span><span style="line-height: 1.2em;">English settlers took kay-chap with them to the American colonies. </span></div>
<div class="magnify">&#0160;</div>
<div class="magnify"><span style="line-height: 1.2em;">But kay-chap was a long way from our familiar ketchup. The commonest kay-chap of the 18th century was not tomato but mushroom based. Tomato ketchup was a mid-19th century invention -- the first recipe for &quot;Tomata Catsup&quot; appearing in 1812. </span><span style="line-height: 1.2em;">Ketchup was popular long before fresh tomatoes because tomatoes were thought to be dangerous and possibly poisonous. A man named J</span><span style="line-height: 1.2em;">onas Yerkes is thought to be the first American to sell tomato ketchup in a bottle. But his initiative was overtaken and displaced by the 1876 ketchup launched by Henry Heinz. </span><span style="line-height: 1.2em;"><span style="line-height: 1.2em;">Heinz still controls 60% of the ketchup market.&#0160;</span></span>

<div class="magnify">Ketchup was not used in my family of origin. It was a revelation when, a Brooklyn youth, I first discovered ketchup, along with french fries, in a local delicatessen.

                                <p>The ol&#39; dreamatorium was working overtime last night. The protagonist, who was and who was not me was a mature, bearded gentleman, a prosperous landowner in what seemed like the antebellum South. He, or he/I, was the target of a plot by a younger cousin in league with a scuzzy lawyer to have him/me declared insane -- and therefore his/my property to be confiscated and transferred to the control of the villainous cousin. The heart of the dream was a hearing or trial in which he/I was cross examined and every of his emotions mischaracterized by the lawyer and the panel of mental health experts. For example, if he/I expressed indignation and anger, it was interpreted as paranoia; if he/I remained impassive it was understood as catatonia. Every emotion became its parodic extreme. As a result, he/I was placed in an institution; a rather bucolic one, but still a place of incarceration. However, after some while, another hearing was held, and he/I was able to convince a judge that there had been a miscarriage of justice. So he/I was set free to reclaim his property. But, he/I said to the judge, I have no money, no clothes, no means of transportation, so no one will believe me. The judge then offered to loan me/him some money, but was clear that it was a loan, not a gift. In the last scene of the dream, he/I is mounted on a horse (black and white one, like a Holstein), wearing a Confederate uniform, and carrying, believe it or not, a shiny sword. Then I woke up.</p>
<p>I cannot interpret this beaut, this honey of a dream.&#0160; It was very cinematic, very vivid, and very long. But it doesn&#39;t apply to my life in any obvious way. I&#39;ve never been accused of insanity, never lost any property, don&#39;t know any corrupt lawyers, never been institutionalized, never even been on a horse, and certainly don&#39;t carry a sword.&#0160; Moreover, it was an undreamlike dream: no fantastic elements or objects morphing into other objects. It seemed less like a dream than like a lost chapter or sub-pot to&#0160;<em>Gone with the Wind</em>. Mighty puzzling.</p>

                                <p>Donald Trump has taken credit for the rise in the stock market. &quot;The stock market hit yet another record high yesterday. There is great confidence in the moves that my Administration is making.” If he is responsible for the rise, then surely he is also responsible for the fall. It can be no accident, and can only be a signal from the other world, that Trump&#39;s market fell exactly 666 points last Friday. One trillion of market value was erased with the wave of the supernatural wand. Six hundred and sixty- six is &quot;the number of the beast&quot; in <em>Revelation.</em>&#0160;Inasmuch as everything happens for a reason, we must ask what the Lord is telling us. The 666 point drop undeniably demonstrates that DT is &quot;the man of sin&quot; who &quot;opposes and exalts himself above every god or object of worship&quot;&#0160;(<cite>2 Thessalonians 2:1). </cite><span style="line-height: 1.2em;">He is the false god who has erected his tower at 666 Fifth Avenue. Heed, O supporters of Trump, the words and acts of the Lord, for the man of the flaming hair is the egg of the serpent, the false prophet, the anti-Christ.</span></p>

                                <p>Dear grandchildren:</p>
<p>I once asked my father, your great-grandfather Emanuel Pearlman, where in the Ukraine we originated. He said that he was told that it was a village called (and here he used a very deep guttural initial consonant) Xhosantin-gebernya &#0160;-- an answer that left me not much enlightened. If he knew more -- and I don&#39;t think he did -- he didn&#39;t say. Our family did not cultivate nostalgia for the old country. Nor much curiosity either. We had no reason to yearn.</p>
<p>But new information about our past has recently come to me. According to a correspondence between my late cousin Marion and a distant Israeli relative, it is now clear that our family hails from the the town of StaryConstantine -- also called Starokostiantiyniv in Ukrainian and Alt Konstantine in Yiddish. It was a small city of perhaps 30,000 people at its height, founded, as far as wikipedia and I can figure, in the sixteenth century by a noble or wealthy person named Konstanty Ostrogski who built himself a castle sometime during the 1560s. Castles are built for protection in lawless places, but then, most places were lawless in late medieval Europe. Old Constantine is in northern Ukraine at the junction of the Ikopot and Sluch rivers. Here&#39;s a picture of the Old Constantine castle across from the Sluch: &#0160;&#0160;</p>

<p>But when, you ask, did your and my ancestors settle in Old Constantine? &#0160;I remember it mentioned when I was a child that our family came to the Ukraine from &quot;the west&quot;, which I assumed to be Germany because my grandmother Eta&#39;s maiden name was Hessel (though in fact Hessel is more commonly Danish rather than German). The Jewish community in Old Constantine dates to the sixteenth century, it is reported. &quot;The town’s Jews suffered Cossack onslaughts during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. At the end of the nineteenth century, more than half of the town’s population was Jewish.&quot; That&#39;s all we know.</p>
<p>However, in the nineteenth century, there lived in Old Constantine a husband and wife named Yaakov and Menucha Sheindl Perelman. They dwelt in a house on the corner of Ragnedinshkaya and Bolshaya Vasikovshaya streets (a house which was destroyed during the second world war). Yaakov Mikolshtein Perelman was born about 1830, lived a long life, and died in about 1920. According to the story, he resided in the one house his entire life. His wife, Menucha Sheindl came from Radomyshyl, a village not far from Old Constantine that was historically a center of Jewish settlement. (In 1797 a total of 1,424 people or 80% of the total population were Jewish). Menucha Sheindl Perelman was the daughter of a sugar and wool merchant named Solomon Rabinovich, who was so rich that &quot;they changed houses for Passover&quot; -- which is a custom heretofore unknown to me. Menucha died in 1908 at age 75 or thereabouts. The family, once wealthy, lost everything in the 1917 revolution and the disorder and purges that followed. &#0160;</p>
<p>And how are Yaakov and Menucha related to you, my grandchildren? &#0160;Well, they&#39;re your great-great-great grandparents. According to the newly discovered information, they had eighteen children &quot;mostly twins,&quot; of whom only nine survived to adulthood. Seven daughters were born before your great-great grandfather Isaiah (also called Buzya or Buzzy) saw the light. Isaiah it is reported, was born &quot;the year the serfs were freed,&quot; which is 1861, but I know that he was 83 when he died in 1946, so I calculate that he was born in 1863. But perhaps Isaiah didn&#39;t know his own age which wouldn&#39;t have been unusual in an era of bad record keeping. When he was thirty-five, Isaiah emigrated to America, arriving in 1896 or thereabouts.</p>
<p>Why did he set out for the New World? &#0160;Certainly the troubled conditions in Old Constantine were reason enough. But there&#39;s also something of a story. Isaiah married (I don&#39;t know whom) but after one night of marriage he asked for a divorce. I don&#39;t know if the divorce was granted, but I do know that very soon afterward he left town with Eta (or Yetta) Hessel, also from Old Constantine. She was 23 or 24, a decade or a dozen years younger than he.&#0160;</p>
<p>Why the one-day marriage? &#0160;No one knows what happened that night, but it couldn&#39;t have been good. A sexual impediment? &#0160;An arranged marriage gone bad? &#0160;Prior misdeeds come to light?&#0160; The discovery of pregnancy?&#0160; We&#39;re free to speculate, but never to know.&#0160;</p>
<p>However, we do know that Isaiah and his father did not see the world with the same eyes. Yaakov was religious; his son Isaiah was an atheist. We don&#39;t know Yaakov&#39;s politics, but we know that Isaiah was some sort of leftist or communist. Something of a free-thinker, after the style of Moses Mendelssohn. And perhaps Karl Marx. And we can also guess that it might have been impossible to remain in Old Constantine after the marriage contretemps.&#0160;</p>
<p>In New York City, Isaiah and Yetta had four children: Max, born around 1896, Solomon, born about 1898; Mollie, born in 1900; and my father Emanuel, the youngest, born on December 22, 1904.</p>
<p>My grandfather Isaiah also had two younger brothers. There was Chaim, who followed him to America some years later and from whose daughter Rose spring the Goldberg and Chodosh lines. And also Isaiah&#39;s youngest brother, who was named Meshulam Zusi Perelman. He did not follow his older brothers, and I don&#39;t know his history, but his family left the Ukraine and it&#39;s his Israeli granddaughter Nechama Sheindl Brukman (born Perlman) through whom these facts were recovered. Nechama Brukman died in 2008 at age 86.</p>
<p>It is most melancholy to read that in 1939 there were 6,743 Jews living in Old Constantine, accounting for 31 percent of the total population, and that the entire Jewish community, some no doubt our cousins, were murdered during the first years of the war.</p>

                                <p>In Charles Dickens&#39; <em>Great Expectations</em>, it is reported that the woman who is eventually revealed to be Estella&#39;s mother was married &quot;over the broomstick (as we say), to a tramping man.&quot; Dickens offers no explanation for &quot;over the broomstick,&quot; apparently assuming that it was a concept with which his readers were familiar. There is in fact a long tradition of &#39;jumping the broom&quot; to certify informally a marriage sanctioned neither by state or church. It was practiced in west Africa where it symbolized the sweeping away of the old life and of a leap into the new world of fertility and increase. &quot;Jumping the broom&quot; was also a frequent practice in southern American slave culture where legal marriage was prohibited. The custom was a feature of ancient Celtic societies, especially among the Welsh and the Picts. As practiced by the Picts, broom jumping neither predicted nor solicited fertility. &#0160;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I was six years old when the war ended in 1945, so my memories are few and arise in no particular order. I remember hearing news reports on the radio that were datelined &quot;Moscow&quot;-- but I conflated Moscow with Bosco, a brand of chocolate syrup popular in the 1940s. I remember that the floor of our kitchen was disfigured with an infinite number of black marks -- rubber was in short supply and the substituted soles left nasty blotches. My mother said, &quot;We&#39;ll wait until the war is over to replace the linoleum.&quot; Many commodities were in short supply: instead of butter there was a white oleomargerine into which a packet of orange food color was mashed to simulate a credible yellow. There were ration books and ration stamps for gasoline and sugar and coffee and greens. My mother was furious that Mr. Lerner, who owned the fruit and vegetable shop on 18th Avenue, sold black-market lettuces from the back of his store. A bus driver was rude to a passenger; my mother said: &quot;all the decent young men are overseas.&quot; We saved our nickels and brought money to school to buy war bonds. Following government advice, my father dug up his carefully tended lawn and planted a &quot;victory garden&quot; of vegetables. There were frequent blackouts: my father&#39;s friend Jack Patent sported a white hard hat because he was a warden. My Uncle Dan, a major in the Army Air Corps, came home from the Burma border for a thirty-day furlough and showed me his captured German Luger. We received air mail letters from him and from other soldiers with details blacked out by military censors. I complained to my mother: &quot;Mrs. Callery (my first grade teacher) isn&#39;t nice to me.&quot; My mother said, &quot;You have to forgive her; she&#39;s lost four of her boys in the war.&quot; Lost?&#0160; Four of her boys? I did not understand. On a sunny spring day in 1945, we heard on the radio that President Roosevelt was dead; my mother sat on the stoop and cried. And in August of that same year, when our family was visiting someone on a lake somewhere, all of a sudden the adults who had motor boats were zooming back and forth and shouting and laughing. I asked what was happening and my father said, &quot;the war is over.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>Uncle Jack&#39;s tank was demolished by German cannon fire and he was the crew&#39;s only survivor. He lived with shrapnel in his brain until the age of ninety-one. Cousin Saul&#39;s older brother was killed in New Guinea, but Sarah, his mother, &quot;knew&quot; that he was alive and waited for the knock on the door or the telephone call until the end of her days. Meanwhile, the poor fellow&#39;s bones lay bleaching at Buna or some other long-forgotten field of battle. Before the war, my mother told me, we used to receive mail from the old country -- from the many members of the Chafetz and Tomaszewski and Middlebank and Hessel families who had stayed behind. &quot;But after the war, nothing.&quot;</p>
<p>Can we, even now, bear to imagine what became of all those Malkas and Rifkas and Levs and Mendels?&#0160; &#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>One of the most joyful of nursery rhymes, and a personal favorite, is this brilliant piece of poetry: &#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160; Crosspatch,</p>
<p>&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160; Draw the latch.</p>
<p>&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160; Sit by the fire and spin.</p>
<p>&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160; Take a cup,</p>
<p>&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160; And drink it up.</p>
<p>&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160; Then call the neighbors in.</p>
<p>The clicky rhymes and jaunty meter are undeniably beautiful -- and there&#39;s much more complexity than first meets the eye. &#0160;</p>
<p>In the first triad, a &quot;crosspatch,&quot; -- a &quot;cross or ill-tempered person, usually a girl or woman&quot;-- is at work, spinning; in the second triad, she&#39;s exhorted to drink and also to invite her neighbors &quot;in&quot; -- presumably into the room, or just as likely, the tiny cottage-- where she lives alone. In the first strophe, the theme is isolation, but in the second, isolation is challenged by the calls of society and by the hope of a more satisfactory and convivial life.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>What can we know about the surly individual addressed by the evocative designation, &quot;crosspatch?&quot;&#0160; The first element in the name --&quot;cross&quot;-- implies not only sourness, but also resistance, as in &quot;cross-grained.&quot; The second element--&quot;patch&quot;-- suggests that the crosspatch&#39;s discontent is not without cause. We can infer that she&#39;s poor because she&#39;s a person whose garments are either assembled from various rescued materials, as in &quot;patchwork,&quot; or that her clothes are, in another sense of the word patch, repaired. In addition, it&#39;s possible that ill health has caused her skin to become &quot;patchy.&quot; But &quot;patch&quot; also signals a degree of mental stress, as in Shakespeare&#39;s &quot;patched fool.&quot; In this signification, patch derives from Italian <em>pazzo</em>, crazy. The crosspatch is therefore disabled physically, socially and psychologically.</p>
<p>At the outset of the poem, our &quot;crosspatch&quot; sits glowering, impoverished, perhaps muttering indistinctly, friendless, without family, her youth blighted by poverty, huddled against the last embers of her dying fire. What is it that she is spinning? No doubt she ekes out a meagre living in the impersonal mercantilist &quot;putting-out&quot; system. Some exploitative proto-capitalist venturer has delivered to her lonely door a quantity of unspun wool or cotton; her job is to return the material to him in the processed form that will then be passed on to an equally poor weaver, then to a tailor, etc. She works alone and never sees the fruits of her labor except for the occasional, paltry farthing that allows her a bare subsistence. No wonder she is slightly barmy and has &quot;drawn the latch&quot; -- closed herself off from her fellows. But then, suddenly, comes the antistrophe, and in a series of importunate injunctives the crosspatch is solicited to rejoin the company of humanity. &quot;Take a cup,/ And drink it up,/ Then call the neighbors in.&quot; What&#39;s in the cup?&#0160; Spiritous liquors, no doubt, which, though designed to dull the pain of wage-slavery, also act to augment the revelry with which the poem climaxes. The wine is not sipped, but it is drained to the lees. And once the door is unlatched, and the neighbors -- neighbors of both sexes, no doubt,-- are called &quot;in,&quot; why then, let the libations and the wild rumpus begin!&#0160; Alienated labor is suddenly set aside and replaced by the natural bonds of one human being to another, and the stasis of the opening lines of the poem transforms in a flash into a wildly kinetic bacchanal. Emotional weakness transmutes into healthy liberated pleasure. Dour Puritanism, with its punishing work ethic, yields to the spirit of holiday and to pagan, perhaps even dionysian, excess. Here, in miniature, is the essence of the comic vision. In a few powerful lines, freedom, good humor, and natural appetite triumph over bondage, artificiality, social constriction and repression; the justifiably sullen crosspatch, in a burst of energy, reintegrates herself into the social nexus from which she has been banished.</p>
<p>Whether or not the crosspatch can permanently liberate herself from the oppressions of industrial capitalism, or whether the anodyne and spurious relief of alcohol is a merely transient solution is left unresolved. To ask a short poem, however dense with meaning, to answer so difficult a question would, just possibly, be to ask too much of it and, perhaps, to push the evidence the merest tad too far.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I asked some friends how they understood&#0160;Senator Marco Rubio&#39;s very blunt statement that &quot;Welders make more money than philosophers. We need more welders and less philosophers.&quot;&#0160; I received a variety of answers.</p>
<p>My linguistically conservative friends asserted that we obviously need grammarians more than either philosophers or welders, because Rubio doesn&#39;t respect the difference between &quot;less&quot; and &quot;fewer.&quot; I admit that &quot;less philosophers&quot; clanks on my sensitive inner ear; nevertheless, I don&#39;t think that it&#39;s wise to hold presidential candidates to high standards of usage. It would be enough for them to grasp the issues. No one I know is so very prescriptivist that he or she will vote for the candidate who knows the difference between less and fewer. I confess to a longing for a more perfect language from our leadership, but traditional&#0160;&#0160;grammar is too much to ask, especially since it&#39;s evident that our electorate easily acclimated to the barbarisms of <a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2005/11/some_of_bushs_m.html">bushlingo.</a>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Others of my friends took issue with Rubio&#39;s unabashed materialism. They parsed his statement to mean &quot;welders make more money than philosophers and <em>therefore </em> we should have more welders than philosophers.&quot; Welding is better than philosophizing because it makes the bucks, gathers the green. If this is what Rubio meant, then his argument is not only crass but wrong. Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics proves that both graduates with a philosophy degree and professional philosophers (meaning professors of philosophy) enjoy much larger salaries on average than welders. But even if welders did outearn philosophers, Rubio&#39;s argument would still be monumentally vulgar. I don&#39;t know anyone who, if push came to shove, assigns value strictly on the basis of earnings. Do we not value men of the cloth, social workers, nurses, small farmers, G.I&#39;s, smoke-jumpers and sometimes teachers more than we value pornstars and slumlords? Einsteins more than reality TV celebrities? And as much as we respect the crafts -- electricians, plumbers, tractor and auto mechanics -- we also know that it is not the craftsmen but the philosophers who now as in the past are going to help us think our way out of our plight. Just as Locke and Hume got us out of Aristotle and the Bible and into the age of reason, and Darwin laid the foundation for all the advances of the last hundred and fifty years in biology and medicine, so we now need someone, desperately, equipped with deep learning and an insightful brain, to generate the ideas that will get the new messy electronic world, bedeviled with fundamentalists/terrorists, into some kind of intellectual order. Welders are good, especially when you want something fastened to a steel I-beam, but philosophers have their place as well. Rubio is just too downright short-sighted for most of us. We know that money ain&#39;t everything and we want our statesmen to know it as well. Rubio&#39;s assertion that welders do more valuable work than thinkers participates in bottom-line American anti-intellectualism. We&#39;re a can-do practical people; we can see what welders do. Who knows what the heck those airy liberal philosophers do at those lefty universities? Can they fix a fuse? Can they meet a payroll?</p>
<p>Another bunch of my friends objected that there&#39;s no reason why a person can&#39;t be both a welder and a philosopher.&#0160;Why set limits on human versatility?&#0160; As it happens, I have in my own family a fellow who makes his living with his brain but who also builds his own furniture, can wire a house, and has, strange but true,&#0160;taken up welding.&#0160;But I think he&#39;d be the first to admit that he&#39;s not a pro at&#0160;any of these crafts.&#0160;We live in a world of specialists and it&#39;s hard to be perfectly skilled at two crafts, let alone a craft plus metaphysics or epistemology or&#0160;logic.&#0160;I understand the longing for the philosopher-welder, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a realistic wish. It&#39;s utopian, prelapsarian, perhaps even Marxist.&#0160;After all, it was Marx who developed the vision of post-capitalist communist society &quot;where nobody has one exclusive sphere of activity but each can become accomplished in any branch he wishes, [where] society regulates the general production and thus makes it possible to do one thing today and another tomorrow, to hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening, philosophize after dinner,&#0160;without ever becoming hunter, fisherman, herdsman or philosopher&quot; (<em>German Ideology</em> [1845]).&#0160;This is Marx at his least practical. I suspect that his hunters and fishermen would return&#0160;empty-handed, his herdsman would find that his cows never come home,&#0160;and his part-time philosophers would boggle&#0160;over some elementary error in logic or language.&#0160;So no dice to the philosopher-welder, I&#39;m afraid. Not a starter, Karl.</p>
<p>What I myself would want to ask Rubio is this: how does it happen that there are not enough welders?&#0160; Rubio puts his faith in the perfect workings of the free market. In theory, the market should have solved the problem of the missing welders by raising their salaries to make the job more enticing. And similarly, it should have lowered the wages of philosophers to dry up the supply. Wait a sec!!&#0160; Is it possible that the free capitalist market is not doing its job. And if I or Marco Rubio propose that we establish more community colleges and offer potential welders training in their craft at little or no cost, are we not interfering with the proper working of capitalism and the free market? Picking winners and losers, in the dread phrase.&#0160; t&#39;s centralized planning, almost socialism to do so-- certainly anathema to the wing of the party to which Rubio belongs. Riddle me that.</p>
<p>Bottom line:&#0160; it&#39;s helpful for Rubio to advocate for more welders. It&#39;s not helpful (nor a credit to his candidacy) to set up a false antagonism between welders and philosophers. Below the bottom line:&#0160; a democratic electorate need thoughtful voters (let us call them philosophers). Welders need to be philosopher-enough that they don&#39;t let themselves be snookered by some demagogue who himself is bookless and factless and history-less. It&#39;s a challenge to identify a thoughtful candidate when one of our major parties is offering a full slate of empty but noisy barrels.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>The old West Bradford cemetery, which is carved out of our land, is peopled by the Worthleys, Hacketts, Kidders, and Sleepers who first settled this part of Vermont. Some were long lived, some passed through this thoroughfare of woe only briefly. There are o-so-many of those sad stone lozenges at the foot of a grave that represent infants who died too young to be christened.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Our&#0160;most disturbing gravestone, in my opinion, is the the one for&#0160;Stanley Franklin&#0160;Dwinell, M.D.&#0160;born in 1920 and who died along with James Scott Dwinell (age 7), Peter Dewey Dwinell (age 6), and Jonathan Dwinell&#0160;(age&#0160;2) all on the same day, December 11, 1952.&#0160;&#0160;What a horror, I thought -- a man and his three young sons all at once.&#0160;A tragedy.&#0160;But what sort?&#0160; A plane crash?&#0160; A boating accident?&#0160;House fire?&#0160; Perhaps even an infectious disease.&#0160;</p>
<p>An internet search came up empty-handed, so I enquired of our longer-tenured neighbors. And here&#39;s the local legend. &quot;Oh yes, the vet,&quot; I was told (although the tombstone distinctly says M. D., rather than D. V. M). &#0160;&quot;He was driving along Route 5 in Fairlee one winter morning and it was an icy road and foggy and he went out of control and all four of them died instantly. His wife was at home drinking a cup of coffee when she got the phone call. She left the coffee half-finished on the kitchen table, left the house without a word, and was never seen again. Didn&#39;t even take her clothes. Just disappeared.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>It&#39;s a good story and it sounds like the plot of a short story by Alice Munro -- but I don&#39;t believe it.&#0160;&#0160;The same gravestone reveals that Constance S. Dwinell, wife of Doctor Stanley Franklin Dwinnel, died January 25, 1985, at age 65.&#0160;</p>
<p>I&#39;m trying to imagine the remainder of poor Constance&#39;s&#0160;life. It&#39;s hard to construct a scenario that isn&#39;t completely dreadful.&#0160;Most likely, Constance returned, shattered, to the small town in New Hampshire, let us say, where she must have been born.&#0160;She moved back into her parents&#39; house and took a job as a town librarian, her life blighted by the&#0160;tragedy.&#0160;She never remarried.</p>
<p>But I prefer to imagine that she moved to Paris (she had majored in French at Wellesley, I&#39;m guessing,) and never told a soul about her first family. There she was wooed and won by Baron Guy de Condorcet de Noialles but could never conceive a child. It was a long happy marriage. After Guy died, crashing his motorcycle on the Riviera, she returned to the States a rich woman, and lived out her life in a Park Avenue apartment in New York. Friends and neighbors who had no idea of her first life were shocked when they read the will which specified that she be buried, along with Stanley and the children, right here in West Bradford.&#0160;</p>
<p>That&#39;s my story and I&#39;m sticking with it though I would very much&#0160;like to know the truth.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p><em>November 14, 2015&#0160;</em> Larry Coffin, president of the Bradford Historical Society, writes:</p>
<p>I would like to correct your information on Dr. Stanley Dwinell.&#0160; He and his three sons were killed in a collision with a train on a crossing in Newbury, Vt as he was going to treat a patient at Woodsville (NH) Cottage Hospital. His father Dr. Franklin Dwinell was in a car following.&#0160;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>How are we new-millenium readers supposed to grasp the social significance of nineteenth-century horsedrawn vehicles when even characters&#0160;in nineteenth-century novels can be easily baffled?&#0160; True enough that Miss Alice Vavasor&#0160;and Lady Glencora are both&#0160;very young ladies, and true also that they&#39;ve lived marvelously protected lives, but still -- such appalling ignorance:</p>
<p>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&quot; [Alice Vavasor] saw a light stylish-looking cart which she would have called a Whitechapel had she been properly instructed in such matters, and a little low open carriage with two beautiful small horses....&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&quot;Dear Alice, I&#39;m so glad you&#39;ve come....&#0160; Your maid can go in the dog-cart with your things!&quot; -- it wasn&#39;t a dog-cart, but Lady Glencora knew no better.&quot;</p>
<p>A dog-cart was not pulled by dogs. It was an informal vehicle with a recessed box or cage in which dogs were transported. Trollope lords it over his Lady Glencora for her ignorance of such plebian matters. And a Whitechapel? There&#39;s no footnote in my edition of<em> Can You Forgive Her</em> and neither google nor wikipedia hazards a guess (though Wik is well aware of a &quot;deathcore&quot; band of the same name), so I&#39;ll just go with &quot;light stylish cart.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>And now add &quot;Whitechapel&quot; to the list: barouche, basket carriage, berlin, <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2006/01/new_words.html">britchka</a>, brougham, buckboard, buggy, cabriolet, caleche, cariole, carryall, chaise, chariot, clarence, concord wagon, coupe, croydon, curricle, cutter, daumont, dearborn, dennet, diligence, dog-cart, fiacre, fly, fourgon, four-wheeler, gig, go-cart, governess cart, hansom, herdic, jaunty car, jersey-wagon, kibitka, landau, <a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2010/04/horsedrawn-vehicle.html.html " target="_self">patache</a>, phaeton, pill-box, post-chaise, rockaway, shandrydan, shay, sociable, spider-phaeton, spring-van, stanhope, sulky, surrey, T-cart, telyezhka, tilbury, <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2008/01/the-tarantass.html">tarantass</a>, trap, troika, victoria, vis-a-vis, wagonette,&#0160;and&#0160;wurt.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Before there were dikes there were terpen.</p>
<p>I was disgracefully ignorant of terpen until I read Robert Van de Noort&#39;s <em>North Sea Archaeologies: A Maritime Biography, 10,000 BC to AD 1500</em> (Oxford, 2011). Van de Noort devotes many pages to terpen, which are artificial islands constructed between 500 BC and 1000 AD in parts of the Netherlands, Denmark, and Germany. The earliest terpen were simple mounds on which a house was built; later several or more would be joined together to form small elevated villages protected against high tides and flooding. They might be as much as forty feet high. With the coming of dikes (c. 1000-1200 AD), terpen ceased to be constructed.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a terp, viewed from above.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef017c362ef0e9970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Terp" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef017c362ef0e9970b" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef017c362ef0e9970b-800wi" title="Terp" /></a></p>
<p>And here&#39;s another, photographed from ground level.</p>
<p>&#0160; <a class="asset-img-link" href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef017d405e0cef970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Terp2" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef017d405e0cef970c" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef017d405e0cef970c-800wi" title="Terp2" /></a></p>
<p>I&#39;ve been to the lowlands and might have seen these peculiar topographical features with my own eyes, but I certainly didn&#39;t register them. Even if I had, I might have confused them with the grave barrows or tumuli that are common in Scythian Bulgaria, or even with drumlins, which have a similar look to the uneducated eye -- although drumlins are natural rather than man-made.</p>
<p>I love it that &quot;terpen&quot; retains its ancient plural, along with words such as oxen and brethren. There aren&#39;t many such words in the language (children is a reduplicated plural, the original &quot;-er&quot; plural supplemented by an -en plural -- and some day to be superseded, I predict, by &quot;childrens&quot;).</p>
<p>Van de Noort&#39;s book is fascinating reading for those who like terpen and bronze-age sewn plank boats and such. It&#39;s rich in detail but might have been even richer if the author hadn&#39;t felt the need to waste space by calling the seashore a &quot;place of liminality&quot; and shipboard &quot;a heterotopia sailing upon the Deleuzian ocean&quot; -- and also indulge himself with many unconvincing&#0160; speculations dependent on such peculiar,&#0160; modish, transitory vocabulary.</p>
<p>When it comes to odd words, give me the old ones every time. Here are some satisfying lovely words that were as new to me as terpen: saltern (an area in fenlands set aside for salt manufacture); cofferdam (a temporary dam), thwart (a seat in a rowboat), leister (a two-pronged spear for fishing), dromond (a medieval galley) and broch (a dry-stone tower).</p>

                                <p>I doubt that I know any more about strigils than your average man in the street. I had read about them for years, of course, but I had never seen one with my own eyes until yesterday, when I took myself down to the Pompeii exhibit in Denver. There they were, kind of stuck away in the corner -- two bronze beauties. &#0160; </p>
<p>Strigils were used for cleaning the body, ancient Roman style. Early loofahs. The one posted below looks a lot like the one I saw yesterday -- a garden-variety Denver/Pompeii specimen that was retrieved from under 20 feet of Vesuvian ash:&#0160; </p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef017ee664efaf970d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Strigil2" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef017ee664efaf970d" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef017ee664efaf970d-800wi" title="Strigil2" /></a><br /><br /></p>
<p>&#0160;Here&#39;s another strigil, this one a little more elaborate.&#0160; </p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef017ee664f37a970d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Strigil" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef017ee664f37a970d" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef017ee664f37a970d-800wi" title="Strigil" /></a><br /><br /></p>
<p>They&#39;re kind of formidable, aren&#39;t they?&#0160; </p>
<p>If, two thousand years ago, you had been patrician enough to go to the <em>thermae </em>for your ablutions, you would have left the <em>calida piscina,</em> the warm bath, and hastened to the <em>destrictarium</em>, which was a room dedicated to strigiling. There you would have applied a mixture of olive oil and pumice to your skin, and then one of your slaves, who might be an <em>aliptes</em>, a masseur, or a simple <em>balneator</em>, a bath attendant, would have strigiled you clean.&#0160;&#0160; </p>
<p>But why olive oil and pumice? Greasy and gritty. Why not soap?&#0160; Did the ancients have soap?&#0160; Who invented soap?</p>
<p>Fortunately, there&#39;s a website devoted to these important questions. Its forthright, unapologetic url is soaphistory.net. </p>
<p>The first traces of soap appeared among the Babylonians, some 5000 years ago. The recipe: mix animal fat with wood ash and boil. So soaps were around, but -- <em>mirabile dictu</em> -- they weren&#39;t used for personal hygiene. They were used for cleaning wool and cleaning pots; Pliny, who was there for the explosion of Mt. Vesuvius, and knew all there was to know, records only that soap was used as a hair pomade.</p>
<p> The world we have lost was a far dirtier place than we like to imagine. In point of fact, our familiar cake soaps and their widespread use are an industrial revolution-nineteenth century invention.</p>
<p>Considering the effectiveness and convenience of modern soaps, I&#39;m not looking for a strigil revival -- no Mr. Strigil at every streetcorner. Nevertheless, there&#39;s not a brush or a washcloth in the modern world that can match the beauty of the best of the ancient strigils. Here, for example, is an old Etruscan strigil with a naked-girl handle (she herself brandishes a mini-strigil). It&#39;s less useful than a cake of Ivory, but -- let&#39;s face it--&#0160; a heck of a lot more glamorous.&#0160; </p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I&#39;ve been reading about the early colonization of New York city, a subject that I&#39;ve not approached since my days in elementary school in the 1950s, where, in retrospect, it seemed that we went over the ground quite regularly -- Henry Hudson, the purchase of Manhattan Island, New Amsterdam, Peter Stuyvesant, and the English acquisition of the Dutch colonies. As we learned it, it was a sunny story, untroubled and inevitable -- a path leading from pleasant but primitive beginnings to its inevitable culmination in the Greatest City in the Greatest Country on earth. There were large helpings of nationalism and triumphalism -- attitudes that I&#39;ve come to loathe -- along with the insistence that America was chosen among all the nations for peace and tolerance.&#0160;</p>
<p>It appears, however, that there are events recounted in Russell Shorto&#39;s <em>The Island at the Center of the World</em> (New York, 2004) that, if they had been mentioned, might have diluted our tadpole triumphalism. Kieft&#39;s War, for example, was never discussed.</p>
<p>Willem Kieft was one of the Dutch governors of the new colony, and he was a pioneer in genocidal racism. A small group of indians had camped at Corlaer&#39;s Hook (now the Lower East Side) and a larger group had settled near what is now Jersey City in New Jersey. The Indians (Wickquassgeck and Tappan) sought sanctuary from the Dutch against the Mohawks, to whom they had fallen behind in their tribute payments. Kieft, for reasons of his own, launched an unprovoked attack. According to a contemporary chronicler, &quot;infants were torn from their mother&#39;s breasts, and hacked to pieces in the presence of their parents, and the pieces thrown into the fire and in the water, and other sucklings, being bound to small boards, were cut, stuck,and pierced and miserably massacred in a manner to move a heart of stone. Some were thrown into the river, and when the fathers and mothers endeavored to save them, the soldiers would not let them come on land but made both parents and children drown.... Some came to our people in the country with their hands, some with their legs cut off, and some holding their entrails in their arms....&#0160; After this exploit, the soldiers were were rewarded for their service, and Director Kieft thanked them.&quot;</p>
<p>Such atrocities (there were many others) were omitted from the P. S. 217 curriculum.&#0160;</p>
<p>When I read these stories, I feel as though I was tricked. I&#39;m indignant and angry.</p>
<p>It&#39;s all part of a grand deception in which every child is indoctrinated with the idea that his own group is wiser, kinder, and better than the others.</p>
<p>If our great country were truly superior, we would have shown it by telling the truth, the whole truth, not a purged and sanitized half-truth.&#0160;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>In 1904, at the age of 20, my grandmother Sonia Chafetz Uzilewski (later Green) disembarked at Ellis Island. Because of her age, and because she lived within an immigrant community, she never acquired much English, and as a result my conversations with her were strictly utilitarian. I was curious about the old country (White Russia, now Belarus) but she spoke little about it and what she did say was difficult for me to construe. Two pieces of information about her childhood have stayed with me: first, that in the old country, they brought the cow into the house in the winter &quot;to keep warm&quot; and secondly, that, as a girl, she &quot;slept over the fireplace.&quot;</p>
<p>I was puzzled. All I could imagine was a house like my own pleasant childhood home, but with a cow on the carpet and a young lady perched precariously on the narrow mantle over the fireplace (if we had had a fireplace, which we didn&#39;t). Frankly, I couldn&#39;t make much sense out of her story.&#0160;</p>
<p>It wasn&#39;t until I happened to find myself in benighted Lithuania in 2003 that I figured out the cow-in-the-living-room puzzle. I visited one of those large open-air museums which are not uncommon in eastern Europe, in which traditional peasant dwellings, along with churches, mills, foundries, etc. have been&#0160; rescued and sprinkled around a landscape. At such sites, a very common form of low-end dwelling consists of a barn or animal shelter on the dirt ground floor, with a wooden second floor for human habitation erected just above. I believe that when grandma said that they brought the cow into the house, she meant that they stabled the cow down below, and that some of the heat from the animal disseminated into the living quarters -- as would, incidentally, some of its pungent effluvia.</p>
<p>So one problem was solved, but the mantle-sleeping remained a mystery. However, just this past week the <em>New Yorker </em>featured an essay on traditional Russian cooking in which there was a paragraph on a long-ago-and-far-away kind of stove. Here&#39;s the pertinent section.</p>
<p>&quot;A traditional Russian kitchen starts with a <em>pech</em>, a huge brick oven with many winding vents designed to retain the heat from a wood fire. A <em>pech</em> was once the centerpiece of&#0160;traditional peasant homes; it took up about a quarter of the available living space. It heated and ventilated the house, it dried food; children and the elderly slept on ledges built into it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Children and the elderly slept on ledges built into it.&quot;</em> Mystery solved!</p>
<p>Sonia told me that she slept over the fire, which I interpreted as a fireplace. But I was wrong. She slept over the stove. For all I know, she might even have used the world<em> pech</em>, which I couldn&#39;t possibly have translated or understood.</p>
<p>Now I know, that like other children at the very bottom of the nineteenth-century Russian social ladder, she slept on a ledge built into a <em>pech</em>, with the cow lowing just a few feet below her.&#0160;</p>
<p>Need I mention once again how glad I am that she decided to pull up stakes and head for new world.</p>

                                <p>Eric Sanderson&#39;s <em>Mannahatta</em> (New York: Abrams, 2009) reconstructs Manhattan as it would have appeared to Henry Hudson when he sailed the Half-Moon into the harbor in 1609. The glory of the book lies in its illustrations.&#0160; Here&#39;s a conjectural reconstruction of old Manhattan island: <br /><a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef016301560963970d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Mannahatta2" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef016301560963970d" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef016301560963970d-800wi" title="Mannahatta2" /></a></p>
<p>And here&#39;s a clever juxtaposition of ancient and modern:</p>
<p><a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef0167624b359e970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Mannahatta3" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef0167624b359e970b" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef0167624b359e970b-800wi" title="Mannahatta3" /></a></p>
<p>In 1609, the island of Manhattan was home to between 400 and 1000 Lenape Indians. They lived on fish, shellfish (leaving behind extensive middens), deer and other wildlife, on fruits and berries. They practiced some small-scale farming of corn, squash, and beans. Sanderson estimates that the Lenape had lived on Manhattan for 10,000 years, or 400 generations.</p>
<p>Why so few people? The land was fertile, the seas abundant, the weather not particularly harsh. While the Lenape sat still in Manhattan, advanced civilizations were created by the Mayans, the Aztecs and the Incas. Along the banks of the Mississippi, the city of Cahokia rose and fell. And yet the Lenape never domesticated a single animal beside the dog and left behind no pottery, weaving, or metals. They remained stuck in the paleolithic. Why, I wonder. Perhaps things were too good.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Lenape lived in harmony with the island for a very long time. What are the odds that our present civilization, which has totally transformed Manhattan in 400 short years, or just 16 generations, will last one tenth as long?&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><em>February 24</em>:&#0160; Still curious about the want of population growth or technological development among the Lenape, I read C. A. Weslager&#39;s T<em>he Delaware Indians, A History</em> (1972) (Lenapes were called by their Anglo name, Delaware, for many years). Wenslager does not suggest that the Lenape ever achieved larger populations. Nor does he point to any archeological evidence of cultural achievement. Still, I&#39;m mildly suspicious that there may be more to the story.&#0160; We know that Verrazzano contacted the Lenapes 90 years before Hudson sailed into the harbor, and no one knows what diseases he might have introduced.</p>

                                <p>If the profoundly Christian seventeenth-century founders of our  country had a single favorite Biblical passage, it might be the one in which the  Lord (speaking through His minor prophet Amos) severely condemned the empty vanity  of holidays. &quot;I hate,&quot; said the Lord, &quot;I despise your feast days, and I  will not smell in your solemn assemblies.&quot; The Lord of Hosts  specifically enjoined against the attempt to placate him by sacrificing  animals (a matter of topical concern in Amos&#39; time). &quot;Though ye offer  me burnt offerings and your meat offerings, I will not accept them;  neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat beasts.&quot; Nor did  He rest with these easy-to-follow injunctions, but He went on to condemn  all musical tributes as well. Not for him any chants, glees or carols: &quot;Take  thou away from me the noise of thy songs; for I will not hear the melody  of thy viols.&quot; Our Puritan forefathers interpreted these lines  correctly and enthusiastically; they recognized that the Lord opposed not only ritual  sacrifice and music but all formal observance and rote piety. The  Ancient of Days made it abundantly clear that what moved him was not  empty ceremony but genuine morality. HIs solution: &quot;let justice run  down as the waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream.&quot; Taking these  uncompromising sentences as their guide, our founders dug in their heels  against the ostentatious celebration of all holidays, especially  Christmas. Instead, they did as they were enjoined: they looked into their hearts.</p>
<p>Would they not have been reduced to angry and impotent sobs by the  grotesque consumerism -- the burnt offerings and squeaking timbrels&#0160; --  that once again this Christmas season displace justice and righteousness?&#0160; Could there be  anything more loathsome either to Amos or to our devout ancestors than  &quot;Silent Night&quot; amidst shopping-mall tinsel and gimcrackery? Or than the attempt to gin up conflict or to gain a partisan political advantage by inventing a mythical &quot;war on Christmas&quot;?</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>

                                <p>While in the Bay Area, I visited SF&#39;s Museum of Asian Art,&#0160; where this grotesque, beautiful piece of maximum conspicuous consumption was on display.&#0160; <br /><a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef0162fd41e70a970d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Silverest carriage Maharaja of Bhavnagar" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef0162fd41e70a970d" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef0162fd41e70a970d-800wi" title="Silverest carriage Maharaja of Bhavnagar" /></a></p>
<p>It&#39;s a silver Landau made for the Maharaja of Bhavnagar around the turn of the last century.&#0160; Needless to say, I was utterly appalled by the waste and extravagance though dazzled by the workmanship. <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef015437c0165a970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Silver coach -2" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef015437c0165a970c image-full" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef015437c0165a970c-800wi" title="Silver coach -2" /></a></p>
<p>&#0160;Afterward, I took a trip to Alameda&#39;s Pinball Museum. Here&#39;s a bank of classic 50&#39;s Gottliebs.</p>
<p><a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef0162fd4202c6970d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Gottlieb pinball bank" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef0162fd4202c6970d" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef0162fd4202c6970d-800wi" title="Gottlieb pinball bank" /></a></p>
<p>I played this magnificent piece of craftsmanship</p>
<p><a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef015437c0375b970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Gottlieb pinball" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef015437c0375b970c" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef015437c0375b970c-800wi" title="Gottlieb pinball" /></a>and, still a master of the flipper, won three (3) free games.</p>
<p>I can&#39;t remember whether the silver coach was owned by this couple of dandies (also in the Asian Art Museum) or one of their cousins,&#0160;</p>
<p><a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef0162fd421d8a970d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Mahara" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef0162fd421d8a970d" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef0162fd421d8a970d-800wi" title="Mahara" /></a><br />but no one who looked like either a maharaja or maharani was playing with Gottlieb&#39;s silver balls.&#0160; I didn&#39;t spy anyone at the pinball museum who was nearly so well accoutered.&#0160;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Neolithic Malta presents&#0160;an e<em>xemplum</em> and a warning.&#0160;The island&#0160;received its first human inhabitants, who probably arrived from Sicily,&#0160;some time around 5000&#0160;BC.&#0160;After about 3600 BC, trade and other links with&#0160; the outside world waned.&#0160;Over the next thousand years or so, the people of Mlata built seventeen&#0160;monumental stone&#0160;temples unlike any elsewhere in the Mediterranean.&#0160;</p>
<p><a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef014e895b24e4970d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Manajdra" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef014e895b24e4970d" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef014e895b24e4970d-800wi" title="Manajdra" /></a>&#0160;</p>
<p>These are the remains of one of the seventeen.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a view of another:<a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef01538f67cf2e970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Hagarqim" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef01538f67cf2e970b" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef01538f67cf2e970b-800wi" title="Hagarqim" /></a>&#0160;<br />There&#39;s something truly remarkable about these megalithic temples, but it&#39;s troubling that a marginal and isolated culture would make such a huge and&#0160;economically unproductive&#0160;investment.&#0160;Indeed, starting about&#0160;2300 BC, this native Maltese culture&#0160;went into precipitous&#0160;decline.&#0160;A major cause&#0160;seems to have been the extreme deforestation and soil loss when the population increased and resources were overused.&#0160;The best guess is that the Maltese experienced an economic and spiritual crisis.</p>
<p>They did not, alas, confront the&#0160;environmental problem; instead, the evidence suggests that the people, probably led by an oppressive priestly caste, continued to make greater and greater investments in religious worship, no doubt hoping that their gods would rescue them from their predicament. &quot;In the end their expectations were not met and crisis ensued from which it took centuries to recover&quot; (Barry Cunliffe, <em>Europe Between the Oceans</em>, [Yale, 2008], p. 172.) The population disappeared, the culture was extinguished and&#0160;Malta was&#0160;deserted until the arrival of Bronze Age peoples around 2000 BC.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s go over this ground and make sure that we understand. The neolithic&#0160;inhabitants of Malta temporarily increased their&#0160;population at the expense of massive enviromental degradation, and then, as the standard of living dropped, decided that the best way to deal with the crisis was&#0160;to make mammoth investments in&#0160;priests and temples (rather than, say, birth control and&#0160;sustainable forestry and agriculture).&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Is there a moral here.&#0160; We report, you decide.&#0160;But I believe that I can hear the&#0160;debate. &quot;We&#39;ve already built fifteen temples and it hasn&#39;t worked.&#0160;Perhaps we should try something new, like planting trees.&quot;&#0160; &quot;Nonesense, young radical.&#0160;We must look to faith. Faith will reward us.&#0160;One more temple, this one really huge.&#0160;More stones over here!&quot;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
