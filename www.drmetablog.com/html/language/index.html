                                <p>During my lifetime, the word &quot;outing&quot; has mutated beyond recognition. It first entered my youthful vocabulary (as did so many other words) through the medium of baseball. An &quot;outing&quot; -- in the old days --meant to me only a stint on the mound. &quot;Podres has had a good &quot;outing&quot; today.&quot; The more general meaning of &quot;outing&quot; as a short trip taken for pleasure, such as a picnic, or a jaunt in the country, only came into my&#0160; life many years later. &quot;They enjoyed a family outing to Montauk.&quot; The fact of the matter is that my family of origin didn&#39;t go on &quot;outings,&quot; but at some point I must have heard I heard about such journeyings from friends or read about them in novels.</p>
<p>These days, I rarely encounter the baseball or picknicky meanings of &quot;outing.&quot; &quot;Outing&quot; has transformed into the obnoxious word that describes the odious and hostile practice of exposing the sexual identity of a person against his/her will.&#0160; From picnic to nasty, alas.</p>
<p>Frankly, I prefer the traditional significations and activities.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>&quot;Bottom&quot; is another of the many words that came into my life through the medium of baseball. As soon as I was able to walk and talk, I learned that an inning has both a &quot;top&quot; and a &quot;bottom.&quot; &quot;Bottom of the ninth&quot; was an optimistic phrase because there was always the Ebbets Field hope that the Dodgers might come through with a game-winning rally. Later, when I discovered that there was more to human existence than baseball, the various and colorful meanings of &quot;bottom&quot; began to reveal themselves. For example, the posterior part of the human body, which I knew as the ass or the behind or the tuchas, was, I learned, called the &quot;bottom&quot; by people of sophistication. A euphemism?&#0160; A Britishism?&#0160;</p>
<p>Even later on, I discovered that bottom, signifying buttocks or butt was not the root meaning of the word but a metaphorical extension of its original sense. Old English <em>botm, </em>cognate with Latin f<em>undus</em>, meant land or farm or soil. This meaning of &quot;bottom&quot; is well-preserved in the phrase &quot;bottom land&quot; -- the level and fertile acres along the banks of a watercourse. Many English family names are consequently topographical surnames of ancient inhabitants of various river fronts -- such as Bottoms, Robottom, Higginbottom, Ramsbottom, Longbottom, Winterbottom, and Bottomley. Names that have nothing to do with either innings or asses.</p>
<p>The oddity that &quot;bottom&quot; can refer both to farmland and to the human butt can sometimes yield unconscious comedy. For example, in 1977, I was a guest at a wedding in the infelicitously named Kent village of Pett Bottom. I must hope that Pett is a variant of Pitt, a &quot;hollow,&quot; rather than commonplace &quot;pet&quot; with a supernumerary &quot;t&quot;.</p>
<p>These days, &quot;bottom&quot; is more likely to mean something like &quot;the essence&quot; -- as in such phrases &quot;to get to the bottom of the matter&quot;; or &quot;the bottom of one&#39;s heart.&quot;</p>
<p>And then there&#39;s egregious Bottom in A <em>Midsummer Night&#39;s Dream</em>, who does not disdain the mandatory pun: &quot;This is to make an ass of me.&quot;</p>
<div class="word--C9UPa">
<div class="">
<div id="etymonline_v_43248">Shakespeare likes the word &quot;bottom.&quot; Here&#39;s Malcolm&#39;s most memorable characterization of Macbeth.&#0160;&#0160;</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>&#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; I grant him bloody,<br />Luxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful,<br />Sudden, malicious, smacking of every sin<br />That has a name: but there&#39;s no&#0160;<strong><span class="keyword1">bottom</span>,</strong> none,<br />In my voluptuousness: your wives, your daughters,<br />Your matrons and your maids, could not fill up<br />The cistern of my lust, and my desire<br />All continent impediments would o&#39;erbear<br />That did oppose my will:</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>This &quot;bottom&quot; is not farmland or butt; it&#39;s the low point in a downward trajectory. This &quot;bottom&quot; is associated with &quot;cistern&quot; -- a receptacle for holding water.&#0160; Curiously, Shakespeare regularly uses the word in its relation to the water of oceans, most specifically the sea-bottom:&#0160;&#0160;</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>&#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; the slimy <strong><span class="keyword1">bottom</span></strong> of the deep.&#0160; &#0160; (<em>Richard III</em>)</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>O coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz, that thou didst know how many fathom deep I am in love! But it cannot be sounded; my affection hath an unknown&#0160;<strong><span class="keyword1">bottom</span></strong>, like the Bay of Portugal.&#0160; (<strong>As You Like It</strong>)</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>By heaven, methinks it were an easy leap,<br />To pluck bright honor from the pale-faced moon,<br />Or dive into the&#0160;<strong><span class="keyword1">bottom</span></strong>&#0160;of the deep,<br />Where fathom-line could never touch the ground,<br />And pluck up drowned honor by the locks.&#0160; (<em>I Henry IV</em>)</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>As is the ooze and&#0160;<strong><span class="keyword1">bottom</span></strong> of the sea. (<em>Henry V</em>)</div>
<div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>Who ever yet could sound thy&#0160;<strong><span class="keyword1">bottom</span></strong>? find<br />The ooze, to show what coast thy sluggish crare<br />Might easiliest harbour in?&#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160;(<em>Cymbeline)</em></div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>I suspect that Shakespeare would have savored the modern phrase, &quot;bottom feeder.&quot;&#0160; But I doubt he would have understood, any more than I do, the names of the fifth and sixth quarks, which are top and bottom (exactly like an inning).</div>

<div class="fR600b islir">Because my knowledge of sheep livers is so appallingly slim, and because most readers of this blague are not doubt similarly ignorant, let me quote an expert description of the object: &quot;In the Etruscan model, the liver is reversed, with the convex part of the gallbladder pointing down. On the right side of the gallbladder, we find a pyramid-shaped structure that was referred to as the processus pyramidalis corresponding with the caudate lobe in humans. On the other side of the gallbladder, we see a protrusion that was called the processus papillaris corresponding with the paracaval part of the caudate lobe.&quot; In other words, it&#39;s one heck of an accurate liver model. Yet It is not its fidelity to the shape and form of a sheep liver that makes the PL so crucial: it&#39;s the markings and inscriptions on its face. As you can see, the surface of the PL is divided into segments, on each one of which is inscribed a word or two in the long-extinct Etruscan language.</div>
<div class="fR600b islir">&#0160;</div>
<div class="fR600b islir">This find is obviously not one of your run-of-the-mill uninformative liver sculptures. It&#39;s brimming with meaning. Let us recall that Etruria was an advanced and prosperous civilization that dominated northwestern Italy from about 800 BCE to 500 BCE until it&#0160; gradually fell under the sway of the ambitious militaristic Romans. In the ancient world, Etruscans were famous not only for their arts and commerce, but also for their skill in consulting the gods through the process of haruscopy -- divination by examining the liver of a sacrificed sheep. The Etruscans passed along this accomplishment to the Romans who rarely made important decisions without the advice of the gods, which they acquired through the medium of a professionally certified haruspex. Inasmuch as the Romans, employing haruscopy, ruled the world for a thousand years, the power of the sheep liver-and-haruspex team cannot but be acknowledged.&#0160;</div>
<div class="fR600b islir">&#0160;</div>
<div class="fR600b islir">I have no idea, nor do scholars of the Etruscans, know when or why haruscopy originated. Etruscan civilization is replete with mysteries and moreover the Etruscan language is not fully understood. It&#39;s an &quot;isolate&quot; -- like Basque --an island in a sea of Indo-European languages to which it bears no relation. Etruscans arrived in Italy a long time ago -- long before they possessed a written language. When? From where did they come? How did it happen that they became proficient in haruscopy?&#0160; No one knows and there are not even any decent theories -- it&#39;s all lost in the dark backward and abysm of time.</div>

<div>Readers of a skeptical bent will wonder, what special powers are incorporated in the liver of a sheep?&#0160; Why not the pancreas or the spleen? Some might even ask, why a sheep?&#0160; Why not, for example, goats?&#0160; Goats are far more intelligent than sheep, and it stands to reason that a goat liver would house more prophetic oomph than the liver of a mouflon or an urial. For that matter, why is haruscopy to be preferred to less messy systems of augury such as ornithomancy, which utilizes the flights of birds, or ceraunoscopy, which works by the study of lightning and thunder. No bloody sacrificing required in either case. Livers, in my opinion, though I&#39;ve never come face to face with a sheep&#39;s, are kind of gross and not for the squeamish. But as William Cowper told us many years ago, &quot;God moves in a mysterious way,/ His wonders to perform&quot; and although Cowper was not specifically referring to the multiple gods of the polytheistic Etruscans, his words certainly apply. So divination by liver it was and has remained so. Whether or not the Romans would have conquered the world without the Etruscan facility with sheep livers is impossible to say.&#0160; &#0160;</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>A closer look at the PL reveals that each demarcated section is inscribed with a series of Etruscan letters. Inasmuch as Etruscan is an extinct language that has been only deciphered in part, the words are not fully understood.&#0160; Although Etruscan is almost impossible to translate, it&#39;s easy to transliterate, because the script is written in a version of the alphabet devised by some Phoenician genius and then passed along to the Euboean Greeks and then on to the Etruscans and to the Romans and eventually to us.&#0160;</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>Here&#39;s the most recent transcription of a part of the outside ring of words on the PL.</div>
</div>

<div aria-hidden="true" class="LAA3yd">&#0160;</div>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="LAA3yd">Kind of impenetrable, is it not?&#0160; Almost entirely opaque with only a few good guesses. But, alas, that&#39;s the sorry state of Piacenza Liver knowledge. Scholars are agreed that the markings are the names of the various gods -- each associated with a section of the live. It follows that the PL is a teaching instrument, a show-and-tell. It&#39;s not difficult to picture a veteran learned haruspex instructing his or her aspiring students to study the PL closely. Any peculiarity or disorder or irregularity in the liver would reveal much to a gifted haruspex.&#0160;&#0160;</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>It&#39;s shocking to me that the tourist-oriented website of the city of Piacenza advertises its Duomo, a 12th century Romanesque church, its Passerini-Landi Library, and the Palazzo Farnese, a 16th century great house, but offers not the slightest mention of its foremost liver (which is housed in the palazzo). An inexplicable omission.</p>

                                <p>I have just finished reading Sybille Haynes comprehensive study, <em>Etruscan Civilization, A Cultural History</em> (2000). It&#39;s not only a window into a remarkable extinct world, but also a trove of exciting words new to me. And as readers of this blague are well aware, vocabulary excites Dr. Metablog.</p>
<p>For example: a <em>skyphos&#0160;</em>is a two-handled cup for drinking wine. Here&#39;s an especially handsome one from the 5th century BCE.</p>
<table class="infobox vcard">

<p>It&#39;s decorated with a portrait of a hoplite, a Greek soldier.&#0160;</p>
<p>Then there&#39;s the versatile word <em>symplegma, </em>which sounds suspiciously like a noxious bodily discharge -- but isn&#39;t. If one searches for the word symplegma, the first meaning that one encounters is a &quot;genus of ascidian tunicates in the family styelidae.&quot; What the heck are any kind of tunicates doing in a volume on&#0160; Etruscan civilization? But on further investigation it emerges that <em>symplegma</em> has a second and more pertinent definition. It&#39;s a word that is used by art historians and archeologists for a depiction of sexual intercourse. Honest to Pete, who would have guessed?&#0160; How the two symplegmata -- the tunicate and the fornicate -- are related, is, I must say, quite a mystery.</p>
<p>Another word with two distinct significations is <em>tibia</em>. We all know that the tibia is the bone that connects ankle and knee. I did not know that for students of ancient world it also refers to a brooch or clasp.&#0160;&#0160;</p>

<p>Speaking of jugs, there&#39;s also the <em>aryballos</em>, which is a &quot;globular flask&quot; used to contain perfume or oil. Another kind of jug is the &quot;<em>canopic</em> jar&quot;, which was used by the ancient Egyptians to store a guy&#39;s (or gal&#39;s) inner organs during the process of mummification. I have no idea how mummies were processed, nor have I any desire to be enlightened.</p>
<p>A coroplast was, in antiquity, an artisan or sculptor who created terracotta figurines. Here&#39;s a lovely example of such a one&#39;s work.</p>

<p>Nowadays, Coroplast, Inc. is the name of a large company that produces corrugated plastic sheets used in packaging and signboards.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>A <em>felloe</em> or <em>felly</em> is the outer rim of a wheel to which spokes are attached. I imagine that this word is well known to bicyclists and wheelwrights, but I had never encountered it. My chagrin, my apologies. An <em>acroterion</em> is an architectural ornament mounted at the apex of corner of a building, a kind of rooftop gargoyle. An <em>anthemion </em>or palmette is a design consisting of radiating petals. Sometimes anthemia are carved into <em>acroteria</em>. If two anthemia are set back to back they are said to be <em>addorsed.</em></p>

                                <p>&quot;Joint&quot; is a word that in the course of my lifetime has engaged in some serious shape-shifting. When I first encountered the word, joint (derived from the Latin<em> jungere</em>, to join) was simply a place where two pieces of wood were glued together or where one&#39;s bones were articulated to produce a wrist, elbow, or knee. Mighty simple and uncomplicated, it would appear -- but even then &quot;joint&quot; had begun to accumulate variants. Rick Blaine&#39;s sentence in <em>Casablanca</em> was an early warning: &quot;of all the gin j<em>oints</em> in all the towns in the world, she has to come into mine.&quot; A &quot;joint&quot; was apparently a nightclub or bar. &quot;Gin joint&quot; suggests that&#0160; &quot;Rick&#39;s Cafe Americain&quot; was louche or sleazy, and perhaps it was, what with all the crooked gambling going on and with the mysterious &quot;letters of transit&quot; stuffed into Sam&#39;s piano. But why &quot;joint&quot;?&#0160; It seems fanciful to suppose that a joint was a place where various people &quot;joined&quot; together, but I can&#39;t think of a more persuasive etymology.&#0160; &#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Another use of joint came to my attention in the late 1960&#39;s when I became seriously interested in Jacobean oak furniture. Here&#39;s a handsome &quot;joint stool&quot;:&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p><img alt="Early Oak Joint Stool, circa 1690-1720 For Sale" class="_cfe61f48 _1548a188" fetchpriority="high" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 305px, 700px" src="https://a.1stdibscdn.com/archivesE/upload/1121189/f_348083821687002681972/34808382_datamatics.jpg" srcset="https://a.1stdibscdn.com/archivesE/upload/1121189/f_348083821687002681972/34808382_datamatics.jpg?disable=upscale&amp;auto=webp&amp;quality=60&amp;width=305 305w, https://a.1stdibscdn.com/archivesE/upload/1121189/f_348083821687002681972/34808382_datamatics.jpg?disable=upscale&amp;auto=webp&amp;quality=60&amp;width=700 700w, https://a.1stdibscdn.com/archivesE/upload/1121189/f_348083821687002681972/34808382_datamatics.jpg?disable=upscale&amp;auto=webp&amp;quality=60&amp;width=610 610w, https://a.1stdibscdn.com/archivesE/upload/1121189/f_348083821687002681972/34808382_datamatics.jpg?disable=upscale&amp;auto=webp&amp;quality=60&amp;width=1400 1400w" /></p>
<p>A joint stool was the most ordinary kind of chair during the period when Shakespeare was wielding his quill. Why &quot;joint&quot;?&#0160; Apparently because it was a <em>joined</em> stool, and therefore of higher quality than one that was merely glued. A joiner was a skilled craftsman before mass-produced nails and screws became inexpensive and commonplace.</p>
<p>Shakespeare knew joint stools very well: &quot;Cry you mercy, I took you for a <span class="keyword1">joint</span>-stool,&quot; says the Fool to a joint stool. Fool humors mad hallucinating Lear by pretending that the joint stool is the king&#39;s daughter Goneril. Shakespeare, by the by, played many a variation on &quot;joint,&quot; employing or inventing&#0160; such terms as &quot;joint-servant,&quot; &quot;joint-laborer,&quot; &quot;joint-ring,&quot; &quot;jointress,&quot; &quot;unjointed,&quot; &quot;injointed,&quot; &quot;short-jointed,&quot; &quot;conjointly,&quot; and &quot;disjoint.&quot;</p>
<p>But even Shakespeare would not have imagined the transfigurations of the word in these our latter days. Nowadays, a joint is a prison, though I don&#39;t know why one would call it so when such colorful appellations as &quot;hoosegow,&quot; &quot;clink,&quot; &quot;stir,&quot; &quot;slammer,&quot; and &quot;pokey&quot; are all on the tips of our collective tongues. Nor would he have imagined &quot;joint&quot; as a marijuana blunt or spliff. He wouldn&#39;t have known but might have appreciated &quot;joint&quot; as a term for the male sexual organ.</p>
<p>All of which makes it possible, theoretically, to say, &quot;I was in a joint, smoking a joint, figuring out how to exercise my joint.&quot;</p>
<p>As for me, I use the word &quot;joint&quot; everyday -- in the most useful phrase &quot;joint card.&quot;</p>

                                <p>I first encountered the word &quot;provider&quot; in its positive sense as a virtual synonym for &quot;mensch&quot;: &quot;he was a good provider; he took care of his wife and his kids and his aged parents and even his employees&quot; (if he had any).</p>
<p>But nowadays the word has been stripped of its warm associations and has emerged as a cool or neutral term. I encounter the word most often when I need medical attention. A doctor is no longer a doctor; he&#39;s been renamed a &quot;provider.&quot; I believe this usage to be the invention of the nefarious insurance companies that govern and distort our medical system. &quot;Doctor&quot; and &quot;nurse&quot; are praise-words, rich in significance. &quot;Provider&quot; has no resonance. It reduces your doctor to an index or reference number and is therefore of great utility to the bureaucracy. I can&#39;t imagine that a doctor, asked what he does, would be happy to respond,&#0160; &quot;I&#39;m a provider.&quot;&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>The word &quot;teacher&quot; has, for many, a positive resonance. I was a teacher; I was not an &quot;education provider&quot; -- nor would I have embarked on a career with the aim of being considered such.&#0160;</p>
<p>I believe that nowadays the most common use of the word &quot;provider&quot; occurs in the internet phrase, &quot;content provider.&quot;&#0160; And so the word continues on its long downward path.</p>

                                <p>&quot;Roux&quot; is word that everyone seems to know but me. To the best of my recollection, &quot;roux&quot; had never crossed my personal threshold until last week -- perhaps because I have never taken any special interest in fine cuisine. I&#39;ve now enlightened myself, but at the cost of blundering into a bewildering etymological thicket.</p>
<p>&quot;Roux,&quot; to reprise the obvious, is &quot;a mixture of flour and fat cooked together and used to thicken sauces.... Butter or lard are commonly used fats.&quot; But why &quot;roux,&quot; with its excrescent French x? <em>Un nom étrange.</em> Roux, if I have it right, means brown, or more precisely, reddish brown (as opposed to &quot;<em>brun</em>&quot; or &quot;<em>marron</em>.&quot; In the case of the sauce, roux is an abbreviated version of &quot;beurre roux,&quot; or brown butter and, curiously, comes unbuttered into English as simply &quot;roux.&quot; Roux derives from Latin russus or ruber, reddish, both of which ancient words originate in the same Indo-European root. I&#39;ve now learned of a kind of surgery called a Roux-en-Y, probably pronounced &quot;ruin why,&quot; which is a kind of &quot;anastomosis&quot;--&#0160; or gastric bypass -- in which blood or intestinal vessels are configured into a Y shape. But although one may suspect so, this &quot;roux&quot; has nothing to do with sauces, thank goodness, but is named for the Swiss&#0160; physician who originated the surgery, César Roux. I suspect that Roux&#39;s roux does not descend from ruber but from rufus, red-headed, as in William II, aka William Rufus.</p>

This rue comes to English through French and from Latin <em>ruta.&#0160;</em>The other English rue, as in &quot;rue the day&quot; is, as one might expect, of entirely different origin deriving from Old English <span class="foreign notranslate">hreow</span>&#0160; -- &quot;grief, repentance, sorrow, regret, penitence.&quot;</div>

There&#39;s <span class="keyword1">rue</span> for you, and here&#39;s some for me. We may call it herb of grace o&#39; Sundays. O, you must wear your&#0160;<span class="keyword1">rue</span> with a difference.&quot; The botanical rue is referenced by the poetical gardener in <em>Richard II</em>; &quot;in this place/I&#39;ll set a bank of <span class="keyword1">rue</span>, sour herb of grace:/ <span class="keyword1">Rue</span>, even for ruth, here shortly shall be seen,/ In the remembrance of a weeping queen.&quot; The pun on rue/ruth is etymologically interesting.

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Here on Walnut Street, we&#39;re trying to make more and better use of locatives -- words that have long been underemployed and undervalued. We think that the language (and therefore the world) would be richer and more commodious if others would join with us in this endeavor. But we&#39;re not evangelizing, heck no! We honor and respect each and every person&#39;s private and personal linguistic choices, locatively-speaking.&#0160;</p>
<p>Nor do we refer to the common adverbial locatives, such as homeward, downtown, underground, or nearby.&#0160; The locatives that we wish to revive and reinvigorate are the neglected -- even forsaken -- classics of locativity.</p>
<p>Everyone uses the locative <strong>where -- </strong>the point upon which you metaphorically stand --&#0160; but how many of us remember to employ the excellent and useful &quot;to&quot; form, <strong>whither</strong>, or the &quot;from&quot; form, <strong>whence</strong>.&#0160; It&#39;s true that whither and whence sound a trifle obsolescent, but with frequent use the flexible ear will soon accommodate. One might be tempted to say &quot;wither goest thou&quot; or &quot;whence com&#39;st thou&quot;, but with a little effort, &quot;whither do you go&quot; and &quot;whence do you come&quot; will sound perfectly natural, I&#39;m sure.</p>
<p>Similarly, we regularly use the word <strong>here, </strong>but by golly, we have slighted <strong>hither</strong> (to here) and <strong>hence</strong> (from here).</p>
<p>Equally neglectful is the abandonment of <strong>thither</strong> and<strong> thence </strong>(&quot;to there&quot; and &quot;from there&quot;). Extraordinary useful words, relegated thoughtlessly to the rear of the locative line.</p>
<p>And then of course, there&#39;s <strong>yon,</strong> <strong>yond</strong> and <strong>yonder</strong>, all related varieties of &quot;there&quot; but further off than &quot;there.&quot; At a distance. Shakespeare, as one would expect, is a most skillful deployer of <strong>yons</strong>. From <em>Hamlet: &quot;</em>But look, the morn in russet mantle clad/ Walks o&#39;er the dew of <strong>yon&#0160;</strong>high eastern hill.&quot;&#0160; From J<em>ulius Caesar</em>. &quot;<strong>Yond</strong> Cassius has a lean and hungry look;/ He thinks too much; such men are dangerous.&quot;&#0160; From <em>Romeo and Juliet. &quot;</em>What lady&#39;s that/ Which doth enrich the hand of <strong>yonder</strong> knight?&quot;</p>
<p>A yonnish locative that is not endangered and continues to thrive is the word <strong>beyond</strong>. Shakespeare&#39;s most remarkable and I daresay most beautiful use of &quot;beyond&quot; occurs in <em>Cymbeline</em>, when Innogen learns that her exiled lover Posthumus Leonatus has returned to England. She is impatient to meet him at Milford Haven; Innogen&#39;s speech that begins with the plaintive cry, &quot;O, for a horse with wings&quot; includes the most transcendent barrier-busting locative in the entire history of the English language. Her longing to see her lover is, she claims, &quot;beyond beyond.&quot; A superlative locative, beyond anyone&#39;s imagination but Will&#39;s.&#0160;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Is there another common English word that exhibits such varied meanings as &quot;boot?&quot; Or one that has shown such continual transformation during my brief years on the planet?</p>
<p>Like much of my early vocabulary, &quot;boot&quot; entered my life through the medium of <a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2006/10/radio_baseball.html">radio baseball </a>. In my mind&#39;s ear, I can hear the voice of Red Barber announcing that &quot;umpire Babe Pinelli has just given the <strong>boot</strong> to Leo Durocher.&quot; &quot;Given the boot&quot; does not make the claim that Durocher was presented with footwear; it means that he was kicked out of the game as if with a metaphorically-booted foot.</p>
<p>Nor was it only obstreperous managers who were &quot;booted.&quot; &quot;There&#39;s a two-hopper to third, but Cox boots it&quot; -- meaning that he bobbled it, even though the ball never touched his foot. In baseball, curiously, you can boot a ball with your hand, which is, logically speaking, as nonsensical as mis-gloving it with your foot.&#0160;</p>
<p>As everyone knows, a boot primarily protects the area from the shin down to the toes. But there&#39;s a second common meaning to &quot;boot&quot;: &quot;something extra,&quot; as in the phrase &quot;to boot.&quot; &quot;He&#39;s a great pitcher -- and a good hitter <strong>to boot</strong>.&quot; The shoe-ish meaning comes through old French from a Germanic source; the profit or use or something-extra meaning derives from an unrelated OE (Old English) word; moreover, in latter stages of its development &quot;boot&quot; has also been influenced by its phonological neighbors booty, and, I suspect, butt.&#0160;</p>
<p>In order to gain some historical perspective, let us consider the ways in which Shakespeare makes use of the word boot. &quot;To boot&quot; meaning &quot;in addition&quot; is employed frequently, as, for example, when Henry IV swears &quot;by my scepter and my soul <strong>to boo</strong>t,&quot; or when Macduff says to Malcolm that &quot;I would not be the villain that thou think&#39;st/ For the whole space that&#39;s in the tyrant&#39;s grasp/ And the rich east to <strong>boot</strong>.&quot; A less familiar use occurs in <em>The Winter&#39;s Tale</em>, when Hermione, accused of adultery, concedes that&#0160; &quot;it shall scarce <strong><span class="keyword1">boot</span></strong> me/ To say &#39;not guilty.&#39;&quot; Her &quot;boot&quot; means that it will not be to her advantage or profit to assert her innocence. This signification can shade over into gain or even into a coin itself, as for example when Camillo passes money to Autolycus, saying,&quot;hold thee, there&#39;s some <strong>boot</strong>.&quot; Contemplating his gain, Autolycus muses, &quot;What an exchange had this been without <strong><span class="keyword1">boot</span></strong>! What a&#0160;<strong><span class="keyword1">boot</span></strong> is here with this exchange.&quot; Just as boot is gain, so bootless means without gain or helpless, as when Henry V explains that he will be powerless to restrain a rampage: &quot;We may as<strong> <span class="keyword1">bootless</span></strong> spend our vain command/ Upon the enraged soldiers in their spoil.&quot;</p>
<p>Shakespeare gets some punning mileage out of the multiple meanings of &quot;boot.&quot; Glendower boasts that &quot;[T]hree times hath Henry Bolingbroke made head/ Against my power; thrice from the banks of Wye/ And sandy-bottom&#39;d Severn have I sent him/ <strong><span class="keyword1">Bootless</span> </strong>home and weather-beaten back. &quot;Bootless&quot; means helpless; but sardonic Hotspur, never noted for a sophisticated sense of humor, cannot resist the obvious pun: &quot;Home without boots. And in foul weather too.&quot;</p>
<p>So a boot can be a shoe, an advantage, an addition, a reward, a help. But look what&#39;s happened to the poor helpless word in more recent times. &quot;Boot Hill&quot; is a cowboy frontier cemetery.&#0160; Across the waters, a &quot;boot&quot; is the trunk of an automobile. The infamous &quot;Denver boot&quot; is a wheel clamp that immobilizes a vehicle. In the army, a boot is a recruit or rookie who is sent to &quot;boot camp.&quot;</p>
<p>But then, along came the computer, where one &quot;boots&quot; or restarts one&#39;s machine. This use, I&#39;m told, originated with the phrase, to &quot;pull oneself up by one&#39;s own bootstraps&quot; -- i.e. perform a difficult task at one&#39;s own initiative, just as a computer starts itself. There&#39;s also the <strong>warmboot</strong>, which sounds little too much like the old torture device, the <strong>Spanish boot</strong> and which can also be called a s<strong>oftboot </strong>(but not by me).&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>In Shakespeare&#39;s day,<strong> boot</strong> was not always distinguished from &quot;booty&quot; as in the case of the Archbishop of Canterbury&#39;s famous bees, which &quot;like soldiers, armed in their stings,/ Make <strong>boot&#0160;</strong>upon the summer&#39;s velvet buds,/ Which pillage they with merry march bring home.&quot; Booty as pillage survives to this day, but is, I think, obsolescent. Nowadays, booty is more likely to be used in the phrase &quot;booty call&quot; which means (and here I&#39;m relying on the invaluable <em>Urban Dictionary</em>) a &quot;telephone call made to request a sexual encounter.&quot; Who would ever have devised or imagined such an innovation?&#0160; Does this booty derive from &quot;shake your booty,&quot; meaning to move your butt or bottom in a sexually suggestive way?&#0160; Not a meaning known to Shakespeare, or at least, not one that the Shakespeare concordance acknowledges.</p>

                                <p>&quot;Troll&quot; is a word that has strangely metamorphosized in the course of my lifetime. While It once had warm associations; now, not so much.</p>
<p>&quot;Troll&quot; came into my life in the late 1940s at Makamah Beach on the Long Island Sound. My grandmother Sonia taught me how to &quot;troll&quot; for bluefish or sunfish. Here&#39;s how you do it. You paddle slowly and let your &quot;shiner&quot; dangle on fishing line a few yards behind the rowboat. &quot;Troll&quot; is very like &quot;trawl.&quot; Perhaps the two words are variants; or perhaps &quot;troll&quot; is a distant descendent of Latin <em>trahere</em>, to drag.&quot; Troll is related to &quot;trolley,&quot; a device used to drag things from place to place, as a trolley does its passengers. &quot;Troll&quot; seems to incorporate the meaning &quot;wander&quot; or &quot;wander into.&quot;</p>
<p>From my early interest in northern mythology (a &quot;mythology,&quot; by the way, is someone else&#39;s religion), I learned that a &quot;troll&quot; is a clumsy ugly monster who hides out under bridges or in cemeteries. Trolls were troublesome, provocative, perhaps even cannibalistic.&#0160;</p>
<p>But nowadays, the older meanings of &quot;troll&quot; have been superseded. A &#39;troll&#39; is now a person who participates in a conversation, usually an internet conversation, with the intention of sowing discord or causing trouble. I am not sure about the origin of this usage, but I would like to guess or hypothesize that it combines the sense of &quot;wandering into&quot; with the malevolence of the Scandinavian figure. A troll is therefore an electronic ogre.</p>

<div class="css-53u6y8">
<p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">I cannot think of a word that has undergone greater change during the course of my lifetime than the plain monosyllable &quot;hack.&quot;</p>
<p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">&quot;Hack&quot; entered my language, like much of my early vocabulary, through the medium of baseball. &quot;He took a good hack at that fastball;&quot; &quot;he&#39;s up there hacking away.&quot; A hack was a hard swing, not necessarily a successful one. [There was also Stan Hack, the great Chicago Cub third baseman whose career was just coming to an end as I was becoming conscious.]&#0160; In the days of my youth, &quot;hack&quot; was also slang for taxicab and a cab driver was a &quot;hackie.&quot; I don&#39;t believe I&#39;ve heard that particular use of the word in decades (except in 1940s movies). In seventh-grade &quot;shop&quot; class at PS 217, Mr. Kaminsky introduced me to the &quot;hacksaw.&quot; The hack in hacksaw derives from a medieval word meaning &quot;cut into pieces,&quot; but the taxi hack has an entirely dissimilar origin. It comes from hackney, a breed of horse and later the carriage itself that the horse drew -- the name of which then migrated to our big yellow taxi.</p>
<p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">When did I first hear the expression, a &quot;hacking cough&quot;?&#0160; And why hacking? Perhaps because the noise of a cough is similar to the sound of the short sharp blows when one hacks through a forest or the jungle with a machete. Maybe that&#39;s how it originated-- but I&#39;m not entirely convinced.</p>
<p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">Hack has another older meaning -- mediocre or failing, or not good at one&#39;s trade, as in a &quot;hack writer,&quot; or a &quot;political hack.&quot; This usage is probably a shortened version of &quot;hackneyed,&quot; meaning trite or overused. When you waste time, you&#39;re just &quot;hacking around.&quot; In such cases,&quot;hack&quot; denoted incompetence.</p>
<p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">Nowadays &quot;hack&quot; has come up in the world. To hack into a computer implies not laziness but skill. In this usage, &quot;hack&quot; is also malicious. Hackers may be smart but they&#39;re also dangerous; they can cause crashes when they illegally intrude to alter a program.&#0160;</p>
<p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">The most common contemporary use of &quot;hack,&quot; if I&#39;m reading the data correctly, occurs in the recent coinage &quot;lifehack,&quot; which is defined as &quot;a strategy or technique adopted in order to manage one&#39;s time and daily activities in a more efficient way.&quot; I can&#39;t be the only person whose junk mail folder is regularly inundated with recommended lifehacks, most of which seem mighty silly or simplistic.&#0160;</p>
<p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">And then there&#39;s an even more specialized use. Here&#39;s one that&#39;s new to me: &quot;scientists announced that they had genetically hacked tobacco plants to photosynthesize more efficiently.&quot; This usage seems to retain something of the older meaning of cut or slash although it is a stretch to envision a genome being attacked by a sword or a snickersnee.&#0160;</p>
<p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">Goodness gracious, it&#39;s a long road from waving at an inshoot with the old hickory to inserting bits of DNA in the tobacco genome. But here we are.</p>

<div class="ZYbY5b aBjGDe">&#0160;</div>
<div class="ZYbY5b aBjGDe">A <em>kurgan</em> is a tumulus or mound erected over a grave, at first in the southern Asian steppes (4th century BCE) and later throughout southeast Europe. I myself saw many kurgans in Bulgaria, but for some reason never learned the word. A <em>saiga&#0160;</em>is a kind of antelope. A <em>zander</em> is a European fish similar to a perch. A <em>chillum&#0160;</em>is a kind of decorated bamboo pipe &quot;often sold in places like Haight-Ashbury and Greenwich Village.&quot; A <em>punkah</em> was, in the late but not-so-great lamented days of the Raj, a large swinging fan, operated by a servant called a <em>punkah wala. Arrack or arac</em> is an alcoholic beverage made from the fermented sap of coconut flowers, which sounds delicious but is probably not available at our local liquor store. The <em>astragalu</em>s, more often called the talus, is a bone in the human foot. The word&#39;s similarity to asparagus is inadvertent but nevertheless amusing. A <em>condyle&#0160;</em>is &quot;a protuberance at the end of a bone.&quot; A <em>swidden&#0160;</em>is an area of land cleared to farm by slashing and burning. Swidden, a truly lovely word, is derived from an Old Norse verb meaning &quot;to burn&quot;-- as well it should be.</div>
<div class="ZYbY5b aBjGDe">&#0160;</div>
<div class="ZYbY5b aBjGDe"><em>Lamellar</em> armor was made from small plates of leather or bronze. Here&#39;s a terracotta statue of a soldier wearing scute-like armor.&#0160;</div>

                                <p><em>Calipash</em> is the &quot;gelatinous greenish material found underneath the upper half of a turtle&#39;s shell.&quot; Perhaps this word is well known to turtle-fanciers, but it&#39;s brand new to me. Calipash is &quot;esteemed as a delicacy&quot; but should not be confused with <em>calipee</em>, which is a fatty gelatinous light-yellow substance found immediately above the turtle&#39;s lower shell. Equally delectable, so say connoisseurs. Here&#39;s a dish of mixed calipash and calipee. I confess that it does not look delectable to me. Looks repellent, in fact, but each to his own.</p>

One might, or might not, add <em>beeswing </em>to the menu. Beeswing is the &quot;filmy translucent crust&quot; that grows on port that has been bottle-aged.</p>
<p><em>Zenana</em> is a word of Persian origin which refers to the part of a large house reserved exclusively for women; it is therefore equivalent to harem.&#0160; Here&#39;s a picture of a rich gentleman visiting a zenana.</p>

                                <p>Turkeys, I was recently surprised to learn, come in two distinct species. The familiar one is the &quot;wild turkey&quot;, <em>Meleagris gallopavo, </em>the big bird that in broods of twenty or so, wanders around my house and garden, eating seeds, insects, acorns and apples and occasionally leaving behind a fancy feather or two.&#0160;</p>
<p><img alt="For many years, wild turkey were missing from Michigan’s landscape. However, they have since made a successful comeback, thanks to careful wildlife management." class="gnt_em_img_i" decoding="async" elementtiming="ar-lead-image" src="https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/01a69089142f279a030c605a67e73d3005cf247c/c=0-130-3008-1829/local/-/media/2017/11/17/DetroitFreeP/DetroitFreePress/636465201392227960-1-TN-DSK59-011.jpg?width=660&amp;height=373&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/01a69089142f279a030c605a67e73d3005cf247c/c=0-130-3008-1829/local/-/media/2017/11/17/DetroitFreeP/DetroitFreePress/636465201392227960-1-TN-DSK59-011.jpg?width=1320&amp;height=746&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp 2x" /></p>
<p>They&#39;re new to the neighborhood. Until about twenty years ago, I had not seen a single turkey; now, they&#39;re everywhere. And bold. Or perhaps just indifferent to me.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>And then there&#39;s the second kind of North American turkey. It&#39;s rare -- found, nowadays, only in the Yucatan peninsula. It&#39;s the &quot;ocellated turkey,&quot;&#0160; and it&#39;s one heck of a fancy bird.</p>

<div class="XiG zI7 iyn Hsu">&#0160;</div>
<div class="XiG zI7 iyn Hsu">Ocellated? I was puzzled, stymied by this unfamiliar word. But then I remembered that an &quot;ocellus&quot; is an architectural term. An ocellus is the circular opening at the top of a dome, familiar to me from its celebrated use in the Roman Pantheon. &quot;Ocellus&quot; is obviously the diminutive of Latin &quot;oculus,&quot; eye. It follows that an &quot;ocellated turkey&quot; is so called because it displays circular markings on its feathers, like a peacock (although none of the pictures of turkeys that I found on the internet revealed eye-like decorations. Many shimmering colors, however.</div>

<div class="uhHOwf BYbUcd" data-bla="">It&#39;s remarkable that the range of the &quot;ocellated turkey&quot; coincides with the habitat of the ocelot.

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I first heard the word &quot;spatchcock&quot; at a Thanksgiving celebration some four or five years ago. The turkey, I was told, had been &quot;spatchcocked.&quot; To be absolutely honest, I thought someone was pulling my leg. To my pure and undefiled ears, the word &quot;spatchcock&quot; sounded more than a little obscene. Certainly not something that a civilized person would do to a turkey. Or even to a fellow human being. I admit that I was puzzled: what sort of perverse activity is implied by &quot;spatchcock.&quot; And just who would be the spatchcocker and who the spatchcockee?</p>
<p>But further investigation revealed that &quot;spatchcock&quot; is not a dirty joke nor even a slangy neologism. The word has an eighteenth-century origin and it&#39;s not sexual but culinary: &quot;to cut poultry along the spine and spread the halves apart for more even cooking when grilled.&quot; Moreover, the word &quot;spatchcock,&quot; believe it or not, has a sibling of its own: &quot;spitchcock&quot;: &quot;to split an eel along the back and then broil it.&quot; So spatchcock and spitchcock, yet as far as I know, no &quot;spotchcock&quot; or &quot;sputchcock&quot;-- but why not?&#0160; Lots of other land and sea beasts out there to de-spine and roast over an open fire. Spatchcocking, the process, probably dates back to the neolithic, after the taming of fire and long before anyone thought to call it by such a silly name.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>Etymology?&#0160; Though there are theories, I&#39;m going to stick with &quot;origin unknown.&quot; The common answer is that the word is <span class="ILfuVd"><span class="hgKElc">&quot;shorthand&#0160; for &#39;dispatching the cock.&#39;&quot; An undocumented, out-of-left-field guess, in my opinion. If I were to propose a theory, I would </span></span><span class="ILfuVd"><span class="hgKElc">say that the &quot;cock&quot; must be a version of&#0160; &quot;cook.&quot; I&#39;m not prepared to venture a guess about the spatch. A mystery, unrecoverable. Perhaps a humorous coinage?</span></span></p>
<p><span class="ILfuVd"><span class="hgKElc">I&#39;d hypothesize that &quot;cock&quot; might be related to the second part of common surnames such as Hancock, Adcock, Babcock, Hitchcock or Wilcox. Some say that the cock in these names is a hypocoristic suffix &quot;applied to a young lad who strutted proudly like a cock.&quot; I&#39;m skeptical. More credible, once again, is &quot;cook.&quot; Hancock is Johan the cook, Adcock is Adam the cook, Hitchcock is Richard (Rich, Hich) the cook, and so on.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="ILfuVd"><span class="hgKElc">The ever-unpredictable Urban Dictionary provides another meaning for &quot;spatchcock&quot;: &quot;w</span></span>hen you intentionally rub your backpack on a nearby stranger&#39;s genitals in an effort to sexually arouse them.&quot; What can I say?&#0160; Only that I&#39;ve lived a long life and have never given a single thought to the erotic potential of the backpack. Nor have I ever been spatchcocked either in the traditional culinary nor the speculative contemporary sexual sense of the word (thanks be to all the gods in the pantheon!)</p>

<div class="entry-body">
<p>I grew up in a baseball-saturated world. The radio voices of Red Barber and Connie Desmond were the water in which I and my family and my neighbors swum. It was therefore natural that I early absorbed the vocabulary of baseball and that many words carried baseball meaning to me long before I recognized their alternative and larger existence.</p>
<p>For example, as a boy, I encountered the word &quot;mound.&quot; It signified, and signified only, a pitcher&#39;s mound -- the ten inches of sand and clay from which a pitcher throws a ball. I had no idea that mounds could exist in nature or indeed, could exist anywhere outside of a stadium, there being no mounds on Coney Island Avenue, or, at least, none that I recognized as such.</p>
<p>And then there was the word &quot;pitcher.&quot; If someone had said to me, in the 1940s, that &quot;little pitchers had big ears,&quot; I might have thought of Preacher Roe, but I would have had no idea that there was such an object as a pitcher for water or other liquid. A pitcher was not jug, ewer, or crock -- it was a man standing on a rubber fooling a batter with a slow curve.</p>
<p>Standing on a &quot;rubber?&quot; Yet another word that had a specific baseball meaning, years before it became an eraser or a galosh or a condom.</p>
<p>Similarly, a &quot;streak&quot; was not a gash of color until many years after it was a winning streak or a losing streak or batting streak. A &quot;dugout&quot; was not a canoe, not in my corner of the universe.&#0160; Nor was a &quot;rally&quot; a political meeting or protest. A rally would never have led to a &quot;strike&quot; -- a word which I knew only as one of the allotted three. &quot;Battery?&quot; A team of pitcher and catcher, not something of military or electrical storage interest.</p>
<p>And then there were the plethora, the fountain of lovely words peculiar to baseball, like &quot;shortstop&quot; and &quot;blooper.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>Inning was exclusively a baseballism. Not so &quot;outing&quot; which was in my childhood a pitcher&#39;s stint on the mound, and which only later became a picnic (or, even later, an involuntary revelation of someone&#39;s sexual inclinations).&#0160;</p>
<p>October 24:&#0160; How could I fail to include &quot;pennant.&quot; When did I learn that a pennant was a kind of triangular flag?&#0160; Not in the 1940s (or even 50s).</p>

                                <p>We watched a Netflix series called <em>Feel Good</em>. I suppose that the series title must be taken ironically, because throughout the first two seasons, not one character seemed to feel even slightly positive or healthy. Just about everyone was miserable -- their unhappiness usually linked to romantic or more specifically sexual dissatisfaction. The program introduced many more eccentric varieties of coupling and frustration than I, a vanilla heterosexual, would have imagined. The main character, Mae Martin, played by Mae Martin, is a boyish lesbian; her on-again, off-again affair with a womanly young lady is the focus of the story. Lots of obstacles both personal and social stand between the two women and the achievement of genuine happiness. Let&#39;s hope that they can figure it all out and find love at long last -- or at least by the end of Season 3.&#0160;</p>
<p>There was one scene that I found to be particularly curious and troublesome. A group of teachers assemble for a meeting, but before taking up business, every one of the participants reveals or defines his or her own sexuality. One young woman, surely the least glamorous of the set, refers to herself as &quot;cishet.&quot; I didn&#39;t catch the word as spoken but fortunately we had the subtitles engaged and I was able to read the word, although in reading I pronounced it to myself as if the sh were a digraph for the lingual palatal fricative as in shut or shun. But I investigated the new word &quot;cishet&quot; -- and sure enough it exists and has become a feature of our contemporary culture. It&#39;s &quot;cis&quot; as opposed to &quot;trans&quot; which means not &quot;across&quot; but &quot;this side&quot; -- as the Romans referred to Gaul as either cisalpine and transalpine. In this coinage, &quot;cis&quot; refer to a person who accepts the gender designation assigned at birth by the appearance of one&#39;s genitals. &quot;Het&quot; is simply a truncation of heterosexual.&quot; &quot;Cishet&quot; therefore means someone who is unambiguously either male or female and is attracted to persons of the opposite sex.</p>
<p>Wow, that&#39;s me. After all these years of just thinking I was an ordinary guy, I now discover that I have a designation. I have a community, a tribe, perhaps even an interest group. Hey, I belong,</p>
<p>But I think that it&#39;s mighty odd and even oppressive that members of a school community, or any community, would feel that it is necessary or advisable to announce their gender classification before getting down to the business of the day. Shouldn&#39;t such information be allowed to remain private. If I want to be cishet, it&#39;s nobody&#39;s business but my own. But perhaps such formal revelations don&#39;t happen in real life -- only in satirical TV series. I sure hope so.&#0160;</p>
<p>Not so for Mae Martin, the first paragraph of whose biography reads &quot;Mae Martin is a Canadian-born comedian, actor, and writer based in England. They wrote and starred in the Netflix comedy series <em>Feel Good</em>.&quot; So it appears that &quot;she&quot; is a &quot;they&quot; which in current modish jargon doesn&#39;t mean that she&#39;s plural but signifies that she feels inadequately represented by the simple and specific feminine pronoun. I can understand her motive, but frankly &quot;they&quot; confuses me and sticks in my ear. I appreciate its value as a statement of resistance to the &quot;hetoro-normative&quot; -- but by golly &quot;they&quot; sure throws a spanner into the grammatico-normative works. It would be good if English had a set of singular pronouns that are as gender indistinct as &quot;they,&quot; but it doesn&#39;t, and to hijack the plural &quot;they&quot; and turn it into a singular is an awkward and I hope ephemeral innovation.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Sometimes I receive communications from people who are much more up to date than dear old dad -- letters that are signed in the traditional way but to which is subjoined, &quot;My pronouns -- &quot;he his,&quot; or &quot;she her hers&quot; (or &quot;they them their&quot;). This habit, I suppose, clears the air and perhaps forestalls some embarrassing or awkward moments, but again, seems unnecessarily revelatory. It&#39;s limiting and partial. It seems to me to declare that such guys and gals were acting in the parochial interest of their own tribe or constituency -- much as if everyone appended to his or her name his own religion or nationality. I&#39;m not happy with this innovation. Although it might seem progressive, it is in my opinion ultimately dangerously reactionary.</p>
<p>Therefore I am not so current that I would include my pronouns on any letters that I write. But I would like to append my adjectives,</p>
<p>Yours very sincerely,</p>
<p>Vivian de St. Vrain</p>
<p>(My adjectives:&#0160; &quot;wise, upstanding, formerly debonair.&quot;)</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Regular readers of this metablague know that Dr. M. has resumed his study of Italian. Foolish say some, but heroic say others, because to try to master a language when one is an octogenarian is truly daunting. However, native speakers of English, even older ones, can, if patient, slowly acquire Italian. Its sounds are similar and sometimes identical to those of English; the conjugations, only three of them, are on the whole regular; and many of its words have English or Latin cognates. For me, pronouns present a problem, because they&#39;re sometimes required when I wouldn&#39;t think to use them, and sometimes dropped when I&#39;d prefer them to be there -- and, moreover, they come in slightly varied direct, indirect, and reflexive forms. And then there are the <em>pronomi combinati</em> or double pronouns which are confusing in themselves and which are sometimes but not always attached to infinitives, gerunds and imperatives as enclitics. It&#39;s probably too late in the game for me to become a fluent speaker, but I have hopes of becoming a competent reader. I can now read at about the 6th or 7th grade level; I have the grammar under control so it&#39;s mostly a problem of vocabulary and idiom.</p>
<p>For a greater challenge, I&#39;ve begun to study a little Beffa. Beffa is a Kartvelian language with admixtures of Cascagian and Ghetti. Fortunately for me, there&#39;s a small Beffan community here in our town. I work with an introductory textbook -- <em>Pathways to Modern Beffa</em> (2012) by Divino Divano -- and with a native speaker named Ismail Kartakov. We meet three times a week when he&#39;s available. Sometimes I enjoy a Beffa-speaking dinner with Ismail and his wife Soraya and their three young children. I&#39;ve also been to some Beffan parties and exuberant dances. I sometimes feel odd-man-out but it&#39;s been fun. The Beffan community, reputedly hostile to outsiders, has been very welcoming. And the goat, mountain oyster, and black radish stew is superb.</p>
<p>Beffa is a bit more complicated than English. For example, while English has 26 consonants, Beffa has 56, including a two kinds of glottal stops that sound almost like clicks as well as a voiced glottal fricative that resembles a cat&#39;s purr. It also has both a voiced and unvoiced bilabial trill that sound a lot like an English &quot;raspberry,&quot; and an unusual, possibly unique lingual-dental stop in which the tongue is pushed firmly against not the upper but the lower teeth. One peculiarity of Beffa is its consonant clusters -- a word may begin with as many as six consonants yoked together before the first vowel appears. Some words have an initial six consonants followed by a vowel and then a cluster of five or six more consonants. This can be strange to English speakers and sometimes I notice Ismail&#39;s younger children giggling at my feeble attempts to replicate their plosives. (Voiceless plosives are usually aspirated and one must take care not to insert a schwa between aspirants.) Beffa also has a varied repertoire of vowels, including a number of diphthongs and a couple of triphthongs. There aren&#39;t any tones, thank goodness. There&#39;s one triphthong the use of which can be perilous, for if you get it wrong the observation &quot;your blue parrot is pining for the fjords&quot; apparently sounds almost exactly like &quot;my knife is longer and sharper than yours.&quot;</p>
<p>Nouns have both natural and grammatical gender. Nouns can be masculine, feminine, neuter, ambiguous, common, animate or inanimate. They can be singular, dual, plural, or paucative (i.e. a few). Neuter nouns rarely have duals. Beffa has six fully formed declensions, distinguished primarily by the fact that plurals in declensions 1 and 3 are formed with a prefix, in 2 and 4 by a suffix, and in 5 and 6 by an infix. There are also some fifteen cases, all useful but some slightly unusual. There are the familiar nominative, possessive, accusative and dative (or indirect object). There are also a series of cases that describe motion: the locative (&quot;the ball that is lying on the ground&quot;), the ablative ((&quot;the ball that is coming in your direction&quot;); the separative (&quot;the ball that is moving away from you&quot;); the commitative (&quot;the ball that is touching your hand&quot;); the partitive (&quot;the ball that has left your hand&quot;); the terminative (&quot;the ball that has stopped moving&quot;); the superessive (&quot;the ball that is on top of another ball&quot;); the penetrative (&quot;the ball that is inside another ball&quot;); the perditive (&quot;the ball that is lost&quot;); the oscillative (&quot;the ball that is going back and forth&quot;); the thumpative (&quot;the ball that is bouncing&quot;); the plungitive &quot;the ball that has fallen into the water&quot;); the remunerative (&quot;the ball that has been bought or sold&quot;); the joculatorative (&quot;the ball that does not fall to the ground&quot;); the alfactorative (&quot;the ball that stinks like a corpse&quot;); the perplexive (&quot;the ball that has disappeared&quot;); and the insouciative (&quot;the ball that has disappeared and no one cares&quot;). Nouns can be either proximate or obviative; nouns that are central to the discourse (proximate) are declined very differently than nouns that are of marginal importance (obviative). There is also an unusual suffix (at least, unusual to me, for I had never encountered it before) that indicates whether the object specified touches the earth or is removed from the earth. And an infix which indicates whether the object is horizontal, vertical, diagonal, spiral, or invisible.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Verbs can be singular dual, plural, paucative, or undetermined: active, passive or middle. There are five fully-formed conjugations and apparently remnants of three others that are retained from the past when the language was more fully synthetic. The most commonly used tenses are present indicative, imperfect indicative, past imperfect indicative, future indicative, future imperfect indicative, future perfect indicative, pluperfect indicative, past pluperfect indicative, future pluperfect indicative, future stative, pluperfect resultative, present optative, future optative, past imperfect optative, present subjunctive, future subjunctive, past pluperfect subjunctive, future pluperfect subjunctive, future pluperfect conditional subjunctive, and future pluperfect optative conditional subjunctive aorist. Curiously, there is no future imperfect subjunctive. Moreover, there are two kinds of vocatives: one when a woman addresses a man; a second when a man addresses a woman or an animal. There is also votive, a tense that was formerly used for addressing the deities in prayer, but is now reserved for tribal chiefs, heads of state or royalty. The votive is very similar to the conditional and the erroneous substitution of a conditional for a votive was formerly grounds for mutilation but nowadays leads only to acute embarrassment, or, in the case of a particularly egregious grammatical lapse, to exile.&#0160;&#0160;</p>

<p>Some verbs are ergative so that the subject of either a transitive or intransitive verb can be in an absolutive case. Some common ergative verbs are &quot;to become,&quot; &quot;to eat,&quot;, and &quot;to gouge&quot; (as in, &quot;to gouge out the eyes of an enemy&quot;).</p>
<p>Beffan script is known as &quot;dabbenaggine.&quot; This passage comments on the familiar Beffan proverb, &quot;If you steal my horse, I will steal your wife.&quot;</p>

<p>Beffa used to be written&#0160;<a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2007/05/boustrophedonia.html">boustrophedonically,</a>&#0160;but since the reforms of 1912 has been written right to left. For some reason which I cannot possibly imagine, dabbenaggine leaves no spaces between words but runs them all together without breaks, which makes it just slightly harder to master. &#0160;&#0160;<a class="image" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mkhedruli.svg"></a>&#0160;</p>
<p>Pronouns and determiners are difficult and complicated and perhaps I&#39;ll describe them sometime in the future when I&#39;m more familiar with their multiple and various forms.</p>

                                <p>I&#39;ve just learned a new word that and I&#39;m trying to figure out how to work it into the conversation. Some sample usages:</p>
<p>&quot;Have you pandiculated today? How often?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m not pleased when you pandiculate at the dinner table.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There were a bunch of kids at the museum today, and half of them were pandiculating.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I thought that the way he pandiculated was ostentatious and rude.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Pandiculation can be very pleasurable, especially early in the morning.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I wasn&#39;t aware that many kinds of mammals pandiculate. You&#39;d never see a reptile or a bird do it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not only did he pandiculate during the concert, but he did it noisily.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think that people should at least cover their mouths when they pandiculate.&quot;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Sometime during the hippie period, say the early 1970s, I&#0160; was driving the big green Dodge station wagon solo from who knows where to somewhere else, and as was my custom in those turbulent days, I picked up a hitchhiker -- a mighty scrawny young guy. He seemed to be in bad shape -- underfed and dirty. I suspected &quot;speed.&quot; Compassionately, I offered him a piece of my sandwich. He turned me down, saying, &quot;I don&#39;t <em>use w</em>hite bread.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>What an effective sentence! In a mere five words,&#0160; he managed to claim complete moral superiority over me. I was now dismissed as a &quot;user&quot; of white bread. and therefore clearly an unenlightened conformist bourgeois -- probably a rabid supporter of the carpet bombing of Cambodia. He, on the other hand, was a butterfly, free and liberated and a dissenter from the Loathed Establishment.</p>
<p>But I don&#39;t think I would remember this incident if it weren&#39;t for his deployment of the word &quot;use.&quot; &quot;Use&quot; asserts an equivalence between two habits -- between whatever cocktail of drugs that he might be injecting or snorting or dropping, and the white bread that I was consuming. It was also implied that my addiction was the worser one. My emaciated pal was, in his own mind, doing me a favor, enlightening me about the depravity of my bread habit.&#0160;</p>
<p>But let me say a word in defense of the bread -- I don&#39;t &quot;use&quot; white bread in the sense of Silvercup or Wonder Bread -- at least not since I left Flatbush neighborhood of origin. The slices of bread in question might not have been made of steelcut handmilled wheat berries enhanced with millet and quinoa and baked in a hickory-fired furnace, but it would have been a perfectly respectable bread and one that should not have been denigrated by a skinny tie-dyed trust fund baby soon to shave his scraggly beard and rejoin his father&#39;s insurance business.</p>
<p>But I sure do admire his use of the verb &quot;use.&quot;</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a more recent incident. On the semi-famous Boulder Mall, not long ago, a panhandler carrying a sign that said, &quot;Anything Helps&quot; held out his hand.&#0160; Compassionately, I gave him a quarter.&#0160; He returned it to me, announcing, &quot;I don&#39;t <em>take </em>coins.&quot;</p>
<p>Well, everybody has to have standards.&#0160;</p>
<p>Once again, I&#39;ve been put in my place by a verb. &quot;I don&#39;t&#0160;<em>take&#0160;</em>coins.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>A third instance: I was in Boston and I wandered into a ragged antique store that sold old and truly ancient Chinese art. The place is a mess but I notice that the goods are museum-quality -- sculptures, mostly, but paintings and even a few bronze pieces -- Neolithic for all I know.&#0160; Way out of the range of my wallet or checkbook. Trying to appear knowledgeable, I ask the proprietor if he has any Green Fitzhugh. Peering over lunettes, he says, with aggrieved condescension, &quot;I don&#39;t <em>do&#0160;</em>export.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Floored again. Put in my place by Mr. Hippie, Mr. Panhandler, and Mr. Antique Dealer -- all of them master practitioners who know how to make a simple monosyllabic verb do a heck of a lot of snobbish work.&#0160;</p>

                                <p>&quot;Kith and kin&quot; is an excellent example of a &quot;pairing&quot; -- sometimes called a &quot;coordinate pair.&quot; A pairing is a linguistic event in which two words join to produce a single meaning.</p>
<p>&quot;Kith&quot; has no independent existence nowadays and only exists as an element of the pair. &quot;Kith and kin&quot; means &quot;family.&quot; Originally, back then, &quot;kith&quot; meant &quot;known&quot; and therefore signified &quot;friends.&quot; &quot;Kith and kin&quot; was &quot;friends and relatives.&quot; No longer; now it means &quot;family and family.&quot; &quot;Time and tide&quot; is another fine pairing; &quot;tide&quot; meant &quot;time&quot; centuries before it came to refer to the moony fluctuation of the seas, although its older meaning survives in &quot;eventide,&quot; &quot;Yuletide,&quot; and similar words. Now &quot;time and tide&quot; seems to evoke the inevitability of both clock and waves -- both of them joined to wait for no man. &quot;Kit and kaboodle&quot; is also a lovely pairing, because &quot;kaboodle&quot; lacks independent existence. It may derive from &quot;boodle&#39; -- a thief&#39;s bundle -- with the &quot;ka&quot; added just for the fun of it. &quot;Dribs and drabs&quot; is more obscure in origin and may not be a true pairing. &quot;Dribs&quot; is probably a variant of &quot;drip&quot; but &quot;drab&quot; was in times past not a small amount of something or other, but an untidy or unchaste woman. It&#39;s possible that &quot;dribs and drabs,&quot; now a rather neat pairing, is better thought of as a reduplicative like mumbo-jumbo or hoity-toity. &quot;Nook and cranny&quot; is a pairing in which both elements survive independently; &quot;nook&quot; originally a corner of a room, and &quot;cranny&quot; a narrow space in which a brown recluse might hide. When someone or something grows by leaps and bounds, it&#39;s hard to tell which is the leap and which the bound. The same with &quot;hot and bothered&quot; -- the two words simply reinforce each other. Similarly, a person might want to &quot;pick and choose&quot; between alternatives, but to do so requires only one action. &quot;Flotsam and jetsam&quot; is an amusing pairing of uncertain origin. It is often thought that flotsam lies on the surface of the water and jetsam is thrown into it, but such a definition might be merely a folk etymology derived from the words &quot;float&quot; and &quot;jettison.&quot; A &quot;hoot and a holler&quot; both refer to shouting, but now they mean &quot;shouting distance.&quot; &quot;Stuff and nonsense&quot; is obvious, but what sort of &quot;stuff&quot; is nonsensical? Perhaps it&#39;s the very vagueness of &quot;stuff&quot; that it allows it to pair up and reinforce &quot;nonsense.&quot; &quot;Alack and alas&quot; is a weary but euphonious pair. &quot;Wrack and ruin&quot; becomes more transparent when it&#39;s remembered that wrack is a variant&#0160; form of wreck -- as &quot;beck and call&quot; becomes clearer when it is recalled that &quot;beck&quot; is a foreshortened version of &quot;beckon.&quot; The cry in &quot;hue and cry&quot; is obvious; the hue is thought to derive from the OF verb <em>huer (</em>shout).&#0160;</p>
<p>Null and void, bag and baggage, prim and proper, vim and vigor, are self-explanatory.</p>
<p>Bits and pieces are sometimes called odds and ends. That&#39;s the long and the short of it.&#0160;Jot and tittle have been thoroughly researched and explicated <a href=" https://www.drmetablog.com/2019/10/jot-and-tittle.html">here.</a></p>
<p>Is &quot;footloose and fancy-free&quot; a pairing. Yes, I think so. An energetic and imaginative pairing.&#0160;</p>

                                <p>In his new book on the Vikings, Neil Price uses some words that I didn&#39;t know. Some old, some new.</p>
<p>&quot;Haptic&quot; -- relating to the sense of touch. A &quot;byre&quot; is farmhouse in which humans live in contact with livestock. A &quot;volute&quot; is a spiral or scroll-like ornament. An &quot;allodium&quot; is land held absolutely and not subject to feudal duties or burdens. A &quot;skald&quot; is a Norse poet. &quot;Theophoric&quot; refers to words, often place names, that embed the name of a god or goddess. &quot;Futhark&quot; is an early or older form of the runic alphabet. A &quot;quern&quot; is a simple mill for grinding grain and consists of two stones, one on top of the other. A &quot;dirham&quot; is an Ottoman coin; the word derives from the Greek drachma. &quot;Tephra&quot; is fragmental material produced by volcanic eruption. A &quot;sigil&quot; is a symbol used in ritual magic. &quot;Lamellar&quot; is the adjectival form of &quot;lamella,&quot; which is a thin flat overlapping scale, in this case used to describe a kind of leather armor. A &quot;hydrarchy&quot; refers to the rule of a piece of land from shipboard, and also to &quot;a pseudogovernmental system of law between pirates at sea.&quot; &quot;Emic,&quot; a fire-new word, describes the analysis of a culture from the perspective of a member of that culture. And my favorite (how could I not have encountered this word before?) -- an &quot;ogonek&quot; is a diacritical hook placed under the lower right corner of a vowel.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <div class="noprint" id="mw-head-base">It&#39;s not often that a figure of speech makes the headlines -- as happened this week with the rhetorical term &quot;sarcasm.&quot; At a press conference a couple of days ago, the present occupant of the White House, Donald J. Trump, whose use of language is occasionally infelicitous, let fly with a giant whopper. He announced that the horrid new coronavirus could be cured by (gasp!) an injection of bleach. When his foolish advice&#0160; attracted scorn, he backtracked by claiming that his words were merely &quot;sarcastic.&quot;</div>
<div class="noprint">&#0160;</div>
<div class="noprint">To put the blame on sarcasm is a transparent lie, of course, believed only by one person in the entire universe -- Trump himself -- although no doubt his brek-a-kek-keks of toadies will pretend that his analysis was pure genius.</div>
<div class="noprint">&#0160;</div>
<div class="noprint">But did he truly mean &quot;sarcasm&quot; -- a trope generally marked by a mocking tone of voice and &quot;a sharp, bitter, cutting or caustic expression, a contemptuous gibe or taunt in which hostility is disguised as humor.&quot; Trump seems to define sarcasm rather more loosely: to him in means &quot;I didn&#39;t say what I said yesterday and, besides, it&#39;s all the fault of the media.&quot; What a curious line of defense, and what a misuse of a rhetorical term!&#0160;</div>
<div class="noprint">&#0160;</div>
<div class="noprint">Besides, one should think twice before invoking sarcasm, because the term has a bad name among the psychologists, who consider it a &quot;maladaptive coping mechanism for those with unresolved anger or frustration.&quot; There&#39;s a class of people who employ sarcasm because they have &quot;certain forms of brain damage as a consequence of lesions in the right parahippocampal gyrus.&quot; I have no particular knowledge of Mr. Trump&#39;s parahippocampal gyrus, but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it&#39;s taken a bit of a beating these last few years.</div>
<div class="noprint">&#0160;</div>
<div class="noprint">Sarcasm has even been banned by Trump&#39;s great friend Kim Jong-Un. No sarcasm in North Korea -- a rare instance of a figure of speech being consigned to a firing squad.</div>
<div class="noprint">&#0160;</div>
<div class="noprint">Besides, Trump is already the master of a number of the tropes of traditional rhetoric. There&#39;s<em> enellage, </em>a sentence that ignores the usual grammatical rules and conventions; s<em>olecism</em> and <em>tautology,&#0160;</em>gross violations of syntax and logic; <em>hyperbole,</em> or exaggeration, and its less well-known cousin, <em>adynaton, </em>a collection or list of impossibilities; <em>aposiopesis, </em>the sudden end of a sentence before completion; and <em>paraprosdokian, </em>the unexpected truncation of a clause. But all would agree that the figure of speech that Trump deploys most regularly is<em> prevaricatio.</em></div>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Frequentatives perplex me. Even<span style="font-size: 10pt;"> on good days, I can&#39;t tell a frequentative from an iterative or what used to be called a present progressive or even from a simple present that expresses a continuing action, such as &quot;he walks to work&quot; -- in the sense that he walks every day or many days, not just once. So instead of struggling with definition and nomenclature, I&#39;ll confine these paragraphs to old-fashioned frequentatives formed in the traditional way -- by the addition of an &quot;-er&quot; or &quot;-le&quot; suffix.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&quot;Wrestle&quot; is a gold star, certified frequentative. The verb &quot;wrest&quot; means &quot;to grab&quot; or &quot;to snatch.&quot; The verb &quot;wrestle&quot; implies that the grabbing or snatching does not occur in one unique instance, but continues over a stretch of time. Wrestle is therefore the frequentative of wrest. </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">In the English language, such frequentatives were once upon a time regularly produced. No longer, apparently; more&#39;s the pity. Frequentative productivity has hit rock bottom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Frequentatives in &quot;-er&quot; are not always obvious, inasmuch as the &quot;-er-&quot; suffix is also used for agency and for comparison. But frequentatives do follow a pattern: blab yields blabber; gleam yields glimmer; climb, clamber; float, flutter; put, putter; slide, slither.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&quot;-le&quot; frequentatives are more common and more varied. </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Consider the relation between &quot;fond&quot; and &quot;fondle&quot;. &#39;&quot;Fond&quot; meant something like &quot;to be in love, to dote.&quot; Somewhere before its first appearance in print in 1796, fond acquired an -le to become &quot;fondle&quot; = caress.&#0160; (Fondle in its turn generated &quot;fondlesome&quot; -- a word which went from neologism to obsolete in an 18th century flash, and whose extinction is much to be regretted. Let&#39;s revive &quot;fondlesome&quot;.)&#0160;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Here&#39;s a short list of intriguing -le frequentatives: crumb, crumble; drip, dribble; nose, nuzzle; prick, prickle; daze, dazzle; joust, jostle; prate, prattle; spark, sparkle; spit, spatter; stride, straddle; suck, suckle. Not all of these frequentatives are as obvious as wrest-wrestle and some cases must be confirmed with the help of a good etymological dictionary. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Frequentatives have a long history. Why can&#39;t they make a comeback? Take a verb such as &quot;jump.&quot; Doesn&#39;t English need &quot;jumple,&quot; a word that would accurately describe the deportment of my twin 4-year-old grandsons. They don&#39;t just jump -- they jumple. Sometimes they leaple. Other useful suggestions: hit, hittle; throw, throwel; run, runnle; hop, hopple. Scream, scrimmle. The possibilities, obviously, are endless.</span></span></p>
<p>The time has come for a Frequentative Renaissance.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Let me guess that a modern reader coming upon Shakespeare&#39;s euphonious phrase &quot;vaulting variable ramps&quot; would be baffled as to its sense. Just WS being willfully obscure, one might complain. But it&#39;s not so; it&#39;s just that the language keeps on changing, making things difficult for audiences and readers.</p>
<p>The most obvious meaning &#0160;of &quot;vaulting various ramps&quot; -- hurdling a miscellaneous series of inclined planes, as in a steeplechase -- won&#39;t fly. &quot;Ramps&quot; takes us down a wrong path, because its modern meaning (a wood or concrete construction leading from one level to another) was unknown in 1611. It didn&#39;t enter the English language until 1778 -- as a borrowing from French <em>rampe</em>. (The entrance to a highway, as in &quot;take the ramp on the right&quot; is an Americanism dating only to the 1950s.)</p>
<p>A &quot;ramp&quot; is also a vegetable. It&#39;s an uncultivated, wild member of the onion family lately celebrated by fad foodies (or food faddies) as a great delicacy. But why Shakespeare would want someone to hurdle an individual ramp or even a field of ramps is less than obvious. Another false start.</p>
<p>Let us therefore examine the context of the phrase &quot;vaulting variable ramps.&quot;</p>
<p>It occurs in <em>Cymbeline, </em>the most magical of Shakespeare&#39;s last plays. Nasty Iachimo (&quot;little Iago&quot;) tries to persuade Innogen that her virtuous husband Postumus has been unfaithful -- that he has, in another splendid Shakespearean phrase, &quot;partner&#39;d with tomboys.&quot; The situation excites Shakespeare&#39;s exuberant pen. Iachimo embroiders &quot;tomboys&quot; and claims that Postumus has consorted with &quot;with diseased ventures/ That play with all infirmities for gold/ Which rottenness can lend nature; such boil&#39;d stuff/ As well might poison poison.&quot; Should she, that is, Innogen (and here Iachimo&#39;s rhetoric soars)</p>
<p>&#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160;Live, like Diana&#39;s priest, betwixt cold sheets,</p>
<p>&#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160;While he [Postumus] is vaulting variable ramps,</p>
<p>&#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160;In your despite. &#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;Ramps,&quot; therefore, are the opposite of Diana&#39;s priestesses, who live chastely; they are in fact loose women. Ramps who are neither architectural nor vegetable, but sexual and promiscuous. At least, they are so in this instance, because otherwise &quot;ramp&quot; carried a meaning closer to &quot;virago&quot; -- in 1611 an overbearing woman but not necessarily an unchaste one. The word &quot;ramp&quot; in this signification has disappeared but has bequeathed us &quot;rapscallion&quot; (which was earlier spelled both &quot;ramscallion&quot; or &quot;rampscallion.&quot;) There is no evidence to support the easy inference that rapscallion combines &quot;ramp&quot; and &quot;scallion.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Vaulting variable ramps&quot; means &quot;to engage in a series of athletic sexual encounters.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>To vault into a lover&#39;s bed might seem to border on the comic but I don&#39;t think that it does so in this case. Shakespeare elsewhere seems to imagine intercourse as a vigorous event. A brothel is in his language a &quot;leaping house.&quot; And surely it&#39;s not comic when Juliet hopes that Romeo will &quot;leap to [her] arms.&quot;</p>
<p>The conception behind &quot;vault&quot; and &quot;leap&quot; reappears in the contemporary demotic phrase &quot;jump his/her bones.&quot;</p>
<p>Ramps:</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>First of all, let us dismiss the notion that Charles Dickens invented a pair of persnickety punctilious accountants and named them Jot and Tittle. Sorry, it could or should have been the case, but it&#39;s not so.&#0160;Nevertheless, both &quot;jot&quot; and &quot;tittle,&quot; often found in each other&#39;s cozy company, have stories to tell.</p>
<p>Take jot, for example. In the&#0160;masterful &quot;seduction scene&quot; in Shakespeare&#39;s <em>Othello</em>, Iago first torments the Venetian general and then pretends sympathy: &quot;I see this (i.e. his nasty sly hints that Desdemona has been a-bed with Cassio) hath a little dashed your spirits.&quot; Othello responds defensively, perhaps a tad dishonestly: &quot;Not a jot, not a jot.&quot;</p>
<div data-dobid="dfn">The noun &quot;jot&quot; is not obsolete but it&#39;s not common either. What is a jot? A tiny bit, a shred, a whit, a speck, a scintilla, a mite, a trace, a skoch, an inkling, a dollop. Smaller by far than a mere smidgeon. But in its root meaning, was a jot a <span style="line-height: 1.3;">measure of liquid, such as an ounce? or of weight, such as a gram? A measure of distance? &#0160;A measure of time: &quot;I&#39;ll be with you in just a jot.&quot;</span></div>
<p>Professor Google tells me it&#39;s none of those things and that I am entirely off track. &quot;Jot&quot; is alphabetic; it translates the Greek &quot;iota,&quot; the smallest letter -- no more than a single straight line, a minimal minim. And therefore Othello might just as well have said (the words are cognates), &quot;Not an iota, not an iota.&quot; He might have said it, that is, if he hadn&#39;t spent his dearest action in the tented field engaging exclusively in broils and battles, but instead had studied at some North African classical academy.</p>
<p>In fact, Shakespeare either didn&#39;t know or didn&#39;t use the word &quot;iota,&quot; which seems not to have entered English until a generation after he ceased putting quill to paper. On the other hand, Shakespeare was mighty fond of the word jot, which he employed at least twenty times (though never so notably as in <em>Othello),</em>&#0160;always to denote a small quantity and frequently to appear as a partitive: &quot;jot of promise,&quot; &quot;jot of ceremony,&quot; &quot;jot of color,&quot; &quot;jot of pleasure,&quot; &quot;jot of blood.&#39;&quot; Shakespeare&#39;s &quot;jot&quot; can even signify a moment in time: &quot;No, faith, I&#39;ll not stay a <span class="keyword1">jot</span> longer.&quot; (His &quot;jot&quot; is always a noun, never the converted verb meaning &quot;to write a few words quickly.&quot;)</p>
<p>Shakespeare undoubtedly knew the word &quot;jot&quot; from its famous and mysterious appearance in&#0160;<em>Matthew</em> 5:18. Here&#39;s the familiar King James Version (1611): &quot;For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.&quot; The phrasing is almost the same in the Geneva Bible of 1576 -- the translation that Shakespeare himself knew and used. &quot;<span style="line-height: 1.3;"><span style="line-height: 1.3;">For truly I say unto you, Till heaven and earth perish, one jot or one tittle of the Law shall not escape, till all things be fulfilled.&quot;</span></span></p>
<div data-dobid="dfn">
<p>I don&#39;t know what &quot;all things&quot; are and I certainly don&#39;t know what is meant by &quot;fulfilled.&quot; But why should I, since Jesus&#39;s prophesy has long baffled trained professional theologians. But I do know that the pairing of &quot;jot and tittle&quot; has become proverbial.</p>
<p>What, then, is a &quot;tittle.&quot; No, it&#39;s not a very small female breast. Nor is it a diminutive seabird, though it&#39;s not difficult to imagine a rocky south Atlantic island frequented by the &quot;Lesser, or Little Tittle.&quot; In actual fact, it&#39;s a stroke of a pen -- and one that&#39;s even smaller than an iota. Specifically, it&#39;s the dot over the lower case &quot;i&quot; or lower case &quot;j.&quot; Or, in an extended sense, any simple diacritical mark.&#0160;</p>
<p>Shakespeare used &quot;tittle&quot; just twice. The first was in <em>Love&#39;s Labor&#39;s Lost</em>&#0160;in a passage in which Shakespeare makes game of affected language. Pompous Don Armado de Adriano compares little things (the woman he woos) to greater things (himself) &quot;Shall I entreat thy love? I will. What shalt thou exchange for rags? robes; for <span class="keyword1">tittles</span>? titles; for thyself? me.&quot; What a difference a &quot;t&quot; makes! &quot;Tittle&quot; makes its second, almost inadvertent, appearance in <em>The Winter&#39;s Tale </em>as an element in the dismissive reduplicative &quot;tittle-tattling.&quot; Both of Shakespeare&#39;s tittles acknowledge that the word is an inherently silly one. Is it accidental that a number of words that resemble tittle are frivolous or infantile: babble, toddle, tattle, prattle? &#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;Tittle&quot; smacks of triviality. It lacks heft. It would have been a literary disaster, a catastrophe of the first order, if Othello had responded to Iago not with &quot;Not a jot, not a jot,&quot; but with &quot;not a tittle, not a tittle.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>[October 29] &#0160;Otis Brown responds: &quot;Dr. M.: you&#39;ve forgotten the most famous Tittle of all: Yelberton Abraham. How could you?</p>
<p>[November 2] &#0160;Vivian de St. Vrain responds:</p>

                                <p>If a widow and a widower form a relationship when they&#39;re both in their seventies, what is the proper and appropriate name for their relationship?</p>
<p>Legally, they&#39;re married, because here in the state of Colorado, if you live together and represent yourself as married, you&#39;re married, even if you haven&#39;t sought governmental sanction. Yet &quot;husband&quot; and &quot;wife&quot; don&#39;t come easily to the lips. They seem too doggone official. And they also seem like words out of an earlier era, especially &quot;wife,&quot; which carries irrelevant overtones of a dominant-submissive relationship. &quot;Just a housewife.&quot;</p>
<p>But &quot;companion&quot; is only slightly better. To my ear, it smacks of &quot;faithful companion Tonto.&quot; &quot;Partner&quot; is even worse; are we associates in a law firm?&#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;Girlfriend&quot; and &quot;boyfriend&quot; are clearly ludicrous and inappropriate to persons of mature years. Such words lack seriousness and heft; they trivialize a weighty relationship. So, similarly, does the naked &quot;friend,&quot; which in this context is colorless, neutral. &quot;Ladyfriend&quot; is a bit more serious. &quot;Gentleman caller&quot; was last said without irony in Peoria sometime in the middle of the nineteenth century. &quot;Mistress&quot; suggests that the friendship is merely sexual; its counterpart, &quot;gigolo,&quot; is even more specific, and seedy to boot. &quot;Lover&quot; is also one-dimensional.&#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;Old lady&quot; and &quot;old man&quot; are outmoded hippieisms. So is &quot;significant other.&quot; Other archaisms: &quot;main squeeze,&quot; &quot;stud,&quot; &quot;pal,&quot; &quot;steady lay,&quot; &quot;fancy man.&quot; &#0160;&quot;Love-slave.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;Spouse&quot;? No, too dry, too legalistic. &quot;Consort&quot;? &#0160;Disrespectful. &quot;Odalisque&quot;? &quot;Handmaiden.&quot; Sexist. &quot;Concubine?&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>It&#39;s fascinating that we&#39;ve had more trouble with nomenclature than with living, eating, working, and sleeping together.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>There are some words which one might study and parse the dictionary definition and yet still not understand -- words for which one has no intuitive or even rational conception. For example, there&#39;s the word &quot;heaven.&quot; I know that &quot;heaven&quot; can mean &quot;sky,&quot; a definition that poses no problem, but when &quot;heaven&quot; is presumed to refer to a place beyond the sky in which the souls of dead people are eternally rewarded, then I&#39;m absolutely baffled. My brain empties out. &quot;Heaven&quot; in such a sense is to me incomprehensible and meaningless nonsense.</p>
<p>Another such word is &quot;worship,&quot; a word which has always puzzled me, right from the start, when the church bells of St Rose of Lima would ring on a Sunday morning to call parishioners to mass, leaving me and my brothers to play stickball or punchball all by ourselves. I recognize that &quot;worship&quot; is a word to which communities of English speakers give assent, and I observe that people attend temples, mosques, and tabernacles to perform certain activities, such as kneeling, genuflecting, singing hymns and uttering hosannas. Nevertheless, I can&#39;t agree that such activities equal &quot;worship&quot; -- because &quot;worship&quot; presupposes that there is an entity to which these activities are directed. And that entity, like &quot;heaven&quot; in the religious sense, doesn&#39;t exist. Just as heaven is a non-existent place, so worship posits a non-existent entity. And therefore the word &quot;worship&quot; has no intelligible meaning, to me.</p>
<p>Perhaps I lack what Charlotte Bronte called an &quot;organ of veneration.&quot; Or, alternatively, worshipers are engaged in mass delusion.&#0160;</p>
<p>On the other hand, I have an excellent grasp of the word &quot;awe.&quot; In fact, I am a great practitioner of awe. I&#39;m regularly &quot;awed&quot; by both the achievements of my fellow beings in art, architecture, music, literature, mathematics and science, and also by the majesty of nature, in the form of grand canyons and in the triumphs of evolution. Moreover, I&#39;ve felt &quot;awe,&quot; in cathedrals and once, in the Church of the Rock in Helsinki -- a magnificent building that melds human ingenuity with natural beauty, -- overwhelming, transcendent awe. &#0160;And I can understand that for some people what I identify as &quot;awe&quot; might translate into &quot;worship.&quot; &#0160;But again, not me. Though I&#39;m awed by Rembrandt and Bach, but I don&#39;t worship them or their works. I&#39;ll stick with awe.</p>
<p>I may lack an &quot;organ of veneration,&quot; but I have a highly developed organ of wonderment.</p>
<p>Update on &quot;worship.&quot; &#0160;For the first time in my life, a few weeks ago, I attended a religious service. I was in New Orleans and friends suggested that I join them at Vespers at Trinity Episcopal Church on Jackson Avenue. The attraction was Ellis Marsalis, who was to play a few notes for the attendees. A priest or whatever he&#39;s called, said a few words, read a prayer, and then elderly, frail Mr. Marsalis sat down at the piano and improvised for a few minutes. It was beautiful and perhaps transcendent. I suppose it was a form of worship. And it didn&#39;t hurt a bit.&#0160;</p>
