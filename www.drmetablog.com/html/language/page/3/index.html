                                <p>The foulest, most obscene word in the English language, at least as far as sound is concerned, is, by all odds, &quot;kumquat.&quot;&#0160; It&#39;s hard to say whether it&#39;s the &quot;kum&quot; or the &quot;quat&quot; that is more reprehensible, but the two together, o my goodness gracious! &quot;Kum&quot; is linked to Fr. &quot;con&quot; and ME (Middle English) &quot;queynte&quot; as well as to the common colloquialism for sexual climax. &quot;Quat&quot; recalls Shakespeare&#39;s &quot;quatch buttock&quot; and also &quot;quatch&quot; in its exceedingly vulgar modern urban signification. Readers attentive to language will also hear in &quot;quat&quot; an echo of Robert Browning&#39;s famous &quot;twat.&quot; (PG-13 rated note: Having encountered in an anonymous 1660 poem the couplet &quot;They talk&#39;d of his having a Cardinall&#39;s Hat; /They&#39;d send him as soon an Old Nun&#39;s Twat,&quot; Browning took &quot;twat&quot; to refer to article of clothing and so composed the following: &quot;Then owls and bats/ Cowls and twats/ Monks and nuns in a cloister&#39;s moods/ Adjourn to the oak-stump pantry.&quot;&#0160; It would appear that Browning was insufficiently alert to obscenity.)</p>
<p>&quot;Kumquat&quot; should properly be used in formulations such as &quot;why don&#39;t you shove it up your kumquat?&quot; or &quot;eat my kumquat,&quot; or &quot;your mother is a kumquat.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>If only Kobe Bryant hadn&#39;t called the referee a &quot;fucking f-gg-t&quot; but had called him a &quot;fucking kumquat&quot; instead. He would not been fined $100,000 and he would have enjoyed a far more satisfactory vituperative experience.&#0160;</p>
<p>Incidentally, one of the most popular varieties of kumquat is the &quot;fukushu.&quot; Honest.&#0160;&#0160; <strong><br /></strong></p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>It&#39;s been a Charles Dickens revival here.&#0160; The Dickens&#0160;formula -- &quot;make them laugh, make them cry, make them wait&quot; -- works as well for me now as it did fifty years ago.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>I was curious to fill in the gaps in my knowledge, so&#0160;I trotted over&#0160;to the library and found a newish biography of Dickens.&#0160; It looked eminently respectable:&#0160; St. Martin&#39;s Press and its author a &quot;Professor of English Studies&quot; at the University of Stirling.&#0160;</p>
<p>But youch, what a travesty the new &quot;biography&quot;&#0160;turned out to be.&#0160;</p>
<p>Here follow&#0160;some sentences (none of which I&#39;ve altered in the least) from a book which&#0160;has the temerity to call itself <em>Charles Dickens, A Literary Life.&#0160;</em> Prepare yourself for&#0160;pretention, bathos, meandering metaphors&#0160;and syntactic peculiarities marinated in post-modern obfuscation.&#0160;&#0160;Savor these monstrosities.&#0160;<em>&#0160; </em></p>
<p>&quot;&#39;Dickens,&#39; a convenient and perhaps unavoidable label, masks a range of Dickenses, which, taken together, constitute a highly complex whole.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In short, this book will attempt to separate out at least some of the contextual forces that flowed through Dickens&#39;s pen along with the ink at the moment when he sat down to the ostensibly solitary and private process of making that series of black marks on white paper that we call novels.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Suffering is a crucial part of the artistic process and the artist is seen as quite different from the ordinary run of people through his possession of a creative power akin to that of God in His creation of the world.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This aspect of his career can be explored in a number of ways, in his deep respect for his own activity as a novelist as well as in an intense concern to extract his full pound of flesh financially from publishers and also, in a sense, from the public.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A dramatic opening and an exciting climax are desirable features of any narrative, but the desire to impose them on historical narratives may distort the flow that is an inherent aspect of historical process.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But the facts and arguments of this chapter show that the point at which Pickwick Papers came into being was one of turbulence in publishing which carried with it, as periods of turbulence always do, possibilities of movement in a variety of directions.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The serial violates the decorum appropriate to high art and the imagery of the passage embodies a distate of profusion which could be likened to a class-based disdain for the crowded urban environment and dislike of such new-fangled phenomena as the railway.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Public school meant the classics and, in England, university spelled Oxford or Cambridge, &#39;advantages&#39; which Dickens conspicuously lacked.&quot;</p>
<p>I could wisecrack about each of the above sentences, but I&#39;m in a more-in-sorrow-than-in-anger frame of mind.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;Why oh why do academics feel they have to write this way?&#0160;&#0160;Such woeful prose and trumpeting obviousness compromise the reputations of sober scholars and teachers.&#0160;</p>
<p>Does the author of this book realize that he&#39;s&#0160;bamboozling himself?&#0160; &#0160;&#0160;Does he know how&#0160;ridiculous he is?&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>One of my loyal readers (see &quot;Comments&quot; to previous post) wants to know how the word &quot;antres&quot; was pronounced. It&#39;s a reasonable inquiry but like many questions about Shakespeare, its answer is not easy.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>I myself pronounce &quot;antres&quot; just as I would &quot;antlers,&quot; but without the &quot;l&quot;. If I were to guess at an Elizabethan pronounciation (and it would be a guess, even though I&#39;ve stumbled through the volumes on Shakespearean pronunciation by Kokeritz and Cercignani), I would say the word with a more open initial vowel:&#0160; &quot;ahnters.&quot; But can we ever be certain how words were pronounced four hundred years ago?&#0160; Especially nonce-words like antres?&#0160;</p>
<p>Moreover,&#0160;Shakespeare did not spell antres, &quot;antres.&#39;&#0160; Antres is a brilliant editorial intervention that made its initial appearance&#0160;in Lewis Theobald&#39;s <em>The Works of Shakespeare </em>in 1733.</p>
<p>The&#0160;first time that <em>Othello&#0160;</em>saw print, in the 1622 quarto, antres was &quot;Antrees.&quot; The second time, in the first Folio of 1623, antres was &quot;Antars.&quot;&#0160; Are either one of these spellings, each of which yields a different pronounciation, authoritative?&#0160; It is impossible to know. With some plays, it&#39;s clear that F was set from Q, and that therefore any divergences are likely to be errors. But in the case of <em>Othello</em>, Q and F descend independently from a lost original (and it&#39;s been suggested that Q reveals evidence of the interpolations and misunderstandings of actors). Neither &quot;Anteers&quot; or &quot;Antars&quot; is definitive. Either pronunciation can therefore be justified.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>Perhaps Shakespeare changed his mind. Perhaps a scribe or a typesetter, struggling with a unique and unfamiliar work, took a guess. The rest is silence.&#0160; &#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>The artistry of&#0160;<em>Romeo and Juliet </em>I.v.30-41 is, I fear, under-appreciated. It&#39;s an utterly revolutionary moment in the history of the drama, but it&#39;s so subtle, so art-that-hides-art, that it easily slips under the radar. Let me quote in full.</p>
<p><em>Capulet.&#0160; </em>Nay sit, nay sit, good cousin Capulet,</p>
<p>For you and I are past our dancing days.</p>
<p>How long is&#39;t now since last yourself and I</p>
<p>Were in a masque?</p>
<p><em>Cousin Capulet.&#0160;</em>&#0160;&#0160;By&#39;r Lady, thirty years.</p>
<p><em>Capulet.&#0160; </em>What, man, &#39;tis not so much, &#39;tis not so much.</p>
<p>&#39;Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio</p>
<p>Come Pentecost as quickly as it will,</p>
<p>Some five and twenty years: and then we masqu&#39;d.</p>
<p><em>Cousin Capulet.&#0160; </em>&quot;Tis more, &#39;tis more, his son is elder, sir:</p>
<p>His son is thirty.</p>
<p><em>Capulet.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; </em>Will you tell me that?</p>
<p>His son was but a ward two years ago.</p>
<p><em>Romeo.&#0160; </em>What lady&#39;s that which doth enrich the hand</p>
<p>Of yonder knight?</p>
<p><em>Romeo and Juliet </em>is a play of rhetorical experimentation. In its course, Shakespeare employs extravagant puns and wordplay, rhyme, prose, embedded sonnets, stichomythia, two passages of contrived, Petrarchan oxymora, outrageous bawdy, lament both real and parodic -- everything, in fact, that was in the garner&#0160;of a&#0160;1590s playwright.</p>
<p>The overlooked conversation between old Capulet and his cousin is an innovative&#0160;piece of rhetoric of Shakespeare&#39;s own invention. It&#39;s simply everyday, colloquial conversation -- in his time, a complete and utter novelty.</p>
<p>It&#39;s two old guys talking the way old guys talk when they&#39;re savoring the past. Repetitions: &quot;&#39;tis not so much, &#39;tis not so much&quot; and &quot;&#39;tis more, &#39;tis more&quot;; mock challenge: &quot;will you tell me that&quot;?; references to details known only to the participants: &quot;Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio...&quot;; homely exaggerations: &quot;His son was but a ward two years ago.&quot; Even though Shakespeare casts the passage in blank verse, he&#0160;manages to capture the authentic sound of real people engaged in real conversation.</p>
<p>But why?&#0160; It&#39;s all a trick or device to set off&#0160;the sentence of Romeo&#39;s that follows.</p>
<p>Unlike the Capulet cousins, Romeo is wholly captured by the language of&#0160;splendid and hyperbolic love-longing. Shakespeare therefore encourages&#0160;his audience to contrast&#0160;the everyday quality of &quot;His son was but a ward two years ago&quot; with Romeo&#39;s &quot;What lady&#39;s that which doth enrich the hand/ Of yonder knight.&quot; Needless to say, there are no knights at this&#0160;merchant-class gathering. &quot;Knights&quot; are a creation of Romeo&#39;s imagination. So is the&#0160;slightly&#0160;archaic phrase &quot;yonder knight,&quot;&#0160;which is directly out of the world of romance and clashes magnificently with the&#0160;context that Shakespeare has so carefully contrived. So too the&#0160;inversion &quot;what lady&#39;s that&quot; instead of &quot;who is that lady&quot; and the highly poetical (and supremely&#0160;beautiful) &quot;enrich the hand.&quot;</p>
<p>Romeo&#39;s sentence is at the same time very serious and highly comic -- a triumph of Shakespeare&#39;s original and&#0160; almost invisible craft.</p>

                                <p>At the coffee shop, reading Crackanthorpe and drinking my horrid decaf tea, a phrase from the conversation of the important-looking business guys at the next table wafted my way. &quot;We don&#39;t have to re-invent the wheel.&quot; Wow, I thought to myself, does anyone still perpetrate that old cliche -- and do so without a shred of irony or self-awareness?&#0160; I listened more closely to them and in less than five minutes plucked the following flowers of wilted rhetoric:</p>
<p>&quot;From the get-go&quot; -- &quot;chicken-and-egg problem&quot; -- &quot;here&#39;s the pressure point&quot; -- &quot;low-hanging fruit&quot; -- &quot;where the rubber meets the road&quot; -- &quot;that&#39;s the genie coming out of the bottle&quot; -- &quot;it&#39;s fifty-fifty&quot;&#0160; -- &quot;here&#39;s my quick pitch.&quot;</p>
<p>All useful phrases, I suppose. Shorthand. But, nevertheless, kind of embarrassingly banal.</p>
<p>If these guys sensed my disapproval, why, they&#39;d probably laugh all the way to the bank.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>My advice to them, and to others similarly situated: when you use cliches, try to think outside the box and turn it into a win-win situation. You don&#39;t have to knock the ball out of the park, language-wise, but you don&#39;t need to throw anyone under the bus either. It&#39;s all water under the bridge that we&#39;ll cross when we get there. Can we agree to disagree?&#0160; When you look at this problem from the 30,000 foot level, then, and only then, can you eat the elephant one bite at a time. So, let&#39;s give it 110%. And, you know, if you fail to plan, you plan to fail. Are we all on the same page?&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>In <em>The Second Part of King Henry the Fourth, </em>the Hostess (also known as Nell or Mistress Quickly) regularly makes fritters of the English language. At one point in the play, she is beside herself -- apoplectic, in fact -- because she believes that she has been abused by Falstaff. Reaching for words to equal her anger, she tries for &quot;homicidal&quot; three consecutive times. First she calls Falstaff a &quot;honeysuckle villain,&quot; then a &quot;honeyseed rogue&quot; and finally she settles on &quot;hempseed.&quot; Although &quot;honeysuckle&quot; and &quot;honeyseed&quot; are amusing guesses, we feel --or perhaps I should speak only for myself-- I feel just a bit guilty that I&#39;ve let Shakespeare amuse me at the expense of an illiterate woman&#39;s linguistic lapses.</p>
<p>I have the same reservations about Charles Dickens&#39;s jokes on the unlettered; the word &quot;apoplexy,&quot; for example, appears as &quot;happyplexy.&quot;&#0160; It makes a second appearance in <em>Great Expectations, </em>when Jo Gargery, of whom much is made that he has never learned to read or write, explains that his father died of a &quot;purple leptic fit.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>I think that pillorying linguistic errors is more fun when the perpetrators are not illiterate but pretentious. Such is the case in Sheridan&#39;s <em>The Rivals </em>(1775), where Mrs. Malaprop, striving for &quot;pinnacle,&quot; refers to a character as &quot;the very pineapple of perfection.&quot; The most famous sentence in <em>The Rivals: &quot;</em>Sure, if I reprehend any thing in this world it is the use of my oracular tongue, and a nice derangement of epitaphs&quot; (apprehend, vernacular, arrangement, epithets).&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>In the last couple of years, there&#39;s been an attempt to distinguish a subset of such malapropisms as &quot;eggcorns.&quot; The neologism derives from the unlearned collapse of &quot;acorn&quot; into &quot;eggcorn&quot; (a substitution which is more intelligible when the word egg is pronounced as in rural &quot;aig&quot;). An eggcorn is supposed to be a special variety of malapropism in that &quot;the new phrase makes sense on some level (&#39;old-timer&#39;s disease&#39; for &#39;Alzheimer&#39;s disease&#39;). But what sort of sense?&#0160; Why is &quot;baited breath&quot; for &quot;bated breath&quot; anything more than a simple spelling error?&#0160; For that matter, &quot;honeysuckle villain&quot; and &quot;honeyseed rogue&quot; also make a kind of sense -- a Shakespearean and psychological sense. The Hostess unconsciously reveals that she&#39;s sweet on Falstaff.</p>
<p>In any case, there&#39;s now an eggcorn <a href="http://eggcorns.lascribe.net/">database</a> on the internet.&#0160; A goodly number of the eggcorns are errors that have appeared time without number on student essays. I can&#39;t guess how often I used to encounter &quot;peak (or peek) one&#39;s curiosity,&quot; &quot;leech&quot; for &quot;leach,&quot; &quot;peon&quot; for &quot;paean,&quot; or &quot;pier&quot; for &quot;peer&quot;;&#0160; or how many times students would &quot;pour&quot; over their work. I remember being stunned the first time that I encountered &quot;morays&quot; for &quot;mores,&quot; but I eventually acclimated to that formidable shock. What can it possibly mean to &quot;reek&quot; havoc?&#0160; Others common student errors: &quot;spade&quot; for &quot;spayed&quot; (sometimes pluperfectized to &quot;spaded&quot;; &quot;verses&quot; for &quot;versus&quot;; &quot;phase&quot; for &quot;faze&quot;; along with the exceedingly respectful &quot;sirname.&quot; I believe that the amount of space I enclosed by circling these common errors as they appeared on coffee-stained student submissions would roughly equal the surface area of Weld County.</p>
<p>The eggcorn database contains some &quot;learned&quot; malapropisms that are new to me. &quot;Hare&#39;s breath&quot; and its funhouse mirror twin &quot;hair-brained&quot;; &quot;beyond approach&quot;; &quot;Cadillac converter&quot;; &quot;garbage shoot&quot;; &quot;wet one&#39;s appetite.&quot; I can&#39;t picture &quot;well-quaffed hair,&quot; but I can certainly visualize a &quot;wind-powered turban.&quot; &quot;It finally donged on me&quot; makes some sense, but &quot;crutch of the matter&quot; is utterly nonsensical. How laid back is a &quot;mellow drama?&quot; To &quot;give up the goat&quot; may have meaning in pastoral societies. My absolute favorite: &quot;pus jewel,&quot; as in, &quot;his adolescent face was covered with pus jewels.&quot; The avian reference in &quot;one fowl swoop&quot; (for one fell -- i.e. fatal-- swoop) was well anticipated by Macduff:&#0160; &quot;What, all my pretty chickens and their dam/ In one fell swoop....&#0160; O hell-kite.&quot;</p>
<p>And speaking of chickens (and eggs), there&#39;s also chocolate &quot;eggclair&quot; and &quot;eggtopic&quot; pregnancy, both of which are weirdly inventive, but&#0160;neither worth (drumroll, maestro!), a pullet surprise.</p>

		<a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2010/02/nose-ornament-news.html">News from the World of Nose Ornamentation</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Although youngsters sometimes try to piss off their parents by inserting into their nose a modest jewel or a gold circlet, we (as a nation or as a civilization) aren&#39;t terribly enthusiastic about decorating the old schnozzola. While the English language has words for many kinds of jewelry (ring, earring, brooch, bracelet, necklace, tiara, pectoral), it is vacant of vocabulary for objects that are affixed to or hang from the nose. Consequently, this magnificent piece of gold jewelry, crafted in Peru two thousand years ago, which certainly bore a name in proto-Quecha or whatever was spoken at the time, is now simply called a &quot;nose ornament.&quot;</p>
<p><img border="0" class="mainObjImage showEnlargeArea " jquery1265854892578="43" rel="1979.206.1172" src="http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/images/h2/h2_1979.206.1172.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 289px;" /></p>
<p>It&#39;s spectacular, isn&#39;t it? The four jolly, fat spiders in their intricate communal web of mesh are truly lovely. We moderns can&#39;t compete.&#0160; We have nothing to offer.&#0160;</p>
<p>Here&#39;s another beauty, this one from the area that is now Columbia.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/images/h2/h2_66.196.23.jpg" /></p>
<p>This nose ornament is five inches long from top to bottom, which means that it would cover the mouth and hang well below the chin. The small gold discs and the long flattened cylinders are loosely attached, so the ornament was designed both to catch and reflect the light and to jingle. This one, like the spider ornament, is glittery, ostentatious, and unapologetic.</p>
<p>I imagine that like most such jewelry, these nose ornaments were designed to say, &quot;I&#39;&#39;m rich, I&#39;m powerful, and I&#39;m sexy. Come mate with me.&quot; To me, they also say, very loudly, &quot;I can endure massive rhinal discomfort.&quot; It appears that these nose ornaments were inserted between the nostrils and attached to the septum. To wear such an ornament would be painful even if the wearer never sneezed or blew his nose, but to insert and remove it would be sheer nasal agony. Those sharp points would dig into the tender flesh. And the object must have been frequently removed,&#0160; because with the ornament in place, drinking or eating would be impossibly messy. While the nose ornament might get a guy a date, it would certainly inhibit chat or flirtation, and would also become a major impediment if he got lucky.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not impressed by the pitifully small nose ornaments worn by modern teenagers, but I would definitely respect the child who was willing to brandish something equivalent to these wonders. Especially the&#0160;one with the spiders.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>When, In a Canterbury bar many years ago, I ordered a cider, the East Kent cockney bartender responded with a question that I interpreted as &quot;strong Boer what knees?&quot; Why would he ask me about the joints of a South African farmer? I was absolutely befuddled even when he repeated the question several times. Finally, in frustration, he held up two bottles of cider: the first was labeled &quot;Strongbow&quot; and the second &quot;Watney&#39;s.&quot; He was simply asking me if I preferred Strongbow or Watney&#39;s -- but how was I to know?&#0160; Some years afterward I mentioned this incident to an English friend who countered with a story of her own. On her first visit to New York City, she said, she ordered a sandwich and the counterman asked her &quot;fur rear oughta go?&quot;</p>
<p>I recalled these events while musing on two moments of childhood linguistic extremity. The first was when I asked one of my P. S. 217 friends what they did during Religious Instruction (in the 1950s, Roman Catholic kids were released from class for two hours a week to study at the local parish church, which in my neighborhood was St. Rose of Lima -- popularly known as &quot;Roe Salima.&quot;&#0160; Our teachers took the opportunity to catch up on the local newspapers while students twiddled the collective thumb). My friend&#39;s answer, &quot;Cat kiss &#39;em.&quot; It was many years before I understood that the word I had no hope of understanding was &quot;catechism.&quot; I was even more puzzled when a Jewish student, who could not know that I came from a family that regularly celebrated Yom Kippur with a roast pork dinner, asked me, &quot;do you put on to fill in?&quot; I construed the question to be some sort of insult, but after a decade or so I realized that I had been asked something rather serious: &quot;Do you put on <em>tefillin? -- </em>tefillin being small leather boxes containing biblical verses donned by observant Jews during morning prayers.</p>
<p>In my neighborhood, it was common for people to shout &quot;doozie pots&quot; at each other.&#0160; I had no idea what that expression meant, except for a strong feeling that it wasn&#39;t praise. It was not until I studied a little Italian that I understood that what I heard as &quot;doozie pots&quot; was a Sicilian variant of<em>&#0160;tu sei pazzo</em>, &quot;you&#39;re crazy.&quot;</p>
<p>None of these misunderstandings, strictly speaking, meet the mondegreen threshold;&#0160; let&#39;s call them near-mondegreens. (The best-known mondegreen is &quot;I led the pigeons to the flag&quot; -- a mishearing of &quot;I pledge allegiance to the flag.&quot; The word mondegreen derives from one of the Child ballads: &quot;They hae slain the Earl of Murray/ And laid him on the green,&quot; the second of these lines misheard as &quot;And Lady Mondegreen&quot;). In my long list of personal mondegreens, the two that are most vivid in my memory are connected to my incomprehension of religion.&#0160; They are a) the luscious &quot;round young virgin&quot; of <em>Silent Night</em>, and b) the theologically implausible &quot;The Lord is ice, the Lord is made of ice&quot; in one of the choruses of <em>The Messiah</em> (&quot;even so in Christ, shall we be made alive&quot;). Here&#39;s another mondegreen from my childhood:&#0160; &quot;Who knows what evil lurks in the hot cement?&quot; <em>March 12:&#0160; </em>Last night at dinner, I remarked&#0160; that one of my favorite innovations of the second half of the twentieth century was &quot;fitted sheets.&quot;&#0160; A guest said, &quot;You&#39;re right;&#0160; we didn&#39;t used to have feta cheese.&quot;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Here is a sentence drawn from a contract for new condominium construction. &quot;The laundry room flooring is a composition tile called Stonewalk; it is a warm light color that <em>compliments</em> all of the wood floor options.&quot; And here&#39;s a second sentence from the same contract: &quot;bedroom carpets are a warm light color that <em>compliments </em>all of the wood floor options.&quot;&#0160; <em>Compliments?&#0160; </em>As every schoolchild is taught, &quot;to compliment&quot; means &quot;to praise.&quot;&#0160; The wording of the contract therefore asserts that Stonewalk, a composition tile, speaks highly of the wooden floor. The bedroom carpets join in the chorus of adulation. No doubt that it&#39;s a praiseworthy floor, but are the warm light carpets and the warm light tiles fully qualified to make so positive a determination?</p>
<p>Surely the highly-skilled and well-compensated lawyers who drew up the contract meant to write (if they subscribe to conventional canons of usage) that &quot;the color of Stonewalk <em>complements </em>the color of the floors.&quot; That is to say, the one color &quot;completes&quot; or &quot;makes perfect&quot; the other.</p>
<p>For example:&#0160; you may compliment the sommelier, but the sauvignon rouge complements the rosbif or the biftek. Them&#39;s the official rules.&#0160;</p>
<p>But should they be?&#0160; Is the distinction between compliment and complement meaningful? Or is it pedantic and arbitrary?</p>
<p>What can history tell us about these twins?</p>
<p>In Shakespeare&#39;s <em>Love&#39;s Labor&#39;s Lost, </em>Don Adriano de Armado is &quot;a refined traveler of Spain..., /That hath a mint of phrases in his brain;/ One whom the music of his own vain tongue/ Doth ravish like enchanting harmony;/ [He is] a man of complements.&quot;&#0160; But is a &quot;man of complements&quot; a courteous man who offers gratuitous compliments, or is he rather a fulfilled or a complete man.&#0160; Clearly, Shakespeare&#39;s word conflates the two meanings. A second example, this one from <em>King Lear</em>:&#0160; &quot;There is further complement of leave-taking between Burgundy and [Lear].&quot;&#0160; Does &quot;complement&quot; mean, &quot;politeness&quot; or &quot;formal civility,&quot; which would be &quot;compliment&quot;;&#0160; or does it mean that Burgundy and Lear have finished or completed or brought to perfection their parting sentences?&#0160; Once again, both meanings are possible. Examples of such blurring can be multiplied. Falstaff (in <em>The Merry Wives of Windsor) </em>says this: &quot;I see you are obsequious in your love and I profess requital to a hair&#39;s breadth; not only, Mistress Ford, in the simple office of love, but in all the accoutrement, compl<span style="color: #3333ff;"><em>x</em></span>ment, and ceremony of it.&quot;&#0160; Complement, compliment; take your pick.&#0160; Either is possible;&#0160; both make perfectly good sense.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>It&#39;s obvious that the doctrinaire distinction between the spellings has been imposed since the time of Shakespeare. In fact, the dictionaries tell us that the introduction of a second, separate word is an example of learned Frenchification. OED:&#0160; &quot;Compliment (Fr) is a doublet of complement (the form directly from Latin). The latter was in use before the introduction of the French form, which slowly took its place between 1635 and 1715.&quot; The twins have been, and still are, closer in meaning than traditionalists allow (which is why the condo contract writers got it, so to speak, &quot;wrong&quot;).</p>
<p>What to do?&#0160; My suggestion: let&#39;s overleap the conservatives and embrace the truly reactionary. Let&#39;s declare that from now on, &quot;compliment&quot; and &quot;complement&quot; are, just as they used to be, one and the same word.&#0160; No more racking the brains over &quot;i&quot; and &quot;e,&quot; no more anxiety, no more guilt.&#0160;</p>
<p>Let the word go forth that from this moment on, tiles and carpets are free to complement or to compliment floors -- just as they prefer.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>To decide upon the language&#39;s silliest word, many would steep themselves into the gallimaufry that features such sesquipedalian monstrosities as mollycoddle, liripoop, and kinnikinnick, but in my view such words are no more than flagrant tomfoolery. (In point of fact, almost every word seems silly, if you just say it over and over again, especially spoon, swivel, and sluice [just in the s&#39;s alone]). A more promising category in which to delve is among those words that ought, from their sound, mean something entirely other than they do, as for example turdiform, titmouse, cacoethes, antimacassar and crepuscular. Some words are silly because it is inherently ridiculous that their combination of consonants and vowels should mean anything at all: usufruct, zeugma, ginkgo and glebe fall into that unlovely grouping.</p>
<p>As a child, I thought that the silliest word in the English language was &quot;pumpernickel,&quot; but now I can make more mature judgments. I therefore announce that the second most ridiculous word in English -- the penultimate -- is &quot;indubitably.&quot;&#0160; &quot;Indubitably&quot; is composed of a series of staccato syllables that can only be spoken by a duchess, or a dandy wearing a tuxedo and a monocle&#0160; -- or perhaps even a lorgnette. I have never heard anyone utter the word &quot;indubitably&quot; with a straight face. It&#39;s a word that is intrinsically litotic.&#0160;</p>
<p>And now, after decades of pondering, I proclaim that the grand champion silliest word in the English, and of this there can be no shadow of doubt, no possible probable shadow of doubt, is: ointment.</p>
<p>The evidence?&#0160; Well, first of all, there&#39;s that wayward &quot;oint.&quot; Except for &quot;oil&quot; and oil-related words (oiler, oily), there are very few English words that begin with &quot;oi&quot; --and for good reason. &quot;Oi&quot; lacks the dignity of more imposing vowels. It&#39;s an unstable gliding sound, hard to fix in the mouth, almost thriphthongic.&#0160; Moreover, &quot;oint&quot; comes perilously close to &quot;oink&quot; and therefore reeks of the piggery. To couple &quot;oint&quot; with &quot;ment&quot; is to augment the awkwardness. Most words that end in &quot;ment&quot; make obvious sense: battlement, pavement, amazement, advancement. If the &quot;ment&quot; in ointment is such a suffix, what, pray tell, is an &quot;oint&quot;?&#0160; And then there&#39;s that foolish near-congruence of the first and second components of the word --its perfect and quintessential spondeehood -- exaggerated by slant rhyme and the awkwardness of &quot;nt&quot;/&quot;nt.&quot; Altogether, &quot;ointment&quot; is indubitably absurd.</p>
<p>Etymology offers no solace. The silly thing came to us through Old French &quot;oignement&quot; from late Latin &quot;unguimentum&quot; and from classical Latin &quot;unguentum.&quot;&#0160; &quot;Ointment&quot; may ultimately derive from an ancient root for butter. Just as might be suspected, that first ludicrous &quot;t&quot; is an accident, having been smuggled in, by analogy, from &quot;anoint.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>When Jean Lundegaard bites Gaear Grimsrud on the hand, he grunts, famously, &quot;Unguent, I need unguent.&quot; One hesitates to suggest an improvements to classic dialogue, but, tell the truth, wouldn&#39;t the scene have been even funnier and more memorable if Gaear had muttered, &quot;Ointment, I need ointment?&quot;&#0160; Especially if the tip of his tongue had landed plosively on both of the lingual-palatal stops?</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>We&#39;re packing up, getting ready to go -- even though there hasn&#39;t been the slightest hint of frost. When I loaded the metal sculptures into the bed of the truck, I realized that it would be a good idea to cover them with a tarpaulin. So down I drove to Main Street and to the recently enlarged Aubuchon. &quot;Where do you keep your tarpaulins?&quot; I asked the young clerk. &quot;What is a tarpaulin?&#0160; I&#39;ve never heard of it?&quot;&#0160; &quot;Never heard of a tarpaulin,&quot; I replied, taken aback, &quot;you use them to cover boats or cargo or the backs of trucks.&quot; &quot;Oh,&quot; he said, brightening, &quot;a tarp,&quot; and he took me right there where the shelves were loaded with blue &quot;polytarps&quot; -- canvas being virtually extinct, at least in our part of the landlocked world.&#0160;</p>
<p>The young feller didn&#39;t know the world &quot;tarpaulin&quot; and looked at me as if I were some sort of pretentious snob. But &quot;tarpaulin&quot; goes right back to my childhood -- it might be the first three-syllable word I ever learned. Not that I was nautical, not in any sense a &quot;tar.&quot; But when it rained at Ebbets Field, the ground crew would roll out the infield tarpaulin and then we&#39;d all sit and listen while Red Barber and Connie Desmond chatted for an hour or so until either play resumed or the game was postponed. &quot;Tarpaulin&quot; is not a hard or obscure word -- certainly not to baseball fans who can remember when fields didn&#39;t have roofs. But the big linguistic question is -- will the word tarpaulin survive in all its glory or will it be truncated into a pathetic apocopic monosyllablic shadow of itself?&#0160; Or will it be confused with the TARP, which is a horse of another acronymic color. Troubled (or more accurately, Toxic) Asset Relief Program.&#0160;</p>
<p>Well, I bought the &quot;tarp&quot;&#0160; -- not at Aubuchon, which didn&#39;t have the right size -- but down at the Farm-Way. So now we&#39;re one step closer to shoving off for DC and then back home. I&#39;m overwhelmed with pre-nostalgia.</p>

                                <p>We&#39;re still dealing with the bureaucratic fallout from Grandma&#39;s death in January. One consequence is that we receive impenetrable, inexplicable documents from Medicare every few days.&#0160;</p>
<p>Here&#39;s an opaque paragraph from the latest missive. Try to judge at what level -- your choices are sixth grade through twelfth grade remedial -- this entirely irrelevant and gratuitous advice is written.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;Medicare may pay for services that you get while on board a ship within the territorial waters of the United States. In rare cases, Medicare may pay for inpatient hospital, doctor, or ambulance services you get if you are traveling through the territorial waters of Canada without unreasonable delay by the mos (sic) direct route between Alaska and another state when a medical emergency occurs and the Canadian hospital is closer than the nearest American hospital that can treat the emergency. Medicare won&#39;t pay for this service since you didn&#39;t meet these requirements.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>It&#39;s the transition between the that long snake of a penultimate sentence and the final injunctive sentence that throws me.&#0160; I made no request, so why the prohibition: &quot;you didn&#39;t meet these requirements?&quot;&#0160; I never claimed to meet them; in fact, I&#39;ve never (nor did Grandma) traveled from Alaska to the lower forty-eight by waterway. What the heck is Medicare talking about? Yikes! Double yikes!</p>
<p>And what&#39;s with the idiom &quot;get services.&quot;&#0160; Isn&#39;t it &quot;receive services?&quot;&#0160; Or better yet, &quot;receive care?&quot;</p>
<p>There is no word more overused in American English than &quot;get, got, gotten.&quot; Can we agree to ban all forms of the word &quot;get&quot; from our vocabulary for a year.&#0160; Get it out of our collective systems. Except, of course, in classic exchanges such as, &quot;Get it?&quot; &quot;Got it.&quot; &quot;Good.&quot;</p>
<p>Is it possible that there are insurance-company moles in the Medicare system? They&#39;ve infiltrated the bureaucracy and they cleverly undermine the drive for socialized medicine by generating cascades of dark, bilious, fearful prose.</p>

                                <p>I can&#39;t remember&#0160;what I was dreaming, but I woke up in a state of pure&#0160;etymological panic -- over the revelation that I didn&#39;t know the derivation or meaning of the &quot;welter&quot; part of&#0160;&quot;welterweight.&quot;&#0160; How could this be?&#0160; Context was not the least help:&#0160; lightweight, welterweight, middleweight, light-heavyweight, heavyweight.&#0160; Why not the more logical, more consistent &quot;light-middleweight?&quot;</p>
<p>What does&#0160;&quot;welter&quot; mean?&#0160; I was barely awake, but I skimmed my mental resources.&#0160; German &quot;welt&quot;&#0160;-- world.&#0160; &quot;Worldweight.&quot;&#0160;Nonsense.&#0160; &quot;Welt&quot; as in a wound&#0160;on the skin caused by a punch.&#0160; Possible, but, all&#0160;boxers raise welts -- that&#39;s&#0160;what boxers do -- not just welterweights.&#0160; A possible past tense of&#0160;&quot;weld.&quot;&#0160; No, that won&#39;t do.&#0160;Boxers don&#39;t weld, or repair, anything.&#0160;It was now time for a quick check of the mental Shakespeare concordance.&#0160; Whoops, a&#0160;blank.&#0160;&#0160;Mental Milton:&#0160; hold on, now,&#0160;here&#39;s something: &#0160;the phrase &quot;welter to the parching wind&quot; in Lycidas.&#0160; But that particular &quot;welter&quot; means, I had always assumed &quot;roll.&quot; In what sense would a&#0160;welterweight &quot;roll&quot; more than any other size of boxer?&#0160; Another dead end.&#0160; OK, it&#39;s now time&#0160;to get out of bed, fire up the computer, and check the on-line etymological dictionary. &quot;Welterweight&#0160;<span style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline"><font color="#0000ff">&#0160;&#0160; </font></span>1832, &quot;heavyweight horseman,&quot; later &quot;boxer or wrestler of a certain weight&quot; (1896), from earlier <span class="foreign"><em>welter</em></span> &quot;heavyweight horseman or boxer&quot; (1804), possibly from <span class="foreign"><em>welt</em></span> (v.) &quot;beat severely&quot; (c.1400).&quot; Now I&#39;m starting to relax;&#0160; the panic is beginning to fade.&#0160; Nothing more calming than to discover that the&#0160;internet doesn&#39;t&#0160;have a better answer than I do.</p>
<p>But&#0160;what the internet knows is intriguing.&#0160;&quot;Welterweight&quot;&#0160;used to mean&#0160;&quot;heavyweight&quot; and then somehow devolved into something less than middleweight (147 pounds, to be exact, in American boxing)?&#0160; By what etymological process?&#0160; It all sounds arbitrary and inexplicable to me.&#0160; What is the root of&#0160;&quot;welter&quot; in the sense of&#0160;&quot;heavy?&quot;&#0160; To what words is it related.&#0160; And when and why&#0160;did it come to be&#0160;demoted?&#0160; Well, there are, as a&#0160;well-known epistemologist liked to say, &quot;known unknowns and unknown unknowns.&quot;&#0160; The history of &quot;welter&quot; is unknown to a power.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the word &quot;welter&quot; standing all by itself is&#0160;very much&#0160;known:&#0160;&quot;to roll or twist,&quot; c.1300, from M.Du. or M.L.G. <span class="foreign"><em>welteren</em></span> &quot;to roll,&quot; from P.Gmc. <span class="foreign"><em>*waltijanan</em></span> (cf. O.E. <span class="foreign"><em>wieltan</em></span>, O.N. <span class="foreign"><em>velta</em></span>, O.H.G. <span class="foreign"><em>walzan</em></span> &quot;to turn, revolve,&quot; Ger. <span class="foreign"><em>wälzen</em></span> &quot;to roll,&quot; Goth. <span class="foreign"><em>waltjan</em></span> &quot;to roll&quot;), from PIE base <span class="foreign"><em>*wel-</em></span> &quot;to turn, revolve&quot;).&quot;</p>
<p>But hold on here.&#0160; The&#0160;noun meaning &quot;confused mass&quot; is first recorded 1851.&#0160; That&#39;s the &quot;welter&quot; in, say, &quot;his mind was a welter of confused etymological ideas.&quot;&#0160; Could the welterweight welter and the confused mass welter be related&#0160;-- in the sense that a &quot;welterweight&quot; is neither light nor heavy?&#0160; Well, it&#39;s a theory, but frankly, not a very good one.&#0160;</p>
<p>Besides,&#0160;it&#39;s still the middle of the night, and it&#39;s time to return to bed.&#0160; The etymology of &quot;welter&quot; remains a mystery, but at least&#0160;the symptoms of etymological stress have faded.&#0160;Will sleep come&#0160;&#0160;-- or will I welter in a welter of confused thoughts?&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>

                                <p>&quot;Physical pressure&quot; is entirely too vague -- goodness gracious, it could refer to something no more serious than a firm handshake -- and as a result it&#39;s impossible even to guess what&#39;s being euphemized. &quot;Abuse&quot; is similarly hazy. Verbal abuse?&#0160; Spousal abuse? Gosh, it&#39;s hard to say. &quot;Harsh methods&quot; and &quot;harsh tactics&quot; offer more of a clue, except that nowadays the word &quot;harsh&quot; can be used semi-comically, as in the teen-age &quot;oh, that&#39;s harsh.&quot; You don&#39;t want inadvertent comedy when you&#39;re inventing prize-winning euphemisms. But &quot;harsh&quot; has more heft when used in combination with other adjectives, as for example &quot;harsh interrogation methods&quot; and &quot;harsh interrogation techniques.&quot; The three-word phrases sound as though they&#39;ve been translated from the original German, always a plus when language is being corrupted. &quot;Rough treatment&quot; is not very imaginative. I definitely prefer &quot;abusive treatment,&quot; and &quot;abusive techniques.&quot; &quot;Coercive interrogation&quot; has a nice ring -- and it leaves a lot of room for the imagination. &quot;Brutal treatment&quot; and &quot;brutal methods of interrogation&quot; -- well, what&#39;s the point? Once you start using words like &quot;brutal&quot;, you might just as well just abandon euphemism altogether and say &quot;torture,&quot; for goodness sake. &quot;Enhanced interrogations&quot; and&#0160; &quot;enhanced interrogation techniques&quot; effectively combine euphemism and bureaucratese. It&#39;s a stroke of genius to take the word &quot;enhanced,&quot; which ordinarily denotes an improvement, and transfer it to the world of thumbscrew and electric shock. &quot;Enhanced&quot; is much more effective than its alternative &quot;extreme,&quot; as in the widely used but colorless &quot;extreme interrogation methods.&quot; My personal favorite is &quot;advanced interrogation techniques,&quot; in which the word &quot;advanced,&quot; customarily employed to describe progress in civilization, has been thoroughly perverted to refer to primitive, barbaric practices. &quot;Advanced interrogation techniques.&quot; Now that&#39;s what I call a world-class euphemism! Credit another success to our government and to our compliant journalists.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>

                                <p>The origin of &quot;steerage,&quot; a word used to describe the part of the vessel allotted to the poorest of passengers is not fully established. Some say that &quot;steerage&quot; originally referred to the section nearest the rudder, but for this theory I can find no confirmation. As far as I know, steerage passengers were as likely to be housed fore as aft. Another guess is that the cables that ran from the steering wheel to the rudder passed through this level of the ship. It&#39;s also been ventured that emigrants were located on the same deck that was used for transporting steers. This suggestion seems inherently unlikely, although it is certainly true that in pre-refrigeration days, large numbers of livestock were carried on ships in order to maintain a supply of fresh milk, eggs, and meat.&#0160; Is it possible that the &quot;-age&quot; in &quot;steerage&quot; is used as in &quot;storage&quot; or baggage?&quot; &quot;Steerage&quot; seems to be unique to English. Other European languages simply say &quot;between decks&quot;; so German &quot;zwischendeck,&quot; Spanish &quot;entrepuente,&quot; Swedish &quot;mellandaeck,&quot; Norwegian &quot;mellomdeck,&quot; French &quot;entrepont,&quot; etc. Until the nineteenth century, &quot;steerage&quot; simply meant &quot;steering,&quot; as in Romeo&#39;s picturesque &quot;But he that hath the steerage of my course,/ Direct my sail.&quot;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Knowing little of the finny tribe, I borrowed the Bradford Public Library&#39;s copy of Langdon&#39;s introductory <em>Fishes of Vermont </em>(2006). It&#39;s an excellent, informative, helpful guide. With Langdon&#39;s help, I can now declare that it&#39;s undeniably the brown bullhead, a species of catfish, that has been multiplying in our pond, The bullhead, a villainous omnivore, is one of the causes of the steep decline of our population of frogs. The butt-ugly, scaleless, bebarbelled brute gobbles frogs&#39; eggs.&#0160; &#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Readers of this blague will not be astonished to learn that Dr. M .has fallen deeply in love with fish names. Take the brown bullhead, for example. It&#39;s also known by such evocative and lunatic denominations as the horned pout, the mudcat, and the minister. Minister?&#0160; To whom, and under what circumstances, would a brown bullhead minister?</p>
<p>My favorite Vermont fish, nomenclature-wise, is the slimy sculpin, also performing under such titles as the blob, the chucklehead, the rock cusk, the stargazer, and the cockatouch. The slimy sculpin should not be confused with its near cousin, the mottled sculpin -- which can also be addressed as the slowfish or gudgeon.&#0160;</p>
<p>Many of the common Vermont fishes have lost their colorful historic names. The bowfin was once called the John A. Gindle, the stonecat was the doogler, the lake trout was the togue or longue, the burbot was variously ling or lawyer (lawyer? minister?&#0160; why not accountant? or dentist?), the quillback was the buffalo, and the gar was the needlenose. On the other hand, the blandly-named pond perch of olden days is trending in the reverse direction: it&#39;s now called the pumpkinseed -- a name which seems curiously vegetarian for a denizen of the deep.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>If I had known that there was a fish called the cisco (known on jolly days as the tollibee and on prosaic days as the sand herring), I would long ago have promoted Galen Cisco to my all-time-great Baseball-Fish Team, adding him to such piscine luminaries as Catfish Hunter, Dizzy Trout, Chico Salmon, Sid Bream, Bobby Sturgeon, Art &quot;Red&quot; Herring, and Shad Roe. And Mudcat Grant.</p>
<p>No Sculpins in MLB that I can recall, but In a more poetic universe, &quot;Slimy&quot; Sculpin would have been a spitball pitcher, or perhaps even a team owner.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I don&#39;t like gore. I’m the kind of person who won’t recklessly channel-surf for fear that the changer gizmo will maliciously lock onto our 24/7 surgery channel, where some poor soul&#39;s innards will be on garish hi-def display. &#0160;And yet, despite my squeamishness, I steeled myself and read right through to the end of Katrina Firlik&#39;s <em>Another Day in the Frontal Lobe</em>, which is a young neurosurgeon’s bildungs-autobiography.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>Of course, I allowed myself the indulgence of zooming through some of the more gruesome parts. How much do I need to know about maggot infestations in the living brain?</p>
<p>I’m grateful to Firlik for her vivid stories, for the occasional moment of black humor and also for offering a forthright glimpse into an alternative world. Nevertheless, I&#39;m sorry to report, <em>Another Day </em>is not a good book.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>It&#39;s too transparently a package shaped by agent and editor for short-term commercial appeal. The author is so anxious to be cute and to be loved – she must have been one of those front-row, admiring-eyes-glued-to-the-professor straight-A pupils -- that whenever she comes up against a controversial topic, such as the irrational funding of our medical system or the egomania of surgeons or the morality of expensive, hopeless surgical interventions, she hints at concern but then swerves and punts. She doesn&#39;t want to offend a single potential buyer.</p>
<p>Not a courageous writer, she is not an admirable being either: what can one say about a highly-skilled professional who turns down job after job in the American hinterland and elects to live in New Canaan, Connecticut, because, she admits, it would be impossible to find a good Japanese restaurant in the sticks, &#0160;and who in one sentence notes that her rich town has more neurosurgeons than all of sub-Sahara Africa and in another reveals that she works on spines rather than brains nowadays because spines are more lucrative.</p>
<p>Hey, Katrina, the next time you publish something, sacrifice some of that royalty money and write directly from your heart (even though it&#39;s one cold and stony organ).&#0160;</p>
<p>Readers of this blague will not be surprised to learn that Dr. M. was much intrigued by the book&#39;s medical vocabulary.&#0160;<em>Another Day </em>serves up a feast of beautiful and exotic words:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span>venous infarct, dura, spicule, rongeur, neuroma, glioma, glioblastoma (you don’t want one!), bone dust, debulk, pachygyria. The ugliest of all: intubated.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>My personal favorite, and a word that I&#39;ve now put in the running for Word of the Year: bezoar.</p>
<p>How could I have lived all these years without knowing the word bezoar?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; Could there be a surer index of my ignorance of medicine?&#0160; </span>A bezoar, as everyone but me seems to know, is a concretion of indigestible stuff stuck somewhere in the digestive tract – hairballs, medicines, bits of food. Sometimes they can be dissolved, but on occasions they can only be removed by surgery. A bezoar was formerly thought to be a magical antidote for poisons –- so score another couple of strikes against our ignorant superstitious ancestors. The most common kind of bezoar is the phytobezoar, which is a collection of lignin, cellulose, or tannin of food fibers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>Common sources:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>celery, grapes, raisins, prunes, pumpkins, all of which, if you’re like me, you’ve probably unwittingly eaten without having given a thought to their bezoar-potential and therefore neglected a splendid opportunity for hypochondria.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">A </span>bezoar caused by eating persimmons (an especially dangerous fruit, bezoarwise), earns its very own word-- diospyrobezoar -- an odd amalgam of Greek and Persian linguistic roots and a word which, just as soon as a suitable opening arises, I intend to insinuate into the conversation.&#0160;</p>

                                <p>Dr. Metablog, like all bloggers, is his own editor. With the new freedom comes a downside: lapses of coherence and flaws of grammar, along with the occasional typos and printos that an editor&#39;s eye would catch, now go uncaught. But independence is also beneficial. In my former incarnation, I was regularly disciplined by stern editors who called me on the carpet for undermining academic prose by smuggling in a smile.</p>
<p>Once upon a time I composed an encyclopedia entry on the earthy and entertaining seventeenth-century English diarist Samuel Pepys. Pepys was an extremely diligent writer who kept his voluminous diary for nine years, rarely missing a day. To appreciate Pepys&#39;s art, it&#39;s wrong to rely on snippets; a reader has to swallow whole large hunks of the diary.&#0160; &#0160;recommended, therefore, that nouveau-Pepysists engage in &quot;deep and promiscuous reading&quot; of the volumes. My joke, weak though it may have been, played on the fact that most people read Pepys not for illumination so much as for the frank revelations about his vigorous sexual life. I was not sent page proofs of my contribution to the encyclopedia, and so I was surprised when I cracked open the spruce new book to discover that, for the words &quot;deep and promiscuous,&quot; a vigilant but unsmiling editor had substituted &quot;wide.&quot; What can I say? The editor batted last and had more clout.</p>
<p>It was perpetually curious to me that the editors would give a pass to incomprehensible jargon but would go to the mat against playfulness.</p>
<p>A few months ago, on this blague, I parodied the curious language of literary criticism in an entry on the imperialist romance <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2007/01/more_on_king_so.html">King Solomon&#39;s Mines</a>. I did not invent the ridiculous vocabulary that I poked fun at, not even &quot;multichronotopic&quot; or &quot;hybridity.&quot;&#0160; Now that I have no glum editor peering over my shoulder, I&#39;m free to play my own game of word-coining. I&#39;m not alone;&#0160; Is it my imagination, or is English vocabulary going through an internet-fueled growth spurt?&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&#0160;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">Reviewing my own posts for the past few months, I see a number of words that I can claim to have invented.&#0160; I&#39;m proud of &quot;precursoress,&quot; &quot;soulwise,&quot; &quot;brainal,&quot; &quot;neojargonianism,&quot; &quot;flimflammery,&quot; &quot;mosquette,&quot; &quot;skinflintism,&quot; &quot;bepigeoned,&quot; &quot;scandalmongery,&quot; &quot;baubleolatry,&quot; &quot;alzheimered,&quot; &quot;cinderelloid,&quot; &quot;prefamiliar,&quot; and &quot;barfitudinous.&quot;&#0160; Can I guarantee that I&#39;m the first user of these contributions to linguistic variety? Of course not -- I&#39;ve no doubt been anticipated in most of them. But I attest that each one of these novelties came to me in a thrilling burst of clarity and light.&#0160; I&#39;m especially fond of my jekyllian word &quot;menschdom&quot; and its hydish antonym &quot;schmuckhood,&quot; of &quot;swiftboatery,&quot; &quot;dysgeographicoid,&quot; &quot;wallstreetway,&quot; and &quot;gigantico.&quot;&#0160; My favorite, and here I&#39;m 99% sure that there can be no other claimant, is <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2007/12/nine-years-afte.html">&quot;antimonofilamentarianism&quot;</a>, defined as opposition to certain recent manifestations of orthodoxy in religion. I also claim &quot;eruvista,&quot; (a person who adheres to these particular beliefs). Only time will tell if one of these novelties turns out to be a nonce word (or as the classicists say, a <em>hapax legomenon)</em>, or a word that sneaks into our working vocabulary, its origin as well as its proud originator obscured by the mists of time.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>One of this blague&#39;s more inquisitive readers is a talented young journalist who knows that before Vivian de St. Vrain morphed into Dr. Metablog, he had spent a lifetime either bent unproductively over the ball point or wearily pounding on the word-processor.&#0160;The young reader has asked this question:&#0160; what have decades of practice taught you, Dr. M., about the craft of writing?&#0160; And in response, Dr. M. has peered soulwise and discovered -- not a heck of a lot.</p>
<p>Yet in all fairness, the curious reader&#39;s question is flattering and deserves a response. And therefore Dr. M. has pondered and pondered and has now refined the drossy deposits that clog his brainal synapses into as much wisdom as he feels qualified to dispense. (Let us be clear -- the advice that follows is not meant to be argumentative or prescriptive or know-it-all.&#0160;Different writers do things in different ways. The precepts that are offered here may not apply to all writing;&#0160;they describe only the Way of the Metablog.)&#0160;</p>
<p>Let us assume that the seeker of advice brings to the table intelligence and information and a point of view -- but needs a little coaching on tactics. Point one:&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>Just as I respect the first tenet of real estate -- location, location, location -- so I subscribe to the most important (but often neglected) rule of writing, which is</p>
<p>A)&#0160; plot, plot, plot, plot, plot.&#0160;The writer must tell a story.&#0160;People relish stories, respond to narrative, and are most engaged when they pursue a plot&#39;s twists and turns. Just because it&#39;s non-fiction, doesn&#39;t mean that the story-teller&#39;s bag of tricks cannot be accessed. Fortunately, every piece of prose from the briefest anecdote to the most convoluted intellectual argument can and should be structured as a narrative. In non-fiction, the first rule of plotting is to &quot;establish the enigma.&quot;&#0160;The enigma need not be a formal question, but it&#39;s indisputable that every essay answers either an explicit or an unspoken question.&#0160;Is not every writer free to shape that implicit inquiry to his own purposes?&#0160;And in the process of delivering an answer, is he not also free to sprinkle clues (some of them red herrings) along the path? And also at liberty to let his readers dangle until the moment comes to gratify their curiosity--and while they dangle, to let them endure suspense; suspense that can be intensified by teasing the reader about what&#39;s going to happen next?&#0160;And every once in a while, to spring a surprise by veering off on an unanticipated or even misleading tangent?&#0160;Nor is there anything wrong with the judicious flashback, the flash forward, or the deceptive digression -- tricks of the trade that have won the laurel since the bronze age, centuries&#0160;before the time when &quot;establish the enigma&quot; became the watchword. Remember: <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2007/11/words-of-wisdom.html">&quot;all writing is fiction, especially non-fiction.&quot;</a>&#0160;</p>
<p>Connoisseurs of storytelling know that the most indispensable element in any narrative is climax. Because climax is so essential, it must be exploited to the full, not just on the universal level but also on the particular, and therefore&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>B)&#0160; every sentence should achieve climax. As a general rule, the climax should come in the sentence&#39;s last phrase, or better still, in its final climactic word. The crucial, contributing part of every sentence, the idea which it strives to convey, the very target of its forward motion, should, whenever artistically feasible, come dead last. When this precept is honored, each sentence becomes an arrow aimed at its own natural target. And it follows as night the day, that every paragraph should also come to climax--and that the climax of the paragraph should be its own last sentence. So designed, sentences and paragraphs carry within them both the exciting pressure of forward motion and also coherence of argument. There&#39;s an ancillary benefit: when a sentence terminates in a climax, transitions become less awkward, because the intellectual content (or logic) of sentence B begins just where sentence A left off, and the logic of sentence C starts where B concludes. Sentences and logic coalesce and become as one. This maxim, true for sentences, is even more true for paragraphs. And therefore it follows that a practiced writer, making deft use of climax, can easily&#0160;</p>
<p>C)&#0160; avoid ungainly mechanical transitions, such as &quot;nevertheless,&quot; &quot;moreover, &quot;on the other hand,&quot; and even that offensive bit of pop neojargonianism, &quot;having said that&quot; -- for these fillers are words that constrict the thoroughfare of thought. Of course there will be times when such connectives usefully signal a switch in direction, but for the most part, transitions between sentences and paragraphs should not be mechanical, i.e. by the use of conjunctive phrases and adverbs, but logical. Logical transitions need not rely on distracting howevers, however easy and tempting it might be to employ them. The best transitions are transparent or, even better, invisible. If a writer studies his sentences and is compelled to admit that they are only linked by banausic connectives, then he must judge whether the argument he offers is truly coherent or whether its logical weaknesses have been plastered over with rhetorical flimflammery. Any writer who wants his prose to be persuasive will profit by examining his connectives. And while the writer is engaged in such scrutiny, he should also check to see that he has</p>
<p>D)&#0160; transferred important concepts from nouns and adjectives into verbs.&#0160;And by verbs, I mean verbs of vigor--not copulatives, passives, or colorless neutral words like seem, appear, make, or do. I mean verbs with punch, or better still, verbs that punch.&#0160;In revising a sentence, it&#39;s a good idea to determine whether it&#39;s the nouns and their modifiers that bear the brunt of the argument.&#0160;If they are doing more than their fair share of the labor, then it is mandatory to reconfigure the sentence so that the verbs strain and lift and carry.&#0160;A paragraph rich in colorful verbs is active and infectious and engaging;&#0160;a paragraph loaded with nouns and modifiers can be clotted and static.&#0160;Strong verbs keep things moving. They keep the plot in gear. They add grit and heft.&#0160;And so does the related process whereby</p>
<p>E)&#0160; generalizations and abstractions are replaced by instances and examples. Let me provide an example. A friend, a large man who has always savored his sauce Bearnaise, wrote this sentence to me: &quot;My doctor--an Asian woman who weighs about fifteen pounds--has been hectoring me about my reluctance to subsist on twigs and grasses.&quot; What an excellent sentence -- not just because of the colorful verbs (&quot;hector,&quot; &quot;subsist&quot;), the ironic faux-hyperbole (&quot;about fifteen pounds&quot;) or the fact that the sentence rises to a splendid climax, but because of the specificity of &quot;twigs and grasses.&quot; A lesser writer might have, instead of &quot;subsist on twigs and grasses,&quot; employed a bland formula such as &quot;go on a diet&quot; or &quot;become a vegetarian.&quot; But by using the concrete &quot;twigs and grasses&quot; for the abstract &quot;diet&quot; or &quot;vegetarian,&quot; my correspondent has not only caught our attention and amused us, but he has created a metaphor. &quot;Twigs and grasses&quot; is specific and visual and memorable. While these nouns stand for &quot;diet&quot; and &quot;vegetarian,&quot; they also stand for whatever penumbra of meaning my friend&#39;s readers bring to the interpretation of these words. In my own case, it&#39;s a irresistible vision of a big guy metamorphosed into a large twitchy-nostrilled rabbit nibbling the bark of willows. Such is the paradox of the metaphor: the more specific the word, the more spacious the liberty of interpretation. Poets know this instinctively; that&#39;s why they&#39;re poets. But remember, writers: metaphor is only one of a bucketload of figures of speech. The astute writer does not limit himself to metaphor alone, but remembers to&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; <br /><br />F)&#0160; use figures of speech of all kinds: pun, simile, alliteration, oxymoron, parataxis, hyperbole, understatement or litotes, irony, metonymy (where an individual stands for a class), synecdoche (where a part signifies the whole), aposiopesis -- I could go on and on!&#0160; It&#39;s the figure of speech that keeps things lively, that makes prose sparkle and that make readers, already enthralled with plot and dazzled by recurrent exciting climaxes, fully engage with the written word.&#0160; After all, writing has no value unless it attracts and holds the reader. And so it follows that a writer must, finally,&#0160;</p>
<p>G)&#0160; know and respect his readership.&#0160;He&#0160;must provide all the information that a reader needs to follow the argument.&#0160;Yet at the same time, he must resist the temptation to be&#0160;over-explicit.&#0160;Let readers do some of the work.&#0160;Let them complete&#0160;the connections that the writer&#0160;only suggests.&#0160;It will keep them on their toes, make them feel intelligent, and retain their interest.&#0160;And while they&#39;re so engaged, the writer&#0160;might remind himself&#0160;of another precept, which is to try to</p>
<p>H)&#0160; make syntax and logic work together. Get them on the same track. Put the main idea in the main clause, put subordinate ideas in subordinate clauses. Put the parenthetical idea in a parenthetical clause. Put parallel ideas in parallel clauses, but when ideas are not parallel, emphasize their incompatibility by using contrasting syntactic structure. Syntax is a tool. Sentences in which logic is chugging onward and syntax is all over the map can be confusing and even impenetrable. Alexander Pope said about poetry, &quot;The sound should be an echo to the sense.&quot;&#0160; In prose, the syntax should be an echo to the sense; or rather, the sense should be an echo to the syntax; or even better, the syntax and the sense should take each other&#39;s hand and dance the same dance. And finally (and this time the &quot;finally&quot; is not meant to be misleading),</p>
<p>I)&#0160; scrutinize every word and see if it is necessary or whether it can either be omitted or made more precise. When in doubt, throw it out. Or amend it. It should be a maxim that in good writing, no one ever &quot;walks down the street.&quot; And by &quot;walks down the street,&quot; I certainly do not mean &quot;walk down the street.&quot; &quot;Walks down the street&quot; is a metaphor for a colorless expression. Why should someone walk down the street, when he can totter, or saunter, or sashay, or hurtle, or trot, or swagger, or stagger, or promenade down an avenue, boulevard, lane, causeway, footpath, or promenade?&#0160; English overflows with words that are specific, evocative, and suggestive. Let&#39;s have fewer street-walkers and more sidewalk-promenaders. Keats said the the poet should &quot;load every rift with ore,&quot; and so should the writer of non-fiction. But be careful not to overload; don&#39;t allow prose to slide toward the baroque. And at last</p>
<p>J)&#0160; &#0160;feel perfectly free to ignore the canard that you were taught in grade school&#0160; --that every piece of writing needs a conclusion.&#0160; It doesn&#39;t.&#0160; As a general rule, avoid formal conclusions.</p>

                                <p>My good friend Professor L---- is an eminent scholar of American literature and an upstanding&#0160; teacher at the University of C------.&#0160; A few months ago, Professor L------ told me the following story. I repeat it unvarnished and unadorned -- a curious but instructive anecdote from the trenches of learning. <br /><br />Some years ago, on the last day of the semester, a student approached my friend and gushed:&#0160; &quot;Oh Professor L-----, I just want to tell you what a great course this was, and what a great teacher you are. I learned so much. Especially about writing. I really really appreciated all the thoughtful comments you made on my papers. You were so helpful. I feel like I&#39;ve made a great deal of progress with my writing. I have just one question. Why do you always write &quot;frog,&quot; &quot;frog,&quot; &quot;frog&quot; all over the margins of my essays?&quot;<br /><br />This anecdote raises a number of questions. The most obvious: if the student thought that Professor L ----- was afflicted with some sort of obscure batrachian obsession, why didn&#39;t she raise the point with him or with the proper medical authorities?&#0160; Poor child, she must have been both mystified and intimidated.<br /><br />However, it&#39;s not the student but the teacher who should profit from this parable. Here are a few of its many <em>moralia.</em><br /><br />If you&#39;re a teacher of writing, don&#39;t assume that any student knows the difference between a sentence and a fragment. Or even knows that there is such a thing as a fragment. Don&#39;t assume that just because you have written something that you think is helpful in the margin of an essay that therefore a student a) reads it, b) understands it) or c) profits from it. Even more important:&#0160; don&#39;t imagine that enthusiastic praise from a middling student has the slightest value -- it&#39;s simple vanity to think so. In fact, better not to build any structure, however slight, on a foundation of student regard.&#0160;</p>
<p>And finally: mind your minims.</p>

                                <p>Colorado's &quot;flagship&quot; football team has had unprecedented success signing up in-state recruits.&nbsp; In the paper this morning:&nbsp; &quot;If you look around we've just got a cesspool of talent around here.&quot; </p>

<p>A &quot;cesspool of talent?&quot;&nbsp; Here are two things that we know about the up-and-coming young linebacker who is credited with that sentence:&nbsp; a) he's never come face-to-face with a actual cesspool, and b) he's under the impression that &quot;cess&quot; means &quot;large&quot; or &quot;deep.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;Is he alone?&nbsp; I'm afraid not.&nbsp; A quick googling retrieves sixty cesspools of talent, perhaps a third of which are ironic. &nbsp; </p>

<p>Shakespeare uses &quot;cess&quot; to mean &quot;measure.&quot;&nbsp; A diseased horse, &quot;Poor jade, is wrung in the withers out of all cess.&quot;&nbsp; Is it possible that our linebacker is familiar with <em>The First Part of King Henry the Fourth?&nbsp;  </em>Does he believe that &quot;cesspool&quot; mean &quot;immeasurable pool?</p>

<p>In a related matter, one of my correspondents sends me this yahoo headline:&nbsp; &quot;U.S. woman abducted in Afghanistan. A Taliban snatch.&quot;&nbsp; Clearly, the writer is ignorant of the demotic use of the word &quot;snatch.&quot;&nbsp; He should have consulted Shakespeare, one of whose nastiest characters (Aaron in <em>Titus Andronicus) </em>uses the word correctly:&nbsp; &quot;Why, then, it seems, some certain <span class="keyword1">snatch</span> or so/ Would serve your turns.&quot; </p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>At our local farmer&#39;s market last Saturday, an enthusiastic young man was bragging to his out-of-town guests about the various vegetable and food stands. &quot;Here&#39;s where you buy the best bread in town,&quot; I heard him say. &quot;It&#39;s the penultimate bakery.&quot; &quot;Penultimate?&quot; There&#39;s no doubt in my mind that the young feller meant to say that this particular bakery -- a very excellent one, in fact -- was the best of the best. Not just the &quot;ultimate,&quot; but more than ultimate. In his mind, &quot;ultimate&quot; means best, and the prefix &quot;pen&quot; signifies &quot;more than&quot; or &quot;extremely.&quot;&#0160; I&#39;d never heard &quot;penultimate&quot; used in such a way, but I googled the word and found a number of such uses, including a Penultimate Wine Bar in St. Louis and a quotation from the speaker of the Massachusetts House of Delegates, who, arguing in support of a proposed constitutional amendment banning gay marriage, specified that &quot;voters must be given the chance to speak. They have the penultimate constitutional authority, not four judges.&quot;</p>
<p>Of course, according to every dictionary on the planet, &quot;penultimate&quot; is not a superlative of &quot;ultimate.&quot; It means, as it has always meant, &quot;next to last.&quot; It&#39;s from the common Latin word &quot;paene&quot; -- nearly or almost, and from &quot;ultima&quot; -- last. Penultimate is almost the last in the same way that penumbra is almost a shadow.</p>
<p>One of the reasons that I&#39;m taken aback by this novel use is that for me, penultimate isn&#39;t at all an unfamiliar or exotic word. It entered my life in high school Latin, in the early 1950s, and therefore dates back to my earliest adventures in literacy. In Miss Beulah Withee&#39;s classes, we spent many hours learning to scan Virgil and Ovid. (I don&#39;t really know why we did so; you don&#39;t need to master metrics in order to appreciate the poetry. I imagine that the practice dates back many centuries to a time when gentlemen were expected to compose Latin verses.)&#0160; We students of first-year Latin were taught that the last syllable of a line was the ultima, the next-to-last the penult, and third from last the antepenult. Thanks to Miss Withee, &quot;penultimate&quot; has never posed any mystery for me. But let me hazard a guess that neither the bread enthusiast, nor the owner of the St. Louis watering hole, nor the Massachusetts speaker were ever required to scan Latin hexameters.</p>
<p>Although penultimate in the sense of &quot;the very best&quot; is, so to speak, &quot;wrong,&quot; I can feel it gaining fast.&#0160; It&#39;s breathing down my neck. And if it&#39;s used often enough in the new signification, &quot;very best&quot; will soon supplant &quot;next to last.&quot;&#0160; Let me predict that in fifty years of so, &quot;penultimate,&quot; which even as I write these words yearns to mean &quot;better than best,&quot; will be only used in its original Latinate sense by a handful of old fogies who will cling to the antique meaning with all the feeble strength in their ancient bony fingers. I can even imagine a time when the prefix &quot;pen&quot; will become detached from &quot;penultimate&quot; and will be used to create a whole series of imaginative new &quot;<span class="a"><span style="color: #008000;"><wbr /><a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2006/03/no_ham_in_your.html">cranwiches</a></span></span>&quot;: &quot;penexcellent,&quot; for example, or &quot;penpenurious.&quot;</p>
<p>I&#39;m of two minds about such changes. I&#39;m well aware that language is inherently unstable and, intellectually speaking, I&#39;m a descriptivist, not a prescriptivist. I try to be tolerant of new words; in fact, I&#39;m proud of the handful that I&#39;ve invented myself.&#0160; &#0160;don&#39;t want to turn into some kind of mossbackosaurus convinced that any innovation in usage signals the demise of western civilization as we&#39;ve known it. Nevertheless, I can&#39;t deny that the phrase &quot;penultimate bakery&quot; grates very harshly on my sensitive ears.&#0160;</p>
<p>Moreover, I&#39;d feel mighty squishy if I had to suppress my instinctive desire to rail against contemporary linguistic collapse.&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160;</p>

                                <p>I&#39;m fond of a passage in <em>Gulliver&#39;s Travels</em> where Jonathan Swift describes Lilliputian script. In a single sentence, Swift manages to attack and nail two of his favorite targets: &quot;ladies&quot; and &quot;England.&quot; The Lilliputians &quot;manner of writing is quite peculiar being neither from the left to the right, like the <em>Europeans</em>; &#0160;nor from the right to the left, like the <em>Arabians</em>; nor from up to down, like the <em>Chinese</em>, nor from down to up, like the <em>Cascagians</em>, but aslant from one Corner of the Paper to another, like&#0160;Ladies in <em>England</em>.&#0160;</p>
<p>In good satirical fashion, Dr. S. supplements truth with fancy: the &quot;Cascagians,&quot; who write from bottom to top, may sound like the Carpathians or Sarmatians or some other trans-Caucasus people, but they don&#39;t exist. It appears that Swift invented them in order to complete his survey of the directions in which writing might flow.</p>
<p>Yet even including the fantastical Cascagians, Swift&#39;s list is not comprehensive. There are other possibilities for writing beside up and down, right and left or aslant.&#0160; &#0160; &#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>In boustrophedon (a lovely Greekish word that signifies &quot;turn like an ox plowing&quot;), alternate lines move in opposite directions. Lines one, three, five and seven and so on proceed from left to right; lines two, four, six, and eight from right to left. Ancient languages such as Safaitic were written in boustrophedon; some Etruscan inscriptions, still undeciphered, seem to follow the same pattern.&#0160;Boustrophedon is not unreasonable, but it&#39;s certainly awkward for those who have made a fetish of left to right.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s how Shakespeare transforms boustrophedonically.&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>It is the cause, it is the cause, my soul,—</p>
<p>!srats etsahc uoy, uoy ot ti eman ton em teL</p>
<p>It is the cause. Yet I&#39;ll not shed her blood;</p>
<p>,wons naht sreh fo niks retihw taht racs roN</p>
<p>And smooth as <span class="keyword1">monumental</span> alabaster.</p>
<p>.nem erom yarteb ll&#39;ehs esle, eid tsum ehs teY.&#0160;</p>
<p>Survival of the fittest, applying even to scripts, no doubt led to the extinction of boustrophedon.</p>
<p>Query: would our brains be more supple and more imaginative if we had retained this style of writing? Or would we simply be more perplexed? Or dizzy? And would we, as a civilization, prize as the peak of wit and award the laurel to the palindrome?&#0160;</p>
<p>Incidentally, Rongorongo, the indigenous language of Easter Island, was apparently written in reverse boustrophedon, i.e. bottom to top -- a compositional practice that any satirist, even Swift, would have been delighted to invent.</p>
<p><em>May 26</em>.&#0160; Marion Morrison, Ph.D., an associate professor of English at the University of Iowa, writes: &quot;I&#39;m confused about &#39;reverse boustrophedon.&#39; Is it real, or is it another Dr. Metablog &#39;invention&#39;?&#0160; Is Rongorongo a metablogian Cascagian?&#0160; I&#39;m skeptical. And how does it work?&#0160; Can you favor us with a few lines in so-called &#39;reverse boustrophedon?&#39;</p>
<p>Vivian replies:</p>

                                <p>On March 10 of this year, I registered an objection to use of the word &quot;within&quot; in sportscaster-slang. Here&#39;s my complaint: &quot;Why in the living heck do they say that the Nuggets are &quot;within&quot; two points of the Lakers? &#0160;&quot;Within&quot; means <strong>less than </strong>than the proclaimed margin -- 1.9 points perhaps. Why not say that the Nuggets are two points behind?&#0160; Or trailing by two points?&#0160; But not -- goodness gracious -- &#39;within&#39;.&quot;&#0160; Now, at the website Language Log, an accomplished young linguist, Benjamin Zimmer, has independently offered a theory of the origin of this idiom. He claims that &quot;within&quot; is short for &quot;pull within,&quot; as in the case of a rower plying his oars to literally &quot;pull&quot; within a certain distance from his opponent. Over time, he says, &quot;pull within&quot; migrated from sports such as racing and rowing, which measure advantage in distance, to sports such as baseball and basketball, which measure advantage in discrete numbers, and where, he concedes, &quot;the metaphorical fit was not exact.&quot; It&#39;s an interesting theory, and it might very well be correct. It&#39;s consoling to imagine that there&#39;s a reason for the irrational use of &quot;within.&quot;</p>
<p>Zimmer is less persuasive when he moves from linguistics to chronology.&#0160; He claims that &quot;it became common by the mid-20th century for announcers and reporters to talk about teams pulling (to) within a certain number of runs, points, goals, or even games in the standings.&quot; He offers no evidence for the &quot;mid-20th century&quot; assertion. I can&#39;t say that my memory supports his version of history. I&#39;ve been listening to basketball games on the radio since just after World War II, when the NBA succeeded the old BAA, and I&#39;m moderately sure that I didn&#39;t hear the idiom &quot;within two points&quot; until the 1980s at the earliest. It was an unpleasant innovation in language that stuck painfully in my ear. To the best of my recollection, &quot;within&quot; was the relatively recent invention of Marv Albert&#0160; -- one of his limited repertoire of linguistic tics. Others: &quot;from downtown,&quot; &quot;served up a facial,&quot; &quot; yesss,&quot; &quot;a spec-tac-ular move.&quot;</p>
<p>Marv Albert, it may be remembered, was a protege of the late great Marty Glickman, sprinter and sportscaster, and (regular readers of these essaylets will be delighted to learn) as far as I know the only genuine celebrity to have set foot in the fabled P. S. 217 schoolyard. Glickman would not have been proud of Albert, who is less well known for his creativity in language than for his strange sexual <a href="http://www.mugshots.org/sports/marv-albert.html">exploits</a>. In 1997, Albert plead guilty to sexual assault. He had proved himself to be a man without a tad of castration anxiety and of exceptional, perhaps unparalleled, courage, when he first bit a woman fifteen times on the back, drawing blood, and then forced her to perform fellatio. A spec-tac-ular move!! Just a couple of months after the Albert nonchalance, Mike Tyson bit Evander Holyfield on both ears, taking quite a chunk out of one of them -- the left, I believe. I had high hopes for a great TV moment: the sportscaster Marv Albert interviews the boxer Iron Mike. Two Brooklyn boys discuss the theory and practice of oral incorporation. Yesss!&#0160;</p>
<p><em>May 19:&#0160;</em>On Language Log, Benjamin Zimmer <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003146.html">responds</a> to my reminiscence that &quot;within two points&quot; was a creation of the 1980s. He offers comprehensive evidence that the idiom &quot;pull within&quot; was in print as long ago as the 19th century. Although he hasn&#39;t offered a chronology for &quot;within&quot; without a preceding &quot;pull,&quot; and hasn&#39;t discussed radio basketball (how would he access radio archives, even if they exist?), he&#39;s certainly a thorough and imaginative researcher. But just because a phrase can be found deep in the archives somewhere, doesn&#39;t mean that it was in common oral usage. &#0160;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I first stumbled over Spellcheck&#39;s wayward sense of humor years ago when I was writing about Shakespeare&#39;s <em>Romeo and Juliet.&#0160;</em>Spellcheck rejected Capulet, which is Juliet&#39;s family name, and presumptuously instead offered the choice of either &quot;co-pilot&quot; or &quot;copulate.&quot;</p>
<p>Spellcheck is deeply offended by proper names, uncommon words, neologisms, words in a language other than English, etc., and sometimes makes its impatience known by suggesting dadaist or absurd substitutions.</p>
<p>For example, everyone (everyone except Spellcheck, that is) knows that Muggletonians are members of a religion founded in England in the 1650s by Lodowick Muggleton which held, among other doctrines, the idea that heaven was only slightly above the reach of our uplifted arms. Spellcheck has an irrational animus toward this harmless, near-extinct religion and proposed as substitutes for Muggletonian, the words &quot;Argentinian,&quot; &quot;Miltonic,&quot; &quot;Macedonian,&quot; &quot;Justinian&quot; and (as a pure instance of spellcheckian whimsy) &quot;melatonin.&quot;</p>
<p>Apparently untutored in geography, Spellcheck rejected the ancient north African and modern upper New York state city of Utica in favor of &quot;Attica,&quot; which makes a kind of sense, but also &quot;Utah,&quot; which is a bit off-the-wall, &quot;Utopia,&quot; which is nowhere, and the imaginative but bizarre &quot;erotica.&quot;</p>
<p>A recent entry on berries provoked an orgy of spellcheckian absurdity. For fenberry, &quot;Canberra&quot;; for crowberry, both &quot;crowbar&quot; and &quot;crockery&quot;; for lingonberry, &quot;linguine,&quot; &quot;lingerie&quot; and &quot;nunnery&quot;; for whortleberry, &quot;wheelbarrow&quot;;&#0160; for earthberry, &quot;authoress&quot;; for cloudberry, &quot;glittery&quot; and the truly wild, out-of-left-field &quot;Goldberg.&quot;&#0160; Speaking of left field: for rbi&#39;s, Spellcheck proposed both &quot;ribs&quot; and &quot;rabbis&quot;; for Ebbets (as in Ebbets Field), simply &quot;beets&quot;;&#0160; for Newcombe, as in the great Dodger pitcher Don Newcombe, &quot;encumber.&quot;</p>
<p>In another recent post I invented the word &quot;mccranwichorama,&quot; defined as a display of inferior coinages of words in which detached segments (such as the wich in cranwich) acquire new meaning. I knew that when I batted mccranwichorama over the net, I would probe the outer limits of Spelllcheck&#39;s powers, but I must say that the program rose to the occasion when it parried with a transcendent absurdity: for mccranwichorama:&#0160; &quot;mercurochrome.&quot; &#0160; &#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>The cranberry, some say, is so named because it is eaten by cranes. Perhaps. But it&#39;s just as likely that the word derives from the similarity between the plant&#39;s stamen and the crane&#39;s beak --&#0160; as the common geranium or cranesbill is named after the flower&#39;s distinct enlarged pistil. (The American cranberry has an English cousin that is known, from its watery habitat, as the fenberry. The fenberry is neither eaten in nor by fens.) But if in fact cranberries were the food of cranes, what about the common bearberry (also known as crowberry, foxberry, and hog cranberry) -- did this plant also derive its name from its consumers?&#0160; I&#39;m skeptical, as I am skeptical about the derivation of the word lingonberry or cowberry, cows not being famous for berry eating. In fact, lingon means berry in Swedish, so the lingonberry is, etymologically speaking, a berryberry. Inasmuch as berryberries contain thiamine, they may help to prevent beriberi.</p>
<p>The bunchberry, a member of the dogwood family, is also known as the squirrelberry, pigeonberry, and crackerberry (from crake = crow), but never as mooseberry, though it&#39;s prized by moose, who have themselves provided a name for a favorite food -- the mountain maple or moosewood.</p>
<p>The circumpolar cloudberry is sometimes called the salmonberry, but no one claims that it is nibbled by salmons. And what about the gooseberry?&#0160; There&#39;s no discernible relation between gooseberry and geese.&#0160; There are also gooseberries that have shed whatever goosiness they may once have possessed. The plant that was originally known as the Chinese gooseberry was transported to New Zealand, where it was selected, hybridized, and cloned, to emerge after commercial re-christening as the kiwifruit or kiwi -- the name gooseberry not considered classy enough for international export. To the best of my knowledge, kiwis are not eaten by kiwis.&#0160;</p>
<p>Blackberry and blueberry pose no etymological challenge, but raspberry is a bit of a mystery, there being no obvious rasp to the berry. The word raspberry was most definitely not derived from the slang term for a rude derogatory sound -- a usage that is only traceable to the last part of the nineteenth century. The unpalatable bristly dewberry has no particular connection to dew. It&#39;s popularly said that the serviceberry is so called because, when it flowers early in the spring, the ground has thawed enough to bury -- or conduct a service -- for last winter&#39;s dead. But it&#39;s a false etymology -- in fact, the service in serviceberry comes directly from its Latin ancestor <em>sorbus </em>(just as the mul in mulberry derives from Latin <em>morus).</em>&#0160;The juneberry does in fact derive its name from its month of flowering. The loganberry is named for its hybridizer, James Logan, who crossed the blackberry and the raspberry. Although the name huckleberry -- also known as a hurtleberry or whortleberry -- is sometimes applied to the blueberry, it describes a botanically distinct species. The slang term huckleberry for a layabout -- nowadays a slacker -- was in use a generation or so before Mark Twain made it famous.&#0160;<em>Huckleberry Finn</em> might just as easily be known as <em>Whortleberry Finn. </em>The bilberry is more distinguished when it is called a fraughan. The jostaberry is brand-new to the market; it&#39;s a cross between a gooseberry and a blackcurrant. (Currants are berries even though not called so; the word currant derives from their older name -- raisins of Corinth.) The strawberry has nothing whatsoever to do with straw. Some think that name derives from the chaff-like external seeds or achenes which cover the fruit, but it&#39;s more likely that the name is drawn from the plant&#39;s habit of growth: runners stray or are strewn over the ground. A thousand years ago strawberries were called earthberries, a name not especially suitable for commerce.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>The word &quot;alcohol&quot; originates in Arabic as &quot;al-kuhul&quot; (said to mean &quot;tincture of antimony&quot;) and comes into English through Old Spanish. &quot;Alcoholic,&quot; as in &quot;possessing the qualities of alcohol,&quot; is an old word, but &quot;alcoholic&quot; does not acquire the meaning &quot;addicted to alcohol&quot; until 1880. In recent years, &quot;holic&quot;, which had no independent existence, has become detached from its word of origin and appears as an enclitic or suffix to produce such useful coinages as &quot;workaholic,&quot; &quot;shopaholic,&quot; &quot;chocoholic, &quot;&quot;sexaholic.&quot;&#0160; Holic is now so well-established as an indicator of compulsive behavior that it&#39;s quite permissible to take almost any noun, slap a holic onto it, and invent a decipherable adjective. A vacationer, for example, could be a beachaholic, a swimaholic, or a sandaholic.</p>
<p>A fate similar to that of alcoholic befell the word sandwich. Originally a town in Kent, Sandwich was later the name of a culinary-minded Earl. &quot;Sand&quot; is self-explanatory and &quot;wich&quot; designated a tract of salty land. Wich, like holic, has set out on its own career path and has generated such apparently essential new words as &quot;bagelwich&quot; and &quot;croissantwich.&quot; A croissantwich consists of a quantity of something or other between two slices of croissant. If a bagelwich is made of bagel and a croissantwich of croissant, of what is a sandwich made? The obvious answer: bread, which, by a quirk of language, is signified by the morpheme &quot;sand.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>There&#39;s no precise linguistic term for words created by the addition of holic and wich, but they are closely related to a group known as &quot;cranberry morphemes.&quot; (A morpheme is the smallest unit of sound that carries meaning.) Why cranberry? &#0160;Compare the two words &quot;blackberry&quot; and &quot;cranberry.&quot; &#0160;Blackberry resolves into two free morphemes: black and berry. Cranberry, however, is a horse of another color, because &quot;cran&quot; all by its lonesome has no meaning at all. (It did, once upon a time; cranberries were eaten by cranes.) &quot;Cran&quot; is therefore a &quot;bound morpheme.&quot; Unlike the black in blackberry, which functions quite well on its own, &quot;cran&quot; is &quot;bound&quot; because if it were free it would be meaningless. Technically, a cranberry morpheme is a bound morpheme that exists in only one lexeme. Workaholic is a variety of cranberry morpheme because, like cran, holic cannot stand alone; but while cranberry is unique, words containing holic and wich occur in numerous manifestations.&#0160; &#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>It&#39;s therefore the case that English does not have an adequate word for workaholic, bagelwich and their proliferating analogues. To supply this need, I nominate &quot;cranwich&quot; (a coinage that is less than minute old as this is written and is therefore a neonate neologism). The definition: a &quot;cranwich&quot; is a cranberry morpheme that has gone wild and no longer limits itself to a single appearance (like cran), but proliferates (like holic) -- and is easily proliferable.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>A hamburger was originally from Hamburg. At some point, burger detached itself from hamburger, went wild, and produced such cranwiches as cheeseburger, baconburger, bocaburger, and gardenburger. Along with these new words comes a rather paradoxical phenomenon. Just as the sand in sandwich now means bread, so the ham in hamburger means beef. This linguistic oddity will some day be a thing of the past: more and more, the word hamburger is being replaced by the less amusing but more precise beefburger. (Still beyond the horizon: breadwich.) It&#39;s impossible to say why the hamburger yielded burger while the frankfurter (from Frankfort) failed to cranwich: why do we have chicken franks and tofu franks rather than chickenfurters and tofufurters?&#0160;</p>
<p>Other cranwiches of note: Dracula has produced blackula and chocula: &quot;ula&quot; seems to mean something both frightening and funny (although not in the case of uvula. A scary uvula would be a uvulula). Godzilla produced hogzilla and bridezilla, coinages which might lead the cranwich-naive to conclude that the god in godzilla means god, which it certainly does not. Marathon, the Greek word for fennel, was also the name of the city where the Athenians defeated the Persians in 490 BC and from which the messenger Phidippides ran twenty-six miles to bring the good news home. &quot;Thon&quot; has now severed its relationship with marathon and, as a suffix, has produced innumerable cranwiches such as as knit-a-thon, jog-a-thon, dance-a-thon, blog-a-thon, and, believe it or not, masturbate-a-thon. The &quot;Mc&quot; in McDonald&#39;s has not only generated &quot;mcmansions&quot; and &quot;mcjobs,&quot; but has also opened up the possibility that an inferior or sub-standard cranwich could someday be called a mccranwich. A compendious display of mccranwiches would be a mccranwichorama.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p><em>March 24.&#0160; &#0160;</em>We&#39;re in Washington D. C.&#0160; On a cab ride we passed the Watergate complex, the presence of which reminded me that I&#39;d failed to mention one of the major cranwiches of the last decade. The &quot;gate&quot; in Watergate has become a suffix that denotes a scandal, as in Korea-gate, Iran-gate, Plamegate or, my favorite (I like odd rhymes), debate-gate. Debate-gate, now largely forgotten, occurred during the 1980 presidential campaign, when the fatuous hypocrite and ex-Jesse Helms speechwriter George Will, using a stolen Democratic briefing book, coached Ronald Reagan for his debate with Jimmy Carter, then later went on TV to praise Reagan&#39;s &quot;thoroughbred performance.&quot;&#0160; &#0160;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Why in the living heck do they say that the Nuggets are &quot;within&quot; two points of the Lakers? &#0160;&quot;Within&quot; means <strong>less than </strong>than the proclaimed margin -- 1.9 points perhaps. Why not say that the Nuggets are two points behind? Or trailing by two points?&#0160; But not -- goodness gracious -- &quot;within.&quot;&#0160; It&#39;s a perpetually annoying piece of basketball-announcer slang and a good reason to keep the TV sound muted. Moreover, why, given everything that I know about language change and about prescription versus description, does such an ugly locution fill me with grievous indignation?</p>
<p>And by all that&#39;s holy, &quot;beg the question&quot; does not mean &quot;raise the question&quot; or &quot;leads to the question.&quot; &quot;Beg the question&quot; is a term in logic which means that the conclusion is implicit in the premise. It&#39;s a form of circular argumentation. Aristotle first defined <em>petitio principii</em> and his analysis served until a dozen or score of years ago, when, for some reason, &quot;beg&quot; became confused with &quot;beget.&quot; Let&#39;s try to hold the line on this one-- we need all the logic we can muster in these perilous times.&#0160;</p>
