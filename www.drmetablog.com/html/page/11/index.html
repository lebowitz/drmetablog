		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>In the back of our fourth-grade &quot;reader&quot; at P. S. 217, there was an appendix containing proverbs and other jots of wisdom. Most of these were commonplaces: &quot;look before you leap&quot;; &quot;a stitch in time saves nine&quot;; &quot;empty barrels make the most noise.&quot;&#0160; Many of these gnomic bits mystified me. For example:</p>
<p>For all your days prepare,</p>
<p>And meet them ever alike.</p>
<p>When you are the anvil, bear.</p>
<p>When you are the hammer, strike.</p>
<p>I had no idea what an anvil was (now I own a beauty!!) but I understood that it was something to beat with a hammer. For what purpose? I had no clue? &#0160;But I was a moderately progressive youth and I couldn&#39;t grasp why we anvils were being urged to &quot;bear.&quot; It seemed like a reactionary idea then and still seems so now. Way too passive, I thought. Why shouldn&#39;t the anvils join together and form a united front against the hammers, or whatever capitalist oligarch controlled the hammers? Why did my grandparents come to America if not to free themselves from the perpetual anvilhood of sorry Ukraine?</p>
<p>Moreover, I completely missed the mark on &quot;strike,&quot; which I interpreted to mean &quot;go on strike.&quot; An easy mistake, because the only other meaning I knew of strike was the &quot;three strikes and you&#39;re out&quot; of basebalI. Even naif me knew that baseball had nothing to do with anvils and hammers or fourth-grade readers.&#0160;</p>
<p>The poem was therefore incoherent. Endure and suffer when you&#39;re an anvil, but get on the picket line when you&#39;re a hammer.</p>
<p>Why couldn&#39;t anvil and hammer unite and resist their oppressors together?&#0160;</p>
<p>I should also confess that anvil and hammer fused and mingled in my youthful brain with a Phillies shortstop of the period named Granville Hamner.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Let me guess that a modern reader coming upon Shakespeare&#39;s euphonious phrase &quot;vaulting variable ramps&quot; would be baffled as to its sense. Just WS being willfully obscure, one might complain. But it&#39;s not so; it&#39;s just that the language keeps on changing, making things difficult for audiences and readers.</p>
<p>The most obvious meaning &#0160;of &quot;vaulting various ramps&quot; -- hurdling a miscellaneous series of inclined planes, as in a steeplechase -- won&#39;t fly. &quot;Ramps&quot; takes us down a wrong path, because its modern meaning (a wood or concrete construction leading from one level to another) was unknown in 1611. It didn&#39;t enter the English language until 1778 -- as a borrowing from French <em>rampe</em>. (The entrance to a highway, as in &quot;take the ramp on the right&quot; is an Americanism dating only to the 1950s.)</p>
<p>A &quot;ramp&quot; is also a vegetable. It&#39;s an uncultivated, wild member of the onion family lately celebrated by fad foodies (or food faddies) as a great delicacy. But why Shakespeare would want someone to hurdle an individual ramp or even a field of ramps is less than obvious. Another false start.</p>
<p>Let us therefore examine the context of the phrase &quot;vaulting variable ramps.&quot;</p>
<p>It occurs in <em>Cymbeline, </em>the most magical of Shakespeare&#39;s last plays. Nasty Iachimo (&quot;little Iago&quot;) tries to persuade Innogen that her virtuous husband Postumus has been unfaithful -- that he has, in another splendid Shakespearean phrase, &quot;partner&#39;d with tomboys.&quot; The situation excites Shakespeare&#39;s exuberant pen. Iachimo embroiders &quot;tomboys&quot; and claims that Postumus has consorted with &quot;with diseased ventures/ That play with all infirmities for gold/ Which rottenness can lend nature; such boil&#39;d stuff/ As well might poison poison.&quot; Should she, that is, Innogen (and here Iachimo&#39;s rhetoric soars)</p>
<p>&#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160;Live, like Diana&#39;s priest, betwixt cold sheets,</p>
<p>&#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160;While he [Postumus] is vaulting variable ramps,</p>
<p>&#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160;In your despite. &#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;Ramps,&quot; therefore, are the opposite of Diana&#39;s priestesses, who live chastely; they are in fact loose women. Ramps who are neither architectural nor vegetable, but sexual and promiscuous. At least, they are so in this instance, because otherwise &quot;ramp&quot; carried a meaning closer to &quot;virago&quot; -- in 1611 an overbearing woman but not necessarily an unchaste one. The word &quot;ramp&quot; in this signification has disappeared but has bequeathed us &quot;rapscallion&quot; (which was earlier spelled both &quot;ramscallion&quot; or &quot;rampscallion.&quot;) There is no evidence to support the easy inference that rapscallion combines &quot;ramp&quot; and &quot;scallion.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Vaulting variable ramps&quot; means &quot;to engage in a series of athletic sexual encounters.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>To vault into a lover&#39;s bed might seem to border on the comic but I don&#39;t think that it does so in this case. Shakespeare elsewhere seems to imagine intercourse as a vigorous event. A brothel is in his language a &quot;leaping house.&quot; And surely it&#39;s not comic when Juliet hopes that Romeo will &quot;leap to [her] arms.&quot;</p>
<p>The conception behind &quot;vault&quot; and &quot;leap&quot; reappears in the contemporary demotic phrase &quot;jump his/her bones.&quot;</p>
<p>Ramps:</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><a class="image" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hangover_Square.jpg"><img alt="Hangover Square.jpg" class="thumbborder" data-file-height="390" data-file-width="256" decoding="async" height="335" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9c/Hangover_Square.jpg/220px-Hangover_Square.jpg" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/9c/Hangover_Square.jpg 1.5x" width="220" /></a></p>
<p>It&#39;s a play on Hanover Square in London, where, apparently, there were many drinking establishments. It&#39;s also still another variety of amnesia. This time the victim knows he&#39;s lost his memory, but his friends and relatives don&#39;t notice.</p>
<p>George Harvey Bone, a composer played by the immense (300 lb) and immensely talented Laird Cregar, experiences what he calls &quot;moods&quot; where he can&#39;t remember what he did or where he did it. It being a film noir, what he does is kill people. An elderly Scottish antique dealer for one, and Netta Longdon, a wicked exploitative chantoosie&#0160; (Linda Darnell at her best), who&#39;s been playing Bone for a sucker. But he doesn&#39;t remember, so it&#39;s not his responsibility, say some. In the event, he carries Netta&#39;s newly-strangled body to the top of a Guy Fawkes bonfire and then returns to his own house where, melodramatically seated at his piano and playing his concerto while fire blazes around him, he&#39;s burned to death. As far as I can tell, he never does discover that he&#39;s a murderer when he&#39;s &quot;in the mood.&quot; Nor must he be punished by the law; the fire does the job. &quot;It&#39;s better this way&quot; says George Sanders, Bone&#39;s ineffectual psychologist.</p>
<p>Fascinating addendum: Linda Darnell, consumed by fire in this movie, died twenty years later in a house fire in Glenview, Illinois. (Laird Cregar, 31, died of a heart attack after <em>Hangover</em> <em>Square&#0160;</em>was completed but before it was released.)</p>
<p>Is it a good film? &#0160;It&#39;s fascinating for sure and there are many good scary scenes, but the plot is so compromised by the inexplicable designer amnesia that it&#39;s hard to embrace, hard to recommend.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>My father had many admirable traits. He was absolutely honest -- &quot;honest to a fault&quot; even. He had a fine sense of humor. He was compassionate and though he affected stoicism, he was deeply romantic and emotional -- tears came easy to him. He was a self-effacing but diligent worker. He was a fine, graceful athlete -- basketball, tennis, baseball (a catcher!) His social views were progressive. I never detected a jot or tittle of bigotry in his conversation (in fact, words that denigrated racial or religious groups were unknown in our home. When I heard words like &quot;goy&quot; on the street, I had to do some research to find out what was meant.) He was a thoughtful man, a wise man, a realist and not an ideologue. He was an affectionate father and husband. He never provoked a soul and had no enemies. He enjoyed his life.</p>
<p>I profited immensely from observing these excellent traits in action.</p>
<p>But perhaps because of his impoverished first-generation beginnings, he was never at ease in the world. Yes, he was comfortable at home and in his backyard garden and among his circle of friends, many of whom he had known from childhood. He was comfortable walking to the BMT at Newkirk Plaza, taking the subway to Court Street in downtown Brooklyn, and practicing his profession, where he was much respected. But he did not like to step out of his milieu. He couldn&#39;t fend for himself. Here&#39;s an extreme but telling example: one day, when I was ten or so years old, as we were walking home, probably from the schoolyard, he stopped in front of the local A &amp; P and said to me, &quot;Your mother wants a quart of milk; you go in and buy the milk. I&#39;ll wait outside.&quot; Which I did, of course; I was used to running such errands. My father couldn&#39;t go into a market without stress. He could buy a newspaper at a candy store or kiosk, and he could bring home a loaf of rye bread from Ebinger&#39;s bakery, but I never once saw him in a vegetable market or a fish store or a butcher shop. When my mother died in 1978, he had to hire people to shop for him. And someone to cook, because, as the saying goes, he couldn&#39;t boil water. Because of his discomfort when out of his routine, he was a classic stick-in-the-mud. He couldn&#39;t travel. He never learned to drive a car. In his relations with others, he was totally passive. He allowed my mother to organize his social life and after she died, he became completely isolated. He hated change. Once when I visited him late in his life, when he was in serious arthritic pain, he complained about the station to which his radio was tuned. It was one of those &quot;twenty-four hours of news&quot; stations that repeated itself every few minutes. I said, &quot;Why not change the station?&quot; He said, &quot;Aw, it&#39;s already set there.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>I tried very hard not to imitate these less-than-admirable habits.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>First of all, let us dismiss the notion that Charles Dickens invented a pair of persnickety punctilious accountants and named them Jot and Tittle. Sorry, it could or should have been the case, but it&#39;s not so.&#0160;Nevertheless, both &quot;jot&quot; and &quot;tittle,&quot; often found in each other&#39;s cozy company, have stories to tell.</p>
<p>Take jot, for example. In the&#0160;masterful &quot;seduction scene&quot; in Shakespeare&#39;s <em>Othello</em>, Iago first torments the Venetian general and then pretends sympathy: &quot;I see this (i.e. his nasty sly hints that Desdemona has been a-bed with Cassio) hath a little dashed your spirits.&quot; Othello responds defensively, perhaps a tad dishonestly: &quot;Not a jot, not a jot.&quot;</p>
<div data-dobid="dfn">The noun &quot;jot&quot; is not obsolete but it&#39;s not common either. What is a jot? A tiny bit, a shred, a whit, a speck, a scintilla, a mite, a trace, a skoch, an inkling, a dollop. Smaller by far than a mere smidgeon. But in its root meaning, was a jot a <span style="line-height: 1.3;">measure of liquid, such as an ounce? or of weight, such as a gram? A measure of distance? &#0160;A measure of time: &quot;I&#39;ll be with you in just a jot.&quot;</span></div>
<p>Professor Google tells me it&#39;s none of those things and that I am entirely off track. &quot;Jot&quot; is alphabetic; it translates the Greek &quot;iota,&quot; the smallest letter -- no more than a single straight line, a minimal minim. And therefore Othello might just as well have said (the words are cognates), &quot;Not an iota, not an iota.&quot; He might have said it, that is, if he hadn&#39;t spent his dearest action in the tented field engaging exclusively in broils and battles, but instead had studied at some North African classical academy.</p>
<p>In fact, Shakespeare either didn&#39;t know or didn&#39;t use the word &quot;iota,&quot; which seems not to have entered English until a generation after he ceased putting quill to paper. On the other hand, Shakespeare was mighty fond of the word jot, which he employed at least twenty times (though never so notably as in <em>Othello),</em>&#0160;always to denote a small quantity and frequently to appear as a partitive: &quot;jot of promise,&quot; &quot;jot of ceremony,&quot; &quot;jot of color,&quot; &quot;jot of pleasure,&quot; &quot;jot of blood.&#39;&quot; Shakespeare&#39;s &quot;jot&quot; can even signify a moment in time: &quot;No, faith, I&#39;ll not stay a <span class="keyword1">jot</span> longer.&quot; (His &quot;jot&quot; is always a noun, never the converted verb meaning &quot;to write a few words quickly.&quot;)</p>
<p>Shakespeare undoubtedly knew the word &quot;jot&quot; from its famous and mysterious appearance in&#0160;<em>Matthew</em> 5:18. Here&#39;s the familiar King James Version (1611): &quot;For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.&quot; The phrasing is almost the same in the Geneva Bible of 1576 -- the translation that Shakespeare himself knew and used. &quot;<span style="line-height: 1.3;"><span style="line-height: 1.3;">For truly I say unto you, Till heaven and earth perish, one jot or one tittle of the Law shall not escape, till all things be fulfilled.&quot;</span></span></p>
<div data-dobid="dfn">
<p>I don&#39;t know what &quot;all things&quot; are and I certainly don&#39;t know what is meant by &quot;fulfilled.&quot; But why should I, since Jesus&#39;s prophesy has long baffled trained professional theologians. But I do know that the pairing of &quot;jot and tittle&quot; has become proverbial.</p>
<p>What, then, is a &quot;tittle.&quot; No, it&#39;s not a very small female breast. Nor is it a diminutive seabird, though it&#39;s not difficult to imagine a rocky south Atlantic island frequented by the &quot;Lesser, or Little Tittle.&quot; In actual fact, it&#39;s a stroke of a pen -- and one that&#39;s even smaller than an iota. Specifically, it&#39;s the dot over the lower case &quot;i&quot; or lower case &quot;j.&quot; Or, in an extended sense, any simple diacritical mark.&#0160;</p>
<p>Shakespeare used &quot;tittle&quot; just twice. The first was in <em>Love&#39;s Labor&#39;s Lost</em>&#0160;in a passage in which Shakespeare makes game of affected language. Pompous Don Armado de Adriano compares little things (the woman he woos) to greater things (himself) &quot;Shall I entreat thy love? I will. What shalt thou exchange for rags? robes; for <span class="keyword1">tittles</span>? titles; for thyself? me.&quot; What a difference a &quot;t&quot; makes! &quot;Tittle&quot; makes its second, almost inadvertent, appearance in <em>The Winter&#39;s Tale </em>as an element in the dismissive reduplicative &quot;tittle-tattling.&quot; Both of Shakespeare&#39;s tittles acknowledge that the word is an inherently silly one. Is it accidental that a number of words that resemble tittle are frivolous or infantile: babble, toddle, tattle, prattle? &#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;Tittle&quot; smacks of triviality. It lacks heft. It would have been a literary disaster, a catastrophe of the first order, if Othello had responded to Iago not with &quot;Not a jot, not a jot,&quot; but with &quot;not a tittle, not a tittle.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>[October 29] &#0160;Otis Brown responds: &quot;Dr. M.: you&#39;ve forgotten the most famous Tittle of all: Yelberton Abraham. How could you?</p>
<p>[November 2] &#0160;Vivian de St. Vrain responds:</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Here&#39;s a memory from my youth. Let&#39;s say it&#39;s the early &#39;50s. I&#39;m a thoughtless, self-absorbed adolescent, nominally studying at Erasmus Hall but in fact not paying much mind to schoolwork. It&#39;s a Sunday dinner, so I&#39;ve probably just come home from playing several hours of schoolyard basketball or softball. We&#39;re at the dining room table. Roast beef, possibly. There&#39;s a desultory conversation, but then my father, Emanuel, savoring the loaded table, observes, right out of left field I thought then, &quot;I don&#39;t think we could eat better food.&quot; He paused. &quot;Perhaps fancier, but not better.&quot;</p>
<p>I didn&#39;t know what has prompted his observation but it made enough impact on me that I retained it in memory for now these seventy years. I doubt that any of the five of us dissented and I suspect that we continued to stuff ourselves with meat and roasted potatoes and (inasmuch as it was the 50s), some sort of soggy canned vegetable.&#0160;But now, almost seven decades later, I think that I have a better understanding of Dad&#39;s spontaneous celebration of the roast. I also think that I know why that particular moment has stayed in my mind when so much else has long since evaporated. After all, Dad was not given to gratuitous compliments, certainly not to the food on the table.&#0160;My father was neither a gourmet nor a food critic (I&#39;ve written about his eating habits <a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2011/03/what-my-father-ate.htm">elsewhere</a>). I now know that he wasn&#39;t commenting on the preparation or the presentation of the food. He was savoring its inherent quality -- its grade A choiceness -- wait, not just its quality so much as its abundance. But even more specifically, when I think back, he was enjoying the knowledge that he was able to provide such a bountiful dinner for his family. &#0160;</p>
<p>To understand Dad&#39;s spontaneous overflow of emotion, it&#39;s necessary to recall the facts of his own childhood. From what I&#39;ve gleaned, the family in which he grew up must have been among the poorest in America, the very bottom of the economic ladder. His father worked in a factory -- which was just a large room behind a storefront -- as a roller of cigars. It&#39;s well documented that in the first part of the 20th century, cigar-rollers were one of the most exploited and most underpaid of American workers. Grandpa&#39;s wage when Dad was growing up, he told me, was $9 per week. The family, the six of them (the parents Isaiah and Eta, the children Max, Sol, Mollie, and Manny) lived in a sixth floor cold water walk-up flat -- that is, in an apartment in a tenement up six flights of stairs (no elevators), water but no hot water. I don&#39;t know how many rooms in this apartment but it didn&#39;t matter much, because, Dad said, they all spent their time in the kitchen, which was the only room they could afford to heat.&#0160;</p>
<p>Dad&#39;s mother, my grandmother Eta (she&#39;s Yetta in her naturalization papers) didn&#39;t speak much English and I can only remember one conversation with her -- just a short while before she died in 1962 at age 89. It was a struggle for her to speak my language but she managed to say two memorable sentences about her early years in America. She said, with pride, &quot;we was poor but we was clean,&quot; and (very relevant here) &quot;we always had what to eat.&quot; &#0160;That sentence of hers --&quot;we always had what to eat&quot;-- was said with almost exactly the same valence as my father&#39;s &quot;I don&#39;t think we could eat better food.&quot; For grandma, putting food on the table for six individuals was achievement enough. It was a triumph. Grandma didn&#39;t speak of her diet in the old country, but from her height (4&#39;10&quot;) and that of her husband Isaiah&#39;s (5&#39;1&quot;), I can guess that food was an issue and that dearth was common. I also suspect that the sixth floor walk-up might have been luxurious compared to the standard of living in StaryConstantin in Ukraine.</p>
<p>But to my father. He had no difficulty acknowledging the poverty of his early years. I think, looking back, that he had some pleasure in knowing that he had overcome the hardships of his youth. If he didn&#39;t have a jacket in the coldest of winters, well, he had a sweater, and that was enough. I only remember one complaint, and it wasn&#39;t about his family. During World War I, students in P. S. 122 were lined up on the side of the room and were instructed to offer their donations for the purchase of War Bonds. When they surrendered their dimes or quarters, they were allowed to sit down. &#0160;But Dad was required to remain standing because he didn&#39;t have even a nickel to donate. &quot;Wasn&#39;t that a cruel thing to do to a child,&quot; he said to me.</p>
<p>But poverty did not distort my father&#39;s personality. He was the precise opposite of the stereotype of the upwardly mobile overachiever, grasping for more and more. &#0160;He was actually rather contemptuous of such people. He said to me once, &quot;Anyone can make money if he makes it the whole business of his life to do so.&quot; And I also remember an instance when I overheard a conversation among his friends about how much their stocks had gained. After they left, my father said,&#0160;<br />&quot;When the stock market is going up, everyone&#39;s a genius.&quot; He himself never had an extra dollar to invest in stocks. But enough is as good as a feast.</p>
<p>He was the person least interested in material goods that I have met in my entire lifetime. He had no possessions and craved none. He was a real estate lawyer in a world where clients squabbled over inches, but his opinion was &quot;Nobody owns anything. Maybe you can say you have a lifetime lease, but that&#39;s all.&quot;</p>
<p>Here&#39;s another piece of wisdom that offered, and one from which I&#39;ve profited. I think I can quote this verbatim. &quot;Never omit an opportunity to do a favor for a friend. And never be embarrassed to accept a favor from a friend. People like to help each other.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s not the most artistic poster (way too crowded a field) but it&#39;s a heck of a movie. It&#39;s a familiar film noir subject: guy (in this case), Eddie Rico, a former mobster, tries to go straight, but his past catches up with him. The first couple of scenes establish him as legitimate businessman and husband. In fact, the director, the ever-reliable Phil Karlson, pushes the Code envelope when Eddie and Alice (Dianne Foster) wake in separate beds (as required by the Legion of Decency) and he reaches over and lays his hand just an inch &#0160;or so from her benightgowned right breast. (Makes me wonder how much negotiation was required with the censors: &quot;Can he put his hand here? How about here? Above? Below?&quot;) And then when Eddie playfully asks Alice why &#0160;she married him, she answers rather forthrightly, &quot;I was a girl. I wanted to be a woman.&quot; Whoa, how did Karlson slip that one through? &#0160;Did the censors not understand?</p>
<p>Discussion of prudery is relevant, because censorship spoils the ending of the film. It&#39;s grim gangland world into which Eddie is reluctantly thrust. Everyone lies, no one can be trusted, every conversation reeks of menace, and violence is ubiquitous and casual. In the showdown, Eddie is wounded and survives, but every element in the logic of film requires that he die. The tacked-on happy ending, in which a headline proclaims that the gang has been destroyed and Eddie and Alice enjoy connubial bliss, is false, and, I think, even insulting to the intelligence of the viewer. Better to ignore it, or, better still, turn off the tv just three minutes before the end, because the first 87 minutes are just terrific. &#0160;</p>

<p>When we arrived at Dead Elm Farm in 1968, we were confronted with a derelict silo. It had not been used for many years and displayed a Pisa-like lean. We thought it was a hazard and decided to take it down, which we did by the simple expedient of tying one end of a rope to one of the metal rings and attaching the other end to a car bumper. The silo offered little resistance. But once it was removed, we discovered that decades of leaking at the junction of silo and barn had engendered massive rot in the uprights and sill and that the side of the barn was hanging by a thread and would need even more reconstruction than we could possibly have imagined.&#0160;</p>
<p>The picture makes it all very clear, but there&#39;s a small structure visible at the top and to the right of the silo which I don&#39;t remember. What was it?&#0160; Perhaps it was part of the primitive venting system that was used to keep hot air from building up in the hayloft. Or a cricket to keep the rain off?</p>
<p>And when did that vent or cricket disappear? What became of it? &#0160;I have no recollection.</p>
<p>It was not a functional or useful silo, but it was beautiful in its own way. Though doomed.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Here&#39;s a marvelously instructive tale about culinary practice, custom, superstition, religion and how knowledge passes from generation to generation.</p>
<p>We&#39;re in the 1940s.</p>
<p>My mother was sitting with her childhood friend, Estelle Fendrick, who was preparing a chicken soup. My mother (this is exactly how she told me the story) noticed that Estelle broke the long bones (the &quot;drumstick&quot;) of the chicken before putting them into the cooking vessel. She asked Estelle, why she broke the bones. And Estelle replied, well, it&#39;s what my mother did. I don&#39;t know why but I&#39;m going to see her next week and I&#39;ll ask her why she broke the bones. So the next week, Estelle asked her own mother why she broke the bones, and her mother answered in the same way as Estelle: I do it because my mother did it. But look, tomorrow I&#39;m going to visit my mother in the Hebrew Home for the Aged in Riverdale and I&#39;ll ask her. So, and here my mother&#39;s narrative comes to its climax, Estelle&#39;s mother went to visit her own mother and asked her, why did you use to break the bones of the chicken before you put them into the cooking vessel, and Estelle&#39;s grandmother thought for a while and then said (and here you have to imagine a very strong old country accent), We had a very small pot.</p>

				<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef0240a48d0a0b200c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="IMG_2743" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef0240a48d0a0b200c image-full img-responsive" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef0240a48d0a0b200c-800wi" title="IMG_2743" /></a></p>
<p>It shouldn&#39;t take more than a moment, dear grandchildren, to figure out exactly what building is under construction. It&#39;s the early spring of 1978 and the house that we&#39;ve lived in these last forty or so years is rising out of the ground. It may be a little difficult, but if you scrutinize closely, you&#39;ll notice the space that has been left for the familiar sliding door (with its prominent header), and also the spaces for the front door and the kitchen windows. The workmen (is that Jimmy Perry up there?) are just starting on the second floor. There&#39;s also a large boulder which came out of the basement on the lower right, sitting where it remained for 30 years or so until it was replaced by a much more handsome piece of granite. (The boulder in the picture can now be found, part buried, at the entrance to the new waterfall garden.)</p>
<p>It&#39;s a very small house (the footprint is 20&#39; x 28&#39;) not because we were in love with small houses, but because we were working with an extremely limited budget. &#0160;Believe it or not, the house (including foundation, roof, well, electricity, and septic) cost just $33,000 --very little even in 1970s dollars. That&#39;s because we cut every corner that could conceivably be cut: unfinished lumber for framing, second-hand doors, used plumbing fixtures and appliances, plywood flooring in some rooms, etc. etc. &#0160;(Almost all these elements have been replaced and upgraded over the years as the family has become more prosperous.)</p>
<p>Also important: the house site. It might seem natural and inevitable to you, grandchildren, that the house is where it is. But in fact, there was a long serious debate about where to put it. And here you must remind yourself that in 1977 the area that now contains a house and a garage/barn and three cabins and an orchard of sorts and three or four different gardens was a blank space, a tabula rasa -- just a meadow behind the old West Bradford cemetery.</p>
<p>Four sites were under consideration and three were rejected : the first where Cabin #3 is located, the second, where the barn sits, the third in the back field (but that would have involved a prohibitive investment in a road and the undergrounding of many feet of electrical wire). I made the decision to put the house up on the knoll, with a good view of pond, forest and field, accessible to the road, and with the hope and possibility of a dry basement. The right decision, I still think. &#0160;</p>
<p>There was only one road in at the time -- the one to the south of the cemetery. The driveway we now use came the next year. &#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>There were many adventures and many anxieties in the building of the house, most of them a consequence of the limited budget. It was not an enjoyable experience, but it didn&#39;t sour me on the land or the property. I learned a lot.</p>

				<p>In the 1940s of ancient memory, it was a rare treat when my father would bring home, on a summer evening, a pint of ice cream to be shared among the five of us. This was in the days of &quot;ice boxes&quot; and before the refrigerators that replaced them had freezer compartments -- so the ice cream had to be consumed immediately. Which it was. &#0160;</p>
<p>There was also the Good Humor truck:</p>

<div class="mVDMnf nJGrxf">which jingled its way down East 9th Street evenings and weekends during the summer months. A small boy could wangle a raspberry or grape popsicle for 5 cents or a chocolate covered bar on a stick for 10 cents (if his parents would front the money). &#0160;</div>
<div class="mVDMnf nJGrxf">&#0160;</div>
<div class="mVDMnf nJGrxf"><span style="line-height: 1.3;">An ice cream cone (single scoop) at the candy store around the corner cost 10 cents. I remember the shock when the price escalated to 11 cents. If the price of an ice cream cone could change, was there any hope for stability in our fallen universe?&#0160;</span></div>
<div class="mVDMnf nJGrxf">&#0160;</div>
<div class="mVDMnf nJGrxf"><span style="line-height: 1.3;">Then sometime in the last of the 40s or the first of the 50s the icebox was replaced with a big new refrigerator from Sears with a freezer compartment. Ice cream could now be purchased by the half-gallon and eaten not occasionally and rarely but every single day. It became an evening staple. It wasn&#39;t very good ice cream, but I didn&#39;t know it then. Pumped full of air, it was the white bread of ice creams. &#0160;</span></div>
<div class="mVDMnf nJGrxf">&#0160;</div>
<div class="mVDMnf nJGrxf">But even Meadowgold and their like were superior to the &quot;ice cream&quot; that we tasted and rejected in England in the 1970s which was made with whale blubber.&#0160;</div>
<div class="mVDMnf nJGrxf">&#0160;</div>
<div class="mVDMnf nJGrxf">Then came the revolution. Heavenly ice cream emerged from its long Dark Age. Reuben and Rose Mattus of Brooklyn Heights introduced faux Danish Haagen-dazs and Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield gave us Ben and Jerry&#39;s. A revolution and a revelation! &#0160;Following their precedent, many brands of superior ice cream and gelato emerged. But beware, because Haagen-Dasz is now owned by Nestle and Ben and Jerry&#39;s by Unilever.</div>
<div class="mVDMnf nJGrxf">&#0160;</div>
<div class="mVDMnf nJGrxf">Beware also of the various masquerade ice creams that clutter the freezer section of the supermarket. Ice cream made not of cream but of tofu, oats, soy, coconut oil, kefir -- ghastly travesties, all of them.</div>
<div class="mVDMnf nJGrxf">&#0160;</div>
<div class="mVDMnf nJGrxf">I think we&#39;re in a golden age of ice cream. I especially think so in the summer, when we drive down to the Whippi-Dip in Fairlee for some of Gifford&#39;s peach ice cream. (Is it bad or good that Gifford&#39;s, out of Skowhegan, Maine, is the &quot;Official Ice Cream of the New England Patriots?&quot;) &#0160;</div>
<div class="mVDMnf nJGrxf">&#0160;</div>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef0240a4d842ee200b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="IMG_2731" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef0240a4d842ee200b image-full img-responsive" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef0240a4d842ee200b-800wi" title="IMG_2731" /></a><br />This is a photograph of the buildings on the West Bradford property as they existed when we made the deal in 1967. As you know -- children, grandchildren and other interested parties -- we are no longer in possession of this part of the property. It passed to Phyllis and Bruce in 1977 and then to Bruce entirely when he and Phyllis divorced in 1984 or thereabouts. &#0160;</p>
<p>But this is how it looked to the photographer, whom I believe to be my brother Jonathan, when he stood on the near knoll looking westward. &#0160;Much remains superficially constant but everything is different.</p>
<p>Still in place: the house and barn, the Red Duchess apple tree just to the left of the house and closer to the camera; the big sugar maple on the left, near South Road. &#0160;</p>
<p>But to my eye, there&#39;s much that has changed. Hanging over the house is a very large, very dead elm. There&#39;s another infected and doomed elm to the right of the barn. Indeed, the property was sometimes called by us &quot;Dead Elm Farm&quot; when we spent our first summer there, in 1968. There&#39;s a chicken house, barely visible, to the right of the white clapboard milk house; there is also another outbuilding once used as a garage and a storeroom for wood visible between the house and barn; there&#39;s a porch of sorts at the street side of the house -- all these elements have been removed though they remain vivid in my memory.</p>
<p>But what you can&#39;t see, grandchildren, is more interesting than what is visible.</p>
<p>The property was owned for forty years by Tom Roberts, who was probably as old in 1968 as I am now. He knew that he was too tired and probably too resource-poor to maintain ownership. His wife, eight years older than he, was mortally ill, and Tom himself had only a couple of years to live. It was time for him to move on.</p>
<p>The house itself (supposedly built in part in 1856) was out of an earlier era. It lacked a septic system (it had only a cesspool, which was an open sewer into which untreated waste flowed and stunk.) &#0160;There was a 15-foot deep dug well (you can see a bit of the topmost well tile and the concrete well cover just to the right of the apple tree) from which a very old electric pump pushed water up to an open copper-lined tank on the second floor of the house. There was no water pressure (because there was no pressure tank) but only a &quot;gravity feed&quot; to the faucets and toilet. The plumbing was rusted iron (in) and lead (out). There was no heating system -- the wood stoves that had heated the place were sold at auction before we took up residence. No insulation either, except (we later discovered) the piles of hazelnut shells that generations of squirrels and chipmunks had deposited in the spaces between the split lathe-and-plaster inner walls and the outer sheathing. The sills were rotten and the house was sagging in places -- although, as you can see, the roof line was still deceptively sound.&#0160;</p>
<p>The barn was in even worse condition than the house. Its partial collapse was the reason -- the last straw -- that Tom Roberts sold out. During the previous winter, the rotted-out floor on the east side of the barn had given way, strangling three of Tom&#39;s eight cows in their stanchions. Tom was heartbroken -- he dropped more than one tear when he told us about the disaster. &quot;I hooked them one by one to the tractor and dragged them out into the field, over there, and buried them.&quot; &#0160;He pointed to a spot that would be just about the lower right hand corner of the photograph.</p>
<p>The barn, at first, was a scary place. &#0160;It took us (Bruce and me) a couple of weeks to get up the courage to enter. It was a disaster area: giant spider webs, peeling whitewash, jumbled and distorted structures for dairy use, piles of twisted lumber. It&#39;s now been repaired and remodeled -- completely transformed. But I still treasure the memory of the way it was, at least after it wasn&#39;t in danger of further collapse. I miss the majestic 16&#39; by 16&#39; hemlock beams, the spacious haylofts, the hand hewn tree that served for a ridgepole.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that the buildings were way past their prime, barely functioning, I didn&#39;t think for a second that we had made a mistake in buying the place. I never thought of reversing course and selling out. I was totally at home from the first breath. I fell in love with the buildings, and even more so with the land. &#0160;</p>
<p>When Althea took her very first walk on the property, just as we passed what we call the &quot;meander&quot; and crossed over the spill (now enclosed in a culvert) through which water from the swamp (now a pond) courses into the Baldwin Brook, she said, &quot;This is too beautiful to be in private hands.&quot; &#0160;</p>
<p>It&#39;s even more beautiful now.</p>
<p>[Addendum October 24, 2019. &#0160;I suppose I should mention that the decision to buy the property was controversial. My father in particular, ever cautious, was adamant: you don&#39;t buy a second home until you&#39;ve bought your first home. You have no idea what you&#39;re buying. The land has never been surveyed; &#0160;you don&#39;t know the boundaries.&quot; &#0160;His reasoning was perfectly correct, but all wrong. Buying the property was the best financial decision of my life.] &#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>My mother, your great-grandmother, Lillian Green, was born in New York City, probably in Harlem, on June 9, 1905.</p>
<p>Her parents, Sonia Chafetz and Joseph Usilewski, were part of the great migration to America of Eastern European Jews. According to my mother, Sonia and Joseph were both engaged to other people when they eloped, he deserting from the Russian army. They arrived at Ellis Island mid-August of 1904 without a kopeck in their pockets and only one pair of shoes between them. I used to think that my mother had been conceived aboard the ship from Rotterdam, but the dates don&#39;t bear it out. Moreover, It&#39;s a melancholy fact that passengers in steerage were segregated by sex and kept apart.&#0160;</p>
<p>My mother was born Lilly Usilewski but when she entered public school, which is where she acquired English, she was enrolled as Lily Solawisky. When her younger brother was enrolled as Daniel Oslofsky, my grandfather Joseph realized that it was time to Americanize his name. The judge before whom he appeared was named Green, so Green he became. Lilly became Lillian when she married, my father insisting that &quot;Lilly&#39;s not a name.&quot; He and everyone called her &quot;Lil&quot; but she was always &quot;Lilly&quot; to her mother Sonia.</p>
<p>Lil&#39;s upbringing, I am afraid, was impoverished and harsh. I was told that her father raised her and her younger brothers Dan and Ellis (Bub) &quot;with the belt.&quot; Her mother Sonia was chronically ill from goiter and from the consequences of her five home-made abortions, so against her wishes Lil was taken out of school six weeks into high school to run the house and to raise her brothers, a sacrifice for which she received no appreciation either from them or from her father. For her, it was a disaster and a source of bitterness.. Her life from age thirteen to age twenty-six, when she married my father, Emanuel, is almost entirely blank to me. I know that she worked in the printing industry and was a skilled proofreader. She was not at all athletic or artistic but she was musical -- she played the piano and sang. At some point in early adulthood she started to take vacations at one of those camps for young Jewish adults in the Catskills. She sang in camp musicals and it was there that she met my father, a law clerk studying for the bar. My grandfather Joseph Green disapproved of her independence and refused to speak to her for two years -- a wound from which she was still suffering when I came to know her. Lil and Manny were married on June 19, 1930 and had four children:&#0160; Eugene (1935- 2006), Susan (1937-1938), Elihu (1939 -&#0160; &#0160; ), and Jonathan (1942 -&#0160; &#0160; ).</p>
<p>Her hard early life and the death of her daughter at the age of nine months, along with a chronic, agonizing stomach ulcer left her a troubled woman. She was what used to be called &quot;difficult&quot; -- acerbic, rude, insensitive, thoughtless. She once said to me, &quot;I was a good mother until you boys were six years old; after that, I couldn&#39;t cope.&quot; I think it was honest and insightful of her to say so. Yet my very earliest memories are pleasurable. She kept us warm and fed and loved; otherwise I don&#39;t know how my brothers and I would have been able to have lived satisfying lives. But I also know that I have no memories of touching her or being touched by her, although sometimes she would demand a quick peck on the cheek. She was not at all &quot;supportive&quot; -- &quot;assaultive&quot; would be a better term. There was no praise, only incomprehension or disdain.</p>
<p>I can&#39;t remember any particular words that she said to me, but here&#39;s a sample of her language. I remember that when my two or three month old firstborn suffered noisily from colic, she proposed to my wife, &quot;Maybe your milk is poisoning him&quot; &#0160;-- which not a sentiment likely to endear her to a struggling new mother.</p>
<p>It took me into adulthood to recognize that my mother&#39;s peculiarities were not villainy but the product of her emotionally impoverished early years and of her almost constant pain.&#0160;</p>
<p>After her children were grown, she resumed her piano playing and turned herself into a stalwart of the League of Women Voters. In 1960, during JFK&#39;s presidential campaign, she gathered fifty or sixty women and welcomed Eleanor Roosevelt herself to our home on East 9 Street. A most memorable and important contribution.</p>
<p>She did not mellow with age. Yet I would have to say, that all things considered, she did well.</p>
<p>Lil died at age 74 from the consequences of her then-incurable ulcer. In the hospital, dying, &quot;intubated&quot; and incapable of speech, she scribbled on a scrap of paper, &quot;I love you all,&quot;&#0160; and I know that she meant sincerely what had always been so difficult for her to express. I retain that piece of paper as a relic.&#0160;</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a picture of Lil at her best. Me and my mom, c. 1940.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Another day, another amnesia movie. This one, <em>Shadow on the Wall, </em>is&#0160; different only because the amnesiac is a child.&#0160; The poor dear has witnessed a murder, and has been traumatized, which we know because her wooden perkiness transforms into wooden woodenness. In the vulgar reductive Freudianism to which the film pays full credence, the little girl won&#39;t be cured until she remembers what she has repressed. Which she does, unsurprisingly and predictably, in the last scene, thereby freeing her father (Zachary Scott) from the threat of execution for a murder he didn&#39;t commit. More turbid amnesia waters flowing under the Lethean bridge.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t now why I have such a dislike for Zachary Scott. True, he&#39;s not a good actor, but it&#39;s not that. It might be his mustache, which is far too tidy and trim and which says (to me), &quot;this person can&#39;t be trusted.&quot;&#0160; Or perhaps it&#39;s his receding chin.&#0160; Or his hairpiece. His awkward movements. His pathetic attempts at comedy.&#0160; I can&#39;t say for sure.</p>
<p>I think that I must have been mistreated by a Zachary Scott lookalike in my childhood, events that I&#39;ve forgotten but have retained in my subconscious.&#0160;</p>
<p>If I could just remember what happened I might be able to free myself of this irrational hatred. Meanwhile, I&#39;m sorry the movie turned out the way it did.&#0160; I would have preferred it if Zachary Scott had been executed, mustache and all, even if it was for a murder he didn&#39;t commit.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Now that I&#39;m eighty (80!) years old, it&#39;s time to think about what, if anything, &#0160;I&#39;ve learned. For many years now, I&#39;ve been waiting for wisdom to kick in, but so far, no thunderbolts or grand illuminations. Yet I seem to have accumulated a number of maxims and cliches, which leads to the dispiriting conclusion that perhaps there&#39;s no difference between ordinary commonplaces and sophisticated wisdom. On the other hand, it is undeniably the case that I am a different person now than I was twenty or forty or sixty years ago, so perhaps all these years have produced some changes in attitude and behavior. What follows is the first installment of either &quot;wisdom&quot; or &quot;commonplaces&quot; -- take your pick.</p>
<p>Although it is true that there are psychopaths and sociopaths, there are very few of them. Almost all the people I&#39;ve known over the years have been poor struggling mortals, like myself, trying to act decently and respectably. The difficult people with whom I&#39;ve had to deal are pathetic rather than villainous. They act badly because of their own inadequacies, anxieties and fear, not because they are innately vicious. A surprising number of people have endured dreadful traumas and most of them have recovered to live satisfactory lives. There are some poor souls who compensate badly. They cause pain to us, but more to themselves. It&#39;s not true that to know everything is to excuse everything, but knowing people&#39;s stories certainly helps you to become more empathetic and understanding. My younger self was much harsher and less compassionate toward difficult people than my present self.</p>
<p>Genuine understanding between individuals is difficult and misunderstanding is rife. It&#39;s hard to translate what&#39;s in your head to your friend or neighbor, and just as hard to understand what&#39;s in someone else&#39;s head by words alone. If you&#39;re going to be surprised because someone misunderstood you, then you&#39;re going to spend half your entire lifetime in a state of dreadful shock. Although irony and understatement are most useful figures of speech, beware of them. There&#39;s nothing more awkward (and sometimes dangerous) than an ironic remark that is taken seriously, or a serious remark that is understood ironically. A meaningful exchange of ideas or insights can&#39;t be brief, because it takes time for a shred or glimmer of understanding to grow and ripen. If you want to have a real friend, make the time. Understanding someone else&#39;s brain is akin to Zeno&#39;s Paradox; &#0160;you get halfway there but you never get all the way. &#0160;</p>
<p>Everyone is engaged in &quot;presentation of self.&quot; You meet someone new, and they tell you about themselves, but they&#39;re not really doing so in any profound way. They&#39;re not trying to. They&#39;re acting out the &quot;presentation&quot; that they&#39;ve devised over the years. They offer you a handful of anecdotes which they think represent themselves. But the fun and the satisfaction only begins when that first mask drops away. In order to know someone, you have to ask a question that is not truly intrusive but manages to take your new friend (or old friend, for that matter), a hair&#39;s breadth apart from their usual style of presentation. Sometimes it&#39;s not worth the effort, &#0160;but there are occasions when it can precipitate a worthwhile friendship. Too many conversations are not exchanges of information. &#0160;A says something from his repertoire of self-presentations; then B, impatiently waiting his turn to talk about himself, responds with a nugget from his own store. No genuine communication takes place. This kind of exchange is disappointing and almost useless. We all generate these forms of presentation partly as a defense against revealing too much of ourselves and becoming vulnerable, and because we all have our own follies and weaknesses. So we act a role. The further the contrived role is from the true self, the more transparent and even offensive it becomes. It&#39;s hard for people to be true to themselves; &#0160;it takes work. &#0160;</p>
<p>More wisdom (or commonplaces) coming soon. Stay tuned.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Three times in the last few weeks I&#39;ve had the opportunity to drop into other people&#39;s lives.</p>
<p>The most recent was a visit to the Mountain Men Rendezvous in Antonito, New Mexico.</p>
<p>&quot;Rendezvous,&quot; you ask? &#0160;In the 1830s, fur trappers gathered in various places in western North America to sell their furs and purchase supplies for the coming year. According to the story, they drank themselves silly, fornicated as much as possible, and played at various games and sports to pass the time while they waited for the wagons to arrive from St. Louis. Modern re-enactors dress in 1820s costumes, and, at least in Antonito, engage in knife and &quot;hawk&quot; (tomahawk) throwing contests.&#0160;</p>
<p>It was a world taken very seriously by the mountain men and their ladies. But strange, even otherworldly to me. I learned about the proper size of a hawk and how muzzle loading rifles work and I handled an elaborately beaded pouch made out of a bull&#39;s scrotum, owned by our host, whose &quot;mountain name&quot; was Long Tongue. But no liquor at this gathering. Lemonade only, I&#39;m glad to say. I wouldn&#39;t have been comfortable with all those knives and hawks whizzing around if the guys and gals had been addled with alcohol.</p>
<p>And also : a few weeks ago, in New Orleans, we shared lunch with the Lords of Leather. A scary, in-your-face name, but a more welcoming group of men I&#39;ve rarely met. Some were costumed, but most of them looked like a bunch of accountants enjoying a weekend cookout. No doubt their fellowship engaged private matters that I don&#39;t know about and wouldn&#39;t understand. Lives very different from mine.</p>
<p>Also in New Orleans, we attended a &quot;ball.&quot; &#0160;Not a ball that involves dancing -- more of a pageant, a display of elaborate costuming. It was sponsored by the Krewe of Iris, a group of women who roll their pageant wagons (floats) during Mardi Gras. We costumed ourselves for the ball -- fancy long dress and tuxedo. The members of the Krewe a) take it all very seriously, and b) know that it&#39;s silly and c) take it seriously nonetheless.</p>
<p>There must be thousands of these cultures and sub-cultures in our rich and various nation. I&#39;m happy to have participated, a bit, in these worlds.</p>
<p>And I wonder, of course, how strange and exotic my life and culture, bland and ordinary to me, might seem to some of the mountain men and leather-lords and Iris ladies.</p>

				<p>He: &#0160;&quot;These allergies are getting me down. &#0160;Every morning I seem to wake up with a liter of mucus in my nose. There&#39;s so much I should probably save it and put in the garden. It would be good for the soil.&quot;</p>
<p>She: &#0160;&quot;Yes, we could save it one of those nice plastic jars that the Talenti ice cream comes in.&quot;</p>
<p>He: &#0160;&quot;It might be a problem on the plane. &#39;What&#39;s that in the jar, sir.&#39; &#0160;&quot;It&#39;s a pint of my snot. I&#39;m taking it to Vermont to put in the garden.&#39; &#0160;&#39; Er, do you want to step over here, sir.&#39;</p>
<p>She: &#0160;&quot;Perhaps we should re-think this.&quot;</p>
<p>He: &#0160;&quot;It&#39;s a good thing that we know each other pretty well. If I had said to you, five years ago when we first met, &#39;Hi, my name is... &#0160;I&#39;m thinking of saving my snot and taking it to Vermont,&#39; it would have ended the relationship right there.&quot;</p>
<p>She: &#0160;&quot;Yes, you were very wise to have waited five years to mention it. Very tactful.&quot;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Today&#39;s contribution, <em>Little Jimmy Hurt his Arm</em>, was written by <a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2017/04/leonardo-the-enlightened-lion.html ">Ralph Ganesha Jefferson,</a>&#0160;the author of the best-selling children&#39;s book&#0160;<em>Leonardo, the Enlightened Lion&#0160;</em>(2017).</p>
<p>&quot;Little Jimmy hurt his arm.</p>
<p>He said to his mother, my arm hurts. His mother said, let us pray over it. So they prayed.</p>
<p>But it still hurt.</p>
<p>So his mother took him to the wise women at the end of the street. She prescribed CBD oil. Jimmy&#39;s mother rubbed CBD oil on his arm.</p>
<p>But it still hurt.</p>
<p>So his mother took him to a psychotherapist. He gave Jimmy some anti-anxiety pills. Jimmy took them.</p>
<p>But his arm still hurt.</p>
<p>So his mother took him to a reflexologist, then to a Kirlian analyst, then to an aromatherapist. Jimmy did what they advised.</p>
<p>But his arm still hurt.</p>
<p>Then Jimmy said, &#39;why don&#39;t we go to a doctor.&#39; &#0160;</p>
<p>So they went to a doctor. And the doctor said to Jimmy, &quot;Your arm is broken.&quot; &#0160;The doctor set the bone and put it in a cast. &#0160;</p>
<p>Jimmy&#39;s arm stopped hurting.</p>
<p>And then the doctor said, &quot;While you&#39;re here, why don&#39;t I give you a measles shot?&quot; &#0160;And he did.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>This reprehensible film aspires to be an &quot;inconsequential romp,&quot; as one reviewer suggests, but fails to meet even that exceedingly low bar.</p>
<p>If a viewer could swallow the buddy-movie plot (Stuart Whitman as a New Orleans card shark and John Wayne as John Wayne), he&#39;d still have to deal with Nehemiah Persoff as a brutal Mexican gang-and-cult leader and Ina Balin (the worst actress Brooklyn has ever produced) as his spitfire daughter. And also embrace the dubious proposition that the road from New Orleans to Galveston goes through picturesque southern Utah. And many other improbabilities.</p>
<p>Ok, so the film is one big joke, a comedy masquerading as a western, or vice versa.</p>
<p>But if the film is a &quot;romp,&quot; then how in the world can we justify its treatment of Indians?</p>
<p>In <em>The Comancheros,</em> Indians have three functions. The first is to be constantly drunk and constantly in search of whiskey. It offers a truly horrible, inexcusable scene in which a renowned chief falls drunkenly into his soup. Amusing? Not to any person with a modicum of fellow feeling. The second purpose that Indians serve is to be cruel: they torture and scalp. Their third purpose is to be cannon-fodder. Scores, perhaps a hundred are remorselessly cut down by our white friends. Not a one of them is awarded a trace of individuality -- though, as is the custom in such films, they get to fall picturesquely from rocky overlooks or be dragged by the foot in the stirrup when they are shot off their horses.</p>
<p>Even worse than these atrocities is a scene in which a bedraggled, impoverished line of hollow-eyed Indians, this time including women and children, trudge dejectedly across the landscape. A mini Trail of Tears. Not to worry, says John Wayne, they&#39;re &quot;tame Indians.&quot; &quot;Tame&quot; means defeated, reduced to poverty, neglected, dehumanized. Tame as cows or dogs. It&#39;s a painful image, hard to ignore or to forget.&#0160;</p>
<p>I imagine that we&#39;re supposed to say, Oh, this was 1961, we know better now. But by 1961, John Ford had made a few movies in which Indians were depicted with not a lot, but a bit of humanity. <em>The Comancheros </em>was reactionary and unenlightened even it its day, we have to admit, and embodied a transparently racist ideology. It&#39;s treatment of our fellow but slightly different humans is grotesque and unforgivable.</p>
<p>Criminal, in fact. It is nothing less than a excuse and justification for genocide. Not inconsequential at all.&#0160;</p>
<p>According to the story, Michael Curtiz set out to direct the film, but fell ill and withdrew. The actual direction was under the control of John Wayne himself, so it is at his feet that this appalling monster must lie.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I don&#39;t read much fiction, but when I do, it&#39;s usually one of the 19th-century classics. However, the &quot;international bestseller&quot;&#0160;<em>The End of Innocence</em>&#0160;(2016) by Benedict Wells came highly recommended, so I gave it a shot. It&#39;s pretty good, not bad, not great, and certainly a novel for today and not for all time -- not even for the next decade. It&#39;s thin, simple.&#0160;</p>
<p>Egomaniac that I am, I was less interested in the novel itself than I was in my own reaction to it, which was, in a couple of words, both resistant and resentful.&#0160;</p>
<p>Why the hostility, &#0160;I ask myself? &#0160;</p>
<p>In the first place, it&#39;s a novel without any sense of style. Perhaps it&#39;s the translator&#39;s fault, but gosh, it&#39;s written in the prose of a bad TV journalist. And second, it&#39;s ruthlessly manipulative. The the back-cover blurb, boasts &quot;tear jerker.&quot; And so it is, shamelessly. Jules, the first-person narrator, loses his parents in an auto accident, is sent to a boarding school that is depicted as a quasi-penitentiary, is abandoned by his two siblings, suffers from paralyzing guilt, and when he finally marries, has to watch his wife die from cancer (a sequence which is narrated in extended, unnecessary detail). &#0160;</p>
<p>I suppose these disasters might have been handled with enough circumspection and integrity to teach us something about the human condition. But no, only to wring a couple of tears from our reluctant eyes. And then the too easily won upbeat ending -- goodness gracious!&#0160;</p>
<p>Some parts, but not enough of them, rang true. The family dynamics among the siblings was complicated enough to generate some heft.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a single instance, one of many, to which I objected: a late middle-age writer suffers from Alzheimer&#39;s. Our hero, Jules, puts a gun in the man&#39;s hands, then walks away and hears the report of the weapon. He never confesses that he assisted in the death, and suffers no psychological ramifications from doing so. Peculiar, especially since the dead man was his rival for the love of his soon-to-be wife. I think most people would agree that assisting in a suicide is a fraught act and that a novelist neglects his duty and cheats his readers when he fails to acknowledge and explore its effects. A major, compromising misstep by Mr.Wells. &#0160;</p>
<p>So there it is, in little: disappointed, exploited and cheated. Not a good feeling to take away from a novel.</p>
<p>But I wonder at myself. The most manipulative novelist of all times is Charles Dickens, whose writing &#0160;I revere. Dickens is on a level several orders of magnitude more tearjerkery than Wells could possibly imagine, grasp, or emulate. How can it be that I embrace Dickens and reject Wells?</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I&#39;ve just read Tim Birkhead&#39;s biography of <em>The Wonderful Mr Willoughby, The First True Ornithologist</em> (London, 2018). Birkhead&#39;s thesis is that Francis Willoughby was not merely a bird watcher, but an innovative, diligent, and imaginative scientist, the founder of a new area of knowledge.&#0160;</p>
<p>Ornithology when Willoughby (1635 â€“1672) started to look at birds was astonishingly primitive. For example, students did not even agree that birds migrated. Perhaps, as Aristotle had suggested, they hid in holes during the winter. Perhaps they transmuted from a species that departed to a species that arrived. With no observers in southern lands and no rapid communication, it&#39;s not surprising that it was hard to imagine that birds flew south in the fall and returned in the spring. Even now, when all is revealed, migration still seems, at least to me, to be mysterious, miraculous, and wondrously improbable.&#0160;</p>
<p>Before the &quot;new philosophy put all in doubt,&quot; the assumption that governed all &quot;science&quot; was that the natural world should be studied for evidence of divine wisdom -- a practice which blinkered understanding and limited speculation. The questions that people asked about birds were therefore not particularly challenging. They asked which ones were good to eat, which ones could be kept in cages, and which ones had medicinal value.&#0160;</p>
<p>The first task of new ornithology was simply to take a census. What birds live here, by what names are they called, and how should they be classified? &#0160;In the non-standardized late medieval world, most birds bore regional or demotic names, and sometimes the same name was attached two or more species of birds. It took a while before the ars-foot came to be recognized and conventionalized as the great-crested grebe and to earn the official designation Podiceps cristatus. It was the same with the such regionally-named birds as the annet, bald buzzard, the Bohemian chatterer, the copped douker, the coulterneb, the didapper, the dun-diver, the fern-owl, the flusher, the gid, the glead, the gorcock, the ox-eye, the pickmire, the puit, the puttock, the pyrag, the rock ouzel, the scarf, the skout, and the witwall? &#0160;It remained to be demonstrated that the &quot;yarwhelp&quot; &quot;was in fact the East Anglian name for the bar-tailed godwit and was to be distinguished from the similar black-tailed godwit.&quot; That the sea-pie was an oystercatcher. That the elegug was a guillemot. &quot;The sea-swallows they there (on Caldey Island) call spurs, and the razor-bills are called elegugus.... This name elelgug some attribute to the puffin, and some to the guillem[ot]; &#0160;indeed they know not what they mean by this name.&quot; Nomenclature was a thicket.</p>
<p>Willoughby was an energetic surveyor and classifier. But as he became more familiar with bird life, he started to ask questions of genuine scientific interest. What is the function of the tomial tooth? Do all birds of the same species have the same color iris? How many birds have rictal bristles? Do birds who lay two eggs produce one male and one female? Do female birds ever have two ovaries and two oviducts? Can birds hold on to their eggs at will, or are they laid involuntarily? How do birds survive the cold of winter? Why do birds molt?</p>
<p>While these are not necessarily the questions of a modern ornithologist, they certainly represent a new beginning. Many thanks to Birkhead for bringing Willoughby to our attention.</p>
<p>How sad that the first true ornithologist died at age thirty-six.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I cooled my heels for more than an hour waiting for a &quot;blood draw.&quot; Why so long? There was no long line of people ahead of me. Was it simply that the department was understaffed? That they all went out for ice cream? Or were the blood-collectors, the vampires, gossiping and lazing about behind the curtain?&#0160;</p>
<p>I was miffed.</p>
<p>But it wasn&#39;t long before I transitioned from passive miff to active glare. Now, &quot;glaring&quot; is a powerful, if ineffective, way to deal with such inconveniences. I think that my powerglare was beginning to get the attention of the poor schlub sitting at the desk pretending to ignore me.&#0160;</p>
<p>But let me confess that there&#39;s a danger inherent in the glare, because if your lower lip quivers ever so slightly, you&#39;re no longer glaring, you&#39;re pouting. Of course I didn&#39;t want to be seen as a pouter. So I concentrated all my energy into my glare. I think I had it under control, but after a while, without making a conscious decision to do so, I escalated from glaring to seething.</p>
<p>The seethe is more difficult to express than the glare. You can glare with just your eyes, but you have to put your whole body into the seethe. For proper seething, you have to cross your arms and hunch over. And once you&#39;re in that posture, you can then begin to move from seething to simmering. But you must be careful not to be perceived as sulking.&#0160;</p>
<p>And then on to fuming. Fuming is very like seething and simmering -- the same hunched body posture -- but accompanied with heavy breathing and an occasional, intermittent through-the-teeth hiss. You&#39;ve got to make sure that your hiss is a true angry hiss and not a pathetic sniffle.</p>
<p>From fuming it was only a short step to boiling, which came at about the 55 minute mark.</p>
<p>Good thing my name was called on the hour, because I was just about to blow my top. &#0160;</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>When I downsized into my present residence in 2009, a few essential items disappeared, among them a venerable but excellent toaster. I did not replace it because I was distracted by more pressing matters. I went toasterless for almost five years. &#0160;</p>
<p>Later, when I entered into a tentative new relationship, toasterlessness became a matter of concern. Toast was an essential item in the diet of my new lady friend. For a while, before she began to spend nights with me, she would daily transport in bag or backpack -- along with toiletries and toothbrush and changes of undergarments -- her glamorous red enamel Cuisinart toaster. &#0160;</p>
<p>That this arrangement was comic became immediately apparent. No one can carry a toaster from one home to another day after day without feeling the irony.&#0160;</p>
<p>As our relationship solidified, it became clear that something had to be done, toasterwise. And so we came to realize that it was time to progress to a stable two-toaster situation.&#0160;</p>
<p>The Cuisinart went back to its original home and off we went to McGuckin&#39;s Hardware. There we acquired a Proctor Silex, with which we have lived until a short while ago. &#0160;</p>
<p>I don&#39;t want to badmouth the Proctor Silex, but let&#39;s face it, it&#39;s a cheap lightweight contraption with too much plastic and a tendency to leak crumbs over the counter. A paucity of knobs and controls. It&#39;s an entry-level toaster, a &quot;starter toaster.&quot; A provisional toaster that lacked the dignity that our maturing connection demanded.</p>
<p>So yesterday, at Peppercorn on the semi-famous Boulder Mall, we purchased a superior toaster -- a highly-recommended, weighty and substantial Breville two-slicer equipped with &quot;Lift and Lock&quot; and other bells and whistles (which we will no doubt some day master), the upper grill of which is inscribed with the comforting motto, &quot;BAGELS FACE INWARDS.&quot; A toaster of heft and permanence. It&#39;s sitting proudly on the counter now.</p>
<p>Moreover, we purchased it with our new joint credit card.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Usually the amnesia is the hardest bit to swallow. The amnesia in <em>Dead Again</em> is particularly unpalatable, because Emma Thompson shows up at a Catholic orphanage without any memory nor with any ability to speak. No explanation is ever offered for her disease, not a grain. No cracking the skull, no mysterious drugs, no trauma, nothing. Just a little all-purpose Hollywood-style amnesia to get the plot rolling.</p>
<p>But spontaneous amnesia slides down the esophagus rather easily compared to hypnotically-induced past-life regression, huge trenchers of which we&#39;re expected to bolt and guzzle. I couldn&#39;t do it and the film became ridiculous and ridiculously baroque, gimmicky, inhuman. A waste of Kenneth Branagh&#39;s extraordinary talent. And the music --portentous, dictatorial, distracting.&#0160;</p>
<p>I saw this movie when it first appeared, in 1991, and liked it. What was I thinking? &#0160;My salad days, when I was green in judgment.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><a class="image" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:The_Great_Lie.jpg"><img alt="The Great Lie.jpg" class="thumbborder" data-file-height="376" data-file-width="264" decoding="async" height="313" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/ef/The_Great_Lie.jpg/220px-The_Great_Lie.jpg" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/ef/The_Great_Lie.jpg 1.5x" width="220" /></a></p>
<p>It&#39;s hard to say how much of <em>The Great Lie</em> (1939) is original to its screenwriter Lenore J. Coffee. In the first place, the film is adapted from a novel, and secondly, at least according to the story, its stars Bette Davis and Mary Astor were unhappy with the screenplay and rewrote much of it. But how much? Nevertheless, in <em>The Great Lie, </em>as in <em style="line-height: 16.9px;">Sudden</em><span style="line-height: 16.9px;">&#0160;<em>Fear</em>&#0160;</span><span style="line-height: 1.3;">&#0160;and <em>Lightning Strikes Twice, </em>two other films written by Coffee, the heart of the matter is a head-to-head struggle between two strong women. In this film it&#39;s Sandra, (Mary Astor) and Maggie (Bette Davis) who go to the mat about first, a husband, who is apparently married to both of them (don&#39;t ask!) and then, a baby boy. Maggie (Bette) winds up with both husband and child, but it&#39;s touch and go for most of the film. I wish I could say that Coffee&#39;s dialog was brilliant, but not so. It&#39;s a serviceable, competent screenplay. George Brent, playboy and drunkard, isn&#39;t nearly as desirable a husband and father as the film asks us to believe. Not much of an actor, either.&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.3;">Mary Astor won an Oscar and well-deserved it; she steals the show. It&#39;s ironic, and it may be significant, that Mary Astor herself had been involved in a child-custody case several years before this film was made.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.3;">The music (by Max Steiner) is noteworthy -- mood-appropriate variations on themes from Tchaikovsky&#39;s first piano concerto.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.3;">Hattie McDaniel does as much with the stereotypical &quot;colored&quot; maid as an actress could be expected to do, but her scenes are still painful and embarrassing to watch.</span></p>

				<p>Actually, I didn&#39;t go TO the awards ceremony. This is what I wore to watch the Oscars on TV. Well, that&#39;s not entirely true either. I forgot to watch the Oscars. But I did wear the outfit.</p>
<p>My ensemble: plaid wool shirt by Woolrich; trousers by Lee (regular cut -- &quot;smoky quartz&quot; color); white cotton &quot;Gold Toe&quot; socks by Costco; shoes by Hoka (with orthopedic inserts by Dr. Scholl); genuine leather belt by SlideBelts; foundational undergarments by Fruit of the Loom and Carhartt; denim jacket by American Apparel. Accessories: eyeglasses by Kirkland Signature; hearing aids by Phonak. Traditional baseball cap by Otto (&quot;one size fits most&quot;).</p>
<p>Hair by Joe.</p>
<p>Once again, I&#39;d like to thank all the little people -- my fashion consultants, suppliers, and supporters -- for their imagination and hard work. I couldn&#39;t have done it without the entire team.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Among its other attractions. New Orleans (where I happen to be at this moment of writing) is a city blessed with street and avenue names that are both unusual, particular to the city, and glorious: Basin, Burgundy (accent on the gund), Calliope (three syllables), Desire, Dryades, Felicity, Frenchmen, Poydras, Prytania, Rampart, and of course Tchoupitoulas. Just a few to get the conversation started.</p>
<p>These names are elegant. No wonder I suffer from a desperate inferiority complex concerning the names of the streets on which I&#39;ve lived. East 9th Street, West 91 Street, 9th Street, 10th Street. Designations without character -- gray and boring. No resonance, no power. Bland.</p>
<p>Of course it hasn&#39;t been all bad: I once lived for a transitory summer (1961) on Snyder Hill Road -- a semi-poetic name that gestures at rurality.</p>
<p>I knew a guy who was raised on Old Oaken Bucket Road. I was initially dazzled -- until I learned that his neighbors had petitioned the city for a name change -- his street had formerly been called Third Avenue or Smith Road or something of that ilk. So it was not a real name -- it was pseudo-historical kitsch. What suburban pretension! What a comedown! I&#39;d have blushed with embarrassment if I had to admit that I lived on Old Oaken Bucket Road. It&#39;s almost as bad as Christmas Tree Drive (a real street in Boulder, Colorado, to the everlasting disgrace, nomenclature-wise, of our city).</p>
<p>But now in this latter end of my life, I&#39;ve achieved onomastic eminence. For half the year I live on Walnut Street, a name that is the epitome of small city authenticity (though it would be slightly better if there were an actual walnut tree anywhere nearby). And of summers I&#39;m at Hackett Hill Road, which is just perfectly titled, and even more perfect because there are numerous Hacketts in our local cemetery and because, fifty years ago, I met aged Edna Hackett, the last survivor of the family that gave its name to hill and road.</p>
