		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Beginning at the northwest corner and preceding south -- in the first brick house, a family of notably obese immigrant Syrian women who spoke no English; there were no children that I know of and no interactions with other neighbors. The house itself was not unusual but it was fronted by a wrought iron fence and a row of ancient stubbed catalpas which we called &quot;umbrella trees.&quot; Next was the house belonging to Dr. Jerry Yurkovsky, our M.D. In retrospect, he was a kind man but a badly-trained, out-of-touch physician. He was also an immigrant -- from Poland, I believe. My father, who rarely spoke badly of anyone, thought that he was a decent sort but that Mrs. Yurkovsky was &quot;a real pill.&quot; I remember only her iridescent dyed red hair. Then came the Lampsons, Hubert and Dorothy. He was never seen in daylight but was rumored to own a &quot;yacht&quot;; she was the neighborhood grouch, known to slice in half any errant pink &quot;spaldeens&quot; that that might be punched (kids played &quot;punchball&quot; in the street) over her tall privet hedge and into her front yard. While I never questioned this neighborhood orthodoxy, I never saw a sliced spaldeen either. Then came the large Victorian house belonging until about 1950 to the Heidtmanns and then to another family whose name I can&#39;t remember but who had an impaired daughter who screamed and screamed at maximum volume at all hours day and night. Next came our immediate neighbors on the south, Mr. and Mrs. Pynn, who lived in a small old wood-shingled structure.The Pynns (did they have given names?) were extremely old, in their 90s I would guess. He was a retired Cornish seaman, believe it or not; she cultivated colorful gladioli in her small backyard garden. Their upstairs tenants were the Rhodins, Thor and Pearl. He was a tall gaunt ancient austere Norwegian whose only known activity was writing letters to local newspapers; she was almost as tall but Jewish and &quot;went to business.&quot; They had three children but they were out of the house and too old for me to know them: Thor, jr, Yammie (Hjalmar), and Margeret. Thor was a physicist at Cornell rumored to have worked on the &quot;bomb.&quot; I have written about the Rhodins <a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2006/10/an_east_9th_str.html">elsewhere.&#0160;</a>Then came our house, a three-story 1912 Victorian of which our family of five occupied the top two floors. The first floor tenants were the Burnets (formerly Bernsteins), Albert and Bessie. He was musician who had retreated to accountancy. There were two sons, the older, Leonard, was troubled, and I now realize, probably gay; he played the sax; the younger son, Henry, had a cleft palate, later corrected by surgery, I believe, and banged on his drums incessantly. To our north were the Carps, who owned a brickyard or building supply business somewhere not in the neighborhood. They were a gloomy Dickensian family. Both of the daughters were nuns who came visiting once a year in their long black robes; the son, hang-dog Eddie, had the demeanor of a jaded funeral attendant. The Carps first act on moving into the house was to erect a tall forbidding chain link fence around the perimeter of their property which annoyed my father no end. Proceeding south, the next house was occupied by the Spollens, an immigrant Irish family who seemed to produce a new child every year. My memory is hazy about the south end of the street, under grand old elms until they fell victim to the Dutch blight, except that in one of the houses dwelt two tired bony sisters, perhaps twins, who every Sunday, trudged down 9th Street and past 18th Avenue to one of our neighborhood&#39;s numerous under-attended Protestant churches. They had a splendid garden of hollyhocks. Also at that end of the street lived, Mr. Mennino, who shared his personal variety of cucumbers with my father. At the very end of the block lived the <a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2011/09/dog-faced-man.html ">dog-faced man.</a>. &#0160;</p>
<p>On the other side of the street was an Italian family named Cocito, pronounced American&#39;ly, ko-see-to. When Junior Cocito (perhaps he had a name, but everyone called him Junior) grew up and married, he bought the house next door to his father&#39;s. Then next, coming closer to us, were the Cunninghams. Mr. Cunningham was a large imposing firefighter; there was at least one daughter and two sons, Jimmy and Billy. Billy was our only celebrity; he became rich and famous as the &quot;Kangaroo Kid&quot;; he also played first base on my younger brother&#39;s baseball team. After the Cunninghams was another house of semi-mystery, occupied by an unfriendly family whose last name was Harris. I believe my mother told me that Mr. Harris was a school principal. There was a shapely daughter a year or so older than I whom I admired from a distance. She (Betty) married at 16 or 17 (&quot;shotgun,&quot; I was told), and disappeared -- as did the family. Then came the Burkes, directly across the street from us. There were two sons, Charley, a genuine dolt and high school dropout who became an armed guard for Wells Fargo, and lanky John, who was studying for the priesthood. There was also an uncle or cousin who lived with them and who spent every weekend waxing and noisily buffing his big new DeSoto. Then came the house occupied by Mr. and Mrs. Petranto along with their ancient father who spent all day every day watching the traffic from the oversize glider on the porch. There was an older daughter, Madeleine, whom I didn&#39;t know, and a son, Frankie, a bachelor, a contemporary of my older brother Eugene, who later found work in the U.S. post office and who, when I investigated a few years ago, still -- eighty years later -- lived in his childhood home. Upstairs from the Petrantos dwelt the Meinekes, Charlie and Tessie. He was a butcher; she was &quot;at home.&quot; There was a rather sad ungainly but harmless daughter just my age, Charlotte, who dropped out of school early. I hope she a good life but I wonder. Next northward was another mystery house, probably a rental; for a year it was occupied by the Tebbets family. There was an attractive mid-twenties daughter whom my older brother and his peers admired no end, and a son, Lee, whom twenty years later I encountered in Vermont where he gave me an envelope of blue corn seeds (which I never planted). And then came the Constantino household. The father was a shoemaker, I believe. There were three children, Frankie, a terrific athlete; Regina, a beauty, and Carly, who dyed his hair henna and moved to Greenwich Village. There were two or three more houses at that end of the street, but I&#39;m vague about them. Sorry, don&#39;t remember; too far away. The name Ortner comes to mind. Mystery houses.</p>
<p>Even though I lived on the street for my entire childhood and until I left for college, I never entered a single house, nor did any of the neighbors ever enter ours. It wasn&#39;t that kind of neighborhood. Or perhaps we weren&#39;t that sort of people.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>The universal condiment in the ancient world<em>, </em>a staple of Roman, Greek and Byzantine cuisines,&#0160;was <em>garum</em>. Garum was manufactured in enormous quantities and shipped in special amphorae all over the civilized, colonized universe. What is garum? It&#39;s a fishy sauce that any sensible modern apple-pie-loving American would avoid at all costs. Trust me, you would not want to slaver your bacon cheeseburger with garum. &#0160;</p>
<p>To make garum, the innards -- the guts -- of fish (whitebait, anchovies, mackerel, tuna, etc.) were stacked between layers of salt and herbs and left in the sun for several months. Honest to Pete!! The result, which must have been malodorous and horrid, was then strained and bottled, or rather, poured into amphorae for transport.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t believe me? Here&#39;s a direct quotation from a 10th century Byzantine manual: &quot;the intestines of fish are thrown into a vessel and are salted; and small fish especially atherinae, or maenae or lycostomi are seasoned in the sun, and frequently turned; and when they have been seasoned in the heat, the garum is thus taken from them. A small basket of close texture is laid in the vessel filled with the small fish already mentioned, and the garum will flow into the basket.&quot; Sounds dreadful, you must admit. And I don&#39;t even know, and I don&#39;t know that anyone knows, exactly what sort of monsters of the deep are designated by the words atherinae and lycostomi.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a picture of a ruined garum factory in Baelo Claudia in Spain. The remains of such factories can be found all over the Mediterranean world. I myself have toured one near Pompeii. Garum factories were set as far as possible from centers of population because they, er, stunk.&#0160;</p>

<div class="magnify">Garum was the ancients&#39; ketchup. What could they have been thinking?</div>
<div class="magnify">&#0160;</div>
<div class="magnify">Strange to say, there&#39;s a etymological link between ancient fish sauce and modern ketchup. <span style="line-height: 1.2em;">In the 1600s, there existed a Chinese concoction that was called, depending on the dialect, a</span><span style="line-height: 1.2em;">kôe-chiap or kê-chiap,&#0160;</span><span style="line-height: 1.2em;">guī zhī, or&#0160;</span><span style="line-height: 1.2em;">gwai</span><span style="line-height: 1.2em;">&#0160;zap;&#0160;</span><span style="line-height: 1.2em;">all these apparently translated as &quot;the brine of pickled fish.&quot; By the early 18th century, the sauce had arrived in the present day region of Malaysia and Singapore, where it came to the attention of hungry, hardened &#0160;English colonists.The Malay word for the sauce was kicap </span><span style="line-height: 1.2em;">(pronounced &quot;kay-chap&quot;). </span><span style="line-height: 1.2em;">English settlers took kay-chap with them to the American colonies. </span></div>
<div class="magnify">&#0160;</div>
<div class="magnify"><span style="line-height: 1.2em;">But kay-chap was a long way from our familiar ketchup. The commonest kay-chap of the 18th century was not tomato but mushroom based. Tomato ketchup was a mid-19th century invention -- the first recipe for &quot;Tomata Catsup&quot; appearing in 1812. </span><span style="line-height: 1.2em;">Ketchup was popular long before fresh tomatoes because tomatoes were thought to be dangerous and possibly poisonous. A man named J</span><span style="line-height: 1.2em;">onas Yerkes is thought to be the first American to sell tomato ketchup in a bottle. But his initiative was overtaken and displaced by the 1876 ketchup launched by Henry Heinz. </span><span style="line-height: 1.2em;"><span style="line-height: 1.2em;">Heinz still controls 60% of the ketchup market.&#0160;</span></span>

<div class="magnify">Ketchup was not used in my family of origin. It was a revelation when, a Brooklyn youth, I first discovered ketchup, along with french fries, in a local delicatessen. It&#39;s been a staple of my diet ever since. Garum, not so much. Nor salsa, an emerging contemporary competitor.</div>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>If a widow and a widower form a relationship when they&#39;re both in their seventies, what is the proper and appropriate name for their relationship?</p>
<p>Legally, they&#39;re married, because here in the state of Colorado, if you live together and represent yourself as married, you&#39;re married, even if you haven&#39;t sought governmental sanction. Yet &quot;husband&quot; and &quot;wife&quot; don&#39;t come easily to the lips. They seem too doggone official. And they also seem like words out of an earlier era, especially &quot;wife,&quot; which carries irrelevant overtones of a dominant-submissive relationship. &quot;Just a housewife.&quot;</p>
<p>But &quot;companion&quot; is only slightly better. To my ear, it smacks of &quot;faithful companion Tonto.&quot; &quot;Partner&quot; is even worse; are we associates in a law firm?&#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;Girlfriend&quot; and &quot;boyfriend&quot; are clearly ludicrous and inappropriate to persons of mature years. Such words lack seriousness and heft; they trivialize a weighty relationship. So, similarly, does the naked &quot;friend,&quot; which in this context is colorless, neutral. &quot;Ladyfriend&quot; is a bit more serious. &quot;Gentleman caller&quot; was last said without irony in Peoria sometime in the middle of the nineteenth century. &quot;Mistress&quot; suggests that the friendship is merely sexual; its counterpart, &quot;gigolo,&quot; is even more specific, and seedy to boot. &quot;Lover&quot; is also one-dimensional.&#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;Old lady&quot; and &quot;old man&quot; are outmoded hippieisms. So is &quot;significant other.&quot; Other archaisms: &quot;main squeeze,&quot; &quot;stud,&quot; &quot;pal,&quot; &quot;steady lay,&quot; &quot;fancy man.&quot; &#0160;&quot;Love-slave.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;Spouse&quot;? No, too dry, too legalistic. &quot;Consort&quot;? &#0160;Disrespectful. &quot;Odalisque&quot;? &quot;Handmaiden.&quot; Sexist. &quot;Concubine?&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>It&#39;s fascinating that we&#39;ve had more trouble with nomenclature than with living, eating, working, and sleeping together.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><em>The Sons of Katie Elder (</em>1965<em>) -- </em>another film so awful that it&#39;s utterly, undeniably fascinating. It&#39;s packaged as a western, but underneath the arid mountainous scenery and the garish Technicolor, it&#39;s a film noir. &#0160;What&#39;s it about? &#0160;Well, a gang of crooks have been muscling in on the Elder ranch. Not an unusual circumstance, but in this case the heart of the matter, it seems, is that the four sons of frequently praised Katie Elder, proprietor of the ranch, have neglected their mother. They should have visited more often, or written, or at least called. The brothers are, in birth order, swaggering John Wayne, a gunman; sniggering Dean Martin, a gambler; colorless bland Earl Holliman, a failed businessman, and sophomoric Michael Anderson, whom the older brothers want to send to college, but whom they should rather send to high school to fulfill the prerequisites for Acting 101. It&#39;s all a mighty predictable -- a string of cliches -- and, just as expected, after the climactic gunfight the Elders get their land back from cheating Morgan Hastings and his gang of no-goodniks. The dialogue throughout is embarrassingly wooden; no, not wooden, harder than that, ceramic; no, not ceramic, titanium.&#0160;</p>
<p>I blame it all on Henry Hathaway, the director, who had some good westerns and also a series of films noirs (<em>The House on 92nd Street, The Dark Corner, Kiss of Death, Call Northside 777)&#0160;</em>to his credit. How could he have perpetrated this film? And someone, I don&#39;t know who, has to take responsibility for the ugliest, unfunniest, uncomic bit of grotesque &quot;comic relief&quot; ever perpetrated, in which Dean Martin auctions off his make-believe glass eye to a passel of local yokels. But I also think that some of the blame attaches to the producer, Hal Wallis. This is a film utterly without a female presence except for Martha Hyer, &#0160;who wanders into a couple of scenes without point or purpose. I couldn&#39;t figure out what the heck she was doing in the film until I read that she was married at the time to Wallis and that her career was on the fritz. I&#39;m positive that Wallis told the screen writer, &quot;Put in something &#0160;for Martha.&quot; &#0160;Well, he did, but it just made the whole mess a little messier, and if possible, a little less coherent. &#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p><em>The Sons of Katie Elder s</em>toked my indignation. What a waste of resources!&#0160;</p>
<p>But hey, there&#39;s a good three minute scene of a hundred or more horses being herded by the brothers, and there&#39;s George Kennedy as a gunslinger and Dennis Hopper as a neurotic youngster who gets killed &#0160;by his own father. It&#39;s something, but, sorry, not enough to dilute the indignation.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>

<p><span class="mw-headline"><em>Addendum November 16.</em> &#0160;I&#39;ve just watched another western, <em>Big Jake (</em>1971), in which John Wayne parodies an earlier John Wayne. Just as awful as Katie Elder. Maybe less intelligible. You can infer a lot from the poster.</span></p>

				<p>1958:&#0160; First batter of the game is Smith. He&#39;s batting .278. First pitch is a ball. Smith is 5&#39;9&quot;, 155 pounds. Married, two children, makes his winter home in Fort Smith, Arkansas. Sells tractors in the off-season. Good curve ball hitter.</p>
<p>2018:&#0160; First batter is Smith. He&#39;s batting .278. His slugging percentage is .342. His OBP is .335. His OPS is .445. He hits .225 against right-handers and .303 against left-handers. First pitch is a ball. On first pitches he&#39;s batting .225. With a count of 2 and 0, he&#39;s batting .247. Second pitch is a ball. On two strike pitches he&#39;s at .175. On fast balls in the upper right quadrant of the strike zone, he&#39;s batting .345. On fast balls in the lower left quadrant he&#39;s hitting .175. On two strike pitches, he strikes out 25% of the time and hits fly balls 30% of the time. He bats .283 in his home park, .246 on the road. Day games, .290, night games .225. His OPS in away night games against a left-handed pitcher is .341. In this ballpark he&#39;s batting .283. He&#39;s batting only .125 against this pitcher, just two for sixteen lifetime, and one of the hits was a double, but that was in a different ballpark and in a previous season. He&#39;s batting .285 against fastballs, .276 against curves, .225 against four seamers, .215 against split fingers, and .275 against change-ups. He sees an average of 4.3 pitches per at bat against right-handers and 5.1 against left-handers. He swings and misses 38% of the time. Here&#39;s the next pitch; it&#39;s a strike. When he connects against a left-handed split finger fastball in the lower left quadrant the ball comes of his bat at an average velocity of 85 miles per hour to left field, 87 to center field, and 76 to right field. His average launch angle is 18 degrees. With men on base, he&#39;s hitting .285. With runners in scoring position, .290; his launch angle to right field against right-handed split finger fastballs in the lower left quadrant rises to 25 degrees, but only on his first at bat in a game. Afterwards, it declines to 17 degrees. But that&#39;s in April and May, on weekends. In August and September, under the lights, his launch angle is 20 degrees against change-ups from right-handers who throw into the upper right quadrant when there&#39;s a man on second or third and fewer than two outs. There&#39;s ball four. &#0160;</p>
<p>Here comes the manager out to the mound. That&#39;s all for this pitcher. We&#39;ll be back in a moment.&#0160;</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I&#39;ve been reading the novels of Thomas Hardy. Some of them are familiar old friends, like J<em>ude the Obscure </em>and <em>Return of the Native</em>; some I&#39;ve read so long ago that they&#39;re new again (<em>Mayor of Casterbridge</em>, <em>Far from the Madding Crowd); &#0160;</em>and then there are a few that I know I&#39;ve never looked at before, such as <em>The Woodlanders</em>, <em>Under the Greenwood Tree</em>, and, the one I just finished a half a second ago, <em>A Pair of Blue Eyes. </em></p>
<p><em>Blue Eyes&#0160;</em>is an early novel (1873), moderately autobiographical. In it, young Stephen Smith is an apprentice architect of working class origins (as was Hardy) who woos Elfrida Swancourt, a maiden of a higher station. He has a rival for Elfrida&#39;s hand in a former teacher, elegant and prudish Henry Knight.</p>
<p>It&#39;s safe to say that this is a novel only for confirmed Hardy enthusiasts. There&#39;s little in it that Hardy doesn&#39;t do better later on.</p>
<p>On the other hand,&#0160;<em>Blue Eyes</em>&#0160;contains one rather wonderful piece of melodramatic excess. Elfrida and Knight go hiking on a dangerous cliff and Knight slips and gets himself into an awkward position, hanging on six hundred and fifty feet above the ocean. His foot &quot;was propped by a bracket of quartz rock, balanced on the edge of the precipice.&quot; She&#39;s clinging to him and they&#39;re both stuck. Knight is ever the gentleman. &quot;Clamber up my body till your feet are on my shoulders: when you are there you will, I think, be able to climb on to level ground.&quot; &quot;What will you do?&quot; asks Elfrida. Knight answers that he will wait &quot;whilst you run for assistance.&quot; But just their bad luck, there&#39;s no one around. And so the chapter comes to a cliffhanging close (the novel was originally published in serial form in Tinsley&#39;s Magazine).</p>
<p>Several minutes and several pages of reflection pass. At last, Elfrida reappears, her form &quot;singularly attenuated.&quot; &#0160;She carries a bundle of white linen.</p>
<p>Jumping jiminy, holy moly, I say, -- the girl has removed her underclothes.</p>
<p>She tears the linen into thin strips, knots them, and forms &quot;a perfect rope, six or seven yards long.&quot; Knight &#39;clambers&#39; up the rope, and is saved. &#0160;But by surrendering her undergarments, &#0160;Elfrida has, as Hardy delicately puts it, &quot;absolutely nothing between her and the weather but her exterior robe or costume.&quot; &#0160;Goodness gracious me, the poor dear is clad only in her &quot;outer bodice and skirt.&quot; &#0160;So, of course, to spare everyone further embarrassment, she runs away as fast as her little legs will carry her.</p>
<p>Poor struggling Thomas Hardy has wrestled Mrs. Grundy to a draw. &#0160;</p>
<p>Good thing Elfrida was clothed in sufficient unmentionables to construct a rope seven yards long. Suppose Knight had been down there couple more yards and she had to remove her &quot;upper bodice.&quot; &#0160;Would she have done so, or would she have let Knight plummet?` Hardy arranges it so that Elfrida can defy social norms, but not to the point of actual nudity. Hardy is bold, but not too bold. &#0160;</p>
<p>I suspect that if Hardy had his way and wasn&#39;t enchained by the humbug prudery against which he struggled all his life, he would have stripped Elfrida to the skin. How would Henry Knight have responded? Probably keeled over from the shock.</p>
<p>What would Elizabeth Bennet have done in the same situation? &#0160;Removed her underclothes to save her suitor? &#0160;Probably not. The most likely answer: Jane Austen would never have let her go out walking near a cliff with a gentleman. &#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Dear T, O, E, L, L, C, A: &#0160;This is about your great-grandmother, Anne Goss. She was born Hannah Sarah Krull in 1912 in New Jersey, but I&#39;ve forgotten which city, although I know that as a young person she lived in Bayonne, Hackensack and Paterson. Her parents, David and Katherine Meltzer Krull, were recent immigrants from eastern Europe. She was the oldest of five siblings: Anne, Jacob (Jack), Hyman, Freda, and Max (Mendy). Her father installed metal ceilings, her mother was what was then called a &quot;practical&quot; (i.e. unlicensed) nurse. The family was not wealthy. The five children shared two beds, boys in one, girls in the other, sleeping crosswise. Anne had a bout of polio at sixteen months which left her with a permanent limp and weakness in the left side of her body. Because of the effects of the illness, she endured an unusually difficult childhood -- marked by a series of surgeries on her leg which may or may not have helped. But she was quick-witted and talented, learning to play violin and viola and graduating as high school valedictorian. About the Jewish religion, important to her parents, she told me, &quot;I gave up that stuff when I was thirteen.&quot; She was intent on a college education which her parents opposed because the few dollars that she made as a dental assistant were crucial to the family economy. She won a full scholarship to Barnard College but it&#39;s sad to report that when she arrived on the first day of classes she discovered that she had to pay for room and board, which her family could not afford. She returned home but was admitted to Montclair State Teacher&#39;s College where she majored in chemistry. In a world with more advantages he would have gone on to medical school and become a distinguished physician, but such a career was not in the cards. At Montclair she played string quartets and met your great grandfather, Daniel Goss. There wasn&#39;t enough money to allow them to marry and no one lived together before marriage in those days. Anne once told me that the greatest mistake of her life was that she didn&#39;t go to bed with Dan until after they married, which didn&#39;t happen until he was 26 and she was 24. I think those premarital depression years must &#0160;have been hard and unsatisfying. And even after they married, still not so good because Dan and Anne couldn&#39;t afford a place of their own but shared an apartment with his parents (actually shared a bedroom, with a curtain between the parents&#39; &#0160;bed and theirs). Dan&#39;s parents disapproved of Anne: &quot;Why would you want to marry a cripple?&quot; Eventually Dan was hired as a teacher of mathematics at Paterson High School and then in 1946 moved to Utica College in Utica, New York. Although Ann had been told that the polio made it impossible for her to carry a child, she gave birth to three daughters (Althea -- your grandmother --in 1939; Phyllis in 1942, and Paula in 1951). She taught mathematics until she retired at the then-mandatory age of 65 but continued with her tutoring business through her seventies. Meanwhile, she had mastered the domestic arts: cooking, baking, sewing (she made all her daughters&#39; &#0160;clothes through their childhoods) and knitting. She was a hard-working woman, often to be found knitting, reading a book, and watching TV at the same time. Dan died in 1966 and so she spent many more years as widow than as a wife. Her life was filled with pain (two dozen major surgeries) but she never complained. She was independent, frugal, and adventurous. She was also strict, cool, not at all affectionate, and humorless. Not exactly humorless -- she never laughed, that I can remember, but sometimes she would respond to a joke by saying, &quot;That&#39;s funny.&quot; &#0160;She played bridge to win and not for fun and she liked a rough game of Scrabble with her grandsons. She was easy to respect but difficult to love.</p>
<p>She moved to Boulder at age 87 and lived to be 97, though much impaired. At her 90th birthday party, in 2002, &#0160;she was still functioning well but &quot;looping.&quot; &#0160;If she had died at 90 she would not have missed much. She was demented and bedridden for the last few years of her life. The last coherent statement she made to me, in her last month, was &quot;I&#39;m not afraid of this dying business.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>A good memory: Anne spent most of her early life wearing a heavy metal brace on her bad leg. But when she was in her early 90s, she acquired a brace made of a light space-age material. I took her walking in the mountains. First time. She was thrilled.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s another: she liked to help grade Althea&#39;s math exams and she liked to talk calculus with her grandsons. I remember saying to them, &quot;You have to understand something. This is unusual. Your standard run-of-the-mill grandmother does not understand calculus.&quot;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Victorian novelists had a hard time describing bodies, especially female bodies. Their usual practice was to sidestep such subjects entirely though the more daring of them might resort to suggestion or innuendo.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s an instance in which Thomas Hardy ties himself into comical&#0160; knots trying to tell his audience that although Tess Derbyfield (in <em>Tess of the D&#39;Urbervilles, 1891</em>) is very young and almost childish she has already developed a large bosom: &quot;She had an attribute which amounted to a disadvantage just now; and it was this that caused Alec d&#39;Urberville&#39;s eyes to rivet themselves upon her. It was a luxuriance of aspect, a fullness of growth, which made her appear more of a woman than she really was. She had inherited the feature from her mother without the quality it denoted. It had troubled her mind occasionally, till her companions had said that it was a fault which time would cure.&quot;&#0160; So very elliptical. It&#39;s distressing that frank-minded Thomas Hardy had to resort to such circumlocutions.</p>
<p>A later novelist might simply have noted that she was physically mature and that her emotions would eventually catch up but for now she was vulnerable.</p>
<p>Back in Brooklyn we might have said, &quot;Though she&#39;s only a kid, he has a pair of gazongas on her like you wouldn&#39;t believe and they&#39;re going to get her into a whole lot of trouble&quot;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>The rooster came to our attention about a month ago. We heard him before we saw him. He was living at the edge of the forest, about one hundred yards from the house. After a few days he became bolder and we were able to catch a glimpse now and then. He&#39;s a Barred Rock, fully mature, with a bright red comb and superior wattles, but with woeful tail feathers. We don&#39;t know from where he came. We asked around but none of the neighbors is missing a rooster. We guessed: he&#39;s an escapee, or, perhaps his owner became tired of him and kicked him out of the truck, or (my favorite theory) he was in a rooster fight, lost his tail feathers and retired to the woods in shame. But in fact, we have no idea how he came to settle on our property.</p>
<p>Little by little he started to become more comfortable with us. He would spend his day in the flower garden, furtively eating insects. He was especially fond of earwigs. A good occupation, I thought. No harm except to the bugs. Eventually he came to tolerate our presence. He would sit a few yards away, studying me while I weeded. He gained our respect, because he managed to survive even though the forest is filled with foxes and fisher cats and weasels and coyotes and the air is patrolled by hawks. He liked to visit the donkeys and peck around their manure piles.&#0160; When he started to roost not in the forest but in the blueberry bushes close to the house I became concerned -- this may be more of a rooster guest than I need. And then he took up the habit of cock-a-doodle-do-ing at dawn just outside our bedroom window. And during afternoon nap time. And familiarizing himself with the vegetable garden, where he snacks on cucumbers. (He loves cucumbers.) He became ever more bold -- a few days ago he was just outside the kitchen, pecking on the glass door, hoping, I imagine, to be let inside. And when I didn&#39;t let him in, he left a large retaliatory splash of rooster dropping right at the doorway.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef0263e9a1ccdb200b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Screen Shot 2021-05-01 at 3.33.28 PM" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef0263e9a1ccdb200b img-responsive" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef0263e9a1ccdb200b-800wi" title="Screen Shot 2021-05-01 at 3.33.28 PM" /></a></p>
<p>We looked out of the small north window of our bedroom and there he was perched on the railing, peering in. A peeping-Tom rooster. (Did he catch an eyeful!!)&#0160;</p>
<p>One day a near neighbor telephoned: &quot;Your rooster is here.&quot;&#0160; &quot;He&#39;s not my rooster.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>And then he disappeared. For the first time in a month, there was no crowing at dawn.&#0160; OK, we thought, some predator got him. One of these days, we&#39;ll stumble upon a bunch of black and white feathers in the forest.</p>
<p>But then a friend who lives on Ira&#39;s Pinnacle told us that he had seen a pair of chickens on Hackett Hill Road about a half a mile up the road. He couldn&#39;t be sure, but he figured it must be &quot;your&quot; rooster and a hen.&#0160;</p>
<p>So that&#39;s where he&#39;s been!! He&#39;s a gallinaceous gallant gallivanting with the local ladies. I thought, good for him; I don&#39;t have to concern myself with him any longer. He&#39;ll go feral and start a family. He must not know about Vermont winters.</p>
<p>But not so. This morning he was back, solitary, crowing vigorously outside my window. His romance, if it were a romance, didn&#39;t work out. I can&#39;t imagine why because he&#39;s become quite a handsome bird. He personable, friendly and he&#39;s grown an an impressive new set of tail feathers. He&#39;s plump and shiny; his walk, once furtive, has become a decisive strut. There he is now, cock-a-doodling his head off in the patch of cucumbers.</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I don&#39;t know why, but after 66 years I found myself thinking about my first English teacher at EHHS, Mr. Stephen Mitchell . Here&#39;s what I can recall. Mr. Mitchell was a lazy guy. I remember that on many a day he would give us busy work assignments, take up his New York Times, rest his feet in the lower drawer of his desk, and read, while the class occupied itself doing who knows what.&#0160; In retrospect, Mr. Mitchell was probably a classic burnt-out case.&#0160; Perhaps he had been young and enthusiastic at one time, but in 1952, he needed desperately to retire.&#0160;</p>
<p>I remember also that in his class we read &quot;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.&quot;&#0160; His instructional technique: he taught us some vocabulary, such as &quot;onomatopoeia&quot; and &quot;personification.&quot; Then one student after another was asked to take a stanza and search it for examples of onomatopoeia or personification or perhaps metaphor and also to identify iambic tetrameter or iambic trimeter.</p>
<p>Of the romance of the Rime, we knew nothing and learned nothing.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>All the while, Mr. Mitchell&#39;s feet never left the drawer.</p>
<p>In retrospect, I wonder whether he might not have been a WW2 veteran, not quite recovered from the trauma.</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>There&#39;s this woman of a certain age, good looking, usually blonde. Generally, she&#39;s a detective but she could be reporter or a spy -- some sort of investigator. She has an instinct for her work, an unusual insight or gift. There&#39;s a murderer or villain out there and she&#39;s determined to get him; it&#39;s personal with her and often she has to violate procedures in order to bring this character to justice. She regularly confronts her superior, an older man who is a stickler for the rules and wants to shut down the investigation. As a last resort, she&#39;ll ask for 24 hours, or more rarely 48 hours, to bring the villain in. And guess what -- it turns out that her instinct was right all along and after a brief struggle, in which her life is in danger (often there&#39;s an attempted assassination, usually by speeding vehicle), the criminal/mastermind/murderer is handcuffed (British version) or shot (American version).</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>The ol&#39; dreamatorium was working overtime last night. The protagonist, who was and who was not me was a mature, bearded gentleman, a prosperous landowner in what seemed like the antebellum South. He, or he/I, was the target of a plot by a younger cousin in league with a scuzzy lawyer to have him/me declared insane -- and therefore his/my property to be confiscated and transferred to the control of the villainous cousin. The heart of the dream was a hearing or trial in which he/I was cross examined and every of his emotions mischaracterized by the lawyer and the panel of mental health experts. For example, if he/I expressed indignation and anger, it was interpreted as paranoia; if he/I remained impassive it was understood as catatonia. Every emotion became its parodic extreme. As a result, he/I was placed in an institution; a rather bucolic one, but still a place of incarceration. However, after some while, another hearing was held, and he/I was able to convince a judge that there had been a miscarriage of justice. So he/I was set free to reclaim his property. But, he/I said to the judge, I have no money, no clothes, no means of transportation, so no one will believe me. The judge then offered to loan me/him some money, but was clear that it was a loan, not a gift. In the last scene of the dream, he/I is mounted on a horse (black and white one, like a Holstein), wearing a Confederate uniform, and carrying, believe it or not, a shiny sword. Then I woke up.</p>
<p>I cannot interpret this beaut, this honey of a dream.&#0160; It was very cinematic, very vivid, and very long. But it doesn&#39;t apply to my life in any obvious way. I&#39;ve never been accused of insanity, never lost any property, don&#39;t know any corrupt lawyers, never been institutionalized, never even been on a horse, and certainly don&#39;t carry a sword.&#0160; Moreover, it was an undreamlike dream: no fantastic elements or objects morphing into other objects. It seemed less like a dream than like a lost chapter or sub-pot to&#0160;<em>Gone with the Wind</em>. Mighty puzzling.</p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2018/04/contra-tattoos.html">Contra Tattoos</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Here are some reasons, young &#39;uns, why you should steer clear of tattoos.</p>
<p>a) because tattoos are permanent and because taste, your taste, is impermanent and will inevitably change. There&#39;s a poster on the wall of your bedroom that you love. Five years later, you&#39;re indifferent to it, and ten years later, you&#39;ve trashed it. &quot;How could I ever have thought that thing was beautiful?&quot; Same with your taste in all the visual arts. So with the tattoo. You may think t&#39;s beautiful now, perhaps, but ten or twenty years on it has become a permanent definition of your callow taste. Without remedy or the possibility of amelioration. You&#39;re stuck with it.</p>
<p>b) because ink fades and bodies sag. That crisp tattoo is going to bend, distort, twist and fade as your body ages. Face facts: that tattoo is going to become uglier and uglier. Have you caught sight of someone of my age who&#39;s tattooed?&#0160; If you have, you know what I&#39;m talking about; if you haven&#39;t, don&#39;t look. It ain&#39;t pretty.</p>
<p>c)&#0160; tattoos are expensive if they&#39;re done by someone with talent. The cheap ones are horrid. What a waste of money! You could donate the same amount to a useful cause and feel good about yourself.&#0160;</p>
<p>d)&#0160; tattoos hurt in the application; sometimes they become infected.</p>
<p>e)&#0160; because tattoos limit your romantic options. For many a potential partner, that pseudo clever tattoo will be a deal breaker. &quot;You have a tattoo where? There? Right there? Ugh?&quot; And also, don&#39;t tattoo yourself with the name of your present beloved. Consider the divorce rate.</p>
<p>f)&#0160; &#0160;if the tattoo is in plain sight, it will lower your earning power. No problem getting a job as a dishwasher, but perhaps that upscale employer is going to think twice before hiring someone who made such a bad choice. Because the employer doesn&#39;t want to offend potential customers.</p>
<p>g)&#0160; because the Bible tells you so. &quot;Do not cut your bodies for the dead or put tattoo marks on yourselves. I am the LORD” (<em>Leviticus</em> 9:28). Your body is a temple; do not mutilate or desecrate it. And for god&#39;s sake don&#39;t tattoo yourself with religious symbols. To do so is like throwing ashes in the face of the Almighty. The injunction against tattoos is one of the few biblical proscriptions that I can sincerely embrace.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>h) because tattoos are an expression of vanity, like wearing show-off jewelry or expensive designer clothes. Let us take pride in our achievements and not in our shallow foppery.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>j ) because you don&#39;t want to cause me, ME, to look askance or into the air and wrinkle up my nose whenever I meet you.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>What a strange little movie, odd even by amnesia-on-film standards! Film amnesia is the most malleable and flexible of illnesses, as fact free (and fact-averse) as the EPA under Trump.&#0160;</p>
<p>In this modest 1942 adventure, David Talbot, played by William Powell affecting a slight now-you-hear-it-now-you-don&#39;t French accent, is either an amnesia victim or an amnesia scammer. He either was or wasn&#39;t a criminal before the accident in which he apparently lost his memory.</p>
<p>An extortionist-grifter Henri Sarrou, played by Basil Rathbone, who looks like &quot;two profiles glued together,&quot; is trying to squeeze him for a million francs in exchange for not turning him over to the police for a murder that he might or might not have committed in his former life, if he had one.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think I&#39;m giving away any secrets to say that all turns out for the best. But what is interesting, amnesia-wise, is that there is no recovery of memory.&#0160; Talbot&#39;s amnesia never resolves, and he comes to the end of the film with no knowledge of three-quarter of his life. This should-be painful situation doesn&#39;t seem to compromise or concern him the least little bit. Off he goes, at the end, blithely, with his luminous bride Hedy Lamarr, at his side.</p>
<p>There are holes within holes in the plot, but what is most striking, I think, is how casually amnesia is deployed, as if losing one&#39;s memory were no more a challenge to selfhood and identity than a case of sniffles.&#0160;&#0160;</p>

<p><em>Nang yai</em> is an intriguing form of Siamese drama, a shadow play with puppets, which, unfortunately, I have never seen performed -- in fact, never been to Thailand, alas, or anywhere else in that part of the world.</p>
<p>The &quot;puppets&quot; are large, almost three-quarters life-size, made of painted buffalo hide. A story, drawn from the Ramayana, is told by means of songs, chants, music, and dance.&#0160;&quot;Nang Yai&quot;&#0160;simply means &quot;large puppet.&quot; People who have studied Nang Yai have traced performances back to the 1400s. Nang Yai dramas would be performed before a large white cotton screen illuminated from behind by fire -- the puppets supported by bamboo poles.</p>
<p>The puppets themselves, one of which is illustrated above, are magnificent works of art.&#0160;<a class="image" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Thailand-shadow-puppet.jpg"></a>From what I can learn, the tradition of making Nang Yai puppets was almost extinct but has now been revived. Nowadays, and I imagine in the past, the hide of a young ox is bleached and cleaned to get rid of hairs and tissue. Then it is soaked in the juice of the lamphong tree, whatever the heck that is, and also in a tincture of lemon grass, pineapple, and orange, and finally darkened by rubbing with burnt coconut husk. The hide is carved with chisels, hammers, knives, and then painted. Here&#39;s a picture of a particularly complicated puppet.</p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2018/03/worship.html">Words of my Life: "Worship"</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>There are some words which one might study and parse the dictionary definition and yet still not understand -- words for which one has no intuitive or even rational conception. For example, there&#39;s the word &quot;heaven.&quot; I know that &quot;heaven&quot; can mean &quot;sky,&quot; a definition that poses no problem, but when &quot;heaven&quot; is presumed to refer to a place beyond the sky in which the souls of dead people are eternally rewarded, then I&#39;m absolutely baffled. My brain empties out. &quot;Heaven&quot; in such a sense is to me incomprehensible and meaningless nonsense.</p>
<p>Another such word is &quot;worship,&quot; a word which has always puzzled me, right from the start, when the church bells of St Rose of Lima would ring on a Sunday morning to call parishioners to mass, leaving me and my brothers to play stickball or punchball all by ourselves. I recognize that &quot;worship&quot; is a word to which communities of English speakers give assent, and I observe that people attend temples, mosques, and tabernacles to perform certain activities, such as kneeling, genuflecting, singing hymns and uttering hosannas. Nevertheless, I can&#39;t agree that such activities equal &quot;worship&quot; -- because &quot;worship&quot; presupposes that there is an entity to which these activities are directed. And that entity, like &quot;heaven&quot; in the religious sense, doesn&#39;t exist. Just as heaven is a non-existent place, so worship posits a non-existent entity. And therefore the word &quot;worship&quot; has no intelligible meaning, to me.</p>
<p>Perhaps I lack what Charlotte Bronte called an &quot;organ of veneration.&quot; Or, alternatively, worshipers are engaged in mass delusion.&#0160;</p>
<p>On the other hand, I have an excellent grasp of the word &quot;awe.&quot; In fact, I am a great practitioner of awe. I&#39;m regularly &quot;awed&quot; by both the achievements of my fellow beings in art, architecture, music, literature, mathematics and science, and also by the majesty of nature, in the form of grand canyons and in the triumphs of evolution. Moreover, I&#39;ve felt &quot;awe,&quot; in cathedrals and once, in the Church of the Rock in Helsinki -- a magnificent building that melds human ingenuity with natural beauty, -- overwhelming, transcendent awe. &#0160;And I can understand that for some people what I identify as &quot;awe&quot; might translate into &quot;worship.&quot; &#0160;But again, not me. Though I&#39;m awed by Rembrandt and Bach, but I don&#39;t worship them or their works. I&#39;ll stick with awe.</p>
<p>I may lack an &quot;organ of veneration,&quot; but I have a highly developed organ of wonderment.</p>
<p>Update on &quot;worship.&quot; &#0160;For the first time in my life, a few weeks ago, I attended a religious service. I was in New Orleans and friends suggested that I join them at Vespers at Trinity Episcopal Church on Jackson Avenue. The attraction was Ellis Marsalis, who was to play a few notes for the attendees. A priest or whatever he&#39;s called, said a few words, read a prayer, and then elderly, frail Mr. Marsalis sat down at the piano and improvised for a few minutes. It was beautiful and perhaps transcendent. I suppose it was a form of worship. And it didn&#39;t hurt a bit.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Many a restaurant in New Orleans; and many visited by us during our latest stay.</p>
<p>Two divergent experiences. &#0160;Shaya, and Venezia.</p>
<p>Shaya:</p>
<div class="photo"><img alt="Shaya, New Orleans, LA" height="386" large-data-url="https://resizer.otstatic.com/v2/photos/large/23751171.jpg" onerror="error()" src="https://resizer.otstatic.com/v2/photos/large/23751171.jpg" title="Shaya, New Orleans, LA" width="386" /></div>
<p>Slick, elegant, ultra-modern, carefully designed. Waitpersons stylishly costumed and coiffed. Well-trained. Reservations mandatory. Customers: jacketed and tied, or on high heels. Price: whole wallet.</p>
<p>The place to go if you&#39;re looking for wood roasted Brussels sprouts with black harissa, tahini and sumac pickled onions. Or ikra made with paddlefish caviar and shallots. Or if you want your crispy halloumi with strawberries, mint and pistachio. Perhaps shakshoula made of tomato, Jerusalem artichokes, poached egg, chilies and chermoula. The roasted chicken is cooked with shawarma spices, heirloom carrots, and chickpea mujadara. Etc. Very enjoyable experience.</p>
<div class="menu-item f42dd212">
<div class="menu-item-title">Then there&#39;s Venezia. Not pronounced ven-ets-ia after the Italian style, but ven-ezh-a by local custom. Red-and-white checked tablecloths. Families, large and extended. Waitresses as wide as tall who call you &quot;honey&quot; or &quot;dearie.&quot; &#0160;Sausages, peppers, spaghetti with tomato sauce, shellfish. Excellent pizza. Sorry, no picture available on website. No website, actually. And, added bonus, Venezia is just down the street from famous historic Angelo Brocato (ice cream and pastries).</div>
<div class="menu-item-title">&#0160;</div>
<div class="menu-item-title">Guess at which restaurant I felt more at home.</div>
<div class="menu-item-title">&#0160;</div>
<div class="menu-item-title">New Orleans is a high contrast city where the Whole Foods sits directly adjacent to the Dollar General. Honest.</div>

<p>Dear Asher, Caleb, Luke, Lola, Ella, Oliver, Talia:</p>
<p>These are pictures of your great-great-great-grandparents, Leib or Louis Hessel and Tsina Voloshen Hessel. They are the parents of Eta or Yetta Hessel, who married Isaiah Pearlman, your great-great grandfather, in StaryConstantine, Ukraine, sometime around 1895. I knew Eta, who died in 1962 when I was in my early &#39;twenties, although our conversations were limited because we did not share a common language. &#0160;According to my father, these pictures are copies of drawings executed by an itinerant Ukrainian artist. Drawn when? Perhaps 1870 or thereabouts.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know much about these people. I have no idea what they did for a living or how long they lived. I see some family resemblance in Leib&#39;s small black eyes and abbreviated eyebrows, but otherwise, not much. What sort of hat is he wearing? Is Tsina wearing the wig of the orthodox or is that her real hair?&#0160;</p>
<p>He looks mild. &#0160;She looks determined.</p>
<p>I know that my grandmother Eta had a number of siblings. In my father&#39;s handwriting, I have a document that hints of two of them: a brother, Morris Hessel, who married Mary Greenberg and had a son, Paul and a grandson Merel; &#0160;and then a sister Malka, who married one Joseph Cohen and had a son, Saris, who was a high school principal in New York, and had a son Peter Cohen, a physician based in Denver. I wonder why my father kept so aloof from his aunts and uncles and cousins? Was there a story? They were not at all a part of our life. No visits, no family celebrations, nothing.</p>
<p>I once met my father&#39;s &quot;Aunt Mary,&quot; who sold tickets at the Kent Theater on Coney Island Avenue. it must have been the only time I went to a movie with my father; he said, &quot;This is my Aunt Mary.&quot; &#0160;I was perhaps 8 years old, and uncurious. That&#39;s the end of the story. I wish I had more to tell you.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Numerous European websites are reporting that Barron Trump, the 12-year-old son of United States President Donald J. Trump, has been betrothed to Katerina Kabaeva, the 11-year-old daughter of Vladimir Putin and &quot;first mistress&quot; Alina Kabaeva. &#0160;</p>
<p>White House spokesman Sarah Huckabee Sanders refused to comment on the report. But another member of the Trump administration, who spoke under the condition that his name not be revealed, said that, &quot;if the story is true, then it&#39;s a significant diplomatic coup for the United States and for the Trumps. &#0160;It would allow two great families, one Russian and one American, to link their fortunes. It&#39;s a significant step forward for Russian-American diplomatic relations. It could be the making of a dynasty.&quot;</p>
<p>It has also been reported that the betrothal agreement, negotiated by Trump lawyer Michael Cohen and former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, calls for the transfer of somewhat more than a billion dollars from the Russian bank&#0160;Vnesheconombank, or VEB, also known &#0160;as &quot;Putin&#39;s bank,&quot; to Trump Industries. VEB has previously been known to be an important investor in Trump properties. &#0160;What the Trump family offered in exchange is as yet unknown.&#0160;</p>
<p>The rumor that the spelling of &quot;Barron&quot; Trump&#39;s name has been changed to &quot;Baron&quot; Trump has not been confirmed.</p>
<p>A date for the wedding has not been announced.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>A few days ago Vivian de St. Vrain aka Dr. Metablog began his last year as a septuagenarian. His next birthday, 80. Astonishing. Unbelievable. And kind of miraculous.</p>
<p>When I was boy, I thought that people of such an advanced age were very likely extra-terrestrials or possibly members of another species. I remember my ancient ancestors and relations as very small people, odd-smelling (chicken soup and mothballs), whose faces were covered with knobs, whelks and unsightly dark spots. As a group, they appeared to my youthful eyes as swollen, distorted, asymmetrical. &#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>But now, at this present age, I don&#39;t feel even the slightest bit extra-galactic. I feel like me. Except, of course, when I catch sight of my reflection in a shop window as I stroll the mall. Who is that white-haired guy?</p>
<p>Here&#39;s my status report at age 79. I&#39;m healthy. All my organs might work a little slower, a little grumpier about doing their jobs, but none of them has crapped out completely. My joints are relatively supple, especially my knees. I have great knees. I experience muscle pains and muscle spasms occasionally, and my back is bad, but it&#39;s better than it was a decade or two ago, thanks to the surgery. I tire more easily and recover from fatigue more slowly. My memory is not as sharp as heretofore, but it&#39;s still pretty good, better than most. I&#39;m learning a new language and I admit that I have to look up new words two or three times before they stick. Sometimes four or five times, truth be told. My capacity for abstract thinking, never strong, has definitely diminished, but my sense of humor is intact.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not taking any medicines, except for an occasional sleeping pill. The bifocals and the lens implants are working just fine. So are the hearing aids. And the tooth implant is still firmly in place. The rest of me, I&#39;m proud to say, is all original equipment.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.2em;">On the whole, I&#39;d say that I&#39;ve come through some dark times and that I&#39;m enjoying a personal renaissance. How long will it last? Impossible to predict. A day, a year, ten years? &#0160;But hey, I have love in my life. Children who are thriving. Lovely grandchildren.</span></p>
<p>I must acknowledge that at my age I could be growing something deadly and that the least little twinge could be an early sign of a fatal disease.&#0160;And although nothing of that kind has happened yet, it&#39;s inevitable that something will happen. Life is term-limited and I&#39;ve lost too many friends and relations to deny the obvious. I&#39;m acutely aware that each day is precious.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>The White House announced today that &quot;naming rights&quot; to stretches of the Trump Wall across the southern U. S. border are up for sale.</p>
<p>Portions have been pre-sold. Among the corporations that will have their names in neon on the wall are Chick-Fil-A and Hobby Lobby. The largest single stretch has been claimed by Koch Industries, Inc. Together with its subsidiaries Invista, Georgia-Pacific, Molex, Flint Hills Resources, Koch Pipeline, Koch Fertilizer, Koch Minerals, Matador Cattle, and Guardian Industries, Koch will place signs on almost six hundred miles of wall. It is rumored that the National Rifle Association has contracted to name a large portion of the Texas barrier.</p>
<p>The White House did not say how much the corporations paid for the naming rights. &#0160;Charles Koch, in a rare interview, asserted that the cost was &quot;a good buy. &#0160;But it&#39;s not about money,&quot; he added, &quot;it&#39;s about patriotism.&quot;</p>
<p>Trump Industries has also claimed a few choices miles of the wall but has yet to make a payment.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>United Airlines has announced that starting March 1, passengers will be charged for the use of on-board toilet facilities. &quot;Charges will be nominal,&quot; according to United spokesperson Alma Santistevan, &quot;just five dollars for the first five minutes and two dollars for every subsequent minute, but passengers must remember to bring their credit cards with them to the facility.&quot;</p>
<p>Toilets are now being equipped with card-operated locks but passengers may still use the facilities for free until the end of the month.</p>
<p>Last year, United carried 95,611,500 passengers. &quot;Even if each passenger uses the facilities just once a trip, we are looking at half a billion dollars of additional revenue with very little capital expense,&quot; explained Santistevan. &quot;Stockholders will be very very pleased.&quot;</p>
<p>United is considering additional charges for toilet paper and for paper hand towels. Barf bags will also require a small fee.</p>
<p>Other airlines are expected to follow suit.</p>
<p>United CEO Scott Brandon was asked if he anticipated passenger resistance. &quot;There will be some grumbling at first,&quot; he replied, &quot;but passengers will get used to it. After all, they&#39;ve accepted smaller seats, charges for water, rude service, unpredictable bumping, huge fees for cancellations and plane changes, luggage surcharges, pets stuffed into overhead bins and suffocated, as well as the occasional person dragged from his seat screaming. Besides, what choice do they have? They&#39;ve got to piss.&quot;</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<div class="original-line">Shakespeare took a few shots at depicting a hellish afterlife.&#0160;</div>
<div class="original-line">&#0160;</div>
<div class="original-line">The most extended, if I remember correctly, belongs to Claudio in&#0160;<em>Measure for Measure</em>. &quot;To die, and go we know not where;/ To lie in cold obstruction and to rot;/ This sensible warm motion to become/ A kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit/ To bathe in fiery floods,/ Or to reside in thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice;/ To be imprisoned in the viewless winds,/ And blown with restless violence round about/ The pendent world; or to be worse than worst/ Of those that lawless and incertain thought/ Imagine howling: tis too horrible.&quot; It&#39;s a damned scary vision, and mostly easy to understand, though it helps to be reminded that sensible = having sense, &quot;delighted&quot; = darkened, &quot;thrilling&quot;= piercing, &quot;viewless&quot; = blind, and that &quot;lawless and incertain thought&quot; refers to non-Christian speculation. Shakespeare gives Claudio a number of choices for eternal suffering, each one worse than the other.&#0160;&#0160;</div>
<div class="original-line">&#0160;</div>
<div class="original-line">When Othello realizes that Desdemona was innocent after all, he foresees a one-dimensional hot hell, one in which devils will&#0160;&quot;Blow me about in winds, roast me in sulfur/&#0160;Wash me in steep-down gulfs of liquid fire.&quot; Clear enough, painful enough.</div>
<div class="original-line">&#0160;</div>
<div class="original-line">And finally, Lear imagines himself &quot;Bound upon a wheel of fire,/ That mine own tears to scald like molten lead.&quot;&#0160;</div>
<div class="original-line">&#0160;</div>
<div class="original-line">I think the whole afterlife thing is a fraud, but if there were a hell, here&#39;s what mine would be like.</div>
<div class="original-line">&#0160;</div>
<div class="original-line">I&#39;m on a commercial flight, steerage class, cramped into a seat too narrow and lacking adequate leg room. A middle seat. On my left is a very large gentleman whose massive shoulders and thighs encroach upon my territory. He stinks of tobacco. He drinks too much alcohol and tries to engage me in conversation. On my right is a similarly-proportioned lady who reeks of cheap perfume and who glares at me whenever my bony elbow makes contact with her fat forearm. I&#39;m hungry and all there is to eat are some horrid plastic pretzels in a bag that only a safecracker could open. A scruffy fourteen-year-old boy sits behind me. Rap &quot;music&quot; leaks from his earbuds and he kicks the back of my seat at irregular intervals. My only reading matter is a airline magazine that advertises expensive gimcrack novelties that no sensible human would ever dream of buying. My bladder is distended and painful but the seat-belt sign is perpetually lit. This plane never lands. Sometimes it threatens to do so, but at the last moment it&#39;s diverted to another airport.</div>
<div class="original-line">&#0160;</div>
<div class="original-line">This continues throughout all eternity.</div>
<div class="original-line">&#0160;</div>
<div class="original-line">And it is much worse than vats of liquid fire. Far worse than anything that Shakespeare could possibly have imagined.</div>

				<p>Donald Trump has taken credit for the rise in the stock market. &quot;The stock market hit yet another record high yesterday. There is great confidence in the moves that my Administration is making.” If he is responsible for the rise, then surely he is also responsible for the fall. It can be no accident, and can only be a signal from the other world, that Trump&#39;s market fell exactly 666 points last Friday. One trillion of market value was erased with the wave of the supernatural wand. Six hundred and sixty- six is &quot;the number of the beast&quot; in <em>Revelation.</em>&#0160;Inasmuch as everything happens for a reason, we must ask what the Lord is telling us. The 666 point drop undeniably demonstrates that DT is &quot;the man of sin&quot; who &quot;opposes and exalts himself above every god or object of worship&quot;&#0160;(<cite>2 Thessalonians 2:1). </cite><span style="line-height: 1.2em;">He is the false god who has erected his tower at 666 Fifth Avenue. Heed, O supporters of Trump, the words and acts of the Lord, for the man of the flaming hair is the egg of the serpent, the false prophet, the anti-Christ.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.2em;"> No possible probable manner of doubt.</span></p>

No chicken or lamb chops, but lots of tongue.&#0160;(When I left home, I vowed never to eat tongue again, and, trust me, I&#39;ve kept the faith.)

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="308" data-total-count="1826">If I&#39;ve offended anyone, I&#39;m really sorry. I didn&#39;t mean to; I have tremendous respect for pretty and desirable women. 10s, all of them. So let me just start by saying that many years ago, decades or centuries I can&#39;t remember exactly when, I had a thunderous crush on Io. She claims that she signaled me that she wasn&#39;t interested, but I did not stop. You know, when you&#39;re a god, they let you do it. You can do anything. It was probably a mistake to have turned her into a heifer but I think she enjoyed it then -- even if she complains about it now. Same thing with Leda; it&#39;s possible that I misinterpreted her but I honestly thought that her &quot;no&quot; meant &quot;maybe&quot; or &quot;yes,&quot; so I turned myself into a swan and grabbed her by the pussy. Maybe I should have backed off, especially since she had already spent that same night with her husband Tyndareus, who had, as everyone knows, very small hands, if you know what I mean. It&#39;s good to be a god. And then there was Semele. I mean, she was one of my very own priestesses, and I realize now that your own priestesses ought to be off limits. But she provoked me by bathing nude in the river Asopus. And I happened to be flying by in the shape of an eagle. What happened, happened. It was definitely wrong of her to ask to look at me face to face and I regret that I incinerated her, but it wasn&#39;t my fault. Europa was also an error, but she should have known better than to come near to me when I&#39;m in the shape of a white bull. And the same with Taygete who came to me as a doe with golden horns. I couldn&#39;t stop myself. I&#39;ve always had a thing for golden horns, though I think Pindar made a bit too much of it. And then there was Dia, who happened by, so she says, when I was in the shape of a stallion. What can you expect of a stallion? Alcmene, that&#39;s another story. She was tall and beautiful, with eyes that reminded me of Aphrodite. I definitely wanted her. I had to disguise myself as her husband Amphitryon to make love to her. Maybe it was wrong to do so, but I don&#39;t think she ever figured out what actually happened, which kind of excuses me. And then there was my adventure with Antiope, where I disguised myself as a satyr; and once you&#39;re a satyr well, you know, a satyr does what a satyr does. To seduce Callisto, I had to transform myself into Artemis, which sounds a little like girl-on-girl action, but it really wasn&#39;t because it was me. Come to think of it, I can&#39;t remember exactly how we did it. And also: I blame Acrisius for shutting up his daughter Danae in a bronze tower. I took it as a deliberate provocation. I had to sneak through an air vent to impregnate Danae in the form of a shower of golden rain, which, I have to tell you, wasn&#39;t entirely satisfying and just a little bit kinky.</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="308" data-total-count="1826">But what can I say? &#0160;I don&#39;t want to play the victim, because, after all, I am a god, but I had a hard childhood, what with my father castrating my grandfather and then me being suckled by the goat Amalthea. You get off to a bad start when you&#39;re suckled by a goat.&#0160;</p>

				<p>I am totally in love with a bit of dialogue in <em>Dog Day Afternoon </em>(1975), the great Sidney Lumet social drama/comedy/crime film.</p>
<p>Sonny&#39;s plan to finance his wife Leon &#39;s sex change operation by robbing a bank has run aground. In exchange for freeing his hostages, Sonny wants a plane to take him to a foreign country. He asks his not-so-brilliant friend/co-conspirator Sal to what country he would want to travel. Sal cogitates for a while, then suggests, &quot;Wyoming.&quot; &#0160;After a pause, Sonny replies, &quot;Sal, Wyoming&#39;s not a country.&quot; The exchange (by John Cazale as Sal and Al Pacino as Sonny) is delivered magnificently -- Cazale with blank-faced understated sincerity, Pacino with tempered exasperation.</p>
<p>&quot;Wyoming&quot; was not in the script (nor in the essay from which the script was drawn) but was improvised by Cazale. A moment of pure genius.</p>
<p>If you haven&#39;t seen the film, run -- not walk -- to your nearest TV. &#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>It wasn&#39;t until I reached college that I discovered poetry. My comic-book, super-hero and baseball-infused brain was until then, poetry-wise, an almost complete tabula rasa; I say &quot;almost&quot; because at eight or nine eight years old I had already memorized two great classics of American literature: &quot;Casey at the Bat&quot; and also the poem by Grantland Rice about Tinkers, Evers, and Chance. In addition, I knew the ubiquitous stercoraceous distich the first line of which is &quot;Here I sit, broken-hearted&quot; and a related gnomic verse that begins, &quot;No matter how much you wiggle and dance.&quot; Then in 1956 I left Flatbush for higher education and enrolled in a course in English Literature. The rest, as they say, is history. It was love sonnets and rich luscious liquid poems by Marlowe and Keats and Hopkins that entranced me. The more intellectual poems were too taxing for my immature head. <em style="line-height: 1.2em; font-size: small;">Lycidas</em><span style="line-height: 1.2em; font-size: small;">, which I now can acknowledge to be the finest poem in&#0160;the language, was utterly impenetrable for at least a decade, although I immediately&#0160;responded to its music:&#0160;&quot;With nectar pure&#0160;his oozy locks he laves.&quot;&#0160;</span></p>
<div class="entry-content">
<div class="entry-body">
<p>One of my teachers sagely observed that certain poets and certain poems were for youth, some for maturity, and some for old age. &quot;You may no longer like then what you like now.&quot; Which has come to pass. As an example of poetry for the latter years, he adduced Tennyson&#39;s &quot;Ulysses.&quot; &quot;This poem may not mean much to you now, but it will some day, if you live long enough.&quot; I remember that I was much taken with the touchstone line &quot;Far on the ringing plains of windy Troy&quot; but I thought that &quot;Ulysses&quot; was too much about a really old guy trying to cheer himself up and I did not see it holding a place in any future that I could envision.&#0160;</p>
<p>Well, folks, I&#39;ve now arrived at the so-called golden years, or, more properly, the endgame, or extra innings (which in some sports is called&#0160;sudden death) and guess what? &#0160;&quot;Ulysses&quot; has returned,&#0160;front and center,&#0160;exactly as was predicted 50+ years ago.&#0160;It&#39;s right on target.&#0160;</p>
<p>Tennyson&#39;s Ulysses is Homer&#39;s adventurer a generation older, kinging it in Ithaca, but bored, unchallenged, and unstimulated.&#0160;&quot;It little profits that an idle king,/ By this still hearth, among these barren crags,/ Matched with an aged wife, I mete and dole/ Unequal laws unto a savage race,/ That hoard and sleep, and feed,/ And know not me.&quot;</p>
<p>To put it vulgarly, Ulysses plans to bust out of the home for old kings. He&#39;s been a warrior, a hero, and a roving explorer. He &quot;cannot rest from travel.&quot; He needs to search &quot;beyond the utmost bound of human thought.&quot; He leaves Penelope, and he resigns the government of Ithaca to his bureaucratically-minded son Telemachus. The last lines of the poem, the leave-taking, are most stirring: &#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Come, my friends</p>
<p>&quot;Tis not too late to seek a newer world.</p>
<p>Push off, and sitting well in order smite</p>
<p>The sounding furrows;&#0160;for my purpose holds</p>
<p>To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths</p>
<p>Of all the western stars, until I die.</p>
<p>It may be that the gulfs will wash us down:</p>
<p>It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles,</p>
<p>And see the great Achilles, whom we knew.</p>
<p>Though much is taken, much abides,</p>
<p>And though we are not now that strength which in old days</p>
<p>Moved earth and heaven, that&#0160;which we are, we are;</p>
<p>One equal temper of heroic hearts&#0160;</p>
<p>Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will</p>
<p>To strive to seek, to find, and not to yield.</p>
<p>Yes, I know -- the diction is a little antiquated and artificial, the urge to get away a trifle too vehement. But nevertheless, I&#39;m moved by the resilience, the perseverance. Though tear-inducing, the poem is anything but lachrymose. And it&#39;s accepting: &quot;that which we are, we are.&quot;</p>
<p>It has lately become the fashion to interpret &quot;Ulysses&quot; as a poem about capitalism and imperialism. In this reading, Ulysses is just another white male, off to conquer and colonize The Alien Other. Or to see it as a poem about male privilege: he&#39;s a bad husband, abandoning the family. Or to conceive the poem as a structure of ironies, in which Ulysses doesn&#39;t realize that he undermines his own suppositions. There&#39;s a tad of truth in these arguments, as there always is, because Tennyson was caught up in a Victorian striving that he didn&#39;t fully or consciously assimilate. But frankly, I feel sorry for readers who can&#39;t hear the verve and excitement in Ulysses&#39;s expansive view of things.&#0160;</p>
<p>Moreover, it turns out that Tennyson was absolutely correct to proclaim that there is a time in life when &quot;not to yield&quot; is an act of daily heroism.</p>
