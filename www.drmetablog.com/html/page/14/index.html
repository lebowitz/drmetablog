		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Dear Talia, Oliver, Ella, Lola, Luke, Caleb, Asher:</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef01b7c94423d8970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Menucah Pearlman" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef01b7c94423d8970b img-responsive" height="299" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef01b7c94423d8970b-800wi" title="Menucah Pearlman" width="224" /></a></p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>This is a picture of my father&#39;s grandmother (that is, my great-grandmother and therefore your great-great-great grandmother) whom I can now identify as Menucha Sheindl Perelman (born Rabinovich) who died in 1908 at the age of 75 or thereabouts. She was born in the shtetl of Radomyshyl and married Yaakov Perelman of Old Constantine in western Ukraine. Menucha is reported to have had 18 children including many twins. Seven daughters and three sons survived to adulthood. The four daughters whose names are known were Rochel Lerner, Reizel Shposhnik, Miriam, and Chaya-Beila, who married Schmul Spector (I remember now that my father had a cousin named Julian Spector). Her sons were Isaiah or Buzya my grandfather, then Chaim, and Meshulam.</p>
<p>My father told once told me story that seems incredible. He said that he had a grandmother in the Ukraine who came from a large family. He said that she had ten children but that all of them died in a week during a cholera epidemic. Then they had five more children. Or perhaps there were five children who died in the epidemic and then they had ten more. Both stories are hard to believe. &#0160;</p>
<p>What would it be like to lose five or ten children in a week? How could anyone ever recover from the grief? &#0160;How could you live? &#0160;It&#39;s possible that this story attaches to Menucha Sheindl Perelman, who lost at least eight children. But it might also be a Hessel story (i.e. my father&#39;s mother&#39;s side of the family, not his father&#39;s).&#0160;</p>
<p>Provenance: &#0160;I have no idea how this picture came into my possession. It&#39;s a drawing, not a photograph. A copy of a drawing, to be more precise, not the original. My father told me that it was done by an itinerant Ukrainian artist (apparently a pre-photography custom). I wish that I could say more about Menucha&#39;s costume, especially the scarf. Is it traditional garb? Or about her very dark hair, which might be a <em>sheitel, </em>the wig worn by the orthodox.</p>
<p>Is it possible -- is it truly the case that the woman pictured above bore eighteen children? &#0160;And Inasmuch as your direct ancestor Isaiah was child number sixteen, if she had said to her husband Yaakov, after birthing number fifteen, &quot;I&#39;m done, Yaakov, no more children&quot; -- which would have been a perfectly understandable sentiment -- then it&#39;s obvious that none of us would exist. &#0160;</p>
<p>Other news of your old country ancestors: &#0160;<a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2018/01/constantine.html">here, </a>&#0160;<a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2017/12/lodz.html ">here,</a> and&#0160;<a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2016/01/sonia-green-with-an-addition.html ">here.</a></p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2018/01/godless.html">Small Screen Godlessness</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>We binge-watched the seven-hour mini-series <em>Godless</em> in three marathon nights.</p>
<p><em>Godless</em> is a Western, or more exactly a fantasia on Western-movie themes and incidents. To the genre-literate, almost every plot element or character will be familiar, but shootouts and jail breaks and horse-rustling and miraculously healing bullet wounds were re-combined in ways that kept our attention. I&#39;m proud to say that I didn&#39;t fall asleep once during the three long evenings, which is quite a compliment to the series, inasmuch as I&#39;ve recently emerged as an Olympic-quality narcolept, prone to drift into sleep at the drop of a hat, even during the second overtime. &#0160;</p>
<p>The three most interesting features of <em>Godless</em>, were, in my opinion, a) the landscape, which, although it surrounds us here in Boulder, seemed particularly crisp on the hi def screen, b) the horses, which are noble beasts of their own and were respectfully depicted and admired by the cinematographer, and c) the character of MaryAgnes, played by Merit Wever, who was rather wonderful in the role and who was rewarded with a lot of the good lines. MaryAgnes is a tough young rifle-toting crack shot who plays for the other team but who you want on your side. &#0160;</p>
<p>I thought that Jeff Daniels who played the ruthless mass-murderer Frank Griffin overacted like crazy. If overacting were a crime, he&#39;d be looking at a good twenty years in solitary. Plus I know it&#39;s the fashion that your deranged evil charismatic lunatic villain always has to be a bible thumper yet let&#39;s face it -- that&#39;s a cliche that has served its purpose and earned its retirement. Speaking of religion -- even aside from the title of the series and the observation that it&#39;s a godless country there&#39;s a heck of a lot of religion stuff both good and bad but mostly bad in this series. For example, much of the backstory evokes the Mountain Meadow Massacre -- one of the most dreadful acts of domestic terrorism in our nation&#39;s history -- which was perpetrated by Mormons (although Mormon participation is underplayed and instead the atrocity is attributed to a nonspecific religious fanaticism). There are frequent scenes of worship and pilgrimage as well as intermittent focus on the new church that the villagers of LaBelle are constructing and specifically on the fashioning of a substantial cross that is photographed as though it were brimming with significance. Moreover, the inhabitants of LaBelle wait six and seven-eighths episodes for the new preacher to arrive but when he finally appears he has only the most banal platitudes to deliver. Frankly, I&#39;m not positive whether the writer of <em>Godless</em> thought the preacher&#39;s speech was genuinely profound or whether he couldn&#39;t give him better words, or whether he was trying to assert that the pieties of faith offered no consolation whatever to the beat-up townspeople. It would have been better if the preacher had just sung an appropriate hymn and let the LaBelleians join in so we could at least end with good music.</p>
<p><em>Godless&#0160;</em>offers a number of revisionist moments where tradition is overturned, sometimes too obviously. An instance: LaBelle is inhabited almost entirely by women and it is the women who make the decisions and take the active roles; men are passive bystanders. Quite an inversion of the usual macho practice. And also:&#0160;usually in the westerns when there&#39;s the threat of intermarriage between the races, it&#39;s the dark skin who gets killed. This time the commonplace was turned on its head with the gratuitous killing of he white guy -- but I think it was a bit too pointed to name him &quot;Whitey.&quot; And the Indians: now that we have the word &quot;orientalism&quot; to describe the mythologizing and falsifying of people of the east, we could apply the word &quot;Indianism&quot; to the romanticizing of the Paiutes, who are depicted as repositories of supernatural mystery and tribal wisdom (which is I suppose is a step up from brutal savages, but still not respectful or true). &quot;Indianism&quot; leads to a grotesque failure in the story when the sheriff is accompanied by a lone brave on horseback who may or may not be a ghost and who should have thudded to the cutting-room floor (along with some faux-spiritual nonsense, totally out of place, about the sheriff losing and regaining his shadow).&#0160;</p>
<p>The series centered on the conflict between father and adopted son -- a borrowing straight out of <em>Red River</em>, but this time around there&#39;s not going to be a reconciliation. The allegorically-named son Roy Goode winds up shooting his father, up close, pistol to temple. Which I liked a lot, because, first of all, I was by this time totally inured to violence, and also because the evil addled father-villain-prophet repeatedly claimed the ability to foresee his own death and &quot;this isn&#39;t it.&quot; &quot;You&#39;re wrong,&quot; says Goode, pulling the trigger. So much for prophecy. Immediately afterwards, the hero rides alone into the sunset -- not into a metaphorical sunset but a very real and carefully photographed sunset -- even though if he had his wits about him he would take his more-than-a-match lady friend with him. It&#39;s a unsatisfying conclusion and one that is dictated, I think, more by the zillion Saturday afternoon Westerns of my childhood than by the internal logic of the film. She loves him. But Western heroes named Goode just plain love their horses more than hearth, home and sex and they are all secretly afraid that if they marry and allow themselves to become domesticated they&#39;ll wind up like poor uxorious powerless Van Heflin in <em>Shane</em>.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Unlike most sciences, where there are numerous pseudo-Greek or pseudo-Latin coinages, geology offers all sorts picturesque and lovely words that have been in the language for years &#0160;-- and are novel to me. So &quot;graywacke&quot; --a muddy sandstone containing particles of quartz&quot;; &quot;fumarole&quot; -- a small vent emitting jets of steam; &quot;sinter&quot; &#0160;-- a crust of calcium carbonate; &quot;molfette&quot; -- a vent emitting gases such as carbon dioxide; &quot;coquina&quot; -- a cemented mass of debris of shells; &quot;clint&quot; -- a sharp ridge; &quot;grike&quot; -- a fissure or crack opened by dissolving limestone; &quot;knickpoint&quot; -- a sharp step, up or down, in a river; &quot;gour&quot; -- a calcite ridge formed when water rich in carbonate flows over an irregular surface; &quot;drumlin&quot; -- an isolated mountain; &quot;nunatak&quot; -- a projecting peak in land otherwise covered by ice; &#0160;&quot;firn&quot;-- a mass of ice pellets compacted by the weight of snow above; &#0160;&quot;cwm&quot; -- a steep rock basin; &#0160;&quot;col&quot; -- a narrow pass; &quot;esker&quot; -- a winding ridge formed by retreating glaciers; &quot;pingo&quot; -- a cone, dome &#0160;or hump caused when freezing water expands beneath the permafrost and pushes up the earth; &quot;yardang&quot; -- parallel ridges of hard rock.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not convinced that I could recognize any of these phenomena of my own accord. I&#39;d probably need a professional geologist or guide. But the words themselves sure are magnificent. &#0160;And this is just a small sample of the wordhoard.&#0160;</p>

				<p>Dear grandchildren:</p>
<p>I once asked my father, your great-grandfather Emanuel Pearlman, where in the Ukraine we originated. He said that he was told that it was a village called (and here he used a very deep guttural initial consonant) Xhosantin-gebernya &#0160;-- an answer that left me not much enlightened. If he knew more -- and I don&#39;t think he did -- he didn&#39;t say. Our family did not cultivate nostalgia for the old country. Nor much curiosity either. We had no reason to yearn.</p>
<p>But new information about our past has recently come to me. According to a correspondence between my late cousin Marion and a distant Israeli relative, it is now clear that our family hails from the the town of StaryConstantine -- also called Starokostiantiyniv in Ukrainian and Alt Konstantine in Yiddish. It was a small city of perhaps 30,000 people at its height, founded, as far as wikipedia and I can figure, in the sixteenth century by a noble or wealthy person named Konstanty Ostrogski who built himself a castle sometime during the 1560s. Castles are built for protection in lawless places, but then, most places were lawless in late medieval Europe. Old Constantine is in northern Ukraine at the junction of the Ikopot and Sluch rivers. Here&#39;s a picture of the Old Constantine castle across from the Sluch: &#0160;&#0160;</p>

<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>But when, you ask, did your and my ancestors settle in Old Constantine? &#0160;I remember it mentioned when I was a child that our family came to the Ukraine from &quot;the west&quot;, which I assumed to be Germany because my grandmother Eta&#39;s maiden name was Hessel (though in fact Hessel is more commonly Danish rather than German). The Jewish community in Old Constantine dates to the sixteenth century, it is reported. &quot;The town’s Jews suffered Cossack onslaughts during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. At the end of the nineteenth century, more than half of the town’s population was Jewish.&quot; That&#39;s all we know.</p>
<p>However, in the nineteenth century, there lived in Old Constantine a husband and wife named Yaakov and Menucha Sheindl Perelman. They dwelt in a house on the corner of Ragnedinshkaya and Bolshaya Vasikovshaya streets (a house which was destroyed during the second world war). Yaakov Mikolshtein Perelman was born about 1830, lived a long life, and died in about 1920. According to the story, he resided in the one house his entire life. His wife, Menucha Sheindl came from Radomyshyl, a village not far from Old Constantine that was historically a center of Jewish settlement. (In 1797 a total of 1,424 people or 80% of the total population were Jewish). Menucha Sheindl Perelman was the daughter of a sugar and wool merchant named Solomon Rabinovich, who was so rich that &quot;they changed houses for Passover&quot; -- which is a custom heretofore unknown to me. Menucha died in 1908 at age 75 or thereabouts. The family, once wealthy, lost everything in the 1917 revolution and the disorder and purges that followed. &#0160;</p>
<p>And how are Yaakov and Menucha related to you, my grandchildren? &#0160;Well, they&#39;re your great-great-great grandparents. According to the newly discovered information, they had eighteen children &quot;mostly twins,&quot; of whom only nine survived to adulthood. Seven daughters were born before your great-great grandfather Isaiah (also called Buzya or Buzzy) saw the light. Isaiah it is reported, was born &quot;the year the serfs were freed,&quot; which is 1861, but I know that he was 83 when he died in 1946, so I calculate that he was born in 1863. But perhaps Isaiah didn&#39;t know his own age which wouldn&#39;t have been unusual in an era of bad record keeping. When he was thirty-five, Isaiah emigrated to America, arriving in 1896 or thereabouts.</p>
<p>Why did he set out for the New World? &#0160;Certainly the troubled conditions in Old Constantine were reason enough. But there&#39;s also something of a story. Isaiah married (I don&#39;t know whom) but after one night of marriage he asked for a divorce. I don&#39;t know if the divorce was granted, but I do know that very soon afterward he left town with Eta (or Yetta) Hessel, also from Old Constantine. She was 23 or 24, a decade or a dozen years younger than he.&#0160;</p>
<p>Why the one-day marriage? &#0160;No one knows what happened that night, but it couldn&#39;t have been good. A sexual impediment? &#0160;An arranged marriage gone bad? &#0160;Prior misdeeds come to light?&#0160; The discovery of pregnancy?&#0160; We&#39;re free to speculate, but never to know.&#0160;</p>
<p>However, we do know that Isaiah and his father did not see the world with the same eyes. Yaakov was religious; his son Isaiah was an atheist. We don&#39;t know Yaakov&#39;s politics, but we know that Isaiah was some sort of leftist or communist. Something of a free-thinker, after the style of Moses Mendelssohn. And perhaps Karl Marx. And we can also guess that it might have been impossible to remain in Old Constantine after the marriage contretemps.&#0160;</p>
<p>In New York City, Isaiah and Yetta had four children: Max, born around 1896, Solomon, born about 1898; Mollie, born in 1900; and my father Emanuel, the youngest, born on December 22, 1904.</p>
<p>My grandfather Isaiah also had two younger brothers. There was Chaim, who followed him to America some years later and from whose daughter Rose spring the Goldberg and Chodosh lines. And also Isaiah&#39;s youngest brother, who was named Meshulam Zusi Perelman. He did not follow his older brothers, and I don&#39;t know his history, but his family left the Ukraine and it&#39;s his Israeli granddaughter Nechama Sheindl Brukman (born Perlman) through whom these facts were recovered. Nechama Brukman died in 2008 at age 86.</p>
<p>It is most melancholy to read that in 1939 there were 6,743 Jews living in Old Constantine, accounting for 31 percent of the total population, and that the entire Jewish community, some no doubt our cousins, were murdered during the first years of the war.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>The person with whom I share a bed reported that last night, following some incomprehensible mutterings, I sleep talked, clear as a bell, the sentence fragment &quot;four ones, which I interpret as eleven hundred and eleven.&quot; &#0160;</p>
<p>I have absolutely no remembrance of saying these words, nor of any dream that might provide them with a context.&#0160;</p>
<p>Some observations:</p>
<p>a) I&#39;m mighty proud of myself for having a dream that was so literate. &#0160;I mean, &quot;interpret.&quot; &#0160;Not your run-of-the-mill sleep vocabulary.</p>
<p>b) What could &quot;four ones&quot; refer to? &#0160;Four aces? &#0160;Some sort of runic inscription? &#0160;Score keeping? &#0160;</p>
<p>c) &#0160;What about eleven hundred and eleven? &#0160;A late antiquity or early medieval date? &#0160;A quantity, but of what? &#0160;</p>
<p>d) &#0160;Why did some part of my brain feel obliged to &quot;interpret&quot; the phrase &quot;four ones?&quot; Did my right brain think that my left brain was communicating in code?</p>
<p>Altogether inexplicable. But fascinating. The brain seems to have &#0160;a mind of its own.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Dear Talia, Oliver, Ella, Lola, Luke, Caleb, Asher:</p>
<p>Althea&#39;s grandfather, Solomon Goss (born Guza), who contributed 1/16 of your genetic inheritance, fled Poland after the worker&#39;s rebellion in Lodz in 1905, walked across Europe to Rotterdam where he boarded a ship and traveled steerage-class to Philadelphia. He had been a silk weaver in the old country and was able to find similar work here. In two years he saved enough money to pay for second-class passage (not the dreaded steerage) for his young bride Miriam Halpern.&#0160;</p>
<p>Solomon Goss played his part in the wave of political and social unrest that rocked the Russian Empire in the first years of the twentieth century -- uprisings that preceded and anticipated the 1917 Russian Revolution. The resistance had at its root the exploitation of workers especially in rapidly industrializing cities like Lodz (which had grown six-fold in a generation), in the state policy of enforced Russification, in czarist tyranny both cruel and arbitrary, and in heady intellectual and Marxist ferment both in universities and in informal worker self-education projects. The workers&#39; strikes and revolts in Lodz (the city, though Polish, was then incorporated into the Empire) were part of that great historical process. The Lodz Insurrection, also called the June Days, was one of the largest of these local rebellions. Following months of unrest and strikes, repressed by Russian police and soldiers, enraged workers began building barricades and assaulting police and military patrols. Additional troops, including the hated Cossacks, were called in. By June 23, the city and commerce was immobilized. Martial law was declared. But rocks proved futile against bullets and horses. By June 25, the uprising was crushed. It was officially reported that several hundred workers were killed but modern scholars estimate that between 1000 and 2000 died and many more were injured. There were arrests and imprisonments and executions. In this atmosphere Solomon Goss, who had manned the barricades, wisely decided that his time in Lodz had come to an end. &#0160;</p>
<p>I do not know how he was able to walk to the Netherlands and shipboard. A secular non-believer, he would not have been welcomed at local synagogues. Were there way-stations manned by sympathetic socialists? &#0160;How did he eat? &#0160;Where did he sleep? He never talked about his trek and if anyone ever asked him, they did not pass the information along to me.</p>
<p>When he came to America he found work in the silk mills in and around Paterson, New Jersey, which was then known as the &quot;Silk City.&quot; Weavers were skilled workers. Most were immigrants from traditional silk-weaving areas in England, Germany, and Italy but there was also a considerable influx from Lodz itself. The working day was ten hours long with a half day on Saturday and the new fifty-five hour week was considered a victory for the workers. Between 1881 and 1900 there were nearly 140 strikes. By the first decade of the 20th century, practically every mill had one or more labor organizations.&#0160;</p>
<p>Solomon Goss told me that when he would take a job in a mill, he would immediately set out to organize and radicalize his comrades. As a result, he said, he was frequently fired. But he was, he claimed, a very skilled worker, able to operate four looms at once (he looked down on American-trained workers whom he thought of as inferior and whom he derided as &quot;Columbus weavers).&quot;</p>
<p>By 1913, close to 5,000 Jewish men and women worked in the Paterson silk factories. It was in Paterson that Solomon Goss must have participated in one of the crucial events in American labor history, the Paterson silk strike. In February.&#0160;nearly 300 mills and dye houses were closed, as 24,000 men, women, and children joined in an industry-wide strike. The strikers&#39; demands were radical. They wanted an eight-hour day as well as increases in wages. Workers agreed that no one would return to work until all of the owners accepted their terms. Picket lines kept &quot;scabs&quot; and strike breakers out of the mills. More than 2,000 workers allowed themselves to be arrested, flooding the jails. But mill owners held firm and refused to meet with the workers. By the end of May, the workers&#39; solidarity cracked. English-speaking and better paid workers voted to accept settlements with individual mill owners. At the same time workers started to cross the picket lines. In July the central strike committee voted to endorse shop-by-shop settlements. The Paterson silk strike collapsed and owners conceded nothing. &quot;Your power is in your folded arms,&quot; IWW leader &quot;Big Bill&quot; Haywood had said. But the mill owners, with greater resources, outlasted the hungry workers.</p>
<p>I do not know how Solomon Goss responded to this second crushing defeat nor when he abandoned the silk trade. But in the 1940s, when Althea first knew him, he operated a &quot;candy store&quot; in Clifton Heights, New Jersey. When I met him in the late 50s, he had long ago sold the store and moved with Miriam to a tiny apartment in Utica, New York, where his son Dan and wife &quot;Grandma Anne&quot; (your great-grandma) lived. The man who had once been a proud unionist and socialist and who considered himself a follower of Daniel de Leon, founder of the Socialist Worker&#39;s Party, had drifted into conservatism, even voting for Richard Nixon in 1972. Defeat and poverty and deracination had not ennobled him. On the contrary, he was to my eyes a mean old man, given to gratuitously cruel and cutting remarks. His default stance toward me and toward the world was scorn. Miriam died in the late 60s; Solomon, having alienated his friends and relations, lived out his widowhood in a single room in a hotel in Rockaway and ultimately in the Hebrew Home for the Aged at Riverdale, where, a secularist to the end, he complained to Althea and to me about the intermittently broadcast Hebrew prayers. &#0160;</p>
<p>I find it almost impossible to reconcile the two sides of the man: the sour, sad, nasty old reactionary that he became and the heroic youthful fighter for social justice who fought the Cossacks, walked seven hundred miles from Lodz to Rotterdam and, I like to imagine, welcomed his beloved, radiant bride at the New York dock with tears in his eyes.&#0160;</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>When you start to watch a 1945 black-and-white movie called <em>Lady on a Train&#0160;</em>you have certain expectations, especially when you&#39;re told in advance that it&#39;s about a woman who sees a murder take place from a train window. And when the movie features such&#0160;<em>noir&#0160;</em>stalwarts as Dan Duryea and Ralph Bellamy. And especially when the title of the movie evokes <em>The Lady Vanishes</em> and<em> Lady in the Lake</em> and <em>Strangers on a Train</em>. But&#0160;<em>Lady on a Train&#0160;</em>is not what you might think it&#39;s going to be; in fact, it&#39;s a film that never has a clue about what it is or wants to be. It&#39;s an unsatisfying hodgepodge.</p>
<p><a class="image" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Lady_on_a_Train_1945_Poster.jpg"><img alt="Lady on a Train 1945 Poster.jpg" class="thumbborder" data-file-height="436" data-file-width="288" height="333" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/73/Lady_on_a_Train_1945_Poster.jpg/220px-Lady_on_a_Train_1945_Poster.jpg" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/73/Lady_on_a_Train_1945_Poster.jpg 1.5x" width="220" /></a></p>
<p>There are some films that are so bad that they become fascinating for sheer awfulness.&#0160;<em style="line-height: 1.2em;">Lady on a Train</em><span style="line-height: 1.2em;"> is that kind of awful. It starts out noir-y and offers, intermittently, fistfights and mistaken identities and shadows, lots of shadows, and enough red herrings to feed cast and crew for the entire time the film was in production. But it also takes a shot at comedy -- not sophisticated banter but broad farce: in one scene, trying to hide herself from a hired gunsel, the heroine disguises herself as a chair and moves around from place to place just as she would in an Abbott and Costello vehicle. And then, if farce/noir weren&#39;t enough of a burden, at three separate times during the events, with the least possible justification, Deanna Durbin, playing at being a detective, breaks into song, but only because she&#39;s Deanna Durbin, not because the film requires her to do so. So it&#39;s a noir-farce-sentimental musical. It just don&#39;t work, except for connoisseurs of badness.</span></p>
<p>Plus it features two of the ugliest hats ever to come out of the Hollywood chapeau-shop:</p>

<p>&#0160;After making this film (and another clunker) Deanna Durbin left Hollywood, where she had been the highest paid woman in America, married and moved to France, never appeared on stage or on film again -- and reassumed her birthname, Edna Mae Durbin. It&#39;s a decision one can respect.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>“Mucilage” is a word whose sound is wildly inappropriate to its meaning. In the world of adhesive nomenclature, “paste” is good and “glue” is even better. Trisyllabic mucilage ought to denote something far more serious -- perhaps a problem involving waste disposal (&quot;OK, we&#39;ve rescued the elephants, but what are we going to do with all that mucilage.&quot;)</p>
<p>In my life, mucilage made its mark long before glue arrived on the scene. In Brooklyn (and perhaps elsewhere) 1940s schoolchildren were issued small curvy bottles of the yellow stuff, each fitted with a red-rubber tip which was slit so that a drop or two of mucilage could be emitted when the bottle was pressed to the surface of your construction-paper or doily project. Actually, the slit regularly became caked and occluded and the hardened mucilage had to be scraped off with your fingernails. It was a lot like nose-picking. &#0160;</p>

<p>LePage’s Mucilage, I believe it was called.&#0160;We said Page as &quot;page&quot;&#0160;but surely LePage&#39;s Mucilage if pronounced&#0160;Frenchly (le pahje) would be far more euphonious.&#0160;Some claim that if you were building a model airplane, you would use mucilage on your fuselage, but I believe such an assertion to be the kind of persiflage at which I take umbrage.&#0160;</p>
<p>And yes, the word is a descendant and cousin of Latin <em>mucus</em>, meaning mucus.</p>
<p>Unbeknownst to 1940s me, mucilage has a life outside the bottle. It is a glycoprotein and exopolysaccharide found in most plants where it helps to store water and thicken membranes. I have now learned that the sticky stuff on the leaf tips of the insect-catching sundews that live at the edge of our pond&#0160;is a form of mucilage.&#0160;</p>
<p>I would be curious to know from what plants William Nelson LePage distilled the vast vats of mucilage that were diluted and parceled out to schoolchildren, who then spent the hour after &quot;Arts and Crafts&quot; removing nasty mucilage scale from their fingers. But I do now know why schools loved the stuff &#0160;-- because vegetable mucilage is, if not exactly edible, not poisonous either. No hoofs were harmed during its production.</p>
<p>Once having established the mucilage monopoly, Mr. LePage must have brought home zillions. And if his descendants were as sticky-fingered as I suspect they must have been, they will be enjoying the profits on their yachts or in their Manhattan penthouses to this day while we 1940s pupils are left with only memory-traces of mucilage&#39;s peculiar feel and odor. &#0160;</p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2017/12/grassley.html">Why I Am So Damned Pissed at Charles Grassley</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Inasmuch &quot;on horror&#39;s head horrors accumulate&quot; every single Trump day, I wonder why an atrocity out of the mouth of Senator Charles Grassley (of once progressive Iowa) pisses me off to the top of my bent. Over the top, actually, even though he&#39;s probably no worse than the others.&#0160;</p>
<p>In an aha!! moment with the <em>Des Moines Register</em>, Senator Grassley defended his vote against the inheritance tax thusly: &quot;I think not having the estate tax recognizes the people that are investing as opposed to those that are just spending every darn penny they have, whether it&#39;s on booze or women or movies.&quot; &#0160;His very words. Out of his own ignorant head.</p>
<p class="p-text">Why am I so enraged? Let us count the ways.</p>
<p class="p-text">First, it goes without saying that Grassley doesn&#39;t know that most ordinary citizens have a hard time making ends meet. That they raid the kids&#39; piggy-bank at the end of every month. That they regularly postpone filling that prescription or repairing the car until next month&#39;s paycheck arrives. That they can&#39;t invest in stocks because they&#39;re busy &quot;investing&quot; in bananas and oatmeal and potatoes, not because they&#39;re frittering their money away on playthings. Grassley is completely out of touch with reality -- with the way real people live.</p>
<p class="p-text">But it&#39;s worse than that. It&#39;s not only that he&#39;s unconnected to his constituents &#0160;-- &#0160;he oozes contempt for them (and therefore for me). Wasting their money on movies, the poor ignorant slobs. If they had self-control and brains of Chuck Grassley quality, why they&#39;d go out and buy a couple of hundred shares of a good growth stock and contribute to the American economy. He&#39;s worse than Marie Antoinette, who, bad as she was, never said, &quot;let them buy stocks.&quot;</p>
<p class="p-text">And therefore it follows in the universe of Grassley values that the tax system should penalize the improvident and reward the rich. (Which it already does in myriad ways, most obviously by taxing unearned income -- e.g. capital growth -- at half the rate of sweat labor).&#0160;</p>
<p class="p-text">And in Chuck Grassley&#39;s view, to reward the rich and penalize the poor is the higher morality -- because &#0160;the rich will invest and the poor will do nothing but spend every darn penny. &#0160;To those who have much shall be given, even if they don&#39;t need or want it.</p>
<p class="p-text">And while I&#39;m stoking my indignation, let me add that I&#39;m offended by the Chuckster&#39;s sanctimonious &quot;darn&quot; -- he can thieve from the working class but he&#39;s too prissy to swear while doing so. And I&#39;m also just slightly off my gourd that he includes &quot;women&quot; among the vices of regular Iowans -- as though (if I understand his point) all money is earned and spent by &quot;men.&quot; I think that the dumb Chuck slipped -- let down his guard for a second -- and revealed that in his heart he doesn&#39;t acknowledge that women are wage-earners nor that they are wage-earners who vote.&#0160;</p>
<p class="p-text">And I am also pissed because the whole argument against the estate tax is fraudulent. The case for repeal has nothing to do with small farmers or small businessmen. It already excludes the first $11,000,000 of estates and therefore affects only a very small number of multimillionaires and billionaires who can well afford to contribute a bit to the general welfare. The sole purpose, and the intended effect of the repeal, is to satisfy the greed of a handful or plutocrats who want to pass their wealth to their heirs and therefore maintain a perpetual class of wealthy aristocrats. Just like France before the revolution, when the titled were exempted from taxation. Chuck -- do &#0160;your realize that your sentiments are profoundly unAmerican. &#0160;</p>
<p class="p-text">So let me say to Senator Charles Grassley, with respect for the high office that you hold and with as much love as I can muster, Chuck, you are a moron, and you can take your insulting opinions, roll them up, and stick them where the sun don&#39;t shine.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Another Thanksgiving come and gone, and here am I in a nostalgic mood, harking back to those songs that we sang in the PS 217 <a href=" http://www.drmetablog.com/2006/12/the_p_s_217_ass.html">&quot;assembly&quot;&#0160;</a>in the 40s and 50s of the last millennium. With Miss Georgia Keiselbach at the piano, we marched, in size places, decorated in white shirts and green ties, into the school auditorium and warbled our dear little hearts out every Thursday at 10:00 am.</p>
<p>I remember very well the stirring but perplexing Thanksgiving hymn that began&#0160;</p>
<div class="poem">
<p>We gather together to ask the Lord’s blessing;<br />He chastens and hastens His will to make known.<br />The wicked oppressing now cease from distressing.<br />Sing praises to His Name; He forgets not His own.</p>
<p>Looking backward, I admit that I understood the first line of the stanza but was pretty much boggled by what came next. &quot;Chasten&quot; and &quot;hasten&quot; make a wonderful internal rhyme, but who does He hasten and how exactly does He chasten?&#0160; A syntactical mystery for sure. Were we expected to believe that the Great Signifier in the Sky &quot;chastens and hastens&quot; His own will? &#0160;Why in the world should he be asked to do so?</p>
<p>Nor did I grasp the meaning of third line, because I didn&#39;t recognize that &quot;the wicked oppressing&quot; meant &quot;the oppressing wicked&quot; or more precisely &quot;the wicked who are oppressing someone.&quot; But who were they &quot;oppressing&quot;? Apparently, the &quot;distressing&quot;, that is, the people who are distressed. And who, to be more specific, were the innocent distressed who were being oppressed. Us? &#0160;Our teachers? Let me now confess that I sang then and remember at this moment the line as &quot;now cease <em>us</em> from distressing&quot;, thinking that we, the pupils, must have been the &quot;wicked&quot; and that it was our now enlightened task to cease from oppressing the distressed. I read the line as a provocation to guilt, even though I knew that I myself, third-grader, had never oppressed anyone.</p>
<p>Nor was I the only confused 10-year-old, because BB, my PS 217 classmate and consultant on our assemblies, remembered the line as &quot;The wicked oppressing now <em>seize </em>us from distressing&quot; -- a sentence which is way beyond my parsing skills.</p>
<p>Of the last line of the quatrain, I grasped &quot;Sing praises to his name&quot; but &quot;He forgets not His own&quot; opened another can of confused worms. I construed &quot;His own&quot; to be shorthand for &quot;his own name.&quot; But what kind of Lord forgets his own name? &#0160;As BB, equally misled, says, &#39;it&#39;s god, just three letters; how hard is that?&quot;</p>
<p>The hymn goes on for another four puzzling stanzas, though to tell truth, I don&#39;t remember whether they were required of us PS 217 choristers. I for one am retrospectively pleased that we omitted the stanza that included the lines &quot;We praise thee, O God, our Redeemer, Creator,/&#0160;In grateful devotion our tribute we bring&quot; which surely seemed even then a trifle too theological.&#0160;</p>
<p>Despite the fact that I was mostly clueless, I rather enjoyed belting out the hymn&#39;s anapests. It&#39;s a joyous, rollicking piece of music. Whether it was appropriate for a public school in the heart of immigrant Brooklyn is another question. But hey, it was the 50s, before we all became so multicultural.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, out of spirit of curiosity, and because it&#39;s now so easy even for us lazybones to investigate such questions, I turned once again to wikipedia and typed in &quot;We gather together.&quot; Warning: surprise in store.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a Christian hymn (of course) written in 1597 by one Adrianus Valerius to celebrate the victory in the Battle of Turnhout, a turning point in the Dutch Protestant war of liberation against Spanish Catholic domination. It first appeared in print in a 1626 collection of Dutch folk and patriotic songs but didn&#39;t find its way to the New World until 1903 and became popular only in 1935 when it was included in the &quot;national hymnal of the Methodist-Episcopal Church.&quot; During World War II, which was entering its last phase when I was a kindergartner in PS 217, the hymn became popular because &quot;&#39;the wicked oppressing&#39; was understood to refer to Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan.&quot; Which is, I suppose, how an anti-Catholic Protestant hymn came to be included in our curriculum. After all, it was out of such strange and unpredictable meldings and divagations that Brooklyn/American culture was formed. &#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;We gather together&quot; was not our only Thanksgiving song. We also sang the entirely unobjectionable&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; Over the river, and through the wood,</p>
<p>&#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160;&#0160;To Grandmother&#39;s house we go;</p>
<p>&#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; The horse knows the way to carry the sleigh</p>
<p>&#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; Through the white and drifted snow - oh.</p>
</div>
<p>I found this song lovely but otherworldly, because my own particular grandmother lived not over the river but in a tiny third-floor walk-up on distinctly unpastoral Coney Island Avenue, where there was an occasional tired horse, pulling a vegetable wagon, but there were few sleighs.</p>
<p>But as it turns out, &quot;Over the river&quot; too has a history. &#0160;</p>

<p>That&#39;s a portrait of its author, Lydia Maria Child. She looks rather forbidding, as though she might have taught sixth grade at PS 217, but on further investigation she turns out to have been a radical and revolutionary woman to whose accomplishments I wish we had been introduced. Born in 1802, she started her writing career with the novel <em>Hobomok </em>which depicts and approves of the marriage of an Indian man and a white woman. It caused a small scandal. In 1833, she published <em>An Appeal in Favor of that Class of Americans Called Africans </em>which proposed the immediate emancipation of slaves, arguing that slavery was as harmful to slave-owners as to the enslaved. It was the first anti-slavery book printed in America. Ms. Child was also an early advocate of women&#39;s rights and spoke favorably of sexual passion. Of course she was ostracized from polite society. In 1844, she published the small innocuous poem for which she is remembered, which concludes &quot;Hurrah for the fun! Is the pudding done?/Hurrah for the pumpkin pie!&quot; -- a sentiment to which there can be no possible objection or dissent.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<div class="noprint" id="mw-head-base">When I was for a decade the caretaker to a very ill, very disabled person, I often attended a &quot;support group&quot; along with folks who found themselves in similar situations. Not an easy task, being a full-time caretaker. At these useful gatherings, Information was exchanged, sympathy was given, hands were wrung and tissues were always at the ready. It was never an easy two hours. &#0160;</div>
<div class="noprint">&#0160;</div>
<div class="noprint">One of the recurrent themes of our discussions was escapism. Many of the caregivers wanted out. &quot;I just want to get into a car and drive somewhere, anywhere.&quot;&#0160; &quot;I want to lie on a beach in Hawaii, all by myself.&quot; &#0160;&quot;I want to move to a garret in Paris, stay there until this is over -- somewhere where I could meet new people, healthy ones.&quot; &quot;Sometimes I think of joining a pilgrimage, but I don&#39;t know to where.&quot; &quot;Nepal.&quot; &#0160;&quot;A cruise around the world.&quot; &quot;Is there another planet that I could go to?&quot;</div>
<div class="noprint">&#0160;</div>
<div class="noprint">I too had escapist fantasies, but I&#39;m embarrassed to report that they were of the blandest, most unimaginative, variety. Not Paris or Rome or Prague. For me, it was decidedly unexotic O&#39;Neill, Nebraska. If any of my constant readers need evidence that I was then and am now a monumentally pedestrian person, the proof lies in the O&#39;Neill pudding.&#0160;</div>
<div class="noprint">&#0160;</div>
<div class="noprint">When I indulged the fantasy, which I did at night, usually between 2am to 4am, I would imagine myself in a room at a slightly louche pay-by-the-week motel a couple of blocks from downtown O&#39;Neill. Crappy old stick furniture (but a good bed and mattress), low-wattage light bulbs in the ceiling fixture, big cut-glass ashtray. In this alternative world, I ate my breakfasts at Fay&#39;s Cafe a few hundred yards from the motel -- at my regular booth by the window. In the big table at the center of the diner, cheerful immense farmers gobbled their pancakes and bacon and coffee before setting off to fire up their John Deeres. They talked irrigation pipe and the price of soybeans. &#0160;</div>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Setting aside the suspicion that <em>The First Part of Henry the Sixth</em> is&#0160;a collaborative work or perhaps even a&#0160;&quot;prequel&quot; to Parts Two and Three, the play can be read&#0160;as if its first few lines were the earliest example of Shakespeare&#39;s playwriting.&#0160;If so,&#0160;then, what can be learned, right there at the very beginning, by looking closely at Act one, scene one, line one?&#0160;</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the first considerable&#0160;speech&#0160;in the play -- just about the very moment, let us imagine, in which Mr. W. S.&#39;s &quot;rough and all-unable&quot; goose quill touched paper. Thirty-seven or thirty-eight astonishing plays lie&#0160;in the future.&#0160;</p>
<p>The adventure begins&#0160;as&#0160;Gloucester eulogizes&#0160;the recently-deceased Henry&#0160;V.&#0160;The speech is not brilliant, not accomplished; in fact, it&#39;s just plain vanilla ordinary.&#0160;But it&#39;s a seed,&#0160;a kernel.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p><em>Gloucester:</em>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;England ne&#39;er had a king until his time.</p>
<p>Virtue he had, deserving to command:</p>
<p>His brandish&#39;d sword did blind men with his beams:</p>
<p>His arms spread wider that a dragon&#39;s wings;</p>
<p>His sparking eyes, replete with wrathful fire</p>
<p>More dazzled and drove back his enemies</p>
<p>Than mid-day sun fierce bent against their faces.</p>
<p>What should I say?&#0160; his deeds exceed all speech:</p>
<p>He ne&#39;er lift up his hand but conquered.&#0160;</p>
<p>A reader or playgoer would have to be superbly&#0160;insightful to predict that <em>this</em> Shakespeare would become <em>the</em> Shakespeare.&#0160;This opening speech is a&#0160;a mighty flat piece of rhetoric.</p>
<p>It&#39;s&#0160;formulaic&#0160; -- simply a litany or list.&#0160;First comes an item, a noun&#0160;(virtue, sword, arms, eyes, deeds) which is then amplified&#0160;by a hyperbolic qualifier (beams, wings, fire, sun).&#0160;It&#39;s open-ended; it could go&#0160;on indefinitely.&#0160;But because it&#39;s so much a formula, there&#39;s no surprise--there&#39;s no&#0160;mystery or excitement about where Gloucester is&#0160;heading.</p>
<p>Moreover,&#0160;for each element in the list,&#0160;there&#39;s&#0160;a congruence between the unit of thought and the unit of verse.&#0160;The sentiment&#0160;of each of the first four items on the list&#0160;is exactly contained in a&#0160;five-beat, ten-syllable line of verse--a pedestrian procedure&#0160;which Shakespeare would soon transcend. And finally, there&#39;s&#0160;an excess of&#0160;old-fashioned, traditional&#0160;alliteration:&#0160;&quot;His Brandish&#39;d sward did Blind me with his Beams&quot; &quot;affects the letter&quot; and browbeats the brain with the letter B. It goes almost without saying that there&#39;s nothing in this speech that is particular (Elizabethans would say peculiar) to either Gloucester or Henry.&#0160;This is Anyduke reciting sentences about Anyking.</p>
<p>But then something truly amazing occurs. &#0160;Although it looks as though&#0160;Gloucester is gathering his strength and his breath&#0160;for a speech that might go on for&#0160;forty lines and which would celebrate&#0160;many more&#0160;of the late kings&#39;s&#0160;amazing attributes,&#0160;he suddenly changes plans and truncates his intention:&#0160;&#0160;&quot;What should I say?&#0160; his deeds exceed all speech.&quot;</p>
<p>Gloucester seems to have run out of rhetorical gas. He is frustrated because he simply doesn&#39;t have the words. He throws in the rhetorical towel, so to speak. He surrenders. And he&#39;s right to do so, because at this early moment neither he nor Shakespeare has the power to generate a language that is equal to Henry&#39;s deeds. Better to stop speaking if you are utterly unable to say what you want to say.</p>
<p>Yet what is the task of&#0160;such a playwright as Shakespeare?</p>
<p>It is not to do exactly what Gloucester admits that he cannot do? -- to find the words that are commensurate with the deed -- as Shakespeare certainly will when he returns to Henry in the 1598 play which concludes and climaxes this sequence of eight history plays. In a decade, Shakespeare will move from the pathos of &quot;What shall I say?&quot; to a rich eloquence that is up to the task.</p>
<p>&quot;What shall I say?&quot; is therefore an important question -- the most important question of all, in fact&#0160;-- and the playwright&#0160;asks&#0160;it right here at the outset.&#0160;Readers&#0160;can&#0160;watch and learn as Shakespeare little by little, in play after play, gradually invents a&#0160;rhetorical style in which speech not only equals but eventually comes to exceed all deeds.&#0160;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>When I was a exceedingly young fellow (teens and twenties), I suffered from a great fear of death. It was not obsessive or constant, but enough to keep me lying awake at night, sometimes in a sweaty panic. It was not a fear of death itself, nor a concern about anguish in an afterlife -- hell a story which I always regarded as a pathetic fiction and fraud. No, my fear was that I would miss out on things. Children, grandchildren, springtimes, love, baseball, mountains, travel, books, knowledge, corn and hamburgers in August, the works. I wanted to live to an old age for the experiences. I well remember that in the 1960s, when I was barely out of adolescence, I would project myself forward to the distant future, as far as to the year 2000, the new millennium. I remember thinking, if I can just make it to 2000, when I&#39;ll be sixty-one, I&#39;ll have lived a full life. I&#39;ll be ready to go.</p>
<p>Well, 2000 has long ago come and gone, and here I am, pushing eighty, and in excellent, almost miraculous health. Such good health, in fact, that on good days I climb our neighboring foothills like a gazelle. (On bad days, even walking downhill seems as though I&#39;m slogging through a swamp of mucilage, but that&#39;s another matter.)</p>
<p>I no longer fear death. No matter what else happens to me, I&#39;m not going to die young, with my promises, such as they were, unfulfilled.</p>
<p>But the fear of dying young has been superseded by a new fear -- the fear of living too long. When did the transition occur?</p>
<p>I don&#39;t want to outlive my time. I don&#39;t want to outlive my friends, my family, my health. I&#39;m already the senior member, the patriarch, of my extended family -- not just the direct line from my grandparents, but of the extended cousinhood. In my family, there are no elders and only a couple of near-coevals. I don&#39;t want to become an isolate. Even more so, I don&#39;t want to lose my mobility or my mind. I don&#39;t want to find myself in a nursing home, pee on my pants, bedridden, &quot;locked-in&quot;. And I&#39;m going to do everything I can to avoid allowing myself to get into that situation. I&#39;ve seen people in that trap at close hand too many times -- and it ain&#39;t pretty. &#0160;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I&#39;m enjoying the perspective of the moment. I&#39;m glad that I managed to get to this point. From where I stand, I can remember my grandparents and I know my grandchildren. I&#39;m at the midpoint, the apex, of five generations. I marvel at the changes -- recall, will you, that my grandfather was born in darkest Ukraine in 1863, my youngest grandchildren were born in hi-tech Boulder, Colorado in 2013. Need I say more?</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Certainly in the 1940s and perhaps in later decades, first-graders all over America were taught an &quot;activity&quot; based on a song called &quot;The Farmer in the Dell.&quot; Older readers of this blague, if they are courageous enough to delve into long-forgotten and repressed pockets of the past, might dare to summon up the memory.&#0160;</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the game: &#0160;Ten young waifs, divided equally by gender, formed a circle holding hands around the Chosen One who was designated the &quot;farmer.&quot; The gamins (and gamines) sang the following song:</p>
<p>The farmer in the dell,</p>
<p>The farmer in the dell.</p>
<p>Heigh-ho the derry-o,</p>
<p>The farmer in the dell.</p>
<p>While they sang, the &quot;farmer&quot; walked around the inside of the circle and chose a partner from the circle of children. Then the tune was repeated with the key word altered:&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>The farmer takes a wife,</p>
<p>The farmer takes a wife,</p>
<p>Heigh-ho the derry-o</p>
<p>The farmer takes a wife.</p>
<p>The &quot;wife&quot; then joined him inside the circle, and the plot thickened. Now they sang: &#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;The wife takes a child,</p>
<p>The wife takes a child;</p>
<p>Heigh-ho the derry-o</p>
<p>The wife takes a child.&quot;</p>
<p>And so on down and down the great chain of being.&#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;The child takes a nurse...</p>
<p>&quot;The nurse takes a cow...</p>
<p>&quot;The cow takes a dog...</p>
<p>&quot;The dog takes a cat...</p>
<p>&quot;The cat takes a mouse...&quot;</p>
<p>And finally, when all the players have been chosen but one, the game ended on the following exclusionary note:</p>
<p>&quot;The cheese stands alone.</p>
<p>The cheese stands alone.</p>
<p>Heigh-ho the derry-o,</p>
<p>The cheese stands alone.&quot;</p>
<p>What was the point of this weird game? Why was it included in the &quot;curriculum?&quot;&#0160; Even seventy years later, it seems to be not fun but gratuitous cruelty. The most popular, the handsomest boy picks the most alluring young lady, and then choices are made in order of status. The game seems to have been devised to reinforce a hierarchical social structure. It was unAmerican, neither democratic or egalitarian. In retrospect, the game was triumphalist with regard to the farmer and his wife and harsh as all get out to the mouse and the cheese. If literary critics were to get their hands on this verse, they would be forced to notice the tragic pattern -- marriage at the outset followed by inevitable decline into isolation and soul-death.</p>
<p>Needless to say, I myself identify not with the prosperous farmer and his vivacious wife, but with the lumpish cheese. Velveeta it probably was, a big shapeless orange block of it, because no fancy aristocratic European cheeses were known to those of us who grew up in the 1940s PS 217 schoolyard. A sad cheese, inanimate, excluded from society, unchosen, least loved. Does the entire history of poetry offer a more mournful note than &quot;the cheese stands alone?&quot; Poor poor pitiful solitary neglected cheese.&#0160;</p>
<p>In recompense (it&#39;s too late for an apology) let us remember, three quarters of a century later, that cheeses have feelings too.</p>
<p>And for the curious, a &quot;dell&quot; is &quot;a small valley in a forest, tucked away from the rest of civilization.&quot; At the corner of Newkirk and Coney Island Avenue, where PS 217 was to be found, there were, trust me, no wooded dells. Concrete sidewalks, chain-link fences, yes. Dells no. Delis, but no dells. &#0160; &#0160;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>&quot;Antres&quot; is among the rarest of&#0160;rare words. Shakespeare&#39;s Othello speaks of &quot;antres vast and deserts idle&quot;&#0160;in the magnificent&#0160;oration&#0160;in which he&#0160;takes issue with the Venetian bigotry&#0160;that claimed that he&#0160;was only able to win white Desdemona by employing&#0160;drugs and witchcraft. No, it wasn&#39;t because he was a sorcerer; it was because he was accomplished, heroic, romantic. &quot;Antres&quot; is one of the exotic words that defines the great&#0160;African general&#0160;as a non-Venetian --&#0160;an outlander, an &quot;erring barbarian,&quot; an &quot;extravagant and wheeling stranger.&quot;</p>
<p>Shakespeare coined &quot;antres&quot; just for the occasion, deriving it&#0160;from Latin <em>antrum, </em>a cave. He never used &quot;antres&quot; again, nor did anyone else until Keats fleetingly revived the word&#0160;two centuries afterward. &quot;Antres&quot; never domesticated into English and remains curious&#0160;and&#0160;remote,&#0160;eternally&#0160;in need of an explanatory footnote. It is&#0160;unlikely that Shakespeare expected that a popular or even a courtly audience would&#0160;grasp &quot;antres&quot; at first hearing. It&#39;s a risky word, but Shakespeare didn&#39;t become Shakespeare without taking risks.</p>
<p>The playwright coupled&#0160;the neologism&#0160;&quot;antres&quot; to another shiny new Latinism to&#0160;produce &quot;antres vast,&quot; a phrase&#0160;which translates into the&#0160;language of&#0160;2017 as &quot;really big caves.&quot; Yet no translation can&#0160;do justice&#0160;to the spacious resonance of&#0160;&quot;antres vast.&quot; The caverns to which Othello refers are monstrously huge -- grown grander and even&#0160;more inaccessible because&#0160;Shakespeare ingeniously placed the modifier&#0160;after rather than before the noun. &quot;Antres vast&quot; are a hundredfold more mysterious --&#0160;darker, more echoic, more glinty with&#0160;stalactites&#0160;and stalagmites -- than &quot;vast antres.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;Antres vast&quot; occurs in tandem with a second&#0160;and equally remarkable&#0160;noun-adjective combination: &quot;deserts idle.&quot; Othello reports that before he came to Venice, he&#0160;had not only traversed &quot;rough quarries, rocks, and hills whose heads touch heaven&quot;&#0160;but&#0160;had also&#0160;dwelt among&#0160;&quot;antres vast and deserts idle.&quot; Strictly speaking, deserts cannot be&#0160;&quot;idle,&quot;&#0160;but they can be vacant or useless.&#0160;&quot;Deserts idle&quot; reinforces and augments &quot;antres vast.&quot; Taken together,&#0160;the two phrases are infinitely more evocative than either alone.</p>
<p>As a structure of sound, &quot;antres vast and deserts idle&quot; pivots on&#0160;the &quot;d&quot; of &quot;and&quot; and&#0160;the &quot;d&quot; of &quot;deserts&quot; and it positions&#0160;&quot;antres&quot; and &quot;idle&quot; in&#0160;symmetrical opposition. The&#0160;two key words are dissimilar yet cleverly interlinked,&#0160;each&#0160;comprised of an open vowel (Antres, Idle), a dental (anTres, iDle), and a liquid (antRes, idLe). It is not by&#0160;accident&#0160;that &quot;antres vast and deserts idle&quot; is such a euphonious&#0160;and mouth-filling phrase.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Shakespeare not only&#0160;invented&#0160;&quot;antres&quot; for Othello&#39;s&#0160;oration but also&#0160;took care to&#0160;surround it with&#0160;other linguistic novelties. For example:&#0160;Othello claims to have encountered&#0160;&quot;cannibals that each other eat/ The anthropophagi.&quot; &quot;Cannibal&quot; is now a commonplace noun,&#0160;but in 1604 it was a newcomer to the language. &quot;Cannibal&quot; derives from &quot;Carib,&quot; the name of a&#0160;recently-encountered people--reputed to be man-eaters --who gave&#0160;their appellation&#0160;to the sea in which they lived.&#0160;&quot;Cannibal&quot; was sufficiently strange--it had only made harbor in England (arriving by way of Spain) in the 1550s--that&#0160;Shakespeare felt a need to define it, which he did&#0160;once in English (&quot;that each other eat&quot;) and once in Greek (&quot;anthropophagi&quot;). &quot;Anthropophagi,&quot;&#0160;a word that&#0160;had originated with&#0160;Herodotus, was as new to&#0160;English--and as seldom employed--as &quot;cannibal.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;Antres vast,&quot; &quot;deserts idle,&quot; &quot;cannibals&quot; and &quot;anthropophagi&quot; play crucial parts in&#0160;Othello&#39;s stirring autobiographical fragment.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; &#0160;I spake of most disastrous chances,</p>
<p>Of moving accidents by flood and field,</p>
<p>Of hair-breadth&#0160;scapes i&#39;th&#39;imminent deadly breach,</p>
<p>Of being taken by the insolent foe</p>
<p>And sold&#0160;to slavery;&#0160; of my redemption thence,</p>
<p>And portance in my travel&#39;s history:</p>
<p>Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle,</p>
<p>Rough quarries, rocks, and hills whose heads touch heaven,</p>
<p>It was my hint to speak -- such was the process.</p>
<p>And of the cannibals&#0160;that each other eat,</p>
<p>The anthropophagi, and men whose heads</p>
<p>Do grow beneath their shoulders.</p>
<p>It&#39;s an astonishing story, each element&#0160;more incredible than the one that precedes it. Hair-breadth escapes?&#0160; Every hero&#0160;can boast of them. Redemption from slavery? A bit less likely. Hills whose heads touch heaven? A pardonable hyperbole. Cannibals?&#0160; Surely,&#0160;less&#0160;believable still. The Othello landscape then crosses the border from exotic to fabulous when it adduces&#0160;&quot;men whose heads/ Do grow beneath their shoulders.&quot; These headless men&#0160;are&#0160;the <em>blemmyae --&#0160;</em>Nubian or sometimes&#0160;Ethiopian -- who&#0160;were&#0160;a feature of&#0160; pseudo-anthropological folklore from Pliny to Sir Walter Raleigh. The skepticism that these monstrous creatures ought to provoke is diluted because the&#0160;road&#0160;to the blemmyes&#0160;passes through&#0160;&quot;antres vast and deserts idle.&quot; If audiences had not been lulled and seduced by &quot;antres,&quot; they might dismiss&#0160;Othello as a mere&#0160;braggart soldier--rather than admire him for the near-magician that he becomes in his self-dramatization.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Shakespeare had yet another purpose&#0160;for&#0160;&quot;antres vast.&quot; In the sentence that treads on the heels of the &quot;men whose heads/ Do&#0160;grow beneath their shoulders,&quot; Othello abruptly turned his attention to Desdemona. His language&#0160;dulls. &quot;This (i.e. his exotic narrative) to hear would Desdemona seriously incline,/ But still the house affairs would draw her hence.&quot;&#0160;Shakespeare strategically contrasts Othello&#39;s vocabulary to&#0160;Desdemona&#39;s when he&#0160;juxtaposes&#0160;&quot;antres vast&quot; to &quot;house affairs.&quot; Only the tinnest of ears&#0160;can fail to be struck by&#0160;the difference between the two phrases. Antres vast--house affairs; house affairs--antres vast. The gap between these two most pregnant phrases&#0160;is small enough to allow the electric impulses of sex and&#0160;romance to&#0160;spark,&#0160;but is too wide&#0160;to allow genuine understanding or empathy to shoot the gap.&#0160;The tragedy of Desdemona and Othello arises out of the unbridgeable space&#0160;between &quot;antres vast&quot; and &quot;house affairs.&quot;</p>
<p>Shakespeare therefore knew exactly what he was about when&#0160;he invented&#0160;the word &quot;antres.&quot;</p>
<p>If he had been&#0160;in a more antic&#0160;mood, less determined to&#0160;characterize&#0160;Othello&#39;s&#0160;massive dignity, he might have&#0160;coined a word from another&#0160;Latin word for cave,&#0160;e.g.&#0160;<em>spelunca</em>.&#0160;&#0160;But&#0160;&quot;spelunkies vast&quot; -- or even &quot;spelunkies splendid&quot;&#0160;-- could not&#0160;possibly do the work of&#0160;&quot;antres vast.&quot;&#0160;</p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2017/11/what-is-an-amana-board.html">Do the Dodgers Have an Outfielder Named Bacchus Pederson?</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Judging from his spectacularly wonderful name you might guess that Bacchus Pederson is either a character in a novel by Thomas Pynchon or the son of a Swedish father and a patriotic Greek mother. Not so. He&#39;s the creation not of eccentric parents or postmodern fiction the but of the voice recognition system that&#39;s been close-captioning that 2017 Dodgers-Astros World Series. He&#39;s an imaginary being. He does not exist. Except on the TV screen.</p>
<p>There is, however, a up-and-coming not-Greek-but-Jewish on-his-mother&#39;s-side left hand hitting center fielder for the Los Angeles Dodgers named Joc Pederson. And what is the relationship between Joc and Bacchus, you ask?</p>
<p>The other day (and the following morning because the game went on roughly forever), I watched the epic 13-12 Houston win over the Dodgers. A most exciting game. There was bad umpiring by the home plate official, there were balls flying out of the bandbox and onto the short porches, there was some beautiful defensive plays and some costly mental errors. See-saw, back and forth.</p>
<p>And yet more. Inasmuch as my veteran ears are past their prime and over the hill, I now supplement my hearing with &quot;close captioning.&quot; I try to catch what Joe Buck and John Smoltz say and then watch as their words, or some approximation of their words, flashes across the screen. It&#39;s an activity that is almost as fascinating and much more amusing than the game itself. And it is out of this experience that the fanciful mythological figure of Bacchus Pederson emerges. Smoltz says &quot;a fly ball to center and back goes Pederson.&quot; CC writes &quot;a fly ball to center and Bacchus Pederson.&quot; No human being would translate &quot;back goes&quot; into &quot;Bacchus&quot;. It&#39;s nonsensical and not even decent English grammar. t&#39;s got to be a machine, an idiot savant machine, that, stumped by &quot;back goes,&quot; has located &quot;Bacchus&quot; in its word hoard.&#0160;</p>
<p>And similarly, what is an &quot;Amana board?&quot; &#0160;Something wooden manufactured in the Amana colonies in Iowa, you might guess. No, it&#39;s CC for &quot;a man aboard.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>CC produces all sorts of comic linguistic wonders because it&#39;s utterly untethered to common sense.&#0160;</p>
<p>When John Smoltz, a human being who knows all there is to know about pitching, said that the left-hander was going to try to &quot;bury it in the back foot,&quot; knowledgeable baseball fans would understand exactly what was meant. The lefty intended to throw an unhittable pitch by coming as close as possible to the left-handed batter&#39;s left foot. However, readers would have to be mighty clever to interpret the meaningless wild CC phrase &quot;Marriott in the back foot.&quot; &#0160;</p>
<p>Other electronic locutions were easier. Not much of problem with &quot;hit it into the upper tank&quot; or &quot;rubbing him of a double&quot; or &quot;sacrifice bump&quot; or &quot;Taylor will eat it off.&quot;</p>
<p>Some CC flights of fancy require a little more interpretive skill. Will the Dodger manager replace his pitcher with &quot;a fresher god?&quot; Perhaps a &quot;fresher guy.&quot; Did the pitching staff &quot;hand out seven rocks?&quot; Seven walks is more likely. Do the Dodgers have a right fielder named Yossi el Pogue? &#0160;No, but they do have Yasiel Puig. Was a reliever taken out after &quot;a short student?&quot; Naw, it was a short stint. Did a pitch come &quot;in her half&quot; of the plate? &#0160;Who is &quot;her&quot;? &#0160;But no, it was &quot;inner half.&quot; Is it possible that a batter &quot;applied to center?&quot; &#0160;No but he might very well have &quot;flied to center.&quot;</p>
<p>Here&#39;s one that is Impossible to comprehend: &quot;Turner headset hard.&quot; I had to rewind and listen again: &quot;Turner hits it hard.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>Sometimes CC sounds vaguely spiritual. &quot;Flies want to center,&quot; says CC. Do they really, I ask. But what Joe Buck said was &quot;flies one to center.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>My favorites, aside from the immortal Bacchus Pederson, are errors that make no sense at all. What does it mean to say that a pitcher is a &quot;shortest writer.&quot; And that he &quot;threw his lighter.&quot; &#0160;The correct locutions: he was a &quot;short strider&quot; who &quot;threw his slider.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>Voice recognition systems are technological marvels, no doubt. But they have a way to go. There&#39;s still a place at the table for humans.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I calculate that for the last seventy-five years I&#39;ve eaten a box of raisins every month (I&#39;m a big fan of raisins and of dried fruit in general). A box of raisins is about 5 inches tall, 4 inches wide and 2 inches deep, or forty cubic inches. In a an average year, I eat 40 x 12 or 480 cubic inches of raisins. If I maintained my raisin-eating pace, it would take me four years to eat through a cubic foot of them. And it follows that in the last seventy-five years I&#39;ve eaten approximately 19 cubic feet of raisins, which amounts to a stack or block of raisins three feet long, three feet wide and two feet high. That&#39;s a heck of a lot of raisins. And that&#39;s just raisins -- &#0160;I&#39;m not even counting table grapes, also eaten plentifully over the decades. And wine.</p>
<p>I myself did not breed, plant, trim, fertilize or harvest the Thompson Seedless or Flame grapes. I did not fence the deer out of the orchard. No did I process the grapes. Nor box, ship, load, unload, or stock them in the market. Someone else made the boxes from wood that another person chainsawed to the ground. I just brought the raisins home from the market and sprinkled them on my oatmeal. Someone else, many someone elses, did all the hard work. &#0160;</p>
<p>I wonder how many people and how much accumulated skill it took to provide me with 19 lifetime cubic feet of raisins.&#0160;</p>
<p>Then there&#39;s milk. I&#39;ve drunk many many cartons of milk. I&#39;m too lazy to do the calculations, but I&#39;m going to guess that I&#39;ve consumed a hundred times more cubic feet of milk than I have of raisins. Probably a spacious roomful. And once again, I did not domesticate those fearsome wild European cattle, nor did I breed or milk them, or pasteurize &#0160;the milk, or ship it. I did not invent refrigeration, nor did I manufacture or install the refrigerators. I did not drive the milk truck (itself the creation of many hands). I hunted and gathered by walking to the market and plucking a carton (whole milk, vitamin D added) from the case. Easy as pie.</p>
<p>And what about potatoes? And pasta?</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think I need to go through any other of the commodities I consume. My point is simple: that it takes a titanic effort by society to keep me me me going. That I am borne on the shoulders of farmers, truckers, engineers, mechanics -- not to mention our neolithic ancestors who first looked at a cow and thought &quot;glass of cold milk&quot; or at a wild grape and thought &quot;those would make good raisins if we could just get the moisture content down.&quot;</p>
<p>So to all those people who think they are &quot;independent&quot; and who assert that they can fend for themselves, I say bullshit. If you eat anything at all, you&#39;re part of the great web of humanity that stretches around the earth and also extends back 65,000 years. &#0160;</p>
<p>So when you sit down to eat, and offer a prayer, don&#39;t thank god. Thank your industrious imaginative fellow humans.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Otzi the freeze-dried 5300 year old Tyrolean man/mummy continues to be studied and his corpse regularly yields new information. &#0160;</p>
<p>Otzi was about 45 years old, stood 5&#39;3&quot; and weighed only about 110 pounds. He had been wounded with an arrow in the shoulder which pierced an artery. He may have bled to death or, alternatively, died from a blow to the head. He had brown eyes, a dark beard, and long dark brown hair. He was wearing a bearskin hat, a goat loincloth, a goat cloak, and goat leggings with deerskin laces. His shoes were complex -- bearskin soles and deerskin uppers and were lined with hay -- presumably for both comfort and insulation. He had a calfskin belt in which he carried flint and bone tools, including a flint dagger, a large bow and a quiver of chamois hide reinforced with hazelwood. The quiver contained unfinished arrows made of shoots from the guelder rose tree. He had a container constructed of birch bark. He carried equipment for lighting a fire -- a flammable fungus, a piece of pyrite, and a flint. Otzi also carried a woven net for trapping prey and a mat made of grass fibers which probably served as a raincoat. And frameworks of hazel twigs that most likely were snowshoes. His outfit consisted of materials drawn from 18 different kinds of wood. His last meal, consumed two hours before his death, was of various unidentified plant material, and a helping of ibex meat. Otzi was lactose intolerant. His skin was marked in about 50 places with &quot;tattoos&quot; where charcoal had been rubbed into incisions. Some ribs (he lacked a twelfth rib) and his nose bone had been previously broken but had healed. He carried a stone ax with a copper edge --a rare and expensive possession. To judge from the traces of arsenic in his body he might have been a copper smith. An analysis of his mitochondria revealed that he belonged to haplogroup K which was a typical marker of members of the farming culture that was then expanding into Europe. His closest relatives today are found on Corsica and Sardinia. He also belonged to a Y-chromosome haploid group G which which is also associated with migrating farmers. He had a rare mutation known as G-L91 which has been discovered in 19 contemporary residents of the Tyrol. He was not healthy. His knee joints were in bad shape and caused him considerable pain, his teeth were worn down and inflamed, his lungs show traces of soot particles probably from living in badly ventilated spaces. He suffered from Lyme disease, rheumatism, intestinal parasites, hardened arteries, gallstones, and an ugly growth on his little toe perhaps caused by frostbite. It would appear that he had had a hard life.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>In Charles Dickens&#39; <em>Great Expectations</em>, it is reported that the woman who is eventually revealed to be Estella&#39;s mother was married &quot;over the broomstick (as we say), to a tramping man.&quot; Dickens offers no explanation for &quot;over the broomstick,&quot; apparently assuming that it was a concept with which his readers were familiar. There is in fact a long tradition of &#39;jumping the broom&quot; to certify informally a marriage sanctioned neither by state or church. It was practiced in west Africa where it symbolized the sweeping away of the old life and of a leap into the new world of fertility and increase. &quot;Jumping the broom&quot; was also a frequent practice in southern American slave culture where legal marriage was prohibited. The custom was a feature of ancient Celtic societies, especially among the Welsh and the Picts. As practiced by the Picts, broom jumping neither predicted nor solicited fertility. &#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I had to change the name on my Comcast -- now they call it Xfinity -- account (internet, TV, &quot;landline&quot;). In the pencil and paper days, you would just cross out the old name and put in the new. But that&#39;s not how it works nowadays. I didn&#39;t want to call the company and be put on hold for a half an hour, and then accidentally disconnected, which happens pretty regularly, so I drove over to the Xfinity storefront on Baseline. Very slick modern spacious venue. You&#39;re supposed to sign in on the computer at the front desk, but the computer was down so they just had a paper sign-up sheet -- embarrassing I would think to the employees to have to resort to something as antique as a written list. I noticed that I was tenth in line and I looked around and I saw that there were only two clerks -- they&#39;re probably called &quot;technicians&quot; or some other highfalutin&#39; name, but they&#39;re clerks. I guessed a forty-five minute wait and I wasn&#39;t far off. I had forgotten to bring my cell phone so I couldn&#39;t amuse myself with FB or the NYT or texting friends so I looked at the various items for sale and I immediately felt mighty ignorant. There were all sorts of devices that I didn&#39;t know what they did, and if I did recognize them, they were described in language that made not the slightest bit of sense to me. One cellphone, for example, offered both CDMA and GSM. Which is probably a good thing, and maybe someone could explain to me what they do and why you need both of them. And would &#0160;I want the cellphone with or without the Qi charger? That sort of thing. There were lots of connectors with fancy plugs for connecting one device to another, which is good if you know what you want to connect, and why, and if you have a solid grasp of your ports. So the forty-five minutes flew by and eventually my name was called and there I was at the counter with this young guy with a scruffy beard that looked like his lifetime growth of facial hair. I explained that I wanted to change the name on the account and he got to work. It seems that you can&#39;t just change the name but you have to cancel the one account and set up a new one so we went through the &quot;mother&#39;s maiden name&quot; thing and &quot;last four digits of your social&quot; and so on. It seemed to go on forever and every once in a while my technician would look up and say sort of mournfully to me &quot;the computer&#39;s kind of slow today.&quot; While I was with him, two old guys, older than me, brought their bills to the next technician over and said, essentially, &quot;I don&#39;t understand a thing about my bill. What am I paying for. What is this charge.&quot; Both guys went away mollified by the explanation but both said that they had to figure out how to reduce the monthly bill. And it&#39;s a fact that the monthly bill is rather complex. For example, I don&#39;t know why I pay a $6.00 monthly &quot;athletic fee&quot; but the clerk explained that it allows the company to televise high school football and small college football games which means that I&#39;d be able to see Cherry Creek play Fairview or the University of Northern Colorado play Mesa College which is something I suppose though no particular advantage to me inasmuch as I&#39;m personally boycotting all football because of the incidence of traumatic dementia. But that&#39;s not the point. It took between half and hour and forty-five minutes for my technician to make all the changes and I signed my name several times to acknowledge this and that which I didn&#39;t entirely understand and I was about to leave at last, but my fuzzy-cheeked technician gave me a piece of paper on which he highlighted a telephone number. He said, &quot;There&#39;s one more step. When you get home, you call this number and they will &quot;activate&quot; your TV and your internet and your telephone. I said, why don&#39;t you just call them, or hand me your telephone and I&#39;ll call the activator now but he said that wasn&#39;t the way it was done -- I had to call from my home. So I went home picked up the telephone, but it wasn&#39;t working. No dial tone. Of course it wasn&#39;t working -- it hadn&#39;t been &quot;activated.&quot; The message on the telephone screen was &quot;check tel line,&quot; but of course I had no idea how to do that. How did Xfinity in their wisdom and experience expect a consumer to activate an account from an inactivated telephone. A rather large glitch in the system I would think. However, I&#39;m a resourceful guy so I picked up my cell phone and called the number. I got through immediately and went through the sequence of this press 1 if that press 2 but there was no option for activating, so I said, several times, &quot;I would like to talk to a human being&quot; and after a number of iterations and going around the choices from 1 to 5 I got through to a person. I explained the situation very carefully to my new clerk or technician who sounded as though he could be in India and we did the mother&#39;s maiden name thing and the last four digits of your social and I was put on hold several times which always makes me very nervous and finally he came back and said that he was going to transfer me to the &quot;activation unit,&quot; who turned out to be a pleasant-voiced lightly-accented woman who was all business, but it took her about half an hour to activate me because Tel 2 kept lighting up on the modem before Tel 1 which is apparently not the way it&#39;s supposed to happen. But eventually it came to pass. I asked my new friend where she was physically located and she said &quot;the Philippines.&quot; So now I&#39;m back in business and it only took maybe three and a half hours at the very most to change the name on the account. Which is much longer than it took to find out why I had a $13.00 charge including a late payment fee on my Traveler&#39;s auto insurance (put on hold twice) or why I&#39;m paying for a electronic newspaper subscription but can&#39;t access the newspaper on line (on hold three times), where I eventually gave up and canceled the subscription (it had been a long day). &#0160;</p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2017/10/theeventjune30.html">What I Said at Our "Event"</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>&quot;Thank you all for coming. We appreciate it more than you can possibly imagine. We&#39;ve needed, and relied on, the support that all of you have given us.</p>
<p>It&#39;s no secret that both Lynn and I have gone through some difficult times. It&#39;s good to host a cheerful event. &#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>A number of people have asked us about our use of the word &quot;wed&quot; in the invitation that we sent to you. (We said, you remember, that we were &#39;wed&quot; on June 30). I don&#39;t want to mislead you. We didn&#39;t mean to imply that we involved either state or church in our relationship. There didn&#39;t seem to be any point for us to get married legally. People marry for the sake of children, but we&#39;ve decided that we&#39;re not going to have children.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the story. Lynn and I wanted to acknowledge in a public way the seriousness and permanence of our friendship -- for our families, and, I think, especially for our grandchildren (there are ten of them). We wanted our families to know that our relationship wasn&#39;t like some streetcar or trolley that you hop on and hop off. So we decided to invite our most nuclear&#0160;family to Lynn&#39;s backyard garden for a brief &quot;ceremony&quot; -- just my children and grandchildren, her children and grandchildren, her brother, my brother, the various spouses -- and pledge our love and fidelity. But then one of my daughters-in-law, Connie, said that we couldn&#39;t ask people to fly&#0160;in from all over the USA just for a five minute ceremony. She suggested that we at least exchange rings. It seemed like a good idea. So we walked over to Classic Facets on the Pearl Street Mall and bought two not antique but vintage rings -- because we&#39;re vintage people. Handsome rings, as you can see. And then as long as everyone was coming here a day early we decided that we should have dinner the night before. And if you&#39;re going to have a dinner you might as well have some music. So gradually the &quot;ceremony&quot; evolved and grew. But more importantly -- and here&#39;s the point -- the meaning of the event evolved as well. It became more significant, more profound, more intimate.&#0160;We never liked the phrase &quot;commitment ceremony&quot; or even the word &quot;commitment&quot; because it sounds as though you are being sent either to jail or to a mental institution, and we didn&#39;t have the vocabulary for what we intended to do. But little by little, while we planned the event, and even more so, after we performed the ceremony, we began to feel more and more married -- in all the positive senses of the word. We can now say &quot;wed&quot; and mean it. I haven&#39;t yet been able to say &quot;husband&quot; or &quot;wife&quot; but I suspect that one day in the not too distant future those words will manifest themselves. But the point is that in all the ways that matter, we are &quot;wed.&quot;</p>
<p>When my Vermont friend Bert, who&#39;s just my age, got married 18 years ago, I said to him, Bert, is it real --that you&#39;re head over heels in love at age 60? At the time, it seemed so improbable. But now, here I am, just a year and a half short of 80, and setting out on a new life. And 60 seems like dewy youth.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>So let me repeat to you now what I said to Lynn on June 30. &quot;I bring you my children and my grandchildren, my prosthetic tooth, my lens implants, my hearing aids, my non-standard but warm heart, and I take you and your children and grandchildren and your titanium hip and arthritic finger&#0160;and I say, &quot;let us make a life of it.&quot;</p>
<p>And let me just add that between us we have been married for 100 years (an average of 50 apiece). So we ought to know what we&#39;re doing.</p>
<p>And what we&#39;re going to do is to ride this old trolley right to the end of the line.&quot;</p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2017/05/enoughisasgoodasafeast.html">"Enough is as Good as a Feast" or Possibly Better</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<div>&quot;Enough is as good as a feast&quot; has become my very favorite proverb.</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>It&#39;s&#0160; a warning against crass consumerism, against materialism, against the excesses of capitalist acquisitiveness. Cold water in a jelly glass, it asserts, is as good as your $500 wine in crystal. As they used to gloss the proverb, no &quot;<em>avaricious scraping together that knows no bounds</em>.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>But for a fully &quot;mature&quot; guy like me, the proverb carries not only a figurative but a plain literal instruction, i.e., &quot;do yourself a favor, eat less.&quot; Enough is as good as a feast if a feast makes your stomach swell, makes you heavy-lidded and gassy and passive, and if you feel a heck of a lot better when you haul yourself away from the Table of Plenty long before you reach satiety.</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>I can remember, as a voracious adolescent, eating <em>three </em>large, overstuffed hamburgers at a single sitting -- the roll overflowing with tomatoes, onions, relish, ketchup, etc. Along with a bottomless bowl of fries. And craving more. Then as a vigorous young man, a good portion was two hamburgers. Nowadays, I go halves with a friend. Hold the fries.</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>When my grandmother dished up those glorious blintzes of my youth, eight was my number. Now my number is -- one. And I feel the better for it.</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>Digestion is slower and, I suppose, less efficient. And then there&#39;s the embarrassing fact that hamburgers and blintzes and everything else settles right in the enlarged belly, the &quot;front porch.&quot;</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>So here&#39;s a proverb for this latter age: &quot;enough is better than a feast.&quot; Much.&#0160;</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>By the way, I first encountered the proverb, believe it or not, as the title to William Wager&#39;s 1581 morality. And then in Latin in Shakespeare&#39;s<em> Love&#39;s Labor&#39;s Lost</em>,<em><em>&#0160;</em></em>where, Sir Nathaniel and the pedant Holofernes come on stage having just completed, apparently, a more than substantial dinner. &quot;<em>Holofernes</em>: &#0160;&#39;Satis quod sufficit.&#39;&quot; Perhaps Holofernes paraphrases and simplifies&#0160;Horace:&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div><em>Multa petentibus<br />Desunt multa.<br />Bene est, cui deus obtulit<br />Parca, quod satis est manu.</em></div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>(Those who seek for much are left in want of much. Happy is he to whom God has given, with sparing hand, as much as is enough.)&#0160;</div>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Now that&#0160;we&#39;ve at last come to the NBA playoffs and are heading toward another Warriors-Cavaliers showdown,&#0160;it&#39;s fitting that we reflect on basketball jargon, which is distinguished by its many colorful monosyllables: hoops, hops, bigs, stuff, slam, jam, slash, dish, board, glass, dunk, pick, screen, paint, lane, point, wing, trey, rim, post, trap, &quot;D&quot;, roll, box, press, tip, swish, bank, brick, feed, stroke, hole, &quot;J&quot;, rock, range.</p>
<p>But down-home slang is not basketball&#39;s only linguistic register.&#0160;</p>
<p>Curiously, roundball jargon exhibits&#0160;a contrary tendency toward polysyllabic words of Greek and Latin origin.&#0160;Some teams, for example, are said to be &quot;physical.&quot; &quot;Physical&quot; (from Gr. <em>physicos </em>= nature) means, in basketballese, simply &quot;rough&quot; and does not imply that the other team plays either an ethereal or spiritual game. It used to be that a guard played on the &quot;outside&quot; and a center on the &quot;inside&quot;; nowadays they&#39;ve become &quot;perimeter&quot; (Gr.) and &quot;interior&quot; (L.) players.&#0160;A fast break has become &quot;transition offense.&quot;&#0160;A player doesn&#39;t drive to the basket; he &quot;penetrates.&quot;&#0160;Players no longer jump; they &quot;elevate&quot;;&#0160;they don&#39;t block an opponent&#39;s shot, they &quot;reject&quot; it. In an odd linguistic development, a point guard no longer passes the ball;&#0160;he &quot;distributes&quot; (Latin<em>: distribuere</em>, to allot) it.&#0160;In its ordinary signification,&#0160;to &quot;distribute&quot; a basketball would be to cut it into pieces like a loaf of bread and give each teammate a slice, but not so in the language of basketball. Only a few years ago, it was still possible to &quot;switch&quot; from guarding one man in order to guard another; now players &quot;rotate.&quot; &quot;Rotate,&quot; derived from &quot;rota,&quot; the Latin word for wheel, properly means &quot;to turn on an axis, to spin.&quot; A defender who did not switch but rotated would pirouette, and pirouetting would not be an effective defensive strategy. (A better classical upgrade&#0160;for switch would be &quot;revolve.&quot;) Even sillier than rotate: &quot;rotate over&quot;&#0160;or &quot;rotate around&quot;-- a usage that evokes the grotesquerie of a big guy in a tutu pirouetting across the baseline -- a vision that is all the more picturesque now that traditional basketball shorts have been replaced by big ol&#39; floppy bloomers. Just last night I heard a TV announcer declare that a&#0160;seven-foot tall player had &quot;a lot of verticality.&quot; (I suppose that if he fell to the floor he would have lots of &quot;horizontality&quot;). Players&#0160;don&#39;t score; they &quot;convert,&quot; as in, &quot;they had a transition&#0160;opportunity&#0160; but failed to convert.&quot; They don&#39;t push an opponent out of the way;&#0160; no, no, no, -- they create space (Latin: <em>crea</em><em>nt spatium).&#0160;</em>Although I am not a&#0160;physicist, I suspect that space is something like matter, and can therefore neither be created nor destroyed. At least not created by power forwards, however potent&#0160;they may be.&#0160;How silly of me to object; neither the laws of physics nor the usual constraints of language are binding on <em>punditor basketballensis</em>. OK, game&#39;s on; let&#39;s see how well they play -- oops, sorry, how well they execute.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Insomnia once again -- a nightly affliction, a family trait. Perhaps we lack a gene that lets others sleep from dusk to dawn. Have I noted here that I want my tombstone inscribed with the motto, just beneath my name and dates, &quot;No More Insomnia, Forever.&quot;</p>
<p>During the wakeful nights, I&#39;ve taken to listening to old-time radio. My favorite: WHRO out of Norfolk, Virginia. Last night, I heard some tenor from the 1920s (perhaps John McCormack) in a scratchy recording (tuba for bass) wail or warble &quot;The Lost Chord&quot;-- quite the 3 am treat it was. A flood of memories arose, because &quot;The Lost Chord&quot; was one of the songs that we learned during the PS 217 <a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2006/12/the_p_s_217_ass.html">assembly</a> back there in Flatbush in the 1950s. I recalled with some amusement that our determined &quot;music specialist,&quot; Miss Georgia Keiselbach, a big lumbering woman with a trained contralto voice, tried gamely to inculcate an anguished mid-Victorian quasi religious parlor song into the minds of a roomful of fidgety 10-year-olds. Quite an experience. I was entranced by Sir Arthur Sullivan&#39;s melody, but I have to admit that the lyric was incomprehensible to me then and is still quite a challenge to this day.</p>
<p>So I investigated. Onto the internet, which, fortunately, works very well at 4 am.</p>
<p>The words to &quot;The Lost Chord&quot; are by Adelaide Anne Procter, after Tennyson apparently the most popular poet of her day, although I&#0160;must&#0160;confess that I had never heard of her even though I&#39;m supposed to know something about nineteenth-century English literature. &#0160;</p>
<p>Here&#39;s Ms. Procter&#39;s fervid poem:&#0160;</p>
<div class="poem">
<p>Seated one day at the organ,<br />I was weary and ill at ease,<br />And my fingers wandered idly<br />Over the noisy keys.<br /><br />I know not what I was playing,<br />Or what I was dreaming then;<br />But I struck one chord of music&#0160;<br />Like the sound of a great Amen.<br /><br />It flooded the crimson twilight,<br />Like the close of an angel&#39;s psalm,<br />And it lay on my fevered spirit<br />With a touch of infinite calm.<br /><br />It quieted pain and sorrow,<br />Like love overcoming strife;<br />It seemed the harmonious&#0160;echo<br />From our discordant life.<br /><br />It linked all perplexed&#0160;meanings<br />Into one perfect peace,<br />And trembled away into silence<br />As if it were loth to cease.<br /><br />I have sought, but I seek it vainly,<br />That one lost chord divine,<br />Which came from the soul of the organ,<br />And entered into mine.<br /><br />It may be that death&#39;s bright angel<br />Will speak in that chord again,<br />It may be that only in&#0160;Heav&#39;n<br />I shall hear that grand Amen.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll paraphrase (even though I know that paraphrase is not a nice thing to do to a poem): in a reverie at the organ the poet experiences something grand that is aesthetic, transcendent, ineffable, and fleeting. The &quot;lost chord divine&quot; -- note the Miltonic deployment of adjectives&#0160;-- stands for the hope or wish or belief that there is such a place as heaven and that it&#39;s a place where weariness, fever, pain, sorrow, perplexity, strife, and discord are superseded by the &quot;infinite calm&quot; and &quot;perfect peace&quot; of the &quot;grand Amen.&quot; &#0160;A not unusual or extraordinary nineteenth-century sentiment where the hunt for the disappearing god was frequently mediated by art -- in this particular case by the art of music.&#0160;</p>
<p>As long as I&#39;m reducing the poem to its paraphraseable meaning, I might also add that Procter, like many poets before and after her, has conflated religious and sexual longing. I&#0160;derive this meaning, inaccessible to the roomful of quavering sopranos of which I was one, and very likely unsuspected by Miss Keiselbach herself, from the vocabulary of passion in which the poem is couched: &quot;crimson,&quot; &quot;touch,&quot; &quot;lay&quot; &quot;love,&quot; &quot;trembled.&quot; &#0160;And from the sentence, &quot;It came from the soul of the organ,/ &#0160;And entered into mine,&quot; where it might be argued, slightly frivolously, that any line of poetry that contains &quot;came&quot; &quot;organ&quot; and &quot;entered&quot; has got to be about a symbolic sexual encounter. Especially when the ambiguous word &quot;mine&quot; can denote either &quot;my soul&quot; or &quot;my organ.&quot; So in this extravagant reading, in which it is once again clearly demonstrated that you can take the boy out of Brooklyn but you can&#39;t take the Brooklyn out of the boy, &quot;The Lost Chord&quot; is not only about the search for &quot;perfect peace&quot; but also for the perfect orgasm which will provide infinite calm to the poetess when she &quot;dies&quot; -- a word which is itself a Victorian euphemism for sexual climax. The lost chord is the big O (and I don&#39;t mean Oscar R.)</p>
<p>Just for fun of it let me also adduce a couple of sentences from the wikipedia article on Adelaide Anne Procter: &quot;Modern critics argue that Procter&#39;s work is significant for what it reveals about how Victorian women&#0160;otherwise repressed feelings.&quot; &quot;One critic&#0160;suggests that Procter may have been a lesbian&#0160;and in love with&#0160;Matilda Hays;&#0160;other critics have called Procter&#39;s relationship with Hays &#39;emotionally intense.&#39;&quot; &quot;Procter became engaged in 1858. The identity of Procter&#39;s fiancé remains unknown, and the proposed marriage never took place.&quot; &quot;In 1851,&#0160;Procter converted to Roman Catholicism.&quot; &quot;Procter never married. She became unhealthy, possibly due to her charity work, and died of tuberculosis&#0160;at the age of 38.&quot; I&#39;ll let my loyal readers connect the dots. &#0160;</p>
&quot;The Lost Chord&quot; is a fine song and deserves to be revived. On <em>YouTube</em>, you can listen to a remarkably accomplished version by Enrico Caruso. Which you can access to at any time, even in the midst of a long insomniac night.</div>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Once Leonardo defeated the old king and began to rule the pride, he evolved into a more modern lion -- more sensitive, more sharing, and more mindful. While he did not trim his mane or become less manly, he transitioned to a new kind of male.</p>
<p>First he decided no longer to bite the necks of the lionesses whom he mounted. Instead he wooed them gently with wine and flowers. He was a considerate mounter -- always taking care that the experience was sweet for his lionesses. He learned to roar more musically.</p>
<p>And soon after, he gave up the custom of breaking the backs of the kittens of the previous king. Instead, he nurtured the babies and brought them porridge and toys and stuffed animals. Nor did he drive the juvenile males into the bush. He taught them to dance and to draw and to meditate.</p>
<p>And finally Leonardo stopped treating other animals as prey. He became a gazelle guardian. Conscious of the environment,&#0160;he encouraged all in his pride to eat organic fruits and vegetables and wholesome ancient grains.</p>
<p>Nowadays Leonardo the enlightened lion starts each day with a large bowl of gluten-free granola and yoghurt.</p>
<p>He&#39;s into wellness.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Four years ago, I listened to a radio interview with Markwayne Mullin, a new member of the House of Representatives from eastern Oklahoma, and was absolutely flabbergasted. Astonished and dismayed, I wrote a few paragraphs about him. Here&#39;&#39;s what I said then: &quot;It wasn&#39;t that he was inarticulate or stupid. It was that he was so utterly smug, so absolutely and entirely certain of himself. He has no doubts. He knows exactly what ails the country -- too much government -- and he knows how to fix it -- lower taxes, less regulation, more free untrammeled capitalism. He does not seem to be aware that the United States of America is a big, complicated, multi-faceted country. Markwayne Mullin possesses all the arrogance of ignorance, in spades.&quot;</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef017d40051129970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Mullin" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef017d40051129970c" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef017d40051129970c-800wi" title="Mullin" /></a></p>
<p class="zn-body__paragraph">And here he is, Representative Markwayne Mullin, smiling in front of the mandatory flag. &#0160;</p>
<p class="zn-body__paragraph">I went on to report on Mullin&#39;s views, which were the usual list of utterly unoriginal, thoughtless, simplistic tea party talking points. I concluded by offering the hope (or might I say it) the prayer, which was &quot;that Markwayne Mullin, who as he begins his congressional career is superficial to the very core of his being, will come to Washington, meet some folks from different parts of the country and from different ethnic backgrounds, learn a little about the world, come to an appreciation of the complexity of things, and grow up to be a useful broad-minded compassionate public servant. It&#39;s not impossible, but it&#39;s not going to happen until Mullin realizes that he doesn&#39;t know everything about everything, and that the practices that made Mullin Plumbing such a success may not be the same practices that will promote the <em>general</em> welfare over all of the US of A.&#0160;I&#39;m hopeful, but frankly, I&#39;m not at all optimistic.&quot;</p>
<p>Well, the calendar has shed a few leaves, and it&#39;s come to pass as I feared. Representative Markwayne Mullin has no more brain than earwax. He&#39;s learned nothing.</p>
<p>He&#39;s back in the news:&#0160;</p>
<p class="zn-body__paragraph">&quot;An Oklahoma congressman is facing scrutiny after a video&#0160;posted Monday showed him telling constituents at a town hall that they do not pay his salary.</p>
<p class="zn-body__paragraph">“You say you pay for me to do this? That’s bull crap. I pay for myself,” Rep. Markwayne Mullin told constituents at a town hall in Jay, Oklahoma. &quot;I paid enough taxes before I got here and continue to through my company to pay my own salary. This is a service. No one here pays me to go.”</p>
<p class="zn-body__paragraph">“Pays you to go where?” a constituent objected.</p>
<p class="zn-body__paragraph">“This is a service for me, not a career, and I thank God this is not how I make my living,” Mullin responded.</p>
<p class="zn-body__paragraph">“Oh please, then don’t run,” a constituent said.&quot;</p>
<p class="zn-body__paragraph">As I understand the exchange, Mr. Mullin believes that inasmuch as the taxes that he paid before he became a congressman exceeds the salary he now draws, that he has limited or no responsibility to his constituents. Not at all a persuasive&#0160;argument, because like the rest of us, Mullin&#39;s taxes go to the defense department and to HEW with a few dribs and drabs left over for social programs and only a trickle for paying for the House of Representatives</p>
<p class="zn-body__paragraph">But that&#39;s not the heart of the matter. The important question is this: &#0160;why the heck is&#0160;Mullin in congress? Obviously, he hates the job and and even more obviously he hates his constituents. He has no respect for government.</p>
<p class="zn-body__paragraph">Perhaps it&#39;s time for Mr. Mullin to reconsider his career. What everyone wants in a representative is someone who will inform himself, be sensible, broad-minded, be able to work with all parties, and be respectful of his constituents. Mr. Mullin fails on all counts. Let&#39;s assume he&#39;s a good plumber. Look, Oklahoma needs &#0160;good plumbers. Please, Mr. Mullin. Do the work you were called to. Markwayne, go back to where you came from, fix those pipes, and stay away from government. Please, don&#39;t run again. You&#39;ve done your bit; let someone else take a crack at it. &#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>By all rights I should have been attending to the intricate areas of my face while shaving, but I lapsed into a reverie. My obsession of the moment--the beard. Why? Why in the world do human males grow hair on their faces? What&#39;s the point? The beard is completely valueless except to Gillette and Schick and now Harry.&#0160;</p>
<p>If the beard had a genuine function and if it honestly kept a person warm in winter, then for what reason would evolution deprive the gals of equivalent protection?&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Do bearded males garner a larger share of the nubile maidens than the shaved and beardless? Or a disproportionate share of the wealth? I know of no evidence that they do so. The fact that most men shave their beards argues that beards lack power or function.&#0160;</p>
<p>It&#39;s sexual dimorphism without purpose or logic. My guess--and it&#39;s only a guess--is that the beard-gene clung to a gene with a useful male purpose a couple of hundred thousand years ago and never let go. Accidental hirsuteness.</p>
<p>I suppose that there are times when sexual dimorphism can be useful. Those magnificent manes sported by the lions of the Serengeti certainly make a formidable statement--<em>noli me tangere</em> and by the way remember to keep your paws off the the ladies in my harem. I can see that--but then, the males of the enormous extinct European lion managed without a ruff, as do Bengal tigers.&#0160;</p>
<p>The gorgeous display of the male peacock is exuberant but inessential--more subtle birds manage to signal their gender and their availability without such a prodigious waste of resources.&#0160;</p>
<p>I should be relieved that it&#39;s only the beard that I have to worry about. Imagine if by some quirk of evolution, males of my species grew a big rack of antlers. Way more inconvenient than a mere beard. What a bother!! I can easily imagine myself lodged in a narrow doorway, or lying in bed trying to find a comfortable position while the antlers scratch the headboard, put holes in the pillow, or poke the eye of the beloved.&#0160;</p>
<p>Perhaps an advanced civilization would demand that we disbud the antlers at birth? Or we might go the other route and celebrate a magnificent set. We might have evolved into a society that decorated or colored or polished the antlers. &quot;How are you wearing your antlers this winter?&quot; &quot;Natural brown, I think, this year, but with golden highlights.&quot; Chains of &quot;Mr. Antler&quot; or &quot;Antler King&quot; shops (&quot;discount on sharpening this week only&quot;). And for guys declined into the vale of years--prosthetic antlers.&#0160;</p>
<p>Better a beard than antlers. Definitely.</p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2017/04/oreofritteria.html">Deepfried Oreos</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>On the main street of Estes Park (Gateway to Rocky Mountain National Park), a sign outside the restaurant advertised &quot;deepfried oreos.&quot; I was both flabbergasted and thunderstruck, not believing my eyes. But here&#39;s the evidence:</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef01bb09921a68970d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Oreos" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef01bb09921a68970d img-responsive" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef01bb09921a68970d-800wi" title="Oreos" /></a><br />Just above ice cream and below &quot;funnel cakes&quot; (but that&#39;s another story). Is it a hoax, or can there be such a thing? Absolutely,&#0160;there&#39;s many a google-entry on &quot;deepfried oreos.&quot; Several different recipes, one more hideous than the next. A piece of <em>cuisine americaine&#0160;</em>that had somehow escaped me all these many years.&#0160;</p>
<p>One of my waggish friends writes: &quot;I should confess that the last time my wife and I were in Paris, we sampled the deep fried Oreos at a little café on the rue de Rivoli. The sommelier suggested a hearty Cabernet to take the edge off the sweetness of the dish and the wine worked beautifully with the cookie filling, an amalgam of flavors that made our senses tingle.&quot; I of course was skeptical of his story. No knowledgeable sommelier would recommend a red wine because it was well known that deepfried oreos were best served with champagne or gatorade.</p>
<p>Is it possible that deepfried oreos could become part of the cuisine of old Europe? Will it be the case that in every Italian village, just between the <em>macelleria&#0160;</em>and the quaint&#0160;<em>pasticceria&#0160;</em>there will be an <em>oreofritteria?&#0160;</em>A mom-and-pop <em>oreofritteria </em>using recipes that have been in the family for centuries&#0160;-- but in danger of being taken over by the big American chain, a subsidiary of -- who knows what -- called Signor Oreofritto. A terrifying prospect all around. &#0160;</p>
