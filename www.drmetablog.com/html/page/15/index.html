			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>What was it like in the 1940s when I was your age? &#0160;Very different. Milk was delivered daily in bottles: a milk-wagon, drawn by a tired, plodding old horse, appeared on East 9th Street three times a week before we sat down to breakfast. There were also daily visits from a horse-drawn vegetable truck. An itinerant knife-sharpener came once every couple of months. And also a very old man with a large sack thrown over his back, singing out in the loudest voice I&#39;ve ever heard, &#39;I cash clothes.&quot; There were squarish automobiles (Packards, DeSotos, Studebakers), but far fewer than today -- so few that kids would play punchball and stickball right in the middle of the street, just stepping to the side to let that occasional car whizz by. Kids also skated in the street, using clunky metal skates that attached to the shoe by turning a &quot;skate key.&quot; There was no television, but everyone listened to the radio. &quot;Portable&quot; radios were as big as bread boxes. Some people had refrigerators (much smaller than modern ones), but most had &quot;iceboxes.&quot; Every week, an ice delivery man would haul a block of ice (about a foot-and-a-half square if I remember correctly) with large tongs and set it in the icebox. Coal was delivered in barrels: men with heavy gloves would roll the barrels from the truck to the ground-level coal chute. All telephones were attached to the wall with wires. Long distance phone calls were expensive and only for emergencies. People did not communicate by e-mail or by texting, but by means of postcards and letters. A &quot;letter&quot; was a piece of paper on which whole paragraphs were written; it was inserted into an &quot;envelope&quot; and put in a &quot;mail box&quot; for delivery. Hard to believe, I know. There were no word processors. I learned to write using a &quot;straight pen.&quot; There were no dvd&#39;s or cd&#39;s or streaming. Instead, we had &quot;records,&quot; vinyl discs 12-inches in diameter which were placed on a rotating &quot;turntable&quot; on which rested a hand with a stylus, at first steel and then later diamond. It was primitive, I know, but it worked rather well. There were no credit cards. Some people had checking accounts, but 99% of commercial transactions were completed with &quot;money.&quot; When I started at P. S. 217, in 1944, I wore &quot;knickers&quot; (pants that went to just below the knee and were held in place with elastic) and long socks. You can sometimes see knickers in old illustrated books or in clothes museums. Men always wore hats: fedoras or derbies or panamas or bowlers or pork-pies, usually made of felt. Women wore hats too, some with veils, most of them godawful ugly. Young folks &quot;courted.&quot; In those days, before people became intimate, they would go through a period in which they would &quot;date&quot; and talk and get to know each other. This period could last for weeks or even months. Astonishing, I know, but trust me, it happened that way in the old days. &quot;The past is another country; they do things differently there.&quot;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;</p>

<p>Here&#39;s another film in the sub-genre that might be called a &quot;Did I Do It.&quot; &#0160;And still another case of &quot;post-murder amnesia.&quot;</p>
<p>Singleton, who can&#39;t remember anything, even her own first name, is played by Jennifer Jones with a kind of distant unfocused look about her. She is seriously troubled; in addition to her amnesia, she&#39;s been the victim of a prank in which Alan Quinton (Joseph Cotten) wrote her Cyrano-like love letters under the name of the lout Roger Morland. She fell in love with the author of the letters, but alas, deceived, married the lout. Now the lout has been murdered and Singleton, blamed for it, is just out of the mental hospital where she was incarcerated. Did she do it? &#0160;Of course not. She may not have a clue, but Alan and we the audience suspect that she&#39;s too pretty and harmless to have done anything bad, let alone committed a murder. Eventually, the truth outs and the real murderer is revealed. Singleton regains her memory and gains the replacement husband (the eloquent Alan that she wanted all along). It&#39;s a mighty unbelievable story but whenever amnesia is involved, probability goes flying out the window.</p>
<p>Bosley Crowther, the <em>New York Times</em> film critic at the time, who never liked anything, called it &quot;sentimental twaddle.&quot; I myself, once disbelief is not only suspended but obliterated, found it to be a quite an engaging mystery.&#0160;</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I was six years old when the war ended in 1945, so my memories are few and arise in no particular order. I remember hearing news reports on the radio that were datelined &quot;Moscow&quot;-- but I conflated Moscow with Bosco, a brand of chocolate syrup popular in the 1940s. I remember that the floor of our kitchen was disfigured with an infinite number of black marks -- rubber was in short supply and the substituted soles left nasty blotches. My mother said, &quot;We&#39;ll wait until the war is over to replace the linoleum.&quot; Many commodities were in short supply: instead of butter there was a white oleomargerine into which a packet of orange food color was mashed to simulate a credible yellow. There were ration books and ration stamps for gasoline and sugar and coffee and greens. My mother was furious that Mr. Lerner, who owned the fruit and vegetable shop on 18th Avenue, sold black-market lettuces from the back of his store. A bus driver was rude to a passenger; my mother said: &quot;all the decent young men are overseas.&quot; We saved our nickels and brought money to school to buy war bonds. Following government advice, my father dug up his carefully tended lawn and planted a &quot;victory garden&quot; of vegetables. There were frequent blackouts: my father&#39;s friend Jack Patent sported a white hard hat because he was a warden. My Uncle Dan, a major in the Army Air Corps, came home from the Burma border for a thirty-day furlough and showed me his captured German Luger. We received air mail letters from him and from other soldiers with details blacked out by military censors. I complained to my mother: &quot;Mrs. Callery (my first grade teacher) isn&#39;t nice to me.&quot; My mother said, &quot;You have to forgive her; she&#39;s lost four of her boys in the war.&quot; Lost?&#0160; Four of her boys? I did not understand. On a sunny spring day in 1945, we heard on the radio that President Roosevelt was dead; my mother sat on the stoop and cried. And in August of that same year, when our family was visiting someone on a lake somewhere, all of a sudden the adults who had motor boats were zooming back and forth and shouting and laughing. I asked what was happening and my father said, &quot;the war is over.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>Uncle Jack&#39;s tank was demolished by German cannon fire and he was the crew&#39;s only survivor. He lived with shrapnel in his brain until the age of ninety-one. Cousin Saul&#39;s older brother was killed in New Guinea, but Sarah, his mother, &quot;knew&quot; that he was alive and waited for the knock on the door or the telephone call until the end of her days. Meanwhile, the poor fellow&#39;s bones lay bleaching at Buna or some other long-forgotten field of battle. Before the war, my mother told me, we used to receive mail from the old country -- from the many members of the Chafetz and Tomaszewski and Middlebank and Hessel families who had stayed behind. &quot;But after the war, nothing.&quot;</p>
<p>Can we, even now, bear to imagine what became of all those Malkas and Rifkas and Levs and Mendels?&#0160; &#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>This pre-Code film deploys amnesia in a manner that is bizarre and possibly unique. Paul, a playwright, is conducting a no ambiguity, no euphemism affair with the actress Odette. His wife Francoise is jealous, so much so that she shoots and kills her rival. And gets away with it. However, she is overcome with guilt and falls into a profound depression, which the actress Ruth Chatterton portrays convincingly, perhaps because her face lacks&#0160;expression&#0160;even when she is jubilant. It&#0160;appears for a while&#0160;as though Francoise is going to succumb to guilt. However, she is seriously injured in an automobile accident. She is hospitalized but recovers, losing only her memory. But no memory, no guilt, and in the end Francoise has recovered her husband and her health and happily sips martinis on the Riviera. It&#39;s a rare case of therapeutic amnesia. Loss of memory doesn&#39;t create a problem; it solves it. And why is Paul content to re-unite with his wife the murderess?&#0160;Because he is convinced that it is all God&#39;s will&#0160;--&#0160;a mighty shallow expedient. So God too is complicit in the murder and its aftermath.</p>
<p>This was 1934; they couldn&#39;t have made it that way in 1935, when adultery and crime were required to be punished.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s Ruth Chatterton, famous in her day but now almost&#0160;forgotten:&#0160;</p>

<div>Just two days after we watched&#0160;<em>The Scarf&#0160;</em>(1951) along comes&#0160;another case of not &quot;whodunnit&quot; but &quot;dididoit&quot; or better still, &quot;doirememberdoing it.&quot; &#0160;Another case of amnesia, this one implicating Hollywood stalwarts Vera Caspary and Fritz Lang, who should have known better. This time it&#39;s Norah Larkin, a telephone operator well played by Anne Baxter, who picks up a poker and takes a crack at wolf/would-be-date-rapist/nasty-character Harry Prebble (Raymond Burr) and then blacks out. Another case of &quot;stress amnesia,&quot; I suppose.&#0160;After many twists it turns out that Norah may have struck Prebble&#0160;but not hard enough to finish him off -- the real murderer was another of Prebble&#39;s victims, a seduced and abandoned ex-girlfriend.</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>I have to say, once again, that Norah&#39;s amnesia seems less like a medical condition than a very very tired plot gimmick. Memory is lost and regained o so conveniently. &#0160;But the larger implications of the relation of memory to sense of self are left unacknowledged and unexplored.&#0160;</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>Just as in <em>The Scarf,&#0160;</em>Norah recovers her memory and gets the guy -- in this case Casey Mayo, the reliable Richard Conte, who plays a gossip columnist who has just enough brain to solve the mystery.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div><em>The Blue Gardenia&#0160;</em>has been called &quot;feminist,&quot; but if it is, its feminism is mild and unobtrusive. Is it that Norah&#39;s roommate Crystal Carpenter, played by wisecrack-heavy Ann Sothern, keeps her ex-husband and present-boyfriend around strictly for sexual purposes? &#0160;But that&#39;s all the film offers in the way of strong women; Norah herself, after her one moment of reflexive poker-wielding, becomes passive, emotional, incapable of taking action. Passive, she leaves it to others to clear her of guilt.</div>

				<p><a class="image" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:The_scarf_poster_1951_small.jpg"><img alt="The scarf poster 1951 small.jpg" class="thumbborder" data-file-height="347" data-file-width="234" height="326" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/54/The_scarf_poster_1951_small.jpg/220px-The_scarf_poster_1951_small.jpg" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/54/The_scarf_poster_1951_small.jpg 1.5x" width="220" /></a></p>
<p><em>The Scarf</em> is a most curious, eccentric film. Something of its oddity is conveyed by TCM&#39;s one-sentence plot summary: &quot;An asylum escapee meets a waitress and hides on a turkey farm; supposedly he killed someone.&quot; The film was written and directed by E. A. (Ewald Andre) Dupont, one of the many German refugees working in Hollywood during and after the war, and features a splendid cast including John Ireland, Mercedes McCambridge, Emlyn Williams and especially James Barton, in a rather brilliant performance as a good-hearted, grizzled, hermit farmer whose flock of turkeys serves as source of income and as watchdog and possibly as metaphor.</p>
<p>John Howard Barrington escapes from an institution for the criminally insane. It seems that he&#39;s been incarcerated for a murder that he can&#39;t remember committing. Some sort of stress amnesia, the audience is expected to believe. He falls in with Connie Carter, a forthright waitress-singer-floozy: she introduces herself&#0160;succinctly:&#0160;&quot;I&#39;m no lily, not at all. &#0160;But my morals have no zipper. Let it go at that.&quot; &#0160;Connie wears an unusual scarf; when Barrington notices it he regains a smidgen of memory. It&#39;s going to be the clue to resolving his amnesia. &#0160;After many an adventure and some good photography, it is revealed that judge, jury and Barrington himself have been deceived. Barrington is innocent and the real murderer and villain is Dr. David Dunbar, an effete confidence man/psychologist who&#0160;has hidden his own psychopathic past. At the climax, all is revealed (with the help of the scarf) and turns out for the best -- &#0160;Barrington gets the girl, regains his memory and his innocence, and takes up the serious business of farming turkeys.</p>
<p>I found <em>The Scarf</em>&#0160;absolutely riveting although I had to suspend disbelief over the many holes in the plot and some occasional crazy continuity problems. But amnesia movies can be mighty flexible about such details.</p>
<p>And there&#39;s a subtext of theatrical repetition-compulsion: &#0160;Emlyn Williams, who plays the maniac-murderer David Dunbar, &quot;became an overnight star in 1935, with his thriller <em>Night Must Fall</em>, which he wrote and also played the lead role of a psychopathic murderer.&quot;&#0160;</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Last Saturday, we hiked to the multiplex to hear and watch the Met&#39;s HD performance of <em>Idomeneo</em>. Once again, the opera did not disappoint. Early Mozart and glorious, especially the rousing choruses, while soprano Nadine Sierra&#0160;was a luminous Illia. A silly story, of course, but for once there was a happy ending--a young man and a young woman, of different heritages, were allowed to marry--hurrah. Not without the forgiveness of a god--in this case, Neptune, who could have saved everyone a lot of trouble if he had been quicker to act but unfortunately didn&#39;t bother to theophanize until the passing of four hours (including extended intermissions) and three long acts of melodic anguish and dread. &#0160;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I was troubled. &quot;And what was it this time, Mr. Malcontent,&quot; you ask. &#0160;</p>
<p>It was the &quot;trouser&quot; role. The &quot;hero&quot; of the opera, Idamante, the guy who gets the girl, was played by Alice Coote, a soprano, a middle-aged woman not at all &quot;boyish,&quot; but full-figured, prominently bosomed, and generously hipped. She was costumed as an ancient Cretan soldier, with an ineffective corset under her corselet and with a circle of what looked like old-fashioned elongated leather shaving strops or giant bookmarks hanging from waist to ankle. But her outfit did not fool me, even though I&#39;m very good at suspending disbelief. Trust me, I can suspend like crazy. &#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>And I know that there&#39;s no point going to the opera if you can&#39;t suspend disbelief. One would think that once you accept the idea that the performers are going to aria at each other whenever they are together and aria at the audience when they are alone, and that they are followed wherever they go by a 100-piece orchestra, you can believe anything at all. But I have to admit that I boggled at Coote/Idamante and that I was sufficiently distracted that my pleasure in the opera was compromised, diminished. At the climax, I thought, &quot;oh no, don&#39;t let them kiss.&quot; (They didn&#39;t, when they should have, and would have, if Idamante had been not a soprano but a tenor or baritone -- is it possible that the director was as squeamish as I.)</p>
<p>Idamante is customarily (but not always) played by a soprano because the part was originally written for a castrato, in this case Signor Vincenzo del Prato (no doubt known to his buddies as del Prato the castrato, or perhaps, as <em>gli italiani</em>&#0160;would say, <em>del Prato il castrato).&#0160;</em>I suppose that it is considered &quot;authentic&quot; to sing the part in the register in which it was composed. But why not transpose it down an octave and give it to a handsome tenor. Yes, it would be different, but to my&#0160;eyes, much better. After all, authenticity has already been compromised -- &#0160;Alice Coote is no Vincenzo del Prato. Nor do I hear even the most enthusiastic supporters of &quot;period&quot; performances call for&#0160;a restoration of castrati. &#0160;</p>
<p>Shakespeare&#39;s women were played by boys. But even the new Globe, with its fetish for ancient ways, does not insist on a boy Cleopatra or a boy Juliet. And all to the good, in my opinion. &#0160;</p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2017/03/chalaza.html">Chalaza </a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>If you asked me to guess what the word &quot;chalaza&quot; means, I&#39;d say, from its sound, that it would have to be an odd cactus-y looking plant that grows only in the Atacama desert and flowers once a decade, or an extinct language formerly spoken in the southern Caucasus mountains, or perhaps some sort of Levantine breadstick. It&#39;s a strange exotic word. But if then I told you that you&#39;ve seen thousands, perhaps many thousands of chalazas (or chalazae) with your own eyes, and eaten as many, you&#39;d be perplexed, even startled. Because you have eaten them.</p>
<p>Anyone who&#39;s cracked an egg has noticed two ropey white bands that extend from the yolk and are rooted in the transparent albumen. &#0160;</p>
<p>Here&#39;s some more information about chalazae which I quote from Tim Birkhead&#39;s <em>The Most Perfect Thing</em> (2016), a detailed and most enthusiastic book all about eggs.&#0160;&#0160;&quot;<span style="color: #0000ff;">The role of the chalazae is to suspend the yolk within the albumen.... One end of each chalaza is attached to the ovum itself... and the other is firmly lodged in the layer of dense viscous albumen, which itself is attached to the shell membranes at the pointed and blunt ends of the egg. The chalazae allow the yolk to rotate when the egg is turned so that the embryo always remains on top of the yolk and within the inner liquid&#0160;albumen layers. This self-righting ability is [necessary] because the embryo develops on the least dense side of the yolk. Keeping the embryo uppermost ensures that it is always closest to the parent&#39;s brood patch for maximum warmth, but also closest to the inner surface of the shell for maximum access to oxygen.&quot;</span></p>
<p>No chalazae, no chicks.</p>
<p>I&#39;m astonished that although I have scrambled thousands of eggs, and certainly noticed the &quot;ropey strands,&quot; I never gave them the slightest thought. How incurious of me!&#0160;</p>
<p>Birkhead&#39;s book is a revelation. He is the egg man of our times. Occasionally he gets so carried away with his joy in the egg that he veers into unconscious comedy. I adore the phrase, &quot;a renaissance in the study of eggshell pigmentation.&quot; &#0160;Or, &quot;guillemots are not&#0160;quite unique in incubating shit-covered eggs.&quot; &#0160;Or, &quot;tinamous lay the most extraordinary and beautiful eggs.&quot; &#0160;Or, &quot;there is something sensual about eggs.&quot;</p>
<p>About the word chalaza: it&#39;s from the Greek meaning &quot;small knot.&quot; Nor is it new: it entered the language (in Latinized form) in 1704.</p>
<p>Some practical information: the more prominent the chalazae, the fresher the egg.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<div class="thumb tright">
<div class="thumbinner">I had to go to the huge shopping mall the other day and let me&#0160;tell you,&#0160;what a colossal waste of effort! There was nothing for me. Lots of jewelry, fancy duds, shoes. There must have been ten shoe stores for the ladies and almost as many for the guys. But I&#39;ve already stocked up on shoes: I buy multiple pairs of a design that works for me, stow&#0160;them deep in the closet, and pull out a new pair when the one in use springs a leak. Same thing with pants: multiple copies of Lee Regular Fit jeans in a variety of colors, bought online or if I&#39;m in a sociable mood at a shop around the corner. The big malls, with their sun glass huts and perfume counters and candle stores and&#0160; knick-knacks, doo-dads, and tschokes interest me not all. Nor their food courts -- gag. Or their muzak music, programmed to make you want to spend, spend&#0160;and spend again.</div>
<div class="thumbinner">
<p>I can, however, imagine a shopping mall designed for my particular and personal satisfaction. It would be called &quot;The Mall of Me.&quot;</p>
<p>Anchoring one end of the Mall of Me is a large book store, carrying both new and used, but stocked with volumes of history, fine arts, crafts, popular science, biography, travel, fiction, gardening and what used to be called &quot;natural history&quot;, with lots of room to browse and sit and read. Proviso: the &quot;bookstore of me&quot; carries zero books on Spirituality, Self-Improvement, Soul Regression, Tarot, Alternative Therapies, or Healing Arts. No books written by TV pastors or repentant politicians recently released from prison or by instant millionaires. No celebrity autobiographies. At the other end of the Mall of Me, there&#39;s a shop selling music cds which&#0160; specializes in the great age of middle European music from 1685 (birth of Bach) to 1911 (death of Mahler), but also features a treasury of classic blues, bluegrass, American roots, popular song, rock and roll, and gospel of the golden age. No New Age, No Rap, no Electronic. Between my two &quot;anchors,&quot; there will be a good garden store featuring expensive, elegant, heavy-in-the-hand garden tools. No power mowers or power tools, but when appropriate to the season, racks of seeds, preferably of heirloom and antique vegetables. Next to it, a movie memorabilia and poster store, with large collections from the earliest days of cinema right through 1950, especially Shakespeare movies. And then I&#39;d like a high-end antique store displaying walls and shelves of classical and Asian works of art. Unfortunately, because of budgetary constraints, I won&#39;t be doing any purchasing in this particular shop, but I&#39;ll be pleased to browse in it, at least weekly, perhaps oftener. Also, a cafe where a guy could purchase a hot chocolate and an almond croissant. I would also like a store that specializes in 19th and early 20th century Caucasian rugs and wall-hangings though here, once again -- it would be more for appreciating than for actual buying. Subject to the same constraints, a baseball memorabilia shop -- National League only. A high end crafts store. And as for restaurants: a Jewish deli, modeled after the now defunct Second Avenue Delicatessen. An imaginative Asian fusion restaurant. A bagel bakery. No fish, and certainly no sushi. Perhaps a hole-in-the-wall one-person walk-in shop where a guy or gal could help me with computer and cell phone anomalies and failures -- someone who speaks in traditional English, not in acronyms. And then there will be buskers: at one end of the mall, a string quartet; at the other end, a bluegrass band. No fire-eaters, contortionists, or drummers banging on pots and pans. All performers personally vetted by me. No panhandlers or noble solicitors with their dread clipboards.</p>
<p>And of course, some intelligently-designed play areas for infants, new walkers and small children. And some comfortable chairs for their parents (and me) to sit and watch the kiddies frolic.</p>
<p>Yes, I think that will do it. &#0160;It&#39;s the Mall of Me.</p>
<p>Now that I think of it, everyone should have their own mall. Instead of vast mall installations, let&#39;s have targeted malls. Individually designed and executed.</p>
<p>Merchandising genius!!&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>A few years ago I posted, right <a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2011/12/birthday.html%20" target="_self">here</a>&#0160;on this blague, pictures of some handsome objects that would make good birthday presents for yours truly. But one March 11 after another March 11 has come and gone, and -- nothing. Not a single reader, acquaintance, friend, or relative has embraced the opportunity. There has not been so much as a serious inquiry, even though my suggestions were eminently sensible. &#0160;</p>
<p>I&#39;m going to try once again this year. After all, unemployment is down, the stock market is up, and there&#39;s&#0160;more loose change out there. (And perhaps more escapism.) Moreover, there won&#39;t be many more birthdays for me -- I&#39;m getting up there in years. It&#39;s now or never.</p>
<p>So -- fans of Vivian de St. Vrain, and Vrainites everywhere, seize the day.</p>
<p>OK, steady now. What about a castle in Ireland? I would really enjoy a castle. There are many on the market this year, and they&#39;re quite reasonably priced, as castles go.</p>
<p>For example, here&#39;s Ballindooley, a starter Castle in Galway.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef017ee7eeb8ed970d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Castle 1" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef017ee7eeb8ed970d" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef017ee7eeb8ed970d-800wi" title="Castle 1" /></a></p>
<p>Even though it&#39;s small, it has undeniable &quot;curb appeal.&quot; The realtor claims that it was built toward the end of the 15th century in the Norman style and probably for the DeBurgo family. The realtor also notes that there&#39;s &quot;a new stone parapet and that there have been recent repairs to the machicolations.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>Inasmuch as I wouldn&#39;t dream of owning a castle where the machicolations were all busted up, I&#39;m happy for the reassurance. The price: a bargain at a mere 950,000 euros.&#0160;</p>
<p>Though I wouldn&#39;t turn up my nose at Ballindooley, I would certainly prefer Killaghy Castle at Mullinahone in Tipperary.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p><strong><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef017d407a7f89970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Castle2" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef017d407a7f89970c" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef017d407a7f89970c-800wi" title="Castle2" /></a><br /></strong></p>
<p>It&#39;s a better value. The original castle was built, the realtor claims (I haven&#39;t seen the documentation) in the first decade of the 13th century. A &quot;long house&quot; was added during Tudor times, and two more buildings were attached during the 18th century -- so it&#39;s already been updated.&#0160;Plus there are two walled gardens with &quot;excellent mature specimen trees.&quot;&#0160; An ominous note though: &quot;price upon request.&quot;</p>
<p>So, loyal readers, it&#39;s time for you to chip in your pennies and farthings and join together for one big happy birthday celebration for me.</p>
<p>And please, don&#39;t forget that in order for me to care for your gift properly, I&#39;m going to need a bit of an endowment --&#0160; which I do not see as much of a problem. Plus furnishings.</p>
<p>And by the way, for those of you who are not &quot;in the know&quot; about castles, a &quot;machicolation&quot; is a &quot;projecting gallery at the top of a castle wall, supported by a row of corbeled arches and having openings in the floor through which stones and boiling liquids could be dropped on attackers.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>I like a castle that says, &quot;all welcome.&quot;&#0160;</p>

				<p>All my movie-loving friends told me that I must watch Kenneth Lonergan&#39;s&#0160;<em>Manchester-by-the-Sea (2016). </em>That was before the&#0160;film won all those awards. So I crashed the Netflix line and there it was in my mailbox the first day that it was released on disk. And indeed it&#39;s a fine film. No car chases, no special effects, just real people wrestling their way through his world of woe. Good dialogue. Excellent camera work, excellent editing, splendid acting.&#0160;</p>
<p>But half way through the film, I began to experience disappointment. An unavoidable sense of dejavuitude. Wait, haven&#39;t I seen this before? And then I remembered Lonergan&#39;s earlier film, <em>You Can Count on Me (</em>2000<em>).&#0160;</em>Hmmm.</p>
<p>In <em>YCCoM</em>,&#0160;20ish small-town boy Terry Prescott is unsteady and unfocused because he has lost his parents in an automobile accident. in <em>MbtS</em>, 30ish small-town boy Lee Chandler is sullen and isolated because he has lost his children in a house fire. In YCCoM,&#0160;&#0160;Terry Prescott <span style="line-height: 15.6px;">has a nephew, son of his much more grounded sister, with whom he tries to connect. In MBtS, Lee Chandler has a nephew, son of his brother, </span><span style="line-height: 1.2em;">with whom he tries to connect. In </span><em style="line-height: 1.2em;">YCCoM</em><span style="line-height: 1.2em;">, Terry Prescott gets into a fight with a guy he used to know&#0160;very well. In MbtS, Lee Chandler gets into a bar fight with a guy he&#39;s never met.&#0160;&#0160;</span><span style="line-height: 1.2em;">In </span><em style="line-height: 1.2em;">YCCoM</em><span style="line-height: 1.2em;">, Terry Prescott can&#39;t stay put, has to be on the road; in </span><em style="line-height: 1.2em;">MbtS</em><span style="line-height: 1.2em;">, Lee Chandler is stuck at home, can&#39;t get out of his rut.&#0160;</span></p>
<p>The details are different, but it&#39;s unquestionably the same story, inverted. It can almost be thought of as a sequel, with Casey Affleck recapitulating the role created by Mark Ruffalo.&#0160;</p>
<p>They&#39;re both excellent films -- just a trifle redundant. As a would-be enthusiast&#0160;of the later effort,&#0160;I felt just a little cheated. &#0160;</p>
<p>All writers, even the best, repeat themselves.&#0160;Nevertheless, I&#39;m hoping that Kenneth Lonergan&#39;s next picture, to which I&#39;m looking forward with great anticipation, breaks out of the box, tries something entirely new.</p>

				<p>Several times a year, we attend the opera -- that is, we wander over to the Metropolitan Opera widescreen HD broadcasts at&#0160;our local movie theater. Last week, it was Dvorak&#39;s <em>Rusalka</em> --overproduced, over-costumed, a mighty silly&#0160;story,&#0160;but nevertheless glorious. Sung in Czech. Of course, I didn&#39;t understand a word, but then I never do expect to do so, even when the opera is sung in a language with which I&#39;m supposed to be on speaking terms. But it&#39;s not the libretto which we savor, it&#39;s the&#0160;music.&#0160;</p>
<p>Nevertheless at each performance there&#39;s a solemn &#0160;moment when&#0160;language moves front and center. It comes after the preliminary fol-de-rol and acknowledgements and interviews and trailers-for-next-month&#39;s performance are finally dispensed with. Now, at long last,&#0160;the camera locates the head-setted director, who sits at huge intimidating console of buttons and knobs and switches and lights. And now here they come, the words of magic and enchantment: &quot;maestro to the pit.&quot;</p>
<p>In that pithy, incantatory sentence is encapsulated all the ritual power of language.&#0160;It&#39;s a&#0160;hieratic moment.&#0160;After such a magnificent statement, everything else is anticlimax (linguistically speaking).</p>
<p>Freed by these words, the shamanic conductor heretofore invisible, steps up, turns his back to the audience and faces the orchestra, brandishes his baton, and initiates the business of the day.&#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;Maestro to the pit.&quot; &#0160;I love the idea that the generic term for conductor is &quot;maestro.&quot; I love the quasi-oxymoronic juxtaposition of &quot;maestro&quot; and &quot;pit.&quot; &#0160;In fact, I love the word &quot;pit&quot; in this context. Not a hole in the ground, nor the pit of hell, nor a place in which to chuck pieces of dismembered bodies. No, an orchestra pit, which is a&#0160;horse of an entirely different color. Good thing it&#39;s not the custom to say &quot;conductor to the podium.&quot; How flat, how banal, how unsacral.&#0160;No dignity, no grandeur, no poetry.</p>
<p>No, it&#39;s &quot;maestro to the pit.&quot;&#0160;And let it always be so.</p>
<p>And by the way, I make a pretty good barbecue sauce, and I&#39;m proud to say that my spare ribs are semi-famous. Let the word go forth, that now and forever,&#0160;whenever I&#39;m called to the grill, it&#39;s going to be &quot;maestro to the pit.&quot;</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>At the Vivian de St. Vrain Theater, also known as the bedroom, pleasurably supine on what Italians call the l<em>etto matrimoniale,</em>&#0160;we watch films from all decades of cinema history. The new technologies deluge us with riches. Films arrive by mail, by download, and on TCM and MGM and Encore Classics. It&#39;s all so remarkably easy.</p>
<p>We especially enjoy unplanned, spontaneous juxtapositions. Two nights ago, for example, we re-re-re-rewatched, on Encore, a film that must be on everyone&#39;s top ten list, the great noir classic&#0160;<em>Chinatown. </em>Dazzled we were, once again. And then,&#0160;last night, courtesy of the U. S. Post Office and Netflix, along came Carol Reed&#39;s masterpiece, <em>Odd Man Out</em>.&#0160;There was, trust me, no plan to follow the one with the other&#0160;--&#0160;but what a stroke of good fortune!!&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p><em>Chinatown&#0160;</em>(1974) gives us a fully-realized Los Angeles in the 1930s. The plot is complicated but not confusing. J. J. Gittes, a bored, compromised detective, is smart enough to unravel the plan to steal the water and smart enough to identify the murderer but nevertheless too innocent to grasp the unspeakable corruption at the heart of the of Mulwray-Cross family. <em>Odd Man Out</em> (1947), which also manages to make&#0160;its Belfast setting as real as real, offers only the slightest plot -- Johnny McQueen&#39;s desperate attempt to escape his city. Yet what a remarkable story and how ably peopled with a variety of characters. It becomes almost picaresque in organization as Johnny reels from adventure to adventure, encountering Irish samaritans good, bad, and traitorous.&#0160;On the surface the films are miles apart --Los Angeles&#0160;all bright colors and fancy clothes, awash with prosperity, Belfast dark dark dark and gloomy. And yet the two films seemed oddly similar.</p>
<p>The overlaps and echoes were such that we decided to investigate. Here&#39;s what we discovered, via the wikipedia entry on <em>Chinatown.&#0160;</em>&quot;Filmmaker Roman Polanski (the director of <em>Chinatown)</em> has repeatedly cited <em>Odd Man Out&#0160;</em>as his favorite film. &#39;I still consider it to be one of the best movies I&#39;ve ever seen and a film which made me want to pursue this career more than anything else.... &#0160;I always dreamed of doing things of this sort or that style. &#0160;To a certain extent I must say that I somehow perpetuate the ideas of that movie in what I do.&#39;&quot; &#0160;So our speculation about the similarities was validated. Unquestionably, Polanski had Carol Reed in mind while making <em>Chinatown</em>.</p>
<p>Let us cut to the chase and (spoilers coming, so watch out!) concentrate on the two films&#39; last scenes. Johnny McQueen, badly wounded, is trying to make it down to the docks to get himself out of Belfast. He&#39;s helped by his girlfriend Kathleen Ryan. For a hopeful second, it appears that he&#39;s going to escape, but the police surround him. He can no longer see, but he asks Kathleen, &quot;Is it far?&quot; &#0160;Kathleen replies (and you have to be made of stone not to drop a tear), &quot;It&#39;s a long way, Johnny, but I&#39;m coming with you.&quot; She shoots at the police and they respond with &quot;deadly force.&quot; It&#39;s suicide by cop -- a sad emotional love-death Romeo and Juliet ending. The ending of <em>Chinatown&#0160;</em>is much more hopeless. Evelyn Mulwray tries to escape her father, corrupt and powerful Noah Cross. She drives away with her daughter but a fusillade of police bullets kills her. Evil, malevolent Cross wins everything -- the money, the land, the water, the child. (Polanski even altered the original ending to make it darker, more like <em>Odd Man Out</em>.) &quot;Forget it, Jake, it&#39;s Chinatown&quot; -- &#0160;i.e. inexplicable, impenetrable.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>The most erudite man that I ever encountered&#0160;in my own person&#0160;was James Hutton, a professor of classics when I was an undergraduate at Cornell back there in the 1950s. Professor Hutton bristled with knowledge&#0160;-- nor is this my opinion only, but one that is well attested by his international reputation&#0160;and by the list of his writings. Hutton wrote two enormous books (800 pages each!!) that won him his scholarly spurs:&#0160;<em>The Greek Anthology in Italy</em> (1935) and <em>The Greek Anthology in France and</em> <em>in the Latin Writers of the Netherlands to the Year 1800</em> (1946). I encountered Professor Hutton in 1958 when, callow and poorly educated, I enrolled in a Latin course called &quot;Terence and Catullus&quot; (of which more&#0160;later). But first, for those curious readers out there in bloglandia&#0160;who are on tenterhooks, painfully stretched like new wool and are wondering what the&#0160;heck is the&#0160;&quot;Greek Anthology&quot; about which James Hutton composed his pair of <em>magna opera</em>&#0160;and around which his life centered --<em> t</em>urn we now to the pages&#0160;of the <em>Encyclopedia</em> <em>Brittanica.</em></p>
<p>In brief, the <em>Anthologia Graeca</em>&#0160;is a collection of poems, mostly epigrams, that had a complicated ancient history, but originated perhaps with an anthology complied by Meleager of Gadara&#0160;in the first century&#0160;BCE, which brought together works by many ancients including Archilochus, Alcaeus, Anacreon and Simonides&#0160;(all big names in their time). There were a series of early editions that do not survive but an authoritative version was made by Constantine Cephalas&#0160;in the 10th century. &quot;Cephalas appended a number of other collections: homoerotic verse collected by Straton of Sardis&#0160;in the 2nd century AD; a collection of &#0160;Christian&#0160;epigrams found in churches; a collection of satirical and convivial epigrams collected by Diogenianus as well as Christodorus&#39;s description of statues in the Byzantine gymnasium&#0160;of Zeuxippos;&#0160;and a collection of inscriptions from a temple in Cyzicus.&quot; And then in 1300 or thereabouts Maximus Planudes brought together an edition which became standard, which, while adding some poems, also deleted or bowdlerized many of those that offended his puritanical Christian sensibilities. Planudes&#39; anthology was the only one known to Western Europe for many centuries; manuscript transmission was superseded when an edition based on his work was printed in 1494.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a lot more but that&#39;s enough information for us to understand the area which James Hutton worked.&#0160;Professor Hutton knew the anthology backwards and forwards and made it his business to trace&#0160;its considerable influence through&#0160;the Latin and vernacular poetry of late antiquity&#0160;and the&#0160;medieval and renaissance worlds. Quite an endeavor, in my opinion. &#0160;</p>
<p>Hutton was a Scotsman, born in Airth, son of a sea captain, though from where I sat (in a small seminar room in Goldwin Smith Hall!!), it was impossible to imagine that he had ever been a child or even a young man. He came to the US early in life and there was not a trace of Scotland in his speech. Hutton entered Cornell as a freshman in 1920, received three degrees there, stayed on to teach, and retired in 1973. According to his Cornell obituary, he was a life-long bachelor. For most of his adulthood, he lived with his mother, Mrs. Elizabeth Hutton, and he shared a house for many years with Professor Lane Cooper, his teacher and another bachelor Cornell classicist. After the death of his mother and of Cooper, he continued to live at 123 Roberts Place with his cousin/housekeeper, Mrs. Margaret Green. Perhaps he was a delightful presence among his friends, but to my eyes he was a pale, tall, gaunt, dry-as-a stick, bony man devoid of humor or juice. Born only two years before my own father, he seemed to be generations older. &#0160;</p>
<p>Now a few words about Terence and Catullus, the twin subjects of my 1958 Latin classroom experience.&#0160;</p>
<p>Terence (Publius Terentius Afer) was Roman playwright possibly of Berber origin but certainly originally a north African slave. Brought to Rome and freed, he wrote six comedies, adapted from Greek originals, of which we students of Professor Hutton plowed through three: <em>Andria</em> (166 BC); <em>The Self-Tormentor</em>&#0160;(163 BC) and the&#0160;<em>Adelphi</em>&#0160;(160 BC). Terence drowned on a trip to Greece, age 25. His must have been a marvelously romantic life, even though much curtailed. Too bad we know only its barest outline.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the title page to the first &quot;modern&quot; edition of Terence&#39;s works (1496)</p>
<div class="thumb tright">
<div class="thumbinner"><a class="image" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Houghton_Inc_473_-_Terence,_Works.jpg"><img alt="" class="thumbimage" data-file-height="1709" data-file-width="1257" height="299" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/Houghton_Inc_473_-_Terence%2C_Works.jpg/220px-Houghton_Inc_473_-_Terence%2C_Works.jpg" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/Houghton_Inc_473_-_Terence%2C_Works.jpg/330px-Houghton_Inc_473_-_Terence%2C_Works.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/Houghton_Inc_473_-_Terence%2C_Works.jpg/440px-Houghton_Inc_473_-_Terence%2C_Works.jpg 2x" width="220" /></a>
<div class="thumbcaption">
<div class="magnify">
<p>In Terence&#39;s plays, young noblemen dally with prostitutes or mistresses even as their fathers insist that they marry more respectable ladies.&#0160;Plots, often contrived by the dull hero&#39;s wily slave, fail to come to fruition because the conspirators are carelessly overheard. Sometimes apparently unrelated women (one rich, the other poor), turn out to be sisters. Sham marriages and double-dealing are frequent. It is not uncommon that sons discover by accident, in the last scene of the play, the identities of their biological fathers. When there are plans to destroy female infants, the girls are rescued and raised secretly, only to come forward as beauties at a critical juncture of the plot. Young noblemen are prone to breaking into the houses of pimps to carry off the girls they love. Generally, plays end with multiple and suitable marriages, the old folks outwitted and the youngsters carrying the day. Slaves are freed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, characters coin memorable aphorisms&#0160;in succinct, elegant Latin.&#0160;Everyone knows&#0160;&quot;<em>Homo sum, nihil a me alienum puto</em>&quot; &#0160;-- I am a man, nothing human is alien to me. &#0160;But also q<em>uot homines tot sententiae: suus cuique mos --&#0160;</em>So many men, as many opinions; to each his own way. And &quot;f<em>ortis fortuna adiuvat&quot; --&#0160;</em> fortune favors the brave. &#0160;And &quot;nullumst iam dictum quod nos dictum sit prius&quot; --nothing new is said that has not been said before. And &quot;a<em>mantium irae amoris integratio est&quot; --&#0160;</em>lover&#39;s quarrels are the renewal of love.</p>
<p>But with all these comic goings-on and witty sayings, there was not one moment that I can remember when Professor James Hutton laughed or smiled or indicated in the least that the plays were clever or amusing. Instead, we discussed grammatical questions with much emphasis on the differences between second century and first century Latin. Dry as dust, it was. The opportunity to find the common humanity of ancient Romans and 1950s Cornellians was missed, even shirked.</p>
<p>Terence&#39;s louche and lively plots must have posed a problem for Professor Hutton; Catullus&#0160;of Verona,&#0160;a poet of love and sex and bawdy, could only have caused even more of a difficulty. In the edition in which we read Catullus, a drab gray book which must have dated from the early part of the century, certain of the more scabrous poems were omitted but, in a moment of confused prudery, printed -- in a smaller font --in an appendix. I suspect that they were also bowdlerized. Some of the words that Catullus used in his freer verse were not to be found in our dictionary, which had also been cleansed. And in a translation that I consulted (was it the Loeb?) the offending poems did appear, but&#0160;only in Italian. Was the idea that if anyone could read Italian he must be sophisticated enough to deal with Catullan pornography. Perhaps my readers think that I&#39;m fantasizing or imagining this half-hearted censorship, but it&#39;s as true as true. Swear.</p>
<p>Even after all these years, two of Catullus&#39;s poems stay in my mind.&#0160;The best, the most frequently republished and the most influential is known to classicists as Catullus 5. It&#39;s a remarkable poem. Here&#39;s the Latin, which is not difficult.</p>
<p>Vivamus, mea Lesbia, atque amemus</p>
<p>Rumoresque senum severiorum</p>
<p>omnes unius aestimemus assis.</p>
<p>Soles occidere et redire possunt;</p>
<p>nobis, cum semel occidit brevis lux</p>
<p>Nox est perpetua una dormienda</p>
<p>da mi basia mille, deinde centum</p>
<p>dein mille altera, dein secunda centum</p>
<p>deinde com milia multa fecerimus</p>
<p>conturbabimus illa, ne sciamus,&#0160;</p>
<p>aut ne quis malus invidere possitor</p>
<p>cum tantum sciat esse basiorum.</p>
<p>And here&#39;s a translation. &quot;Let us live, my Lesbia, and love. The gossipings&#0160;of stern old men let us value at just one penny. &#0160;Suns may set and rise again, but us, when once the brief light has set, night is one perpetual sleep. Give me a thousand kisses, then a hundred, then another thousand, then a second hundred, then yet another thousand, then a hundred, then when we have counted up many thousands, let us shake [the abacus] lest some evil man be envious when he knows how many kisses there were.&quot;&#0160;That is to say, Let us keep on making love no matter what the old envious guys think. (Lesbia has nothing to do with lesbians; it&#39;s just code for the name of the married woman with whom Catullus was sleeping.) &#0160;</p>
<p>I have no recollection of any discussion of this peach of a poem in 1958. Perhaps we talked about the ingenious lux/Nox juxtaposition, but I am sure we didn&#39;t touch on either the boasted adultery or the joys of sex. We were still in the last gasp of Victoriana. We were pre-Beatles, pre-Kennedy, pre-readily available contraceptives. Some things were not to be discussed.&#0160;</p>
<p>The other poem that stands in my memory is Catullus 61, a joyous epithalamion (or marriage song) which celebrates, with great gusto, the wedding of Vinia and Manlius. It is sensual and almost hypnotic. It&#39;s frankness about sexual pleasure pleased me in 1958, when such things were rare. Still pleases me.</p>
<p>But what about the omitted poems, the ones too &quot;coarse&quot; for our tender eyes and ears? &#0160;How would James Hutton have dealt with them. Not at all, of course. But now, censorship and self-censorship and propriety eased, we can read the poem that begins <em>Paedicabo ego vos et irrumabo</em>. which I can now translate as &quot;I will fuck you in the ass and then fuck you in the face.&quot; And goes on from there. Not part of the 1958 curriculum. In Professor Hutton&#39;s class, we were more comfortable discussing a synezis of the genitive than any exercise of the genitalia.</p>
<p>But I wonder, now, about, James Hutton, at home after a hard day of declining and conjugating, at dinner with his mother and his bachelor roommate. What did Professor Hutton think about Catullus&#39;s &quot;<em>paedicabo ego vos et irrumabo&quot;.</em></p>
<p>This I know: whether repelled or offended or secretly sympathetic, he certainly did not share his feelings with his students.&#0160;</p>

It&#39;s a paraceratherium. Because it was extinct before humans came on the scene and perhaps because it&#39;s not cute or disneyesque, it doesn&#39;t have a common name but I think &quot;really big rhinoceros&quot; fills the bill. You can see from the illustration that it was enormous, much larger than any of our surviving megafauna. It dwarfs the elephant. Sixteen feet tall at the shoulder, according to Donald Prothero, the author of <em>The</em> <em>Princeton Guide to Prehistoric Mammals</em>&#0160;(2017), a page-turner if there ever was one for fans of brontotheres and titanotheres. If you&#39;re reading this post in a room with an eight foot ceiling, double that and you&#39;ll get the idea of the height of a paraceratherium. Six feet taller than the rim of a basket. &#0160;Not to mention the head (skull size 6.5 feet long.) Really big rhinoceros browsed the tops of trees, so that gigantic head must have been held way high in the air. The beast probably weighed somewhere in the range of fifteen to twenty tons.&#0160;Unquestionably imposing.</div>
<div class="thumbcaption">&#0160;</div>
<div class="thumbcaption">Moreover, really big rhinoceros had a long run. It was around for about a million years until it disappeared some twenty million years ago. Changing environment, very likely. Such a huge animal&#0160;and his family and friends would need a tremendous amount of forest for browse. It&#39;s hard to imagine that they had any natural enemies. Who&#39;s going to jump on a paraceratherium? &#0160;On the other hand, they must have made scavengers very happy when they met their very imaginative Maker (who really outdid Himself this time).</div>
<div class="thumbcaption">&#0160;</div>
</div>
<div class="thumbinner">I wish really big rhinoceros was&#0160;still around. I would have liked to have seen a herd at browse.&#0160;Or just listened to the thump-thump-thump of their feet as they wandered about.</div>
<div class="thumbinner">&#0160;</div>
<div class="thumbinner">We could put a few, perhaps a couple of paraceratherium cows and their babies and maybe one large bull, right out there in the back field. But how would we fence them? &#0160;Or feed them, after they&#39;d stripped the birches and the oaks? &#0160;How many truckloads of hay does an adult paraceratherium eat&#0160;in a day?&#0160;&#0160;What size barn would we need to house them during the long winter months?&#0160;</div>
<div class="thumbinner">&#0160;</div>
<div class="thumbinner">On the whole, I am forced to admit that although picturesque, paraceratherium would be&#0160;a&#0160;very&#0160;expensive, inconvenient pet.</div>
<div class="thumbinner">&#0160;</div>
<div class="thumbinner">And then there&#39;s the scat. Contemporary rhinocerotes are famous for making &quot;communal dung piles.&quot; &#0160;Did their ancestors also do so? &#0160;I can imagine some truly formidable foothill-size formations.</div>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>According to his biographer (Peter Ackroyd), Alfred Hitchcock &quot;feared and hated the body.&quot; When he was a student at St. Ignatius in London, whenever he used the lavatory, he scrubbed it &quot;so that it seemed as though no one had been there.&quot; At maturity, Hitchcock stood 5&#39; 5&quot; and weighed approximately 300 pounds. His marriage to Alma Reville (4&#39;11&quot;) was mostly &quot;white.&quot; He claimed that it was &quot;sexless&quot; and that he was a &quot;celibated&quot; director, and that his daughter, Patricia, was some sort of error. &quot;If he was not the center of conversation or attention at a dinner table, he would often doze off.&quot; He made a bet that a property man would not be able to spend the night chained to a camera in a dark studio, then sabotaged him with a bottle of brandy laced with a strong laxative. He referred to his audience as the &quot;moron millions.&quot; He was fond of the great painters but had no interest in any &quot;symbolic significance or inner meaning.&quot; The actress Ann Todd reported that he had a schoolboy&#39;s obsession with sex and &quot;an endless supply of very nasty and vulgar stories and jokes. He was a very sad person.&quot; He &quot;had a fetish about women wearing glasses.&quot; One of his secretaries reported that he bought her five or six pairs but if she appeared without wearing one, &quot;it irritated the devil out of him.&quot; During the making of<em> Psycho</em>, Hitchcock would place one or more grotesque models of Norman Bates&#39; mummified mother in Janet Leigh&#39;s dressing room, just to hear her scream. &quot;He would also regale her with his fund of dirty stories just before she went on camera.&quot; When asked, &quot;what is the deep logic of your films,&quot; he replied, &quot;to make the spectator suffer.&quot; When an actor was dissatisfied with a performance, Hitchcock refused another take, saying, &quot;They&#39;ll never know in Peoria.&quot;&#0160;While &quot;The Birds&quot; was being filmed, he harassed Tippi Hedren mercilessly, sending her flowers, specifying what clothes she could wear, keeping her from her daughter, trying to convince co-workers that they were having an affair.&#0160;He gave Hedren&#39;s young daughter (Melanie Griffith) an image of her mother lying in a coffin. Hitchcock&#39;s recurrent dream was that his penis was made of crystal.&#0160;</p>
<p>Is it possible that so stunted a human being might become a great artist? &#0160;Or is it rather that his obsessions, distortions and failures of human empathy constitute a permanent barrier to greatness and that time will reveal that even his best films are shallow and brittle -- all surface glitter?</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>The twins and their older brother came to visit and were playing their favorite new game, &quot;hide the goose.&quot; The goose? &#0160;a two foot tall hollow plastic replica perhaps originally a lawn ornament, now an excellent child&#39;s toy. Easy to find. After the hiding game&#0160;had gone on long enough, and was just starting to become a trifle rambunctious, I tried to signal to my fellow student of Italian that the time had come for the goose to retire for the day -- but try as I might, I couldn&#39;t come up with a translation for the word goose. Later, after the lads had left, I looked in the Italian dictionary for&#0160;&quot;goose.&quot;&#0160;<em>Oca</em>, it said.<em>&#0160;</em>A strange, unanticipated word. &#0160;</p>
<p>I tried to recall the Latin word for goose. Nothing. But after several hours (and here comes the point of the story), a word suddenly floated to the surface -- <em>anser</em>. Let me tell you now, fans of Dr. Metablog, that I was exceedingly proud of myself. Fifty-five years or so after my last study of Latin, out popped <em>anser.&#0160;</em>Self-celebration knew no bounds.</p>
<p>After I had stopped crowing about my triumph, I started to marvel at the brain -- not just my brain, but any brain. In what corner of the brain, in what concatenation of synapses, had the word <em>anser</em> been lurking&#0160;lo these many decades. And what sort of ingenious search program needed only a few hours to ferret it out? <em>&#0160;</em>Glaciers have melted, rivers have changed their course, and yet anser remained unchanged, permanently embedded somewhere in my brain. It&#39;s kind of miraculous, isn&#39;t it?</p>
<p>So how did Italian acquire <em>oca</em>&#0160;rather than a word descended from <em>anser.&#0160;</em>Why not *asse, for example. My dictionary of classical Latin offers no alternative to <em>anser</em>, but&#0160;the&#0160;Italian etymological dictionary explains that the late Latin word for goose was&#0160;<em>auca,&#0160;</em>derived from a diminutive a<em>ucellus</em> of <em>avis</em> (bird) and it cites as cognates old French <em>oue</em> and Occitan <em>auca</em>. No doubt demotic auca replaced the &quot;book word&quot; anser sometime in late antiquity. &#0160;</p>
<p>The result of this investigation: next time, I will be able to say, with great authority, &quot;nascondi l&#39;oca.&quot;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Years ago, I read, in translation of course,&#0160;a few of Leonardo Sciascia&#39;s Sicilian mysteries. Excellent books: T<em>he Day of the Owl</em> (<em>Il giorno della civetta -- 1</em>96<em>1)</em>), <em>Equal Danger</em>&#0160;(<em>Uguale pericolo --1973</em>), <em>The&#0160;Challenge (Il contesto--</em>1971). Last week I tried to read one of Sciascia&#39;s short stories in its native Italian. A good idea, but quite a struggle. Too taxing for my present fluency. Sciascia&#39;s vocabulary is enormous, mine is puny. Not to mention Sicilian&#0160;expressions that would be stumpers and require footnoting even for mainland&#0160;Italians.</p>
<p>The story I tackled is Il lungo viaggio, (The Long Voyage). Some impoverished Sicilian peasants pay a man whom we would call a coyote to smuggle them into America; he takes their entire savings, takes them on board his ship, and then after ten excruciating days sets them right back down in Sicily. A sad tale of exploitation, not, alas, irrelevant today.&#0160;</p>
<p>Sciascian geography: the Sicilians think they are headed for the middle Atlantic coast of North America, where they will find Nugioirsi, Nuovaiorche, and my very favorite, Brucchilin.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>On the whole, Italian is a mighty regular language. Of course it has its irregularities,&#0160;but many fewer than, say, English. Plurals, for example, are largely predictable, but with some curious exceptions. The masculine noun <em>bue (ox&#0160;</em>or sometimes, by extension, a dolt) seems to call for the plural form *bui, but it&#39;s not&#0160;so;&#0160;it&#39;s <em>buoi</em>. <em>Dio&#0160;(</em>god), becomes dei rather than *dii. The very ordinary word <em>uomo&#0160;(</em>man), yields the extraordinary plural <em>uomini</em>&#0160;-- which is strange indeed except to oldsters who remember <em>homo, hominis </em>from their high school Latin class.&#0160;The word for wing is <em>ala</em> and, if Italian were law-abiding, its plural should be *<em>ale&#0160;</em>but instead it&#39;s <em>ali. </em>Similarly, arma should yield *arme, but doesn&#39;t; it&#39;s armi.&#0160;<em>Eco</em> has the plural <em>echi</em>, which seems normal, except that the singular is feminine and the plural masculine, so <em>la eco</em> but <em>gli echi. </em>Some words, conversely, have masculine singulars&#0160;but feminine plurals: most notably, <em>uovo</em> (egg) which becomes <em>uova</em> rather than&#0160;*<em>uovi</em>, while <em>dito</em> (finger) becomes the odd masculine <em>dita</em>. <em>Paio</em> (pair) is similar; its plural is <em>paia</em>. <em>Il riso</em> (a laugh) has the plural <em>le risa</em>. There&#39;s the same gender switch with the&#0160;truly curious word for&#0160;ear -- <em>orrechio</em> becomes <em>orecchie.</em> There are a few words with two slightly different plural forms, many of them words for parts of the body, such as <em>braccio</em>&#0160;(arm) which can become <em>bracci</em> or <em>braccia</em>; &#0160;c<em>iglio</em> (eyebrow), which has plurals in<em> cigli</em> and <em>ciglia</em>; <em>ginocchio</em> (knee) which can be either <em>ginocchi</em> or <em>ginocchia</em>, and <em>osso&#0160;(</em>bone)&#0160;which can be <em>ossi</em> or <em>ossa</em>. I&#39;m fond of <em>muro (</em>wall) the regular plural of which is muri (the walls of a house) but also yields the irregular plural&#0160;<em>mura, </em>which refers to the&#0160;fortifications or walls of a city.&#0160;</p>

				<p>If it happened in Brooklyn, it must have happened in metaphorical or mythological rather than real Brooklyn, because it&#39;s not the Brooklyn of my memory. <em>It Happened in Brooklyn&#0160;</em>is a 1947 musical, I guess you&#39;d have to call it, featuring still skinny Frank Sinatra and womanly Kathryn Grayson, and also Jimmie Durante, who steals the show. And also the ever-luminous Gloria Grahame in a very small role as an Army nurse in England. Brooklyn is evoked as a fairy tale land where everyone is nice to everyone and jobs and money fall from the trees -- kind of an urban big rock candy mountain. Not the case -- though nowadays Brooklyn, which used to be mocked, is every Twenty-Something&#39;s land of putative milk and theoretical honey. In truth there&#39;s nothing much that is recognizably Brooklynian -- even in geography -- to my jaded old eyes except a rather beautiful sequence of Frank Sinatra singing and &quot;dancing&quot; on Brooklyn Bridge. Most of the action supposedly takes place in the basement of New Utrecht High School, but in actual fact it&#39;s a Hollywood sound stage.</p>
<p>Sinatra, a returned soldier, thinks he&#39;s in love with Kathryn Grayson but she prefers Peter Lawford, playing the shy grandson of an English Dook. The film is worth seeing if only because Sinatra and Grayson sing, believe it or not, &quot;La ci darem la mano&quot; from <em>Don Giovanni --&#0160;</em>as far as I know Sinatra&#39;s only foray into grand opera.</p>
<p>If I had been the screenwriter, I would have had Gloria Grahame jump on a luxury liner and return to Brooklyn for the climactic concluding scene, rather than remaining, as she does, merely a sweet overseas memory of Frankie&#39;s.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>On successive nights, we watched&#0160;<em>Out of the Past&#0160;</em>(1947) and&#0160;<em>Angel Face (</em>1953). Both are, as they say, &quot;gripping&quot; films. In my present situation, &quot;gripping&quot; means that even though the nominal curtain rose on these movies after 9:00 pm, and I was in bed, comfortable, with a full stomach, I was sufficiently gripped that I didn&#39;t waver or snooze or nap, even for a second. Such criteria of excellence may not seem significant to younger folk, but trust me, loyal readers, in these latter years, staying awake and engaged is&#0160;a crucial critical yardstick. &#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>Both <em>Out of the Past</em> and <em>Angel Face</em> are superior <em>noirs</em>. In both films the central character is played by Robert Mitchum.&#0160;I couldn&#39;t detect a the least tad of difference between&#0160;the&#0160;two parts he plays. You could lift his&#0160;Jeff Bailey from <em>Out of the Past</em> and plunk him down in <em>Angel Fac</em>e as Frank Jessup and no one would notice, except that civilian Frank would lack private-eye Jeff&#39;s semi-official trench coat and fedora. In both films, Mitchum&#39;s character is expressionless and sleepy-eyed and smart but, once his testosterone kicks in, falls prey to a clever, ruthless bad bad bad girl. Both characters know that they&#39;re being framed for murder and yet can&#39;t just pack up and move to Nebraska or Mexico or somewhere&#0160;sensible -- as any human being outside of the world of <em>noir</em> would&#0160;do.&#0160;You, the spectator, want to raise yourself from your soft pillow and shout at the TV and at the guys Mitchum plays, &quot;Hey you big lug, what the heck are you doing. Use your noodle.&quot; But lunkhead Mitchum makes mistake after mistake. I hope everyone who&#39;s reading this post has seen the movies,&#0160;because I don&#39;t want to spoil their pleasure&#0160;in the endings, but let me just say this --&#0160;Jeff, or Frank, or Bob, please next time don&#39;t get into an automobile&#0160;with a homicidal <em>femme fatale</em> in the last few frames&#0160;of a murder mystery and expect to escape alive. And if you must &#0160;do so, at least check your so-called girlfriend&#39;s purse for a silver-handled Beretta. And under no circumstances surrender to her the keys to the vehicle. Do the driving yourself.</p>
<p>These films have everything one would want in a classic f<em>ilm noir: </em>a relentless wicked ambitious beautiful dame who entraps an honest but naif and helpless ingenu, and also snappy dialogue, a gloomy claustrophobic atmosphere, multiple plot twists and turns, and the valueless atomistic society that Hobbes feared would follow from curtailed authority. And much yearning for cash, which is never in adequate supply. Lots of shadows and odd-angled photography. Some good, complicated characters but a&#0160;few&#0160;who are merely melodramatically evil.&#0160;</p>
<p>Mitchum&#39;s acting is much praised of late but I don&#39;t buy it: he&#39;s effective in a way but monochromatic to a fault. A better actor is Kirk Douglas, who &#0160;projects gleeful menace as a corrupt, criminal businessman. But to me both movies are carried by their female leads. Dazzling Jane Greer as Kathie Moffat is equally adept at innocence and villainy, often in the same scene, sometimes from moment to moment. At the end of the film, when she&#39;s killing people left and right, she wears a nun-like snood that only an accomplished actress could transform into a brilliant metaphor. Equally splendid is Jean Simmons as the angel-faced Diane Tremayne, who conveys innocence, ambition, obsession, and intermittent but genuine madness with the raise of an eyebrow (and the help of excellent lighting). And good girl Mona Freeman shines in a restaurant scene in which she sees right through Tremayne&#39;s beauty to the dangerous craziness beneath. &#0160;</p>
<p>Here&#39;s Mitchum and Greer together.</p>

				<p>I wrote the following long ago, republished it once. Here it is, relevant again.</p>
<p><strong>What Doesn&#39;t Dick Cheney Commit Suicide?</strong></p>
<p>Why doesn&#39;t Dick Cheney put a bullet in his brain?&#0160;It would do him (and his reputation) a world of good. What could possibly stand in his way?&#0160;Once he sprinkles the ratsbane on his porridge -- and, of course, leaves behind a detailed and humble letter of apology --&#0160; he will begin to free his soul of sin and to enjoy some peace of mind.&#0160;When he has fallen on his sword, his lackeys and toadies will be able to claim that although&#0160;he was a black-hearted knave, at least he wasn&#39;t a shameless black-hearted knave.&#0160;They can try to persuade us that although he was egregiously and dangerously wrong, he was, like another suicide, Othello, &quot;great of heart.&quot; But if Cheney continues in his surly, obstinate, unapologetic lip-curling silence -- why then, he&#39;ll go down in the books as an unrepentant demi-devil like Iago (&quot;From this time forth I never will speak word&quot;).&#0160;</p>
<p>Cheney has brought disgrace upon our beloved nation and upon himself.&#0160;Using faked spy data, he suckered the ignorant, feckless Decider and almost the entire Congress into invading Iraq.&#0160;His war has been a monumental disaster.&#0160;&quot;Full of scorpions [should be] his brain.&quot;&#0160;At this moment of writing, Cheney is guilty of killing 3260 American soldiers and maiming (by official count -- who can possibly guess at the truth?) 24,314 others.&#0160;If Cheney has even the most rudimentary of consciences, on it lies the heavy burden of 60,000 to 100,000 Iraqi souls.&#0160;The Dickster has cost America $414 billion dollars, loss of prestige and the squandering of oceans of good will.&#0160;Like Anthony, he &quot;has lived in such dishonor/That the gods detest [his] baseness.&quot; But Antony took the proper course.&#0160;When Cheney dispatches himself -- &quot;after the high Roman fashion,&quot; let&#39;s hope -- he&#39;ll have taken the first step toward rehabilitating himself and the nation.&#0160;For him not to do the deed would be ignoble.&#0160;</p>
<p>Dick:&#0160; I know that you&#39;re hunkering in your bomb-proof shelter. I know that you&#39;re up late at night, sleepless with guilt.&#0160;You&#39;re cruising the internet, perchance googling &quot;Cheney + suicide,&quot; and you&#39;re wavering in your purpose.&#0160;Dick -- take my considered advice.&#0160;I&#39;m thinking of your place in history.&#0160; At this point, &quot;you have no friend,/ But resolution and the briefest end.&quot;&#0160; You&#39;ll immediately feel better. It&#39;s a no-brainer.&#0160;Go for it.</p>
<p><em>April 10.</em>&#0160; Spike Schapiro comments:&#0160; &quot;Dr. M. -- I&#39;ve read your exhortation to suicide. You are, as usual, falsely optimistic. Cheney can&#39;t off himself because a) he&#39;s shameless and b) he&#39;s a total coward, and c) he has no self-knowledge and d) he can&#39;t point a shotgun. You cite the precedents of Othello and Anthony but they&#39;re both great spirits and therefore irrelevant. Cheney is a slug. Moreover,&#0160;Cheney can&#39;t be &quot;great of heart&quot; -- he has no heart of his own --it&#39;s either a transplant or some mechanical contraption.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p><em>April 4, 2014&#0160; </em>Why is this man still alive?&#0160; Allowed to give interviews?&#0160; Is there no justice in our&#0160;sublunary world?&#0160;</p>
<p>December 22, 2016 &#0160;Only a silver stake in his heart is going to do it. Mirrors, garlic. Too late for prayers.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I&#39;m marvelously fond of the Italian word &quot;fango,&quot; which translates into English as &quot;mud.&quot; &quot;Fango&quot; is expressive of the matter which it describes. To my ear, the word fango sounds slimy and disreputable, perhaps even repulsive, while its English counterpart &quot;mud&quot; is bland and lacks character. And &quot;fangoso&quot; is so much more dramatic than &quot;muddy.&quot;</p>
<p>But why fango? &#0160;How did fango infiltrate the Italian language? The Latin word for mud is &quot;lutum,&quot; which would naturally yield Italian &quot;luto&quot;, which, as it happens, is a word that does exist, but, so far, one that I&#39;ve encountered only in dictionaries. Fango it is, and gladly. Let us revel in fango.&#0160;</p>
<p>Fango, according to my bank of etymological resources, appears to be of Germanic origin and a distant cousin to the English word &quot;fen,&quot; &quot;a low land covered in whole or part by water.&quot; Lots of fango in that there fen, obviously. There&#39;s also a rare (my dictionary says &#39;poetical&#39;) French word &quot;fange,&quot; for mud, but the more common word is boue. Boue is one of a handful of French words (other than toponyms) that are of Gaulish origin.&#0160;So that when it came to mud, both the Italian and French languages adopted indigenous rather than Latin words. And for good reason: if there&#39;s any substance that is common rather than learned, it&#39;s mud. &#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;Fango&quot; bears no relation to English &quot;fang.&quot; Fang is an oversized tooth, but not in its earliest appearances. Old English fang denoted&#0160;plunder or booty, &quot;a seizing or taking.&quot; The root meaning of grasp or capture is present in the name of Good Master Fang, an ineffectual officer of the law in Shakespeare&#39;s <em>The Second Part of King Henry the Fourth</em>. Yet fang as unquestionably tooth or toothy in Duke Senior&#39;s metaphor in <em>As You Like it</em>, where &quot;the icy <span class="keyword1">fang/&#0160;</span>And churlish chiding of the winter&#39;s wind,... <em>bites</em>&#0160;and blows upon my body.&quot;</p>

				<p>One of the most joyful of nursery rhymes, and a personal favorite, is this brilliant piece of poetry: &#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160; Crosspatch,</p>

<p>&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160; Sit by the fire and spin.</p>
<p>&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160; Take a cup,</p>
<p>&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160; And drink it up.</p>
<p>&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160; Then call the neighbors in.</p>
<p>The clicky rhymes and jaunty meter are undeniably beautiful -- and there&#39;s much more complexity than first meets the eye. &#0160;</p>
<p>In the first triad, a &quot;crosspatch,&quot; -- a &quot;cross or ill-tempered person, usually a girl or woman&quot;-- is at work, spinning; in the second triad, she&#39;s exhorted to drink and also to invite her neighbors &quot;in&quot; -- presumably into the room, or just as likely, the tiny cottage-- where she lives alone. In the first strophe, the theme is isolation, but in the second, isolation is challenged by the calls of society and by the hope of a more satisfactory and convivial life.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>What can we know about the surly individual addressed by the evocative designation, &quot;crosspatch?&quot;&#0160; The first element in the name --&quot;cross&quot;-- implies not only sourness, but also resistance, as in &quot;cross-grained.&quot; The second element--&quot;patch&quot;-- suggests that the crosspatch&#39;s discontent is not without cause. We can infer that she&#39;s poor because she&#39;s a person whose garments are either assembled from various rescued materials, as in &quot;patchwork,&quot; or that her clothes are, in another sense of the word patch, repaired. In addition, it&#39;s possible that ill health has caused her skin to become &quot;patchy.&quot; But &quot;patch&quot; also signals a degree of mental stress, as in Shakespeare&#39;s &quot;patched fool.&quot; In this signification, patch derives from Italian <em>pazzo</em>, crazy. The crosspatch is therefore disabled physically, socially and psychologically.</p>
<p>At the outset of the poem, our &quot;crosspatch&quot; sits glowering, impoverished, perhaps muttering indistinctly, friendless, without family, her youth blighted by poverty, huddled against the last embers of her dying fire. What is it that she is spinning? No doubt she ekes out a meagre living in the impersonal mercantilist &quot;putting-out&quot; system. Some exploitative proto-capitalist venturer has delivered to her lonely door a quantity of unspun wool or cotton; her job is to return the material to him in the processed form that will then be passed on to an equally poor weaver, then to a tailor, etc. She works alone and never sees the fruits of her labor except for the occasional, paltry farthing that allows her a bare subsistence. No wonder she is slightly barmy and has &quot;drawn the latch&quot; -- closed herself off from her fellows. But then, suddenly, comes the antistrophe, and in a series of importunate injunctives the crosspatch is solicited to rejoin the company of humanity. &quot;Take a cup,/ And drink it up,/ Then call the neighbors in.&quot; What&#39;s in the cup?&#0160; Spiritous liquors, no doubt, which, though designed to dull the pain of wage-slavery, also act to augment the revelry with which the poem climaxes. The wine is not sipped, but it is drained to the lees. And once the door is unlatched, and the neighbors -- neighbors of both sexes, no doubt,-- are called &quot;in,&quot; why then, let the libations and the wild rumpus begin!&#0160; Alienated labor is suddenly set aside and replaced by the natural bonds of one human being to another, and the stasis of the opening lines of the poem transforms in a flash into a wildly kinetic bacchanal. Emotional weakness transmutes into healthy liberated pleasure. Dour Puritanism, with its punishing work ethic, yields to the spirit of holiday and to pagan, perhaps even dionysian, excess. Here, in miniature, is the essence of the comic vision. In a few powerful lines, freedom, good humor, and natural appetite triumph over bondage, artificiality, social constriction and repression; the justifiably sullen crosspatch, in a burst of energy, reintegrates herself into the social nexus from which she has been banished.</p>
<p>Whether or not the crosspatch can permanently liberate herself from the oppressions of industrial capitalism, or whether the anodyne and spurious relief of alcohol is a merely transient solution is left unresolved. To ask a short poem, however dense with meaning, to answer so difficult a question would, just possibly, be to ask too much of it and, perhaps, to push the evidence the merest tad too far.</p>

				<p><em>Carinate</em>, which sounds vaguely dental, actually describes the shape of a particular kind of ceramic or metal vessel. An object which has a rounded base and inward sloping sides is &quot;carinated.&quot; <em>Hypogea</em>, which is drawn directly from Greek under (hypo) and earth (gaia) means, obviously, underground, but in the world of&#0160;archaeology generally refers to an underground temple or tomb. Catacombs and crypts, therefore, are both hypogea. A <em>megaron</em> was the great hall of a Grecian palace but archaeologists use the word to describe the large entrance room of any substantial structure. An <em>exedra</em> is a semicircular recess set into a building&#39;s facade. It think of it, perhaps incorrectly, as a half of a rotunda. A <em>plinth</em> is the base or platform on which a column or statue rests. <em>Ashlar</em> is finely dressed stones, generally in the shape of a&#0160;cube or a rectangular solid. Ashlar construction is therefore different from rubble masonry, in which walls are made of irregularly shaped or found stones.&#0160;A <em>tophet</em> is a burial place for children either sacrificed or dead of natural causes; it&#39;s a word of Hebrew origin and recalls the valley near Jerusalem&#0160;n which ancient Canaanites sacrificed children to Moloch or Baal. I&#39;m embarrassed that I apparently never encountered the word<em> annona,&#0160;</em>which characterizes the grain supply of the city of Rome in ancient times. &#0160;Annona, the common noun, is also personified or deified as &quot;a theophany of the emperor&#39;s power to care for his people through the provision of staples.&quot; Annona, the goddess, is sometimes assimilated to her compatriot Ceres.&#0160;<em>Acephalous </em>means headless, and describes &quot;clerics not under a bishop&quot; or lines of verse missing a first foot. In archaeology, it&#39;s a&#0160;decapitated statue.&#0160;A <em>cist</em>&#0160;is simply a stone-lined grave or shaft.</p>
<p>These splendid words are drawn from&#0160;<em>Shepherds, Sailors &amp; Conquerors, Archaeology and History in Sardinia from the Stone Age to the Middle Ages&#0160;</em>by Stephen Dyson and Robert Rowland, 2007, which I read with great care, enjoying especially the middle chapters on Sardinia&#39;s fascinating nuraghagic civilizations. &#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>&quot;Orts&quot; is a rare but tasty word. Orts are the bits of bones, gristle, stems, skins, pits and other inedibles that are left on the plate after one finishes eating -- the stuff that is scraped directly into the garbage can. Orts are to be distinguished from &quot;leftovers&quot; which are the uneaten remains of the meal that are carefully sequestered for tomorrow&#39;s breakfast. Leftovers good, orts bad.</p>
<p>Shakespeare uses &quot;orts&quot; twice in the plays, both times metaphorically. The first instance is in <em>Julius Caesa</em>r, when Anthony tells Octavius how little he values his colleague Lepidus. According to Anthony, Lepidus is &quot;A barren-spirited fellow; one that feeds/ On abjects, orts and imitations.&quot; In this instance, orts seems to be prompted by the word &quot;feed.&quot; A second appearance of the word orts is in<em> Troilus and Cressida.&#0160;</em>Troilus has discovered that his beloved Cressida has been playing at fast and loose with Diomedes: &quot;The bonds of heaven are slipp&#39;d, dissolved, and loosed/&#0160;And with another knot, five-finger-tied,/&#0160;The fractions of her faith, <span class="keyword1">orts</span> of her love,/ The fragments, scraps, the bits and greasy relics/ Of her o&#39;er-eaten faith, are bound to Diomed.&quot; It&#39;s a strong speech and &quot;orts of her love&quot; is a powerful phrase, though rather obscure nowadays to audiences for whom the &quot;ort&quot; is a mystery --which certainly includes contemporary audiences.</p>
<p>Whether Shakespeare&#39;s first audiences would have required a footnote for orts I do not know. It was never a frequently used word, though the OED attests its presence in the language from 1440 to 1880. I don&#39;t know of any recent usages, but once, when I was at lunch with a group of professional Shakespeareans, I asked at the close of the meal, &quot;What do we do with the orts&quot; -- everyone at the table knew exactly what I meant. Rather a specialized audience, however.</p>
<p>Orts should not be confused with Oorts. The Oort cloud is the presumed boundary of the solar system, way out there, ten times further than Neptune, where the comets are thought to reside until they are dislodged from their proper home and come hurtling toward the inner planets. Orts and Oorts are both leftovers, in the sense that they are the remains of an original creation, in the one case chicken pot pie and in the other the universe. Orts are much smaller but more palpable than Oorts. Makes a guy wonder what could possibly be denoted by ooorts? Or oooorts?</p>

				<p>A textbook example of the unthinkable actually happening:</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s good to be the king,&quot; says Mel Brooks (as Louis XVI) in T<em>he History of the World, Part I</em>, lifting the skirt of one of his lovely courtieresses in order to dry-hump her. It&#39;s make-believe Hollywood pseudo-licentiousness. It&#39;s outrageous, beyond the pale, and hilarious as long as it stays in the movie.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s good to be star,&quot; says Trump, bragging about his license to kiss women and grab them by their &quot;pussies.&quot;</p>
<p>What in comedy is amusing is in real life simply grotesque -- as is the perpetrator of the atrocity, the maniacal Republican candidate for the most powerful office on earth.&#0160;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Elsa Morante, the distinguished Italian novelist, spent the war years in what might be called internal exile, holed up, hungry, with her friend and later husband Alberto Moravia in a one-room hut in Sant&#39;Agata (both Morante and Moravia were half Jewish). After Mussolini and his mistress Clara Petacci were arrested and shot, hung upside down for all to see, Morante wrote about her countrymen that &quot;all of Mussolini&#39;s faults were either tolerated or encouraged and applauded. Thus a people who tolerate the faults of their head of state are complicit with these faults. But if they encourage and applaud them as well, it is worse than being an accomplice, it makes them an accessory to these faults.&quot; Mussolini was, according to Morante, a mediocre man, a crude man, a man outside the culture. But Mussolini was also a perfect exemplar of the Italian people who, she claimed, were such that they would rather given their vote to a strong man than to a just man, and if they had to choose between their duty and their profit -- even if they knew what their duty was -- they would choose their profit.</p>
<p>It is difficult not to see an analogy to our beloved country at this election season.</p>
