					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2015/10/rush-.html">Liberal Water on Mars??</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Egregious Rush Limbaugh, who ranks number three&#0160;on my list of the people who, in the course of my&#0160;lifetime, have done the most damage to the United States of America (Dick Cheney and Antonin Scalia are one and two and Dick Nixon&#0160;only slithers in at number 6) speaks&#0160;a language that is extraordinarily difficult to parse.&#0160;His sentences are shapeless, wayward, and undiagrammable, equally indifferent to the conventions of language and the rules of logic.&#0160;When you&#39;re fact-free&#0160;there&#39;s no compelling reason not to be&#0160;grammar-free as well.&#0160;</p>
<p>Now there&#39;s a new and appalling example of Limbaugh&#39;s resistance to reality. NASA recently announced that the planet Mars must once have had flowing water and might still have underground water. Limbaugh, if I read his tangled language aright, not only rejects the discovery but claims that water on Mars is evidence a &quot;left-wing agenda&quot;&#0160; at work. Wow, we are tempted to exclaim. Double wow. Paranoia run amok.&#0160;</p>
<p>How can Limbaugh present such a counter-factual notion with a straight face?&#0160; In order to coherently present his &quot;thoughts&quot; on this subject, I will now extract and re-assemble some of his phrases from the linguistic rats&#39; nest in which they are embedded. Here&#39;s his chain of &quot;thought&quot; reduced to its essence. First of all, global warming is a myth. Secondly, NASA has been &quot;corrupted by the current regime&quot; and has falsified climate data. Inasmuch as NASA is a mendacious organization, its discoveries about flowing water must therefore also be false. And because NASA is subject to a leftist regime, its claims must be not only false but &quot;a technique to advance the leftist agenda.&quot; A watery Mars is therefore a &quot;leftist&#39; Mars. And so the circle is almost complete. Limbaugh knows he&#39;s correct but hasn&#39;t quite figured out how it all works:&#0160; &quot;I don&#39;t know what it is, I would assume it would be something to do with global warming.&quot;&#0160; So round and round we go.&#0160;</p>
<p>While Limbaugh&#39;s logic is roundabout, his perspective cramped and his evidence, how shall I say, perhaps a bit on the skimpy side -- all assertion and no fact -- &#0160;I feel that I must agree with his conclusion. Yes indeed, the discovery of ancient flowing water on Mars is definitely &quot;leftist&quot;-- and is leftist in at least two different ways.</p>
<p>Let us try to connect the subterranean dots inside the Limbaughian skull. What is it that is so paranoia-inducing and threatening about Martian water? Well, water on Mars might indicate life on Mars. If there is life on Mars, then there might be life elsewhere in the universe. If life elsewhere in the universe, then the creation story in Genesis is certainly incomplete and probably false. No creation myth, no biblical absolutism. Moreover, if there is life elsewhere, there are probably intelligent beings who are highly likely not to worship our earthly gods and are probably not -- horror of horrors --&#0160; subscribe to Baptist fundamentalism. Water on Mars therefore challenges his local and provincial Truth. Limbaugh is therefore correct to see Martian water as &#39;leftist&quot; in its implications.</p>
<p>Watery Mars is yet another blow to conservative &quot;thought.&quot; It&#39;s just like evolution or the big bang -- in actuality like any truth that comes to be discovered either by hard science or social science or by the unbiased study of history. Truth and fact are anathema to radical conservative Limbaughians. Of course they are repelled and confused by scientific discoveries.&#0160; Martian water is still another manifestation of the continual drip drip drip of facts that challenge their provincial world view and animate their paranoia.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I&#39;m devoutly secular, just as I was raised. Moreover, almost all of my friends are equally unreligious: either retired Catholics or atheist Jews or freethinkers or lapsed UU&#39;s or never-wases. I was therefore taken aback and a bit unsettled last week when at a friend and neighbor&#39;s dinner party, just as the guests were starting to dig in, we all paused for a moment and held hands while the head of the household thanked the Lord for providing. It was a brief and inoffensive grace but still startling because so unfamiliar. I had momentarily stepped into another world.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>And then I thought, if I were preparing&#0160;to deliver a &quot;grace&quot; before a meal, what would I say?&#0160; Who would I thank?&#0160; For I readily confess&#0160;that I feel great gratitude every time that I lift a loaded fork to my hungry, salivating&#0160;mouth.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>To begin, I wouldn&#39;t thank any god or gods, because I don&#39;t see the least evidence or sign of the supernatural around the table.&#0160;No god of the&#0160;beets or the chicken or the lasagna.</p>
<p>Instead, I would thank, sincerely and reverently, all the people, present and past, who have in fact made a real and palpable contribution to the meal. Let us think for a moment about the slice of bread. While I could not detect the real presence of anything transcendent, yet the bread was immanent with the labor of the farmer. And the trucker who delivered the fertilizer and the trucker who took the wheat to market. And the guys at the John Deere factory in Moline who made the tractor that harvested all the seven grains in my particular slice. And the baker. Road builders. And for that matter, now that I think about it, how about our intelligent Neolithic ancestors who first spotted the einkorn or emmer and decided that it was a plant worth domesticating. Moreover, the butter that I lavished on the bread did not arrive by flights of angels but through its own particular chain of development and distribution. And then the wine, the &quot;merry cheerer of the heart&quot; which wouldn&#39;t have cheered anyone&#39;s heart if someone hadn&#39;t mastered the technology not only of wine-making, but also of glass bottles. And I would also like to thank the furniture makers -- the designers, the carpenters, the turners -- because there would be no sitting at the table without their help. And therefore foresters and the manufacturers and inventors of chain saws. I could go on and on, but I think the sitters-down at my board would take my point. A moment&#39;s reflection reminds us that when we collect ourselves for dinner, we profit from the efforts and endeavors of not dozens but millions of people. Diachronic and synchronic, now and then.</p>
<p>It is to all of them that I offer my thanks, my <em>gratia</em>, my grace. And in doing so I acknowledge my continuing connection to all members of our wonderful, horrible species.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Last night there was no moon and no clouds.&#0160;It was so bright and clear that I couldn&#39;t resist going out to take a gander at the stars.&#0160;It was, once again, a brilliant and dazzling spectacle.</p>
<p>I can never remember whether there are two hundred million or two hundred billion stars in the Milky Way.&#0160;Both numbers are so beyond my ability to grasp that I wonder whether it even matters.&#0160;But after marveling at the expanse of stars, I returned&#0160;to the computer and&#0160;did the research.&#0160;It&#39;s true and astonishing:&#0160;there are between 100 and 400 <em>billion </em>stars in our home galaxy. (The astronomers, I have to say, give themselves quite a bit of leeway.) And then I was reminded that there are an estimate hundred million galaxies in the known universe.</p>
<p>I was feeling mighty small, mighty intimidated.</p>
<p>After a while, I went upstairs to dip back into the book on human anatomy that I&#39;m struggling to read. Here&#39;s a fact that I should have known, but didn&#39;t: there are six <em>trillion </em>cells in the human body.&#0160;More or less.</p>
<p>That&#39;s a a lot of cells. And a lot of stars. If a trillion is a thousand billion, then there are a ten thousand times more cells in my own personal body than there are galaxies in the universe, which is an interesting but not particularly important statistic.&#0160;</p>
<p>I feel as though there is some important conclusion that I should draw from these numbers, but honestly I have nothing much to say beyond the usual awe -- that ordinary&#0160;feeling of insignificance and impermanence. It&#39;s not exactly news that I am merely a heap of cells in an obscure corner&#0160;of a&#0160;tiny planet of an undistinguished star&#0160;in a medium-size constellation.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>And yet, sitting by the pond this sunny afternoon, watching a pair of companionable ducks slowly swimming one after another, I have to say that this particular transitory conglomeration of cells has been&#0160;enjoying a mighty fine day.</p>

				<p>Yesterday, and for the last week, there were two mallard in the pond: a buff-brown female trailed incessantly by a shiny green head. Courting, if not already nesting. But today there&#39;s just one, the female, and she&#39;s swimming round and round, quacking, quacking. What happened to Mr. Mallard. Where is he?&#0160; Eaten by fox or coyote or hawk?&#0160; Flown away to look for another, greener pond? Lost? On a business trip?</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>In the catchment area of P. S. 217, as indeed in all of my home territory in darkest Flatbush, there was very little immigration or emigration. People stayed put, for the most part, and the students with whom you entered kindergarten were the ones who were likely to graduate with you at the end of eighth grade.</p>
<p>I can think of two outsiders who came not from a near neighborhood but from the rumored &quot;outside world.&quot; One was Beryl McLeod, who arrived from Scotland, stayed long enough to engender in me a most powerful and confusing pre-adolescent crush, and then disappeared. Lovely Beryl spoke with a most exotic and enchanting accent, Glaswegian if I remember correctly. And then there was Alan Dean, who dropped in for a year or two from western Pennsylvania. He was a diminutive tough boy, not very bright but competitive on the punch ball field. He also spoke in a dialect unfamiliar to me and which I now judge to have been country or Appalachian. One day in Miss Finsmith&#39;s crowded stuffy fifth-grade classroom we pupils were asked to elucidate a picture that the teacher had displayed. It was a young lad with a candle in his hand. I recall very clearly a sentence of Alan Dean&#39;s: &quot;you can see that it&#39;s nighttime because he&#39;s wearing his sleepers.&quot;</p>
<p>Alan Dean&#39;s &quot;sleepers&quot; made a lifetime impression on me, not only because I had never heard that specific term before, but because I wasn&#39;t until that moment aware of dialectical differences in vocabulary. I knew about soda but I had never heard of tonic; I knew about pancakes but had never heard of griddlecakes or flapjacks, and I wore sneakers all day every day but knew nothing of tennis shoes or tennies -- not to mention plimsolls. I was not only monolingual but monodialectical, if there be such a word. For someone to employ the word &quot;sleepers&quot; for an item of clothing that I knew only as &quot;pajamas&quot; was therefore a transformational experience.</p>
<p>And a very sensible word, at that. Much to be preferred to other&#0160;deplorable dialectal terms for pajamas, as for example the&#0160;twee&#0160;diminutive &quot;jammies,&quot; or worse, the lazy &quot;pj&#39;s&quot; (not doubt employed by the&#0160;sort of people who would call&#0160;orange juice, O.J.), or even worser, the&#0160;infantile reduplicative &quot;jim-jams.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>So I was on the alert the next time that &#39;sleepers&quot; swam into my imaginative ken, which was when I first became acquainted with John Donne&#39;s&#0160;clever little love poem, &quot;The Good Morrow,&quot; in which the poet claims that until he fell in love, he was&#0160;immature, unconscious:&#0160;</p>
<div style="text-indent: -1em; padding-left: 1em;">I wonder, by my troth, what thou and I</div>
<div style="text-indent: -1em; padding-left: 1em;">Did, till we loved? Were we not weaned till then?</div>
<div style="text-indent: -1em; padding-left: 1em;">But sucked on country pleasures, childishly?</div>
<div style="text-indent: -1em; padding-left: 1em;">Or snorted we in the Seven Sleepers’ den?</div>
<p>Who the heck, I wondered, were these &quot;seven sleepers?&quot; Not, in fact, a wardrobeful of pajamas nor (my first guess) a parody of the famous &#39;nine worthies&quot; of chivalry?&#0160; But no, inasmuch as Donne habitually and regularly conflated religion and sex, he knew that the seven sleepers were a group of enthusiastic early Christian converts who were imprisoned for their faith in a cave near Ephesus, fell into miraculous sleep, and then woke up two centuries later to discover to their delight that their city had adopted and institutionalized their religion. Rips van Winkles of miraculous devotion.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Of other religious or literary sleepers surely the most prominent are Thoreau&#39;s. In a poignant passage about railroads in <em>Walden</em>, Thoreau recalls that &quot;sleepers&quot; is the demotic name for the wooden ties on which steel rails are laid. From this suggestive bit of nomenclature, Thoreau elaborates a conceit about the way the new industrialism favors some and crushes others. &quot;We do not ride on the railroad; it rides upon us. Did you ever think what those sleepers are that underlie the railroad?&#0160; Each one is a man, an Irishman, or a Yankee man. The rails are laid on them, and they are covered with sand, and the cars run smoothly over them. They are sound sleepers, I assure you. And every few years a new lot is laid down and run over; so that, if some have the pleasure of riding on a rail, others have the misfortune to be ridden upon.” So &quot;sleepers&quot; live on.</p>
<p>I have never heard this sense of &quot;sleepers&quot; in conversation, but then, I don&#39;t talk about railroad-making all that much. Nevertheless, it is not difficult to endorse the continued pertinence of Thoreau&#39;s witty comparison.&#0160;</p>
<p>No doubt my regular metablogian readership has been waiting patiently for me to mention that the &quot;sleeper&quot; is the first and easiest trick learned by beginners with the yo-yo. At least, such was the case in the 1950s P. S. 217 schoolyard. And a spy in a &quot;sleeper cell.&quot; And a dark horse. A surprise. A film; in fact, many films that are unexpected successes.</p>
<p>A lifetime of many and various &quot;sleepers.&quot;</p>
<p>September 21, 2015.&#0160; Let me add that Sleepers are plentiful in the old West Bradford cemetery, they being one of the first families to colonize the part of Vermont in which I am now writing this paragraph. A quaker Sleeper disrupted a church service in the 1790s, shouting at the congregational minister, &#39;Sir, you preach false doctrine.&quot; There&#39;s a Sleeper farm right at the end of South Road, just over the West Bradford line into Corinth. Never met them, don&#39;t know if their family&#39;s historic religious enthusiasms have persisted.</p>

				<p>Let us suppose that an old friend has just told you that his or her spouse is suffering&#0160;from Alzheimer&#39;s or some other horrible form of dementia. It&#39;s very difficult to know what to say to your friend. You want be sympathetic and consoling, and polite, but you just&#0160;can&#39;t find the right words. Perhaps the best you can do is to say nothing, just put your hand to your heart to indicate compassion, or give the guy or gal a sincere hug.</p>
<p>And here are some sentences that you should definitely avoid&#0160; --&#0160; all of them transcribed directly from real life.</p>
<p>1.&#0160; &quot;Think of it as a growth opportunity.&quot;</p>
<p>2.&#0160; &quot;My grandmother had Alzheimer&#39;s.&quot;</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I know that I&#39;m not the only person in the world who&#39;s prone to snap judgments and easy stereotyping.&#0160; I say this in apology, because yesterday I was guilty of a spectacular misjudgement, a wildly incorrect speculation.&#0160; It&#39;s time to kneel on ground glass, to scourge myself (metaphorically speaking).</p>
<p>One of the attendees of a support group that I attend is a &quot;little old lady.&quot; Elderly, gray in complexion and attire. Wizened, juiceless. She looks as though nothing of any moment happened to her in all her eighty or eighty-five years. </p>
<p>Her husband, Steve, died last week. Here&#39;s the piece of her story that she revealed.&#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;I was Steve&#39;s third and fifth wife. He was an airline pilot, so we traveled together all over the world.&#0160; Steve had two children by his first wife; I had five children by my first husband. I had so many babies because they started to come in pairs. At his funeral I played some of the Bach preludes.&quot;</p>
<p>You, gentle imaginative readers, can fill in the blanks. There are many, several novelsworth, in fact, starting with the obvious question, &quot;who was wife number four; tell me about her?&quot;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Not just my own, but surely every thinking person&#39;s favorite word-forming element is &quot;--some,&quot; perhaps because It appears in so many cheerful formulations. If you experience a sudden, overpowering urge to transform a noun to an adjective then&#0160; &quot;--some&#39;s&quot; the way to go.&#0160;</p>
<p>Imagine yourself, for instance, writing a novel and searching for the words to describe your ingénue heroine. She&#39;s not just &quot;handsome&quot; and &quot;wholesome&quot; but also&#0160;&quot;blithesome,&quot; &quot;lissome,&quot; &quot;winsome&quot; &quot;toothsome,&quot; &quot;cuddlesome&quot; and perhaps even &quot;frolicsome.&quot;&#0160; Could you find a better word? Well, maybe. Perhaps &quot;buxom?&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>Most of these words are of obvious origin but a few are on the obscure side. &quot;Winsome,&quot; one of the language&#39;s most delightful (or delightsome) adjectives, derives from the now defunct &quot;wynn,&quot; meaning &quot;joy&quot;. It&#39;s a word that apparently hid out in illiterate northern English dialect for a couple of centuries before it was resuscitated, to everyone&#39;s advantage, by Burns and Scott. &quot;Lissome,&quot; which now means supple or graceful, comes from the old English &quot;lithe&quot; meaning mild, gentle, or meek. &quot;Buxom&quot; is drawn from a stem meaning &quot;bow&quot; and for most of the existence of the English language signified &quot;compliant&quot; or &quot;obliging.&quot; &quot;Buxom&quot; began to connote zaftigity only during the middle of the last century. Here&#39;s the very best use of &quot;buxom&quot; in its long history.&#0160; It&#39;s by John Milton -- the young Milton, not yet the epic Milton.</p>
<div style="text-indent: -1em; padding-left: 1em;">The frolic wind that breathes the spring,</div>
<div style="text-indent: -1em; padding-left: 1em;">Zephyr, with Aurora playing,</div>
<div style="text-indent: -1em; padding-left: 1em;">As he met her once a-Maying,</div>
<div style="text-indent: -1em; padding-left: 1em;">There on beds of violets blue,</div>
<div style="text-indent: -1em; padding-left: 1em;">And fresh-blown roses wash&#39;d in dew,</div>
<div style="text-indent: -1em; padding-left: 1em;">Fill&#39;d her with thee, a daughter fair,</div>
<div style="text-indent: -1em; padding-left: 1em;">So buxom, blithe, and debonair.</div>
<div style="text-indent: -1em; padding-left: 1em;">&#0160;</div>
<div style="text-indent: -1em; padding-left: 1em;">Candor compels us to admit that not all &quot;-some&quot; words are quite so bonny. There&#39;s also a &quot;--some&quot; underside: &quot;irksome,&quot; &quot;loathsome,&quot; &quot;gruesome,&quot; &quot;meddlesome,&quot; &quot;fearsome,&quot; &quot;noisome&quot; (which now means&quot; foul-smelling and is related to &quot;annoy&quot;), bothersome. Good mouth-filling words to describe the villain of the piece.</div>
<p>And then there&#39;s &quot;fulsome&quot; which for the longest time meant what it seems to mean, then latterly acquired the learned connotation &quot;odious,&quot; which it is now in the process of shedding. And &quot;awesome&quot; which has deteriorated from &quot;filled with awe&quot; to meaning &quot;cool&quot; -- and has become a favorite adjective of praise to an entire cohort or generation of the vocabularially deprived.</p>
<p>No one can say, &quot;unbuxom&quot; or &quot;unblithesome.&quot;&#0160; Yet we regularly say &quot;unwholesome.&quot;</p>
<p>For the record, the &quot;--some&quot; in &quot;threesome&quot; is an entire different &quot;--some,&quot;&#0160; as is the &quot;--some&quot; in &quot;chromosome.&quot;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Thomas Fairfax, a well-known nineteenth century lobster smack captain, wrote convincingly that &quot;lobsters are very good as an article of commerce, and pretty enough to look at, after they&#39;re boiled, but, as to eating them, I prefer castoff rubber shoes.&quot; George Hoag, a down-easterner, added that &quot;if them tourists want to come up from Boston and pay those prices, then, by Christ, let them. Damn fools. Lobsters, hell, they&#39;re big cockroaches, that&#39;s what they are. You won&#39;t catch me eating one, even if I could afford the damn things.&quot; Fairfax and Hoag may be two of the most honest men in the history of American commerce. Lobsters are loathsome, both in appearance and as culinary articles. The meat is stringy tasteless gristle. And inaccessible to boot. And messy to attack. How did modern &quot;sophisticates&quot; get themselves bamboozled into thinking that these big bugs of the sea should be considered a gourmet item. It boggles the healthy, balanced, sensible mind. Lobsters are hideous insect-like creatures. Who was the first addled individual who took a look at a lobster and said, &quot;looks good, I&#39;ll try it.&quot; Eeew.</p>
<p>Then there&#39;s the practice of immersing live lobsters in boiling water. Just remember to put your fingers in your ears while the poor creatures screech. Human beings degrade themselves morally and aesthetically when they lower themselves to such indifference. How can they torture a lobster and then pretend that the poor things are palatable.&#0160;</p>
<p>I&#39;ve eaten a couple, may all the gods of the sea forgive me. Before I reached the age of enlightenment I would go along to get along. I never pretended to enjoy them, but, petty conformist that I was, I would participate in the horrid feast. Now I&#39;d rather eat kale and tofu, tasteless trendy manifestations of liberal guilt, than violate my integrity with a severed claw or tail.</p>
<p>it&#39;s time for a moral revolution in America. Let&#39;s make a start by liberating the lobster.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Bats originated approximately 50 million years ago. Although warm-blooded, many have &quot;thermostats&quot; that allow body temperature to vary with ambient temperature; they are therefore &quot;heterothermic.&quot; There are 1300 living bat species -- about 20% of all mammal species. The Long-tongued Fruit bat has a wingspan of 1.5 centimeters; the Spectral Bat a wingspan of a meter. Many bats sport &quot;noseleaves&quot;&#0160; --fleshy projections around the snout and nostrils -- which aid in the transmission of sound. DNA studies have determined that the closest living relatives of bats are not rodents but hoofed mammals and whales. There are twenty bat families, nineteen of which employ laryngeal echolocation -- the twentieth relies on tongue clicks -- as well as ten extinct families. Bats have five unique muscles: the occipitopollicaris connects the back of the head to the hand and runs along the anterior edge of the wing. The coracocutaneous anchors networks of elastic fibers to the armpit. The humeropatagialis tightens and braces the distal parts of the wing membrane. The tensor plagiopatii anchor the trailing edges of the wing. The depressor ossis syloformis controls the interfemoral membrane between the hind legs. Hoary Bats can fly at 27 kilometers per hour. Migrating Silver Haired Bats fly at over fifty kilometers per hour. The heart rate of an alert Little Brown Bat hanging in a roost at room temperature is about 200 beats per minute but while flying the heart rate increases to about 1000 beats per minute. The heart of a hibernating bat beats five times a minute. Flying bats consume energy at about twelve times the rate of resting bats. Bats can feel changes in air pressure with the skin of their wings. Some bats&#39; feet lock into place when hanging upside down, so no energy is consumed except when the bat releases and drops. Common vampire bats engorged with blood have difficulty regaining flight. They urinate copiously, then use their long thumbs to provide extra lift leverage. Bats use echolocation (as do toothed whales, dolphins, shrews and tenrecs). When Lazzaro Spallanzani claimed&#0160; (in 1794) that bats could see with their ears, he was widely mocked. &quot;Does Signor Spallanzani also claim that bats can hear with their eyes?&quot;&#0160; Ultrasonic noises were not detected by scientists until 1938. Echolocation calls cover a range of frequencies. A Little Brown Bat searching for prey usually produces echolocations at the rate of twenty calls per second. but a Hoary Bat will produce only five calls per second. Calls increase in frequency during the actual attack. Bats can vary the length of the call from less than one millisecond to over 50 milliseconds. Bats are very loud to those who can hear them. A hunting bat can produce a sound that is twenty times more intense than the alarm of a smoke detector. Bats, unique among mammals, can turn off their hearing. At about two milliseconds before a vocalization is produced in the larynx, muscles in the middle ear contract, disarticulating three bones in the middle ear; then the ear is &quot;reconnected&quot; allowing it to hear the echo of the sound it has just emitted. Bats can be insectivorous, carnivorous, frugivorous, nectarivorous, piscivorous and sanguinovorous. Some bats eat birds, some eat other bats. Eastern Red Bats eat both tent caterpillars and gypsy moths. They must eat about 150 moths per night simply to retain their weight (thank you, Eastern Red Bats). The upper incisors of vampire bats are greatly enlarged, but since they don&#39;t chew their food, the cheek teeth are reduced to mere spicules. More than 500 species of flowering plants are pollinated by bats. Bats may eat up to 120% of their body weight each day. The common vampire bat can consume about two tablespoons of blood during a single night. Tiger Moths produce clicks that &quot;jam&quot; the echolocation patterns of bats. Because bats must minimize their weight, their digestive systems are extremely efficient --&#0160; Little Brown Bats move food through their system in twenty minutes. One million bats roost under the Congress Avenue Bridge in Austin, Texas. Bats are capable of eating 500 mosquitoes an hour. Some bats hibernate but bats can also enter into a state of torpor to consume less energy while roosting. Frio and Bracken caves in Texas each house over ten million Brazilian Free-tailed Bats during the summer. Bamboo bats roost in the hollow spaces in bamboo stems. In Borneo, Hardwicke&#39;s Wooly Bat roosts in the leaves of Raffle&#39;s Pitcher Plant and donates its feces to the plants nitrogen intake. Some Leaf-nosed bats bite the stems of banana and palm leaves in order to create tents for roosting. White-throated Round-Eared bats roost in excavated cavities of termite mounds. Hibernating Little Brown Bats bats breathe once an hour. Most bats bear one offspring rather than twins or multiples. Bats live surprisingly long lives. A banded Brandt&#39;s Myotis was at least forty-four years old. Vesper Bats mate in the fall but the female stores the sperm and does not ovulate until early spring. White nose disease is caused by a European strain of a common soil fungus. Bat droppings can contain spores that cause histoplasmosis in humans. Rabies, often bat-borne, kills 60,000 to 80,000 humans per year in Asia and Africa.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Olivier Truc&#39;s&#0160;<em>Forty Days Without Shadow</em> came highly recommended, both by the forty or so literary awards that it has garnered, and also by trusted friends. It&#39;s a murder mystery -- or rather a &quot;police procedural&quot; -- and indeed it is a very good &quot;read.&quot; It&#39;s set in the northern reaches of Scandinavia amidst tensions between the indigenous Lapps, or more properly Sami, and their Swedish and Norwegian oppressors. It&#39;s got everything: a brutal murder, a child molester; a budding but blighted romance between a veteran policeman and his beautiful novice partner; a tough wise old &quot;native&quot; who clings to the traditional ways; a search for an old gold mine; stolen Sami artifacts, and enough red herrings to furnish a medium-size Stockholm restaurant. And snow, lots of snow. Snowshoes, snowmobiles, snowstorms, snowdrifts.</p>
<p>And yet I had to discipline myself to keep on with the reading. Something, perhaps age, has blighted my appetite for fiction -- not just genre fiction, like this mystery, but all fiction. Let me confess: to read stories, rather than to read history or biology or geology has come to seem frivolous. An indulgent &#0160;waste of time when I could be learning something substantive.&#0160;</p>
<p>I looked up some reviews of this novel. Let me quote one opinion: &quot;the background information about the Sami lifestyle will slow down the action and readers may wish that Olivier Truc had left his documentary days behind.&quot; Interesting, but I had exactly the opposite reaction. What kept me intrigued and kept me plowing through the snowheaps was precisely the ethnographic and historical detail that the reviewer deplores. I wasn&#39;t just being &quot;entertained&quot;; &#0160;I was learning something!</p>
<p>Five years ago, I reported on this very blague that in my youth I loved to read science fiction and fantasy, but that somewhere along the line, I lost my taste for such flights of imagination. (If anyone is interested, they can find the relevant paragraph&#0160;<a href=" http://www.drmetablog.com/2010/02/insects-drugs-science-fiction.html " target="_self" title="">here</a>.) I would say that my condition has worsened -- my resistance to fantasy has now spread to almost all fiction. Odd that I don&#39;t feel the same way about movies: I prefer fiction films, stories, to documentaries. &#0160;</p>
<p>Darwin carried his Virgil and his Milton to Tierra del Fuego and claimed that the books sustained him throughout his Beagle days. But later, in his autobiography, he revealed that he no longer found any pleasure in poetry. &#0160;I can&#39;t compare myself to Darwin in any way except that we both grew older.&#0160; Yet I wonder whether an impatience with fiction and a loss of aesthetic sensibility isn&#39;t a characteristic of septuagenarians.</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>On the mall, smoking, wheels (i.e. bicycles and skateboards), and pets are prohibited. Between forty and fifty signs and icons state the case very clearly. Nevertheless, the rules are often flouted.</p>
<p>Smokers are furtive: they can&#39;t help themselves even though they show, by their demeanor, that they are well aware that they&#39;re doing wrong. The bicyclists are apologetic. Skateboarders are oblivious, totally. The dog-owners are defiant. &quot;No bureaucrat is going to tell me where I can walk my dog.&quot; The beggars are entitled. This morning, one disheveled youth carried a sign that read &quot;Why lie?&#0160; I need to get fucked up.&quot; (I used occasionally to donate to our &quot;homeless&quot; until I was taught that meals are readily available and that the begged money goes to support alcohol and drug habits. Also I was taken aback when a man to whom I gave two quarters returned them to me, saying, &quot;I don&#39;t take coins&quot;.)&#0160; Some of the buskers are fine musicians and earn their one or five dollar bill but I think that there is something rather sad about their forced cheer.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the strolling young folks, holding hands and radiantly in love, are wonderful to behold, especially when there&#39;s a toddler or two trailing them. And I also enjoy watching the strolling old folks, fifty or more years into marriage, sometimes holding hands, sometimes wheelchairing it. Dyads of all ages and kinds cheer and encourage me.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>For the first twenty minutes or half-hour of <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Things_We_Lost_in_the_Fire" title="Things We Lost in the Fire">Things We Lost in the Fire</a></em> I thought that Susanne Bier, my current favorite director, had succeeded in transferring her wondrous Danish idiom into a big-name Hollywood production. I loved the unusual but profound relationships, especially between Brian Burke, the real-estate developer, and his childhood friend and heroin addict Jerry Sunborne. It was all far-off-the-grid, but it rang true. It&#39;s not easy to make a European movie in the American system. Nevertheless, I was disappointed when the second half of the film fell into deep cliche and became a familiar saga of addiction-recovery, complete with predictable confessions at the Narc-Anon shop. Brian&#39;s wife Audrey, played by the impossibly radiant Halle Berry, dominates the film equally as much with her acting as her beauty, but the script poses insuperable challenges -- especially when she is asked to retain her sexual innocence while snuggling in bed with Jerry. The direction is as might be expected highly accomplished, but I&#39;m concerned that Bier&#39;s fondness for extreme close-ups, sometimes of only a single eye, has devolved into mere mannerism. The film received passable reviews but was a box-office failure, which is, unfortunately, not difficult to understand.</p>

				<p>Ludwig Wittgenstein, the renowned philosopher whose strict stringent strictures about language inadvertently destroyed my youthful interest in philosophy, wrote in one of his less rigorous moments that &quot;a man&#39;s own name [should be] sacred to him. Surely it is both the most important instrument given to him and also something like a piece of jewelry hung round his neck at birth.&quot; Wittgenstein&#39;s name at birth was &quot;Ludwig Josef Johann Wittgenstein&quot; -- his Jewish origins concealed behind a string of <em>echt</em>-German Christian names.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve never thought that my own name was a piece of jewelry -- but if it were a jewel, it was entirely a counterfeit.</p>
<p>My surname is an accident. My grandfather, according to the story, was born into a family named Middlebank or perhaps Middlebrook. Because a sole male child was exempted from the draft in darkest nineteenth-century Ukraine, he was surreptitiously adopted into a childless family. As a result, the name that he brought to America in 1895 was a merely a useful fiction. And then there&#39;s my middle name, Hessel. The only Hessels I&#39;ve ever been able to trace are almost uniformly Danish. My grandmother on my father&#39;s side was born Eta Hessel and it&#39;s from her that the name descended. But am I to believe that a troop of Danes wandered into eastern Ukraine sometime before 1850 and left progeny behind?&#0160; I doubt it. In any case, I don&#39;t feel any more Danish than I feel anything else. And then my praenomen was borrowed out of the book of Job. Why my atheist parents, who never ever attended religious services of any kind, would have elected for me an obscure Hebrew name will always remain a complete mystery. So the whole parcel is a fabrication, a construct, without integrity or authenticity.</p>
<p>What name should I have had, a name I could finger like a rich jewel about my neck. Something that would suit me?&#0160; Suggestions are welcome. I&#39;m thinking &quot;Rocco&quot; for a first name (it&#39;s so appropriate), but I&#39;ll need help on the middle or middles and the family name.</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>A close relative has accused me of lacking spontaneity. Specifically, &quot;I doubt he ever did a spontaneous thing in his entire life.&quot;</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been mulling over this attack and I can think of at least three spontaneous actions that I have performed.&#0160; A) Frequently, in the middle of the afternoon, without forethought or planning, I take a nap.&#0160; B) And closely related, but certainly different, sometimes, waking up in the morning, I decide, spontaneously, to lie in bed for another hour or so. And C), just yesterday, when I trundled over to the Public Library to borrow the book on ancient dead languages that I had reserved, I spontaneously pulled a second book (on Neanderthals) off the shelf.&#0160;</p>
<p>Now if those aren&#39;t plain and distinct instances of spontaneity I don&#39;t know what.</p>
<p>Moreover, I am making a long list of spontaneous actions to perform in the near future.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>If a person could rescue one of the many lost books of the Greeks and Romans, which would it be? I think most ordinary walking-around-Americans would nominate the lost second book of Aristotle&#39;s <em>Poetics,&#0160;</em>about which Umberto Eco made such a fuss, and which is presumed to be a philosophical analysis of the genre of comedy.</p>
<p>I myself am not enamored of Aristotle&#39;s lit crit. I suspect that if the second book had survived, it would only show that Aristotle had invented a&#0160;vocabulary to describe the various elements of comedy -- and as a result generations of scholars would have felt an obligation to conduct sterile and inhibiting debates about the precise interpretation of his various technical terms. So, therefore, if I were interested in comedy, rather than rescuing the second book I&#39;d prefer to read Homer&#39;s lost <em>Margites, </em>famous among the ancients as a comic counterpart to the <em>Iliad</em> and <em>Odyssey</em>. It might have been fun, and we would certainly learn a lot more than we now know about the archaic Greek sense of humor. My suspicion is that we moderns would find the <em>Margites</em> to be a trial, a puzzle, a genuine challenge.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Not only comedies but tragedies also have perished. Anyone who has been dazzled by the great Greeks would want to read the 60 or 70 lost plays of Aeschylus, the hundred or so that have disappeared by Sophocles as well as the 60 or so vanished plays of Euripides. No doubt our understanding of the great age of Athens and Athenian religion and art and politics would have to be thoroughly rethought. Nothing more tragic than the loss of the tragedies.</p>
<p>And then there is Livy&#39;s history of Rome in 142 books, of which only 35 (plus fragments and reports) survive. How much more full would be our knowledge of the last years of the republic with Livy as a guide.</p>
<p>But if I had to choose a single work of the ancients that has perished, I think I would opt for one of the books that were written by Livy&#39;s student and friend, the emperor Claudius. Claudius, whose first wife (and one of his better ones) Plautia Urganilla was a native speaker of Etruscan, wrote two books about the Etruscans: a general history, and a volume on the Etruscan language. It&#39;s this second book that I would most want to rescue. Claudius was the last person known to have been able to read Etruscan, a language which was becoming extinct in his lifetime.</p>
<p>Etruscan was an isolate -- a language with no known relatives, like Basque. It was written in an early (8th century) variety of Greek, so it can be recited, but it cannot be understood. Etruscan contributed not only its alphabet but a few words to Latin: &quot;atrium,&quot; &quot;histrio,&quot; &quot;taberna,&quot; &quot;stilus,&quot; and &quot;cera,&quot; for example. Approximately 13,000 Etruscan inscriptions are in existence, mostly on gravestones. There are also about 300 bronze mirrors with religious or mythological scenes on one side, many with Etruscan inscriptions on the obverse. They are found in the tombs of women who, it would seem, must have been literate. There are no surviving Etruscan manuscripts but there is the Zagreb mummy. Sometime around 125 in the last pre-Christian millennium, an Egyptian technician re-used a linen Etruscan book to wrap a body. Twelve hundred legible words survive. They seem to record prayers and invocations to the gods. Not much else, except for a great linguistic mystery in the heart of civilized Europe. Alas that Claudius&#39;s books did not make it through the dark age bottleneck!</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>There is unfortunately very little of the often superb Danish director Susanne Bier in this darkish Hollywoodish comedy.&#0160; She&#39;s so much better when she stays closer to her native themes.</p>
<p>The plot is built on an antique and hallowed cliche: northern Europeans migrate to southern Italy to find freedom and to re-awaken love. In this case it&#39;s Philip, a workaholic widower and Ida, the relict of a boorish unfaithful husband, who make the journey. They (Pierce Brosnan and Tryne Dyrholm) carry it off rather well. But the film has an incapacitating defect: three of the supporting characters (Ida&#39;s husband Leif, Leif&#39;s mistress Thilde, and Philip&#39;s ex sister-in-law Benedikte, played by Bier&#39;s favorite actress Paprika Steen) are so broadly drawn and so melodramatically horrid that they don&#39;t belong in any comedy that asks to be taken seriously. There are a few good scenes that almost recall the director at her best: a conversation in which Philip momentarily drops his guard and reveals his unresolved grief; another in which he tries to make contact with this son while the Mediterranean waves lap at their feet; a third in which mother and daughter talk about marriage. Redeeming moments these. But for the most part Susanne Bier appears to be strait-jacketed by a plot for which she has little empathy. The psychological complexity that should have arisen from Ida&#39;s cancer and her breast surgery evaporates: a great opportunity squandered, in my view.</p>

				<p>I would have thought that&#0160;I&#39;d have had in the hopper all the senses, proper and improper, of &quot;&#39;stopper.&quot;&#0160; But I&#39;ve come a-cropper.</p>
<p>The most familiar stopper is, of course, the blocker of liquids, as for example the cork that fits into the top of the wine bottle -- or the polished glass stopper that used to slide into those old-fashioned ink bottles. And then there&#39;s the stopper in baseball -- the ace pitcher, the &quot;number one&quot; on the staff, who brings a&#0160; losing streak to a close. And also the show-stopper -- the performer who freezes the show in its tracks, so excellently that he or she earns several rounds of applause and encores. (Latterly, a supremely attractive woman has come to be called a &quot;show-stopper&quot;; when she enters a room all activities, even molecular motion itself, immediately cease).</p>
<p>But down here in South Florida, where I am enjoying a few days of indolent hedonism, there&#39;s a stopper of which even the OED is ignorant. It&#39;s a plant -- a bush or small tree. The best known stopper is the simpson, <em>myricanthes fragran</em>s, demotically known to all as the nakedwood twinberry. It&#39;s a member of the eucalyptus family and smells nutmeggy. The fruit is edible, as might be expected of a distant cousin of the guava. Simpson stoppers are a food of choice for Florida&#39;s state bird (not the pelican, as one might expect, but the mockingbird). And there are other stoppers beside the aristocratic simpson: the redberry stopper <em>Eugenia foetida</em>, whose leaves and flowers are foul-smelling;&#0160; the white stopper; and the inedible Spanish stopper.</p>
<p>I have no clue about the etymology of &quot;stopper&quot; in this sense.&#0160; Neither does anyone else.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><em>Black Angel</em> is a good, fast-paced Cornell Woolrich mystery and certainly one of the noiriest of all noirs. It features lots of grimy black-and-white photography of seedy hotels and bars, and a nebbishy weakling who is falsely accused of murder and who is rescued from execution by a last-second phone call to the Governor. It also offers a blackmailing chantoosie and a hogshead of red herrings. The plot turns on an unusual episode of amnesia. Martin Blair, played by Cornellian Dan Duryea, has strangled his cheating ex-wife while in an alcoholic haze but doesn&#39;t remember that he did so. He gets himself involved with the attractive wife of a man who has been accused of the murder, abandons alcohol for Coca-Cola and sets out the find the killer. Eventually he falls off the wagon, and in a blackout suddenly &quot;remembers&quot; that he himself is the perpetrator. &quot;It&#39;s Korsakoff&#39;s syndrome,&quot; mumbles an authoritative doctor, trying to add a glimmer of credibility to a doubtful turn of events.</p>
<p>I had never heard of Korsakoff&#39;s and I thought it was just mumbo-jumbo, but it turns out there is such a condition:&#0160;&quot;Korsakoff&#39;s syndrome is a chronic memory disorder caused by a severe deficiency of thiamine.&#0160;It is&#0160;most commonly&#0160;caused by alcohol&#0160;misuse.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>But Korsakoff&#39;s is not a come-and-go disease; it&#39;s a progressive deterioration. Moreover, there&#39;s not the vaguest hint&#0160;in the &quot;literature&quot; to suggest either that a Korsakovian&#0160;is likely to commit a murder and then forget it or that a second bout of drinking can restore his memory.&#0160; That sort of stuff is strictly Hollywood</p>
<p>Once again&#0160;Hollywood amnesia proves to be the most flexible and variable of all diseases.&#0160;</p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2015/01/chimpanzee-alzheimer.html">Why Don't Chimpanzees Suffer from Alzheimer's?</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Why Indeed?&#0160; And also, while we&#39;re considering the question, why don&#39;t chimpanzees get atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, endometriosis, myocardial infarction, falciparum malaria, HIV infection, or epithelial cancers?&#0160; Chimpanzees are, after all, our closest living relatives.&#0160;We share a common ancestry and we only embarked on&#0160;separate&#0160;path some six or seven million years ago --a blink of an eye in evolutionary terms.&#0160;Why is it that we human beings, so superior, as we like to think, in so many ways from our cousins -- in our big&#0160;brains and delicate hand manipulations, for example&#0160;-- are subject to an array of diseases&#0160;to which our inferior relations&#0160;are&#0160;immune.&#0160;What&#39;s the deal?&#0160;</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the current thinking on this important problem (which I draw from Eugene E. Harris&#39;s informative and up-to-date monograph <em>Ancestors in our Genome</em> [Oxford, 1914]). As I understand it, human beings went through a sort of bottleneck sometime in our recent (say 200,000 years ago) history and our&#0160;effective breeding population was reduced to a mere 10,000 or so souls.&#0160;When a population becomes so small, random genetic drift dominates over natural selection, and so moderately deleterious but not incapacitating mutations can survive and even thrive.&#0160;The defective&#0160;genes that would be&#0160;weeded out in larger populations persist in our genome.&#0160;Hence our many inherited susceptibilities and disorders.</p>
<p>But that&#39;s not the end of the story.&#0160; Yesterday there was a report that the Ashkenazim went through &quot;a severe bottleneck&quot; six or eight hundred years ago which reduced its&#0160;population to about 350 individuals. O my, what a boon to genetic drift, what a recipe for genetic disaster or genetic success, or more exactly, both success and failure simultaneously.&#0160;</p>
<p>And so our talents, our deficits, our strengths and weakness, our brains and our bodies, are determined&#0160;by arbitrary aleatory long-ago events.&#0160;No surprise, really, but another event in the continuously unfolding revelation.</p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2015/01/henotheism.html">Henotheism</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>As a born-and-bred third-generation&#0160;atheist, I never made much of an effort to understand theology, which is, I gather,&#0160;the study of the nature and attributes of god or gods.&#0160;But no god, nothing to study.&#0160;No problem. Theology&#0160;will always be for me&#0160;&quot;the subject without an object.&quot; And therefore&#0160;when I read Michael Coogan&#39;s <em>The Ten Commandments&#0160; (</em>Yale, 2014), I was surprised by own ignorance.&#0160;For example,&#0160;I had taken it for granted that the Bible was a document of monotheism.&#0160;No god but god, Jahweh.&#0160;And also &#0160;that the monotheism of the ancient Hebrews was their gift to civilization (though why to believe in one god was a better idea than to believe in a&#0160;plethora of godlings will always remain&#0160;a mystery to me).&#0160;But Coogan makes it clear that I&#39;ve gotten it all wrong. The commandment &quot;you shall have no other gods before my face&quot; distinctly postulates the existence of &quot;other gods.&quot;</p>
<p>These other gods appear in the Bible in a number of guises and particularly as &#39;&quot;the host of heaven.&quot; Some&#0160;were apparently worshipped even in the Temple itself. It is reported in&#0160;<em>Kings </em>that the reformer Josiah ordered &quot;all&#0160;the vessels made for Baal, for Asherah, and for all the host of heaven&quot; be removed from the sacred precincts.&#0160;The ancient Hebrews were therefore not monotheists, but henotheists (a lovely word new to me), which Coogan defines&#0160;as &quot;the recognition that while other gods may and do exist, only one is to be worshipped&quot;&#0160;(14).&#0160;</p>
<p>So it seems that what has been represented to naive ol&#39; me as a case of moral development,&#0160;from polytheism to monotheism, is better understood as&#0160;a kind of religious nationalism or jingoism:&#0160;our god is better than your god -- so let&#39;s everyone&#0160;pay him exclusive attention.&#0160;Or perhaps, more vulgarly but just as accurately, in the words of the spiritual leader Hank Williams, move over little god, big god moving in -- have I quoted this exactly right? -- just as Jahweh moved in on&#0160;El Shaddai and the rest of the crowd. One of my friends says that the essence of organized religion is &quot;my prince of peace can beat up your prince of peace.&quot;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><em>Desperately Seeking Susan</em> offers a cartoon version of amnesia.&#0160;<em>Pow</em>, Roberta is knocked into a lamppost and doesn&#39;t know who she is.&#0160;And then, a day later, <em>pow</em> again, she is knocked to the ground, bumps her head, and her memory returns intact. The film isn&#39;t interested in amnesia except as a plot device to facilitate the doppelganger relationship between Roberta and Susan. Roberta is a downtrodden cautious Fort Lee housewife; Susan is an anarchic adventuress. In the course of the film, each woman tries on the other&#39;s identity. Without a memory, but wearing Susan&#39;s clothes, Roberta &quot;becomes&quot; Susan, and Susan in turn invades Roberta&#39;s home and tries on her clothes, her pool, and her husband. At the end, Roberta has absorbed enough of Susan&#39;s pizzazz to leave her stifling husband and Susan has changed enough so that she can enjoy a moment with the boyfriend who has been desperately seeking her. It&#39;s an easy-to-watch film. Rosanna Arquette is lovely as a perpetual naif and Laurie Metcalf is superb as Roberta&#39;s short-tempered know-it-all sister-in-law. And it has more than one brilliant line of dialogue. &quot;I thought you were dead.&quot;&#0160; &quot;Naw, I was in New Jersey.&quot;&#0160; And my favorite: &quot;How do you use the bird?&quot;&#0160; -- which you have to have been there to understand and appreciate. An enjoyable film; unless you approach it with the idea that it has anything to do with real-life loss of memory.&#0160;&#0160;</p>

				<p>Vivian de St. Vrain, fully accredited prophet&#0160;(Senior Fellow, American Society of Prophecy), has retreated to the mountaintop and has returned&#0160;with&#0160;predictions for 2015. Here they are:&#0160;</p>
<p>1)&#0160;&#0160; there will be unusual weather patterns in North America;</p>
<p>2)&#0160; a famous Hollywood actress will sue for divorce;&#0160; moreover, another (or possibly the same) Hollywood star will become pregnant; another (or possibly the same) actress will gain and lose a great deal of weight;&#0160;</p>

<p>4)&#0160; a politician will be accused of taking bribes;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>5)&#0160; questions will be raised about the safety of America&#39;s food supply;</p>
<p>6)&#0160; there will be either a monsoon, an airplane crash, or a capsized ferry in Asia;</p>
<p>7)&#0160; there will be fluctuations in the stock market;</p>
<p>8)&#0160; there will be turmoil in the Middle East.</p>
<p>9)&#0160; a religious leader will be involved in either a financial or a sex scandal.&#0160; Or perhaps both.</p>
<p>You read it here first.&#0160;Loyal readers: check back at the end of 2015.&#0160; Let&#39;s see whether a senior but world-class professional prophet still has enough on the ball (a crystal ball) to foretell the future one more time.</p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2014/12/manstand.html">"Man" Is Now an Adjective and not a Good One. </a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I believe that I first heard &quot;man&quot; used as an adjective in the phrase &quot;man cave&quot; -- which is, I believe, a place where guys go to isolate themselves from their wimmen and famly and where they watch boxing on the TV, drink a lot of beer, and puke on the shag rug. But recently I learned about the &quot;man stand.&quot; &quot;To do the man stand&quot; is when the husband waits at the door of the dress shop clutching a bundle of packages while the old ball and chain decides between the 10 and the 12 and between the gray one and the green. Sometimes a manstander parks his carcass in a designated &quot;man chair.&quot; And now there&#39;s a new one: the &quot;man spread&quot;, which describes the way a crude young guy with below-the-waist pants sits in the subway, legs akimbo, indifferent to the gentle ladies and to the tired old geezers who need to relax far more than he does.</p>
<p>&quot;Man boobs,&quot; which are nothing more than unsightly fat, are sometimes abbreviated to&#0160;&quot;moobs.&quot;&#0160; &quot;Manparts&quot; requires no elucidation.</p>
<p>In each of these cases, &quot;man&quot; is not used affectionately or admiringly. &quot;Man,&quot; as an adjective, is anything but &quot;manly.&quot;&#0160;&quot;Man&quot; is primitive and insensitive, an adjective of derogation and denigration.&#0160;</p>
<p>January 4:&#0160; My penpalessa, SF, writes that in England the phrase &quot;man flu&quot; has now become popular. A &quot;man flu&quot; is merely a cold that men (such babies they are!!) make a fuss about, but which a woman would ignore.&#0160;&#0160;</p>

				<p>I bought a February airline ticket to The Big Easy. I bought it online, as we all do nowadays (whatever happened to travel agents?) I figured that they would try to squeeze a few dollars in extra charges out of me, but I&#0160; was surprised that the airline had the balls to demand $25.00 for my one piece of carry-on luggage (not checked -- carry on!). And then I was completely floored to discover that Frontier now adds an extra charge for a seat. Yes, a seat! A seat is an additional charge, even though an airplane is not like a subway, where you can strap-hang. Nor can you sit outside, on the wing. A seat is not a an option or, goodness gracious! a luxury. And yet Frontier now exacts a few bucks for the privilege of sitting down.</p>
<p>Frontier, I can tell you, lacks any sense of irony.</p>
<p>&quot;Would you like air with your seat. There will be a small extra charge for breathing.&quot;</p>
<p>I know we&#39;re supposed to feel sorry for the struggling airlines, but that&#39;s a myth, a canard. The airlines are not starving. thank you very much. The International Air Transport Association, the airlines&#39; trade group,&#0160;estimates that the industry&#39;s profits were $11 billion in 2013, will be $19.9 billion this year and will rise&#0160;to $25 billion next year.&#0160;(Billion!, not million.)&#0160; Why so much?&#0160;Because fuel costs continue to drop.&#0160;And also because we passengers have become accustomed to being crammed into smaller and smaller spaces and have been taught to pay extra for every glass of orange juice.&#0160;And to enjoy the luxury of a chair.</p>
<p>Hey, fellow passengers!&#0160; Remember when oil prices spiked a few years ago and the airlines added &quot;fuel surcharges&quot;? Well, fuel is down.&#0160;Raise your hand if you think you&#39;re going to get a &quot;fuel rebate.&quot;&#0160;Let me count the hands.&#0160;Hmm.&#0160;Not so many.</p>
<p>Where do you think the $25 billion in profits will go.&#0160;I&#39;ll give you three guesses.&#0160;A) Increase the salaries of stewards, baggage handlers and other airport workers?&#0160; B. Lower the cost of airline travel for passengers in the economy (i.e. steerage) classes?&#0160; C.&#0160;Improve amenities for first-class travelers?</p>
<p>Shock!!&#0160; The correct answer is C. According to <em>The New York Times,</em> improvements in service &quot;have been directed at the airlines’ most lucrative passengers, who are flying in business class or paying for full-fare coach seats. Delta Air Lines, for instance, announced on Monday that it <a>renamed its business section Delta One, instead of BusinessFirst, and said it would glorify the seats with brand-new quilted covers. </a>American Airlines announced this week that it would spend $2 billion to improve customer experience at the airport and inside its planes. Part of that investment includes adding more lie-flat seats for business class passengers.</p>
<p>For the rich: &quot;lie-flat seats,&quot; and &quot;quilted seat covers.&quot; And what is American Airlines doing for the rest of us, the not-rich. &quot;In the back of the plane, it introduced a class of fares called Basic Economy, the cheapest fares. Passengers with those tickets, though, will not be able to book their seats in advance and will not be able to refund or change those tickets.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#39;s&#0160;still another example of the way the good ol&#39; USA is becoming more and more a class-ridden society.&#0160;Billions for the few,&#0160;sub-minimum wage for the many. I wonder why the airlines don&#39;t go whole hog&#0160;and separate passengers not by front and back of the plane, but by plane itself. Class I planes -- all sleek and shiny with free champagne supper and lie-flat quilted seats, and Class II planes -- no seats at all, just a few square feet&#0160;on the corrugated metal floor.&#0160;For only a few extra dollars, you will be able to reserve your very own couple of square feet.&#0160;Do you think I&#39;m imagining some sort of wild dystopian future? I don&#39;t think so.&#0160;The way things are going, it&#39;s an inevitability.&#0160;</p>

				<p>A surprising number of current NBA players take the&#0160;floor with their names reversed:&#0160;first name for surname, surname for first.&#0160;The king of this confusion is LeBron James, who in any sensible universe would be named James LeBron.&#0160;And then there&#39;s the budding star Nerlens Noel.&#0160;Who can possibly doubt that&#0160;Nerlens Noel is a copy editor&#39;s error for Nerlens, Noel -- the lost comma&#0160;precipitating the embarrassing inversion? The very same error seems to have produced&#0160;Leonard Kawhi, Jack Jarrett, Howard Dwight,&#0160;Irving Kyrie,&#0160;Arthur Darrell, Leonard Meyers and Anthony Carmelo.&#0160;Then there&#39;s Cory Joseph, the Spurs&#39; talented backup point guard, about whom Edward Arlington Robinson wrote the poem -- o wait no, that was Richard Cory -- or&#0160;Cory Richard, as he would have been known if he had preferred b-ball&#0160;to banking.&#0160;</p>
<p>And there are also two closely&#0160;related&#0160;onomastic anomalies:&#0160;the &quot;two first name syndrome&quot; featuring Chis Paul and&#0160;Paul George (with help from Joel Anthony), and the &quot;two surname&#0160;syndrome,&quot;&#0160;where the&#0160;Dallas Mavericks teammates Tyson Chandler and Chandler Parsons have completely confounded&#0160;prae with&#0160;cog.&#0160;Or&#0160;should their team now be updated&#0160;to&#0160;Mavericks Dallas?</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>My daughter&#39;s nephew-in-law, Zach Appelman, is a talented actor setting out on what might very well turn out to be&#0160;a terrific&#0160;career. (His ascent&#0160;would be more rapid&#0160;if he would take his aunt-in-law&#39;s father&#39;s&#0160;advice and change his stage name to Zach Barrymore or Zach Zellweger, but the young man has too much integrity to comply with aged opportunistic wisdom).</p>
<p>Zach recently played Hamlet at the Hartford Stage in Connecticut (Hartford Courant:&#0160;&quot;a career-propelling performance that at times takes your breath away&quot;).&#0160;I spoke&#0160;with Zach at the recent&#0160;family Thanksgiving and he told me that the director of this <em>Hamlet</em>,&#0160;Darko Tresnjak, made an effort to emphasize the play&#39;s comic passages.&#0160;It was a good idea, I think, because <em>Hamlet</em> is both&#0160;in reading and performance an intermittently hilarious&#0160;piece of dramatic art.&#0160;But, added&#0160;Zach, sometimes the audience laughed at moments that he did not anticipate.&#0160;He cited an example in the&#0160;so-called &quot;bedroom scene,&quot; where&#0160;Hamlet assails Gertrude&#0160;for marrying Claudius.&#0160;Hamlet&#39;s rebuke of his mother&#0160;is harsh&#0160;and dislocating. About her marriage to Claudius, he says&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>You cannot call it love;&#0160; for at your age</p>
<p>The hectic in the blood is tame, it&#39;s humble</p>
<p>It waits upon the judgment.</p>
<p>These lines&#0160;apparently caused quite a commotion among the seniors in the audience.&#0160;It is not hard to imagine why.&#0160;Hamlet, for all his sparkling intelligence, is callow.&#0160;He has&#0160;youth&#39;s&#0160;ignorance about middle-age sexuality -- as&#0160;the silver-threads-among-the-gold demographic must certainly have recognized.&#0160;How could Hamlet (or perhaps even young Shakespeare, a mere thirty-five when he wrote the play), know that desire and passion increase in middle-age as&#0160;impetuous adolescent oestrus and fumblings are superseded by mature appreciation and achievement.</p>
<p>I doubt that&#0160;Shakespeare meant Hamlet&#39;s lines to be funny -- there&#39;s no room for humor in the rhapsody of words that the prince&#0160;directs at his mommy.&#0160;Nevertheless, a modern sophisticated and wrinkle-deep-in-time audience cannot help but titter at Hamlet&#39;s grotesque misjudgment.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>These observations on sex in youth and age were still percolating in my waiting-for-wisdom brain while&#0160;I&#0160;re-read, for, what? &#0160;the fourth or fifth or sixth&#0160;time, Anthony Trollope&#39;s excellent 1857 novel, <em>Barchester Towers</em>.&#0160;My attention was caught, this time through,&#0160;by one of Trollope&#39;s digressions, very pertinent to the topic of autumnal&#0160;love, and which I now transcribe&#0160;in a slightly reduced&#0160;version and which I think is well worthy intense study, especially by my readers of certain late-hectic ages.</p>
<p>&quot;It is, we believe, [says Trollope] common with young men of five and twenty to look on their seniors -- on men of, say, double their own age -- as so&#0160;many stocks and stones -- stocks and stones, that is, in regard to feminine beauty.&quot;</p>
<p>(Let me interject that for &quot;young men of five and twenty&quot;, think &quot;Hamlet.&quot;&#0160;And when Trollope talks of &quot;feminine beauty,&quot; let us recognize that the phrase is a&#0160; euphemistic Victorian surrogate&#0160;for issues of human desire and sexuality that conventional taboos made it impossible for Trollope to address forthrightly.)</p>
<p>&quot;There never was a greater mistake [continues Trollope].&#0160;Men of fifty don&#39;t dance mazurkas, being generally too fat and wheezy;&#0160;nor do they sit for hours together on river banks at their mistresses&#39; feet, being somewhat afraid of rheumatism.&#0160;But for real true love, love at first sight, love to devotion, love that robs a man of his sleep, love [and here Trollope begins to quote from the famous passage in <em>Love&#39;s Labor&#39;s Lost]</em> &#39;that will gaze an eagle blind, love that will hear the lowest sound when the suspicious head of theft is stopped, love that is like a Hercules still climbing trees in the Hesperides, we believe that this best age is from forty-five to seventy.&quot;</p>
<p>Forty-five to seventy, ladies and gentleman.&#0160;Just the age of the men and women in the Hartford playhouse who snickered&#0160;at&#0160;Hamlet junior&#39;s&#0160;incomprehension&#0160;of his mother&#39;s passions.&#0160;</p>
<p>And then Trollope brings his excursus to conclusion with a great sentence in which he both&#0160;disses and dismisses&#0160;immature youthful ardor:</p>
<p>&quot;Up to that age [i.e. forty-five] men are generally given to mere flirting.&quot;</p>
<p>&#0160;As perhaps Hamlet flirts with Ophelia.</p>
<p>It&#39;s intriguing that Trollope recognizes that men of seventy summers may still be ardent lovers and appreciators of the flesh. If he had been a little older and more experienced, he would have increased his estimate to seventy-five, perhaps even eighty. After all, eighty is the new seventy, is it not?&#0160;&#0160;Or he might even have acknowledged that it ain&#39;t over until it&#39;s over.</p>
<p>Trollope was only forty-two when he wrote&#0160;<em>Barchester Towers, </em>so perhaps he knew that he was only capable of mere flirtation with Rose Heseltine.&#0160;But he was 67 when he proposed, in the nasty dystopia <em>The Fixed Period, </em>that 68 was the age at which all men should be required to give up the ghost.&#0160;<em>The Fixed Period</em> is a novel which, at least to this septuagenarian, provokes not titters but guffaws.&#0160;Poor Anthony T. had become so terribly sour, so unlike the Trollope of Barchester.</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>What indeed?&#0160; In Trollope&#39;s <em>Barchester Towers, </em>when&#0160;Mrs Quiverful discovers that her husband, rector of Puddingdale, is not to become warden of&#0160;Hiram&#39;s Hospital, she sets out to Barchester to confront the bishop. Not a walker, and not the owner of a horse or carriage of her own, she &quot;begged that Farmer Subsoil would take her thither in his tax-cart.&quot;&#0160; A tax-cart, as far as the dictionary is concerned, is a &quot;small spring-cart on which a tax is paid.&quot;&#0160;So it is properly a &quot;taxed-cart.&quot;&#0160; A &quot;spring-cart&quot; is a &quot;springed-cart&quot; -- i.e a cart with springs.&#0160;But were taxes paid on&#0160;all vehicles?&#0160;If so, why should this one kind of vehicle be called a &quot;tax-cart?&quot;&#0160;But if not, why should this particular kind of vehicle be singled out of taxation.&#0160;Trollope does not illuminate.&#0160;</p>
<p>And so to the other nineteenth-century horsedrawn vehicles (barouche, basket carriage, berlin, <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2006/01/new_words.html">britchka</a>, brougham, buckboard, buggy, cabriolet, caleche, cariole, carryall, chaise, chariot, clarence, concord wagon, coupe, croydon, curricle, cutter, daumont, dearborn, dennet, diligence, dog-cart, fiacre, fly, fourgon, four-wheeler, gig, go-cart, governess cart, hansom, herdic, jaunty car, jersey-wagon, kibitka, landau, <a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2010/04/horsedrawn-vehicle.html.html " target="_self">patache</a>, phaeton, pill-box, post-chaise, rockaway, shandrydan, shay, sociable, spider-phaeton, spring-van, stanhope, sulky, surrey, T-cart, telyezhka, tilbury, <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2008/01/the-tarantass.html">tarantass</a>, trap, troika, victoria, vis-a-vis, wagonette,&#0160;whitechapel, and&#0160;wurt) now add &quot;tax-cart.&quot;</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>So far <a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2014/06/occupations-not-for-me-updated-edition.html" target="_self" title="">my list</a>&#0160;includes taxi-driver, trapeze artist, surgeon, dog-groomer, monk, and hostage. Here&#39;s another.&#0160;</p>
<p>Last week I had a room&#0160;on the twelfth floor of&#0160;a new downtown Brooklyn hotel. From my window I could watch a new skyscraper being assembled. The basic I-beam members were in place and&#0160;concrete floors and ceilings had been poured.&#0160;But the structure&#0160;lacked&#0160;external walls!!&#0160; Where there will&#0160;be walls sometime it the future, preferably before the building is leased and&#0160;inhabited, was what looked to be an&#0160;orange plastic mesh, perhaps reinforced with a thin cable or two.&#0160;From my vantage point, I could&#0160;could see right through to the interior of the building.&#0160;There men on aluminum stilts were spreading on the ceilings something that might have been plaster but was more likely some sort of curing preparation for raw concrete.&#0160;Let me make this clear:&#0160;men on stilts were plastering ceilings in rooms that had no exterior walls and where a slip or trip would send them plummeting&#0160;twelve stories to the hard sidewalk.&#0160;Frankly, I found it difficult to watch without vivid and&#0160;horrible imaginings flashing across my vulnerable brain.&#0160;So without hesitation I can add to the set of occupations in which I would fail ignomiously, stilt-walker in high-rise construction.&#0160;A terrifying way to make a living, especially for people like me, pre-frightened by heights.&#0160;</p>
