					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2014/11/disasters-consoling.html">Joy of Extinctions</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I am inordinately fond of&#0160;mass extinctions.&#0160;I find them consoling.</p>
<p>The most recent mass extinction, the newly-famous Yucatan-comet-iridium K-T boundary event of&#0160;66 million years ago is one of my personal&#0160;favorites. To recall:&#0160;a comet six or seven miles in diameter, zooming along at 65,00 miles per hour and therefore generating a good bit of momentum, smacked into&#0160;what is now the Yucatan peninsula&#0160;with&#0160;the force of a heck of a large number&#0160;of&#0160;hydrogen bombs.&#0160;The impact produced&#0160;a crater that was initially&#0160;an astonishing 65 miles across and 18 miles deep, triggered massive earthquakes as well as tsunamis half a mile high, and briefly heated the earth&#39;s atmosphere to hundreds of degrees.&#0160;Within minutes, everything as far as&#0160;Illinois&#0160;became wasteland. Because of the blanket of smoke and dust, sunlight could not reach the earth, so temperatures plummeted, completely disrupting the world-wide chlorophyll-based food chain.&#0160;At the same time, downpours of acid rain corrosive&#0160;enough to dissolve rocks killed everything they&#0160;touched. A full 80% of the world&#39;s&#0160;animal&#0160;species disappeared -- along with half of all land plants.&#0160;</p>
<p>Although it must have been quite a show, it was not as thorough a disaster as the&#0160;Permian extinction (252 million years ago) which killed 95% of all living species, but it is, rather, comparable in scope&#0160;to the Ordovician extinction (444 million years ago), the Devonian&#0160;(375 million years ago) and the Triassic (201 million years ago).&#0160;It&#39;s no wonder that folks&#0160;in the know estimate that 99.9% of all the species that have ever existed have disappeared.</p>
<p>The knowledge that there will inevitably be another extinction helps to put our daily woes in perspective.&#0160;How can I worry about whether the grout should be &quot;Desert Sand&quot; or &quot;Forest Gray&quot; or whether my newest&#0160;skin thingy is benign or dangerous&#0160;when our species and the&#0160;cool green earth itself are doomed.&#0160;Judgment day is a-coming, whether in the form of another wayfaring comet, or a series of explosive volanoes, or the release of the nitrogen and carbon now sequestered in the permafrost, or some event entirely unpredictable. Something is going to happen, as sure as shooting.&#0160;Perhaps, some think, it&#39;s already happening.&#0160;</p>
<p>So that&#39;s one benefit of a mass extinction -- it helps you sleep well at night.&#0160;Why worry about trivialities?</p>
<p>And also:&#0160;if it weren&#39;t for the extinctions, we wouldn&#39;t be here at all.&#0160;If the dinosaurs hadn&#39;t been killed by the comet they would most likely&#0160;have continued to dominate the planet, and the&#0160;descendants of velociraptors and mosasaurs and thunder-lizards sure as heck weren&#39;t going to leave a lot of breathing room for&#0160;the proto-primates.</p>
<p>Extinctions are one of the many improbable accidents that got us here. Extinctions are jolly.&#0160;</p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2014/11/sleeping.html">Another Myth Debunked</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>One day, back in the 50s, our neighborhood softball team was hosting a team from some exotic location, such as Bensonhurst, at the PS 217 schoolyard. I think I must have been playing either shortstop or second base, because I had an excellent view of the earthshaking event that I&#39;m about to describe.</p>
<p>It was the case that our guys&#0160;were often a little less well-outfitted than the opposition because we didn&#39;t have enough baseball gloves for the whole team and had to borrow them from the visitors.&#0160;Jimmy Nolan was playing first base and early in the game, possibly in the&#0160;first inning, someone on the other team hit a grounder to third and the third baseman made a good on-target throw to first.&#0160;But Jimmy, who happened to be wearing&#0160;an official but I suspect borrowed first baseman&#39;s glove with a big pocket, reached out for the throw&#0160;with his right hand (he was a southpaw)&#0160;but let the ball miss the glove. He then&#0160;casually caught the ball with his&#0160;bare left hand which&#0160;dangled nonchalantly at his knee. I was impressed, as was everyone,&#0160;and I thought, &quot;that&#39;s the way to show these visitors how tough we are -- we don&#39;t even need the gloves that we&#39;ve borrowed.&quot; I was proud to be a PS 217 Misfit.</p>
<p>Sixty years later, last week in fact, at a reunion of PS 217 softball players, I asked Spike Cohen if he remembered the play.&#0160;He did, much to my surprise. &quot;Oh yes,&quot; he said, &#39;and I even remember who threw the ball.&#0160;It was Marv Lasky, and he had a cannon for an arm.&quot;&#0160;So&#0160;The Play became even more dramatic and&#0160;mythical. I thought, wow, I&#39;m not the only one who remembers that catch,&#0160;which ought to go down in history as one of the great iconic moments in PS 217 schoolyard athletics.&#0160;And then, since Jimmy himself was present at the reunion, I asked him if he&#0160;recalled the Great Event.&#0160;He said he did.&#0160;So I asked him,&quot;Why did you do that?&#0160;Why did you let the ball go under the glove? &#0160;Why did you catch it with the wrong hand?&quot;&#0160; And he answered, &quot;I misjudged the throw.&#0160;It was a mistake.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>I was deflated, nay crushed. For all these many years, I had been convinced that&#0160;Jimmy had made that play on purpose to make a statement.&#0160;But now I know that it was merely an accident. And so another myth comes to be&#0160;de-mythologized by revisionist historiography.</p>
<p>Next thing you know, they&#39;ll try to tell us&#0160;Babe Ruth didn&#39;t point to the right-field bleachers just before hitting that home run.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>If you listen to the announcers of the NBA games, basketball players defy the laws and logic of physics. They &quot;create space.&quot;</p>
<p>One of the greatest space-creators was Shaquille O. Others merely imitate his technique.&#0160;His most characteristic play was to&#0160;drive his massive left shoulder into the chest of the defender, knocking him backwards a couple of feet.&#0160;When he had gained a sufficient advantage and had room to maneuver, he would flip the ball (awkwardly) toward the basket.&#0160;HIs defender would as likely as not be charged with a foul while the&#0160;pre-Newtonian announcers would celebrate him for &#39;creating space.&#39;&#0160;And a beautiful game would be transformed into a brutal game.&#0160;</p>
<p>And why is LeBron James allowed to create space on his every drive to the basket?&#0160; He&#39;s gifted enough that he doesn&#39;t need the advantage; but nevertheless, he routinely pushes off with his off hand, often lodging his off-elbow in the chest of the hapless defender.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>I often watch LeBron create space on hdtv where I&#39;ve precorded the game.&#0160;I can therefore watch the same play again and again.&#0160;In doing so I stop time, or run time backwards.&#0160;He creates space, I stop time.</p>
<p>So two can play at defying Einstein.&#0160;</p>

				<p>I awoke this morning&#0160;from a semi-nightmare all in a dither about&#0160;Superman&#39;s x-ray vision. Inasmuch as the blue-haired one&#0160;can see through dense objects (except, if I remember correctly, lead) then&#0160;it follows as night the day that&#0160;he&#0160;cannot help seeing through his own eyelids.&#0160;Superman must therefore suffer from what the sleep consultants call&#0160;&quot;poor sleep&#0160;hygiene.&quot; Unable to&#0160;keep the light out of his own eyes, he must&#0160;therefore be subject to&#0160;a degree of insomnia.&#0160;No wonder he&#39;s&#0160;always powing someone in the jaw -- he&#39;s just not getting enough sleep.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Has anyone else given thought to this important topic?</p>

				<p>We were playing punchball&#0160;on the&#0160;PS 217&#0160;&quot;big court.&quot;&#0160;It must have&#0160;been during school hours because Mrs. McGowan&#0160;(a fifth grade teacher) was the umpire&#0160;and the players included the entire population of the class, not just the regulars.&#0160;Michael Lurie, the least athletic student in the grade,&#0160;and perhaps in the entire borough, was told&#0160; to play third base, and obviously&#0160;unfamiliar with the game and with Billy Cox, stationed both feet directly on the white-painted&#0160;base.&#0160;Someone&#0160;hit (punched) the spaldeen&#0160;toward him and he froze, but the ball&#0160;landed&#0160;precisely&#0160;in his crotch, and lodged,&#0160;and after a bit he found it there and held it up.&#0160;We all knew that the&#0160;batter was out, but Mrs. McGowan, as ignorant as Michael Lurie, shouted, &quot;he caught it illegally&quot; and awarded&#0160;first base to the&#0160;batter.&#0160;I remember&#0160;that several of us protested, but&#0160;Mrs. Mc Gowan was adamant.<br />&#0160;<br />It was a miscarriage of justice.&#0160;A violation of the rules. The umpire was incompetent.&#0160;How could I ever trust authority again?&#0160;</p>

				<p>My friend Mike, who is pushing eighty very hard, told me this story.&#0160;&quot;In the 1940s we lived in Sarasota, where the Red Sox held spring training.&#0160;I had had&#0160;rheumatic fever and my mother over-reacted and kept me in bed for years.&#0160;Nevertheless,&#0160;I was an altar boy and&#0160;I also would get out of the house&#0160;whenever I could to watch the Red Sox play -- Johnny Pesky, Johnny Doerr, Rudy York, Vern Stephens, Dom DiMaggio, and of course Ted Williams.&#0160;One day I talked to Ted Williams and asked him for an autograph.&#0160;He said he would bring&#0160;me a signed picture.&#0160;He did, but I wasn&#39;t at home.&#0160;Ted Williams came to my house and I wasn&#39;t there!!&#0160; My mother said, &#39;a very tall man came&#0160;by and gave me this for you. I told him you were at church.&#39;&#0160;I thought, how can I trust&#0160;a religion&#0160;that would let me be at church rather than at home when Ted Williams called.&#0160;That&#39;s when&#0160;I stopped believing.&quot;&#0160; It&#39;s a great story and I&#39;ve recorded it exactly as he told it.&#0160;</p>

				<p>There&#39;s a brief sentence in <em>The Second Part of King Henry the</em> <em>Fourth</em>&#0160;that continues to&#0160;move me no matter how frequently&#0160;I return to it.&#0160;I&#39;s a passage that&#0160;resonates in my latter-day soul.&#0160;</p>
<p>Falstaff and Doll Tearsheet (whose name, obviously, indicates her&#0160;profession) are old acquaintances and&#0160;old rivals who are evermore at odds. &quot;They never meet but they fall to discord.&quot;&#0160; They seem to delight in exchanging insults. To Doll, Falstaff is a &quot;muddy conger,&quot; &quot;a huge full hogshead,&quot; &quot;a poor ape,&quot; and even, when she is more&#0160;affectionate, &quot;a whoreson little tidy Bartholemew boar-pig&quot;.&#0160; Falstaff is equally abusive. But at one point in the play, there is a magical moment when&#0160;Shakespeare allows&#0160;Doll to propose a truce.&#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;Come,&quot; she says, &quot;I&#39;ll be friends with thee, Jack, thou art going to the wars, and whether I shall ever see thee again or no there is nobody cares.&quot;&#0160; <em><br /></em></p>
<p>I think that what electrifies me is the last phrase, &quot;there is nobody cares. &quot; &#0160;A less imaginative, less empathetic writer than Shakespeare would have ended the sentence more predictably: he would have written,&#0160;&quot;nobody knows&quot;&#0160;and would have therefore repeated the commonplace that the future is unknowable.&#0160;But Shakespeare raises the ante&#0160;-- as he so often does.&#0160;&quot;Nobody cares&quot;&#0160;is&#0160;demotic shorthand for &quot;nobody else but we two care&quot;-- which I take to suggest that Doll reflects not that the universe is dicey but rather that we are each of us isolated and unimportant except as we are valued by our nearest friends and the people with whom we have gone through life.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>The sentence is nostalgic in the best sense. It is not&#0160;sentimental;&#0160; Doll does not romanticize hers or Falstaff&#39;s past.&#0160;Instead she faces the aleatory universe bravely.&#0160;You are at risk,&#0160;it could turn out badly, let&#39;s be friends now, all that matters is the moment.&#0160;The sentence is valedictory and at the same time&#0160;extremely warm.&#0160;</p>
<p>Perhaps I&#39;m projecting my own feelings onto Doll Tearsheet.&#0160;I&#39;m at the point in my life in which&#0160;I value (perhaps even treasure) the people whom I&#39;ve worked with, or argued with, liked or&#0160;loved.&#0160; (I have even come to value some whom I&#39;ve not loved.)&#0160;They&#39;re all part of the fabric of my life and they are all disappearing, one by one -- going to the wars, we might say.&#0160;And nobody cares.&#0160;Except us.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I read <em>Planet of the Bugs</em> (Chicago, 2014) by Scott Richard Shaw, a Wyoming entomologist. It&#39;s a good book on a great topic -- the evolution of insects. In the acknowledgements, Shaw thanks his editor for helping him to &quot;shape a bulky manuscript into a sleeker book,&quot; but I think I would have much preferred the fatter unpublished version, which I imagine would have been heavier on curious, fascinating and sometimes lurid detail. I think that Shaw&#39;s editor may have misunderestimated his potential enthusiastic readership.</p>
<p>Shaw loves his insects and writes the evolution of life bug-centrically. Instead of the conventional telling, where everything leads ineluctably to majestic us, <em>homines sapientes</em>, Shaw inscribes the triumph of the six-legged kind. For example, Shaw disparages our (I mean mankind&#39;s) walking and running. &quot;Two-legged bipedal locomotion is so unstable and difficult to master that it seems highly improbable and almost pointless.&quot; He has a point there. A child takes a year to learn to walk, and even after he does so, he staggers like a drunken sailor for several months. No other creature on earth is so ungainly at the outset.</p>
<p>Moreover, Shaw adds, six-leggedness optimizes balance and stability and has the potential for rapid motion. &quot;Six legged form is sublime. Fifty million insect species can&#39;t possibly be wrong.&quot;</p>
<p>If I understand it correctly, most insect species propel themselves by alternately moving one of their two leg tripods -- and tripods are inherently stable.&#0160; It&#39;s a great system.&#0160;</p>
<p>Now that I&#39;ve achieved the &quot;golden years,&quot; I spend much too much time worrying about that I&#39;m about to crash to the ground and break a wrist or a hip -- all too common afflictions among the two-legged kind.&#0160; No one has ever seen a beetle trip, or an ant sprawl embarrassingly on the sidewalk.&#0160;</p>
<p>Too bad we don&#39;t have six legs. Or even four (the other two having evolved into arms). We&#39;d be better off. We&#39;d need two pairs of hips, of course, and copulation would be more complicated, but it would be worth it. Speed, stability, grace. Four legs would definitely be sublime.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I&#39;m glad that we evolved an internal skeleton, which the insects never did. I wouldn&#39;t want to bother with an exoskeleton or carapace. It would be ungainly, troublesome. And probably accompanied by all sorts of emotional displays. &quot;Don&#39;t pay any attention to him. He&#39;s moulting.&quot;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>The old West Bradford cemetery, which is carved out of our land, is peopled by the Worthleys, Hacketts, Kidders, and Sleepers who first settled this part of Vermont. Some were long lived, some passed through this thoroughfare of woe only briefly. There are o-so-many of those sad stone lozenges at the foot of a grave that represent infants who died too young to be christened.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Our&#0160;most disturbing gravestone, in my opinion, is the the one for&#0160;Stanley Franklin&#0160;Dwinell, M.D.&#0160;born in 1920 and who died along with James Scott Dwinell (age 7), Peter Dewey Dwinell (age 6), and Jonathan Dwinell&#0160;(age&#0160;2) all on the same day, December 11, 1952.&#0160;&#0160;What a horror, I thought -- a man and his three young sons all at once.&#0160;A tragedy.&#0160;But what sort?&#0160; A plane crash?&#0160; A boating accident?&#0160;House fire?&#0160; Perhaps even an infectious disease.&#0160;</p>
<p>An internet search came up empty-handed, so I enquired of our longer-tenured neighbors. And here&#39;s the local legend. &quot;Oh yes, the vet,&quot; I was told (although the tombstone distinctly says M. D., rather than D. V. M). &#0160;&quot;He was driving along Route 5 in Fairlee one winter morning and it was an icy road and foggy and he went out of control and all four of them died instantly. His wife was at home drinking a cup of coffee when she got the phone call. She left the coffee half-finished on the kitchen table, left the house without a word, and was never seen again. Didn&#39;t even take her clothes. Just disappeared.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>It&#39;s a good story and it sounds like the plot of a short story by Alice Munro -- but I don&#39;t believe it.&#0160;&#0160;The same gravestone reveals that Constance S. Dwinell, wife of Doctor Stanley Franklin Dwinnel, died January 25, 1985, at age 65.&#0160;</p>
<p>I&#39;m trying to imagine the remainder of poor Constance&#39;s&#0160;life. It&#39;s hard to construct a scenario that isn&#39;t completely dreadful.&#0160;Most likely, Constance returned, shattered, to the small town in New Hampshire, let us say, where she must have been born.&#0160;She moved back into her parents&#39; house and took a job as a town librarian, her life blighted by the&#0160;tragedy.&#0160;She never remarried.</p>
<p>But I prefer to imagine that she moved to Paris (she had majored in French at Wellesley, I&#39;m guessing,) and never told a soul about her first family. There she was wooed and won by Baron Guy de Condorcet de Noialles but could never conceive a child. It was a long happy marriage. After Guy died, crashing his motorcycle on the Riviera, she returned to the States a rich woman, and lived out her life in a Park Avenue apartment in New York. Friends and neighbors who had no idea of her first life were shocked when they read the will which specified that she be buried, along with Stanley and the children, right here in West Bradford.&#0160;</p>
<p>That&#39;s my story and I&#39;m sticking with it though I would very much&#0160;like to know the truth.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p><em>November 14, 2015&#0160;</em> Larry Coffin, president of the Bradford Historical Society, writes:</p>
<p>I would like to correct your information on Dr. Stanley Dwinell.&#0160; He and his three sons were killed in a collision with a train on a crossing in Newbury, Vt as he was going to treat a patient at Woodsville (NH) Cottage Hospital. His father Dr. Franklin Dwinell was in a car following.&#0160;</p>

				<p>I&#39;m reading <em>Middlemarch</em> again.&#0160;It&#39;s either my fourth or fifth time through the best novel ever written in the English language.&#0160;If you want to know about the nineteenth century, start with George Eliot.&#0160;</p>
<p>I had the oddest feelings fifty pages in.&#0160;(Actually, &quot;pages&quot; is an anachronism because&#0160;I am&#0160;reading on the kindle.)&#0160; Lydgate is flirting with beautiful, empty-headed Rosamund Vincy.&#0160; I thought &quot;this time let him be smart;&#0160; let him not marry Rosamund.&quot;&#0160; I must have been in an unusally plastic frame of mind, or in some sort of reading reverie.&#0160;I know that novels are immutable, but I was hoping against hope that Lydgate had learned something since the last time I read the novel. Even&#0160;though he made a fool of himself with that actress in Paris.&#0160;And then last night, just before I turned out the lights, Lydgate did it again -- fell for the blonde curls and the glistening eye.&#0160;He&#39;s learned nothing, not a thing,&#0160;in the last ten years.&#0160;And now I have to live through the saga as&#0160;his crush turns into crushing disappointment and bitterness.&#0160;Marry in haste, repent at leisure. Poor Lydgate.</p>
<p>&#0160;The kindle changes the input but doesns&#39;t do a thing for the&#0160;outcome.&#0160;</p>

				<p>Netherlands-Argentina was exciting and rather beautiful until it went to penalty kicks.&#0160;What a foolish way to find a winner! It&#39;s as if, in basketball, tie games led to a foul-shooting contest, or if, in baseball, instead of extra innings they started hitting fungoes for distance.&#0160;Soccer travesties itself by resorting to penalty kicks. A better solution:&#0160;play until someone scores.&#0160;Sudden death. I mean, sudden victory.&#0160;I would hope the game (the match) would end before midfielders start to collapse from&#0160;exhaustion.</p>
<p>Brazil-Germany offers a second opportunity for improvement.&#0160;Is it not time to&#0160;institute a mercy rule.&#0160; When there&#39;s a mismatch in junior high girls softball and one team gets ahead by ten runs, the game is called off. It&#39;s over. It should be the same in soccer. Team A, let us say, runs up a five goal lead -- stop the game, everyone go home.&#0160; Why should a team (Brazil, for example) suffer interminable humiliation.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>And a bonus recommendation:&#0160;no biting. Recidivist biters should be&#0160;banned for life.&#0160;</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Here are some career paths that it&#39;s just as well I didn&#39;t tread.&#0160;Opportunities for failure and misery.</p>
<p>1. Taxi driver in a large city (especially a city that&#39;s not on a grid, such as Boston or London.&#0160; Even the DC-diagonals drive me nuts).&#0160; I&#39;ve earlier written about my incapacitating <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2006/09/geographical_dy.html">directional disability</a>, but I neglected to mention that I tend to get into a bit of a panic when I&#39;m lost --&#0160; I start driving much too fast and far too waywardly.&#0160;So, dear friends, imagine me a befuddled cabbie, sweating super-profusely, while the fares in back scream bloody murder when I take the exact wrong turn for the fourth consecutive time.&#0160;It would be a freakin&#39; nightmare.&#0160;Related occupations that won&#39;t work:&#0160;tour guide, wilderness guide, tracker.</p>
<p>2. Dog-groomer. I&#39;ve hinted at my lack of affection for doggies <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2006/01/my_campaign_for.html">before.</a>&#0160; I just don&#39;t think I&#39;d do a good job blow-drying Fido or brushing Fifi&#39;s teeth.&#0160;(Incidentally, I&#39;m joined in my prejudice against curs by gentle Will himself, whose references to canines are uniformly unfriendly: the superbly wicked sisters in <em>King Lear, </em>for example, are &quot;dog-hearted daughters.&quot;)&#0160; &#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>3. Trapeze artist. I&#39;m terrified of heights and I have absolutely no sense of rhythm.&#0160; Imagine me launching myself at just the right moment to catch my partner by the ankles. Related opportunity for ignominious disgrace: dance instructor.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>4.&#0160; Surgeon.&#0160;I&#39;m far too squeamish to be poking around in someone&#39;s innards. Even channel surfing has become a dangerous pastime since we accidentally acquired the live surgery channel.&#0160;Motto:&#0160; &quot;all gore, all the time.&quot;&#0160;I have to keep clicking that remote lest I accidentally pause at an open-heart moment.&#0160; The FCC should mandate a warning and a five-second delay:&#0160; &quot;Caution:&#0160;palpitating inner organs on view shortly.&quot;&#0160;Related non-opportunity:&#0160;veterinary surgeon.</p>
<p>5. Hostage. Chained to a bed somewhere in the &#39;stans wouldn&#39;t work for me. I must have my oatmeal every morning at 7 a.m., and I need to move my bowels shortly afterward. Moreover, if I don&#39;t eat lunch right on time, I get wicked headaches. Not to mention that I don&#39;t function well in rooms that are either too hot or too cold or not well ventilated, and I can&#39;t stand tobacco. On the whole, I&#39;d be a mighty cranky hostage.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>6. Monk. Poverty I could manage, I suppose. Chastity would be a struggle but with plain fare, isolation, and cold showers I might succeed (but why?). Obedience?&#0160; Never. Not a chance. Nope. Not for me.</p>

				<p>I&#39;m late as usual getting in the vegetable garden.&#0160;After many years of adding manure and compost and leaves, the soil is soft and fluffy.&#0160;But every year, rocks and more rocks.&#0160; When I first started this garden in 1978, I was pulling out boulders;&#0160;then large stones, then small stones, now one-inch stones and pebbles.&#0160;Why do I continue to&#0160;do so?&#0160;</p>
<p>Because my father took the rocks out of his garden.&#0160;I remember once, as a small child, saying to him, &quot;Dad, you&#39;ll never get all the rocks out of your garden.&quot;&#0160; &quot;True enough, he replied, &quot;but I&#39;ll have fewer rocks&quot;&#0160; From which response I realized that he was not an idealist but a meliorist, as I&#0160;am. So every year, a new crop of rocks.&#0160;I put the rocks on the driveway, in the low spots where puddles accumulate after a rainstorm.&#0160; It&#39;s ridiculous, I know;&#0160; we order seven cubic yards of crushed&#0160;stone for the driveway every few years, so a bucket of rocks makes very little difference.&#0160; But if feels good to perform two useful services at once:&#0160; rocks out of the garden, rocks on the road.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><em>Fuffa</em>&#0160;is a&#0160;&quot;<em>cosa inutile, ciarpame</em>&quot; [a useless thing, trash] according to Federico Roncoroni in&#0160;<em>Sillabario</em> <em>della Memoria</em> (Milano, 2010).&#0160; It&#39;s a dialectical (probably Milanese) word not found in most Italian dictionaries.&#0160;Roncoroni tells us that his aunt Evelina called the tiny balls of material that sometimes form on the surface of socks &quot;fuffa.&quot;&#0160; She likened them to &quot;<em>furuncoli</em>&quot; [pimples].&#0160;The etymology of <em>fuffa</em>&#0160;is obscure. Roncoroni proposes that it might be merely&#0160;onomatopoeic, related to English fluff which signifies, as he says,&#0160;&quot;<em>lanugine o peluria</em>&quot; [fuzz or nap].&#0160;But fluff,&#0160;fuzzy stuff in English, derives from&#0160;Latin <em>vellus</em> [fleece] or &quot;<em>villus</em>&quot; [hair].&#0160; It&#39;s most commonly used as&#0160;a verb (&quot;to fluff a pillow&#39;).&#0160;In theatrical jargon, a person can fluff or flub his lines.&#0160;Fluff is also a horrid marshmallow-like confection that appeared in my childhood (though it dates to the 1920) and put me off sweets for years.&#0160;As far as I can tell, the meaning &quot;a light woman&quot; as in &quot;a bit of fluff&quot; is not present in the Italian &quot;<em>fuffa</em>.&quot; I doubt whether &quot;<em>fuffa</em>&quot; and &quot;fluff&quot; are linked, unless &quot;<em>fuffa</em>&quot; also descends from&#0160;&quot;<em>vellus</em>.&quot;</p>

				<p>In <em>Breaking Bad, </em>Walter White disappears for a few days when he is kidnapped -- he escapes only by murdering&#0160;his&#0160;meth-addled drug dealer.&#0160;In order to cover his tracks and account to his family for the missing days, he feigns amnesia.&#0160;And he&#39;s persuasive, possibly because everyone has seen so many amnesia movies.

				<p>Why doesn&#39;t Dick Cheney put a bullet in his brain?&#0160;It would do him (and his reputation) a world of good.&#0160; What could possibly stand in his way?&#0160;Once he sprinkles the ratsbane on his porridge -- and, of course, leaves behind a detailed and humble letter of apology --&#0160; he will begin to free his soul of sin and to enjoy some peace of mind.&#0160;When he has fallen on his sword, his lackeys and toadies will be able to claim that although&#0160;he was a black-hearted knave, at least he wasn&#39;t a shameless black-hearted knave.&#0160;They can try to persuade us that although he was egregiously and dangerously wrong, he was, like another suicide, Othello, &quot;great of heart.&quot;&#0160; But if Cheney continues in his surly, obstinate, unapologetic lip-curling silence -- why then, he&#39;ll go down in the books as an unrepentant demi-devil like Iago (&quot;From this time forth I never will speak word&quot;).&#0160;</p>
<p>Cheney has brought disgrace upon our beloved nation and upon himself.&#0160;Using faked spy data, he suckered the ignorant, feckless Decider and almost the entire Congress into invading Iraq.&#0160;His war has been a monumental disaster.&#0160;&quot;Full of scorpions [should be] his brain.&quot;&#0160;At this moment of writing, Cheney is guilty of killing 3260 American soldiers and maiming (by official count -- who can possibly guess at the truth?) 24,314 others.&#0160;If Cheney has even the most rudimentary of consciences, on it lays the heavy burden of 60,000 to 100,000 Iraqi souls.&#0160;The Dickster has cost America $414 billion dollars, loss of prestige and the squandering of oceans of good will.&#0160;Like Anthony, he &quot;has lived in such dishonor/That the gods detest [his] baseness.&quot;&#0160; But Antony took the proper course.&#0160;When Cheney dispatches himself -- &quot;after the high Roman fashion,&quot; let&#39;s hope -- he&#39;ll have taken the first step toward rehabilitating himself and the nation.&#0160;For him not to do the deed would be ignoble.&#0160;</p>
<p>Dick:&#0160; I know that you&#39;re hunkering in your bomb-proof shelter.&#0160; I know that you&#39;re up late at night, sleepless with guilt.&#0160;You&#39;re cruising the internet, perchance googling &quot;Cheney + suicide,&quot; and you&#39;re wavering in your purpose.&#0160;Dick -- take my considered advice.&#0160;I&#39;m thinking of your place in history.&#0160; At this point, &quot;you have no friend,/ But resolution and the briefest end.&quot;&#0160; You&#39;ll immediately feel better.&#0160; It&#39;s a no-brainer.&#0160;Go for it.</p>
<p><em>April 10.</em>&#0160; Spike Schapiro comments:&#0160; &quot;Dr. M. -- I&#39;ve read your exhortation to suicide.&#0160; You are, as usual, falsely optimistic. Cheney can&#39;t off himself because a) he&#39;s shameless and b) he&#39;s a total coward, and c) he has no self-knowledge and d) he can&#39;t point a shotgun.&#0160; You cite the precedents of Othello and Anthony but they&#39;re both great spirits and therefore irrelevant.&#0160; Cheney is a slug. Moreover,&#0160;Cheney can&#39;t be &quot;great of heart&quot; -- he has no heart of his own --either a transplant or some mechanical contraption.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p><em>April 4, 2014&#0160; </em> Why is this man still alive?&#0160; Allowed to give interviews?&#0160; Is there no justice in our&#0160;sublunary world?&#0160;</p>

Dozens of Earls, including the diminutive Boykins, and my favorite, nomenclature-wise, Acie Earl. Also Brevin and many other Knights. Nor can we forget Marques Johnson or Marquis Teague. And Mel Counts, the 7&#39; foot guard. Baron Davis, Walter Dukes, Tayshaun Prince. Royal Ivey. Let&#39;s not forget Mike &quot;The Czar&quot; Fratello.</p>

While I&#39;m very accomplished at <em>going</em> to sleep, I&#39;m deficient at staying there for the full eight hours.&#0160;By&#0160;two o&#39;clock in the morning, I&#39;m awake -- reading, watching a previously-recorded basketball or baseball game, or, more often, lying there with the body dormant but the mind in a frenzy about our doomed civilization and about&#0160;whether&#0160;my newest skin thingy&#0160;has already metastasized.&#0160;</p>
<p>So I decided that it was time for divine intervention.&#0160;</p>
<p>Surprisingly, there&#39;s&#0160;no patron saint of sleep. The closest is&#0160;St. Dymphna, but she&#39;s more properly, at least according to her website,&#0160;the saint of &quot;mental and nervous disorders.&quot;&#0160;Insomnia a nervous disorder?&#0160; I don&#39;t think so, but on the other hand, she works cheap.&#0160;To light a seven-day votive candle at her shrine in Massillon, Ohio costs&#0160;only $3.00 -- so what the heck.&#0160;And it can be done online,&#0160;via Paypal.&#0160;it&#39;s a bargain; why not give it a try?</p>
<p>Then there&#39;s St. Vitus, the patron saint of oversleeping, also not exactly my problem. But St. Vitus is a busy fellow, inasmuch as he&#39;s also the patron saint of actors, comedians, dancers, and epileptics when he&#39;s not busy warding off lightning strikes and fending off attacks by wild animals. He&#39;s kind of the go-to saint for all manner of things, but as far as i can tell, simple insomnia is not in his portfolio.</p>
<p>Inasmuch as I&#39;m even-handed about religions, I think I&#39;ll try Hypnos. who is billed as a genuine sleep god. Hypnos is the father of Morpheus (the god of dreams), brother of Thanatos (yes, that Thanatos) and the son of Nyx (night) and Erebus (the deity of darkness). Quite the family tree. In order to placate the entire group a three-buck candle would be clearly insufficient, even insulting. I figured better to go whole-hog and sacrifice a lamb. However, there are no lambs in my condo unit, and I was, frankly, afraid of making a mess, so I thought that &#0160;perhaps a lamb chop would do just as well. I mean, how would Hypnos know. So I checked the freezer and would you know it not a lamb chop to be found. However, I did manage to locate a couple of pork chops which I think will serve just as well. Tonight, I will eat them in honor of Hypnos. By the way, I make a nice sauce out of orange juice, soy sauce, and garam masala. I&#39;m hoping that honoring the deity will earn me a couple of good nights&#39; sleeps.</p>
<p>And as a&#0160;backup, I&#39;ll have 5 mg of ambien at hand.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>My 75th, my diamond jubilee, is coming up&#0160;in a few days, and it&#39;s about time that&#0160;family and friends gave serious thought to the celebration.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>When Queen Elizabeth II had her jubilee&#0160;just two years ago,&#0160;there was a specially-commissioned anthem, a service for two thousand folks at St. Paul&#39;s, an equestrian extravaganza (550 horses), a flotilla of schooners on the Thames, and something that involved&#0160;the lighting of 4000 beacons world-wide.&#0160;</p>
<div>
<div style="width: 222px;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Queen_at_the_Diamond_Jubilee.JPG"><img alt="" height="147" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Queen_at_the_Diamond_Jubilee.JPG/220px-Queen_at_the_Diamond_Jubilee.JPG" width="220" /></a></div>
</div>
<p>Frankly, a bit much.&#0160;A little over-the-top, if you know what&#0160;I mean.&#0160; Although&#0160;who can fail to admire&#0160; the hat.&#0160;</p>
<p>Last year, I suggested that a good choice for my birthday might be an Irish&#0160;&quot;starter&quot; <a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2013/01/birthday.html " target="_self" title="">castle.</a>&#0160; The year before that, I hinted at one or two ancient <a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2011/12/birthday.html" target="_self" title="">sculptures</a><a href="tp://www.drmetablog.com/2011/12/birthday.html " target="_self" title="">.</a>&#0160; But, disappointingly, there were no takers.&#0160;Birthdays number 73 and 74 were left unacknowledged -- to the shame of my fans.&#0160;</p>
<p>But here is an opportunity for redemption. Diamonds for the diamond jubilee. I would greatly appreciate a pair -- a singleton is tacky -- of those big hunking earrings that the professional athletes wear. They can be easily purchased, I understand, in the $900,000 to $1,100,000 range, depending on size and color.&#0160;</p>
<p>My only reluctance&#0160;is that piercing the&#0160;ears would violate the integrity of my body.&#0160;&#0160;Also, I&#39;m afraid of the pain.&#0160;So it&#39;s either pressure clips or ear-piercing under general anesthesia.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#39;t want to drop so precious&#0160;an ornament and then lose it forever when I vacuum the rug.&#0160;</p>
<p>Gosh, now I&#39;m worried if&#0160;I can afford the insurance.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I&#39;ve written before about <a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2006/10/occupations_not.html " target="_self">occupations that are not for me.&#0160;</a> Among them are tour guide&#0160;(because of my directional dyslexia), trapeze artist (i&#39;m terrified&#0160;of heights), surgeon (frightened of&#0160;gore), and dog groomer. I&#39;ve also discussed possible&#0160;options for future employment, such as my plan to become a&#0160;<a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2007/05/my_new_career.html " target="_self">power forward in the NBA</a>.&#0160;However, I&#39;m now starting to think that, what with my back acting up again,&#0160;and the NBA plagued with salary cap problems and an&#0160;influx of 7-foot tall Europeans, that&#0160;professional basketball might not be a realistic possibility.</p>
<p>But I have two new ideas. The first is to become a leader of a religious cult. I think I have what it takes: charisma, creativity, and ruthlessness. I haven&#39;t exactly come up with a theology yet, but if that Scientology guy could get away with Thetans and the &quot;clear,&quot; I feel that I could come up with something better. I&#39;m aiming for a system of belief in which participants deed over all their worldly goods to their leader, i.e. me. And also I&#39;d like a harem of willing maidens. I admit that some recent cult leaders have given the profession a black eye (David Koresh, Jim Jones, Charles Manson) but I have in mind something milder, something paternal or even grandpaternal. Less Kool-Aid, more chocolate milkshake.</p>
<p>A second idea:&#0160;hedge-fund&#0160;billionaire.&#0160;I admit that I don&#39;t know much about&#0160;hedge-funds, but I plan to get started&#0160;right away by reading the Wikipedia article.&#0160;How hard can it be?&#0160;It&#39;s not as though they manufacture&#0160;something&#0160;or invent anything.&#0160;And then, after you collect a&#0160;couple of billions, you get to have &quot;dark money,&quot; off-shore accounts, and your very own Super-Pac. This is a career&#0160;with no discernible&#0160;downside.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I tried&#0160;the first three installments --&#0160;a netflix diskful of episodes&#0160; -- of <em>House of Cards</em>.&#0160;I plan to watch a few more, but I&#39;m deep into negative enthusiasm, not at all sure that I&#39;m going to continue.&#0160;<em>Cards</em> certainly&#0160;grabs you, and it&#39;s startling and theatrical, but it&#39;s also&#0160;far too cynical and depraved&#0160;for my rose-colored tastes.&#0160;I just don&#39;t believe in it. I know that it&#39;s all the rage&#0160;to assume&#0160;that politicians are horrid&#0160;and power-obsessed -- but every one of them,&#0160;all the time,&#0160;without a moment of relaxation or redemption?&#0160;&#0160;And so I&#39;m skeptical of every character, every twist in the plot, every nasty turn of phrase.&#0160;And because I&#39;m skeptical, I just can&#39;t, as they say, &quot;get into it.&quot; Or at least, not all the way in. &#0160;(Full disclosure:&#0160;during episode three I fell into a &#39;deep rest,&#39; sometimes denominated&#0160;a minor nap.)</p>
<p>The character who dominates <em>House of Cards</em> is&#0160;Kevin Spacey&#39;s&#0160;Frank Underbelly --&#0160;I mean &#0160;Underwood --&#0160; who is fascinating but not credible.&#0160;Or rather, he is not designed to be credible, because he regularly violates the fourth wall and converses intimately with viewers.&#0160;Underwood&#0160;is ruthless, implacable, ambitious, vengeful, depraved, vicious, malignant, and amusing. He turns his audience into his co-conspirators.</p>
<p>And where have we seen&#0160;this&#0160;curious concatenation of traits before?&#0160; Think back, fit audience though few,&#0160;to&#0160;your college class in the History of English Drama.&#0160;There you encountered the vice and his crossbred friend, the machiavel,who were&#0160;ubiquitous in medieval drama.&#0160;Shakespeare brought this semi-supernatural hybrid to perfection two separate times&#0160;-- once in the person of&#0160;Richard of Gloucester in <em>Richard III</em> and then again as&#0160;Iago&#0160;in <em>Othello</em>.</p>
<p>Richard of Gloucester winks to his audience that he &quot;can smile, and murder whiles I smile,/And cry &#39;Content&#39; to that which grieves my heart, /And wet my cheeks with artificial tears,/ And frame my face to all occasions.&quot;&#0160; Now if that isn&#39;t Frank Underhill to a T, first spotted killing a puppy and a few scenes later baldly and straightfacedly lying to his President. Richard can &quot;set the murderous Machiavel to school&quot; in order to gain a crown; our unFrank friend Frank once wanted to be secretary of state, but now he just wants revenge. Richard and Iago are capable not only of falsity but even of murder to get what they want. Both of them kill their own wives. &quot;I&#39;ll have her, but I wlll not keep her long,&quot; says Richard of Queen Anne.&#0160;</p>
<p>And therefore If I were to offer advice to Zoe&#0160;Barnes, the reckless young reporter for the <em>Washington Herald</em>, I would suggest that she steer mighty&#0160;clear of Frank Underwood. I would tell her&#0160;to read <em>Othello&#0160;</em>post-post-haste and take careful note of what happens to Desdemona&#39;s lady-in-waiting Emilia. Hint: &quot;Fie, your knife upon a woman.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Zoe, please, please, get out of there&#0160;while the&#0160;going&#0160;is good!</p>
<p>In Shakespeare&#39;s plays, Richard and Iago both overreach and come to grief.&#0160;Richard is left to die on the battlefield and Iago is subjected to the rigors of Venetian justice (&quot;Torture will ope his lips.&quot;)&#0160;And that&#39;s what is supposed to happen to&#0160;machiavels.</p>
<p>I&#39;m curious as to what will happen to Frank Underhill.&#0160;By rights he should be publicly humiliated&#0160;and&#0160;die a ghastly&#0160;death. But inasmuch as we live in an exceedingly&#0160;cynical age, we can guess that Frank will only die when Kevin Spacey is offered better work, or when ratings plunge, or when the series jumps its inherent shark.&#0160;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>The first (the most ordinary, the least wild):&#0160; I&#39;m sitting in a basketball stadium watching a game&#0160; (it&#39;s close to the end of the first half) when a fire drill is announced.&#0160;Everyone, including me and my &quot;date,&quot; a mysterious unknown woman whom my dreamatorium has conveniently supplied,&#0160;leaves their seats.&#0160;I&#39;m now outside but I&#39;m cold and I remember that I&#39;ve left behind my denim jacket. I return to my place&#0160;in the now-deserted&#0160;arena but no jacket.&#0160;Then I&#39;m outside again. I locate&#0160;my date and tell her about the missing denim.&#0160;She serenely rises from her squat to reveal that she&#39;s been sitting on the jacket.&#0160; I wonder:&#0160; did she try to steal it? &#0160;2) The scene shifts abruptly.&#0160;I&#39;m now back fifty years, in graduate school, and I&#39;ve been informed that a new requirement for the degree has been instituted.&#0160;Each semester, every student will have &#0160;to drink a 20 oz. paper cup&#0160;of a pink liquid (looks like Pepto-Bismol but is decidedly&#0160;more mucilaginous and nasty).&#0160; 3) All of a sudden i&#39;m being pursued by a huge scary rhinoceros with an ovesize horn.&#0160;I run, of course, terrified.&#0160;Fortunately, I come upon a cottage size stack of&#0160;carrots (large, grated, carefully arranged).&#0160;I&#39;m able to climb the pile, rather gracefully I think, but the rhino can&#39;t get any traction and I easily outdistance him.&#0160;I was scared for a while but the carrots saved my life.&#0160;Then I woke up.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Are there any interpreters of dreams out there?&#0160;&#0160;Clearly, Dr. M. needs your help.&#0160;(Do not bother using words like &quot;nutso&quot; or &quot;loco,&quot; please.&#0160; Serious interpretations only.)&#0160;</p>

				<p>i&#39;ve been following the Bridgegate scandal&#0160;-- the vindictive sabotaging of traffic entering the George Washington Bridge by Governor Christie&#39;s staff with the&#0160;connivance and wink-wink approval of the governor hmself.&#0160;I&#39;m appalled -- is this the kind of man to whom we should offer the&#0160;bully pulpit?&#0160;</p>
<p>I&#39;ve even gone so far as to read the internet comments to&#0160;columns in the <em>New&#0160;York Times</em>.&#0160;While some people who take the trouble to contribute &#0160;have a reasonable point to make, there&#39;s a refrain that distresses me,&#0160;all the more so because it&#39;s&#0160;a sentiment that no one bothers to refute. Here are three representative examples.</p>
<p>&quot;Like most politicians, the man [i.e. Governor Christie] &#0160;is a classic sociopath.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Politicians have a truth gene missing in their DNA.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All, and I mean all. politicians are dishonest, deceitful, untruthful and corrupt.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#39;s a common enough sentiment. We&#39;ve all heard it.</p>
<p>One of our local school board members once said this to me: &quot;When did I become untrustworthy, a liar?&#0160; When I was citizen with kids in the school, I was an honest well-meaning citizen.&#0160;&#0160;But as soon as&#0160;I was elected to the school board, something&#0160;must have&#0160;happened to me, because &#0160;I began to be accused of all kinds of chicanery and corruption.&#0160;I went from &#39;citizen&#39; to &#39;politician.&#39;&quot;</p>
<p>Or, you could say it this way:&#0160;the stereotype kicked in.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve never held public office myself, but I&#39;ve known many &quot;politicians&quot; pretty damn well-- members of school boards, members of our&#0160;city council, county officials and commissioners, many members of our state legislature, a couple of state office-holders and at least two&#0160;of our&#0160;representatives&#0160;to&#0160;Congress.&#0160; And here&#39;s what I know:&#0160; they&#39;re honest and talented people&#0160;who sacrifice&#0160;time and money to serve the public.&#0160;They work very hard and they absorb a tremendous amount of abuse for little reward.&#0160;</p>
<p>Of course there are vile and corrupt politicians. But there are also very many public-spirited statesmen who rise to the challenge of&#0160;governing this complicated nation of ours.&#0160;</p>
<p>Let us be fair to our fellow citizens.&#0160; And let us&#0160;purge these ridiculous stereotypes.</p>

				<p>And so we&#39;ve come to the end of&#0160;the &quot;holiday season&quot;&#0160;once again.</p>
<p>Another Christmas, another winter solstice, another St. Lucy&#39;s day with its deepest of midnights.&#0160;Even here in ever-sunny Colorado, things are a bit gloomy.&#0160;However, I have every confidence that another&#0160;spring is just around the corner. I don&#39;t need to bring greenery into the house in order to prevent&#0160;the dragon from swallowing the sun.&#0160;The days, now so abbreviated, will lengthen and in&#0160;five weeks we&#39;ll see the first crocuses and&#0160;a week later the daffodils and pussy-willows.&#0160;It&#39;s going to happen. But as always, the&#0160;last days&#0160;of the year challenge me.</p>
<p>I&#39;m relieved and happy that Christmas and the whole Christmas business is done and gone. No one wants to be a scrooge and I don&#39;t want to frown on carols and gift-giving and plum-puddings and good fellowship, but in my heart, let me confess, I don&#39;t like the holiday. I can&#39;t make sense of the virgin birth or the sacrifice of the only-begotten son. I don&#39;t even respect the story-- to me it&#39;s just dressed-up scapegoating. Moreover, Jesus&#39; revolutionary message about caring for the poor seems to be ignored or repudiated by Christianity&#39;s most vociferous advocates. And then there&#39;s all that incongruous stuff that has accreted around Christmas -- the hype and the commercialism and the religious chauvinism and the reindeer and the tactless triumphalism. It&#39;s both incomprehensible and offensive to me.</p>
<p>And I&#39;m in good company. I have allies.&#0160;Let&#0160;us&#0160;go back to the beginning of the American experience with Christmas.</p>
<p>If the profoundly religious seventeenth-century founders of our country had a single favorite Biblical moment, it&#39;s when the Lord (speaking through His prophet Amos) severely condemned the vanity of holidays. &quot;I hate,&quot; said the Lord, &quot;I despise your feast days, and I will not smell in your solemn assemblies.&quot; The Lord of Hosts specifically enjoined against the attempt to placate him by sacrificing animals (a matter of topical concern in Amos&#39;s time). &quot;Though ye offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings, I will not accept them; neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat beasts.&quot; Nor did He rest with these easy-to-follow injunctions, but He went on to condemn all musical tributes as well. Nor more chants, glees or carols: &quot;Take thou away from me the noise of thy songs; for I will not hear the melody of thy viols.&quot; Our Puritan forefathers recognized that the Lord opposed not only rituals and music but all formal observances and rote piety. The Ancient of Days was moved not by empty ceremony but by right action and good behavior. Instead of squeaking timbrels and sounding brass, why, &quot;let justice run down as waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream.&quot; Taking these uncompromising sentences as their guide, our founders dug in their heels against the ostentatious celebration of all holidays, especially Christmas.</p>
<p>I applaud the old guy, the Father, and I revere Amos. His mantra bears repeating: &quot;Let justice come down as the waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>The neglect of &quot;righteousness&quot; in favor of buying things makes me melancholy.&#0160;I would be happy to see fewer purchases and more good deeds.&#0160;It would help&#0160;us through the dark months.</p>
<p>The winter solstice is a sensitive time for me because it&#39;s the anniversary of my father&#39;s birthday. He arrived&#0160;to no poorer family on the planet on the darkest day of the year, the twenty-second of December, 1904.&#0160;‘And they called his name Emanuel, God with us,’ -- but whether by accident or design, I have no idea. My father lived a long and just life. He had many virtues -- one of them that he was the least materialistic person ever.&#0160;He had no possessions and craved none.&#0160;But he was righteous.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know how anyone could write a biography of Emanuel, my father. There was so little plot, so little conflict in his life. He went about his business, raised his family, kept to the straight and narrow. His memory is a blessing to us.</p>
<p>At this time of the year I turn once again to one of the most challenging&#0160;fathers in literature. The&#0160;voluminous works of Sir Edmund Gosse are not much read nowadays except by specialists in Edwardian literature, but <em>Father and Son</em> (1907) still stands as one of the world&#39;s&#0160;great autobiographies.&#0160;</p>
<p>The father in <em>Father and Son</em>&#0160;is the biologist Philip Henry Gosse, whom Charles Darwin once called &quot;an honest hod carrier of science.&quot;&#0160;The older Gosse&#0160;was a minister and a leader of the Plymouth Brethren, a very strict, very puritanical splinter&#0160;of English Protestantism --&#0160;one that could easily have taken Amos as its prophet and leader.&#0160;According to his son Edmund, P. H. Gosse held&#0160;that the celebration of Christmas was &quot;nothing less than an act of idolatry. The very word is Popish, [my father] used to exclaim, &#39;Christ&#39;s Mass!&#39; Then he would adduce the antiquity of the so-called feast, adapted from horrible heathen rites, and itself a soiled relic of the abominable Yule-Tide.&#0160;He would denounce the horrors of Christmas until it almost made me [that is, Philip Henry&#39;s&#0160;son&#0160;Edmund Gosse the autobiographer] blush to look at a holly berry.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>A passionate man, Philip Henry Gosse. A difficult father. Can we Imagine how Philip Henry Gosse would have suffered to behold a twentieth-century American Christmas: muzaked &quot;Silent Night&quot; in a shopping mall. Or even --horror of horrors --the odious, saccharine &quot;Little Drummer Boy.&quot; There&#39;s not a sappier song in all of creation.</p>
<p>In&#0160;<em>Father and Son,&#0160;</em>Sir Edmund recollects a Christmas of his youth.&#0160;One boyish&#0160;year he defied his father and, putting his immortal soul in danger, secretly ate some Christmas plum-pudding that had been offered to him by &#39;rebellious&#39; servants. But then, overcome with guilt and stomach-ache, he flew to his father, crying out &quot;Oh! Papa, Papa, I have eaten of flesh offered to idols!&quot; Philip Henry&#0160;then &quot;ran with me into the midst of the startled servants, seized what remained of the pudding,... and ran till we reached the dust-heap, when he flung the idolatrous confectionery on to the middle of the ashes, and then raked it deep down into the mass.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>A frightening episode for a nine-year-old -- but beautifully told.&#0160;Only&#0160;an accomplished writer of comedy&#0160;(and one who was steeped in Dickens) could have invented a phrase as marvelous as &quot;idolatrous confectionery,&quot; where the triviality of the noun undermines the high seriousness of the adjective.</p>
<p>Compared to Amos and to the Plymouth Brethren and to Philip Henry Gosse, my own resistance to Christmas is trivial. I&#39;m a dissenter, but a dissenter in moderation.</p>
<p>In fact, I&#39;m not even a Puritan --&#0160;I&#39;m delighted with the baked ham and the sweet potatoes. Moreover, I have devised a Christmas custom of my own. Every December 25,&#0160;I reserve three hours to listen to Handel&#39;s <em>Messiah --</em> not out of piety or reverence, but because the oratorio is so marvelous that it&#39;s almost -- almost -- sacred.</p>
<p>There are many <em>Messiahs</em>, but In our house, the performance of choice is, inevitably, the extremely intelligent Pearlman version (Boston Baroque Orchestra and Chorus-- Martin Pearlman, Conductor [Telarc 80322]). Blessings and honor and glory and hallelujahs be unto George Frederick Handel and unto his unsurpassed&#0160;oratorio.</p>
<p>So this year and every year: rejoice greatly but appropriately, ye sons and daughters of Zion!&#0160;</p>

				<p>I&#39;ve been reading Trollope&#39;s Palliser novels again -- my third or fourth time through this series of six great big whoppers. &#0160;It&#39;s a familiar tour -- but with enough forgettings and misrememberings on my part to keep me focussed and surprised.</p>
<p>I finished <em>The Eustace Diamonds </em>late last night. I know that I read this novel for the first time in 1961 because it was in the curriculum of a course taught by&#0160;showman&#0160;Professor Edgar Rosenberg. I haven&#39;t the siightest recollection of that early reading or of Rosenberg&#39;s lectures either, but then, sixty years have gone by and larger and larger cavities riddle&#0160;my porous Swiss cheese brain.&#0160;</p>
<p><em>The Eustace Diamonds&#0160;</em>is rich in both plot and character. &#0160;In addition to the usual &quot;who is going to marry whom&quot; scenario&#0160;(three separate instances here) and still another version of the handsome but weak&#0160; hero who is going to the dogs but&#0160;redeems himself in the&#0160;last installment,&#0160;there&#39;s a genuine cops-and-robbers mystery along with&#0160;three separate detectives (none of them as competent as Mr. Bucket). And then there&#39;s also a riotous profusion of characters. Some, like Mr. Benjamin and Mr. Mealyus, products of Trollope&#39;s uncontrollable disgust with those nasty Semites, merely disfigure the page. Others are stock characters who appear in novel after novel, the name alone changed: &#0160;in this case the the patient Griselda figure Lucy Morris. But then there&#39;s a glorious almost Dickensian abundance of highly-marked, genuinely individualized and extremely imaginative, credible inventions.</p>
<p>There&#39;s Lizzie Eustace, with her fibs, taradiddles and utterly conscienceless lies;&#0160;George de Bruce Carruthers, who has an eye for the main chance but knows how to protect himself against pretty women; elderly Lady Linlithgow, who&#39;s all tart tongue and selfishness;&#0160;Lord Fawn, a pitiful small-minded aristocrat;&#0160;and the bustling opportunistic hypocrite Mrs. Carbuncle.</p>
<p>And then there&#39;s Lucinda Roanoke, who inhabits a corner of the novel but who is fascinatingly perverse.&#0160;She&#39;s an American, very young and handsome, impecunious, who&#39;s being shopped around to&#0160;snare&#0160;a husband. Under pressure, and against all good sense, she accepts an&#0160;offer from the brute&#0160;Sir Griffin&#0160;Tewett.&#0160;Lucinda&#0160;has no intention of becoming an obedient wife.&#0160;The engagement becomes a war of attrition between the &quot;lovers.&quot;&#0160; Sir Griffin holds on only because, it appears,&#0160; he doesn&#39;t like to lose and because he assumes that he&#39;ll be able to control Lucinda once he&#39;s married and has legal authority over her.&#0160;He&#0160;looks forward to the only sort of sex that might occur, which woud be nothing less than rape.&#0160;Lucinda is sex-averse and&#0160;finds&#0160;even a kiss to be abhorrent. As the wedding day approaches, she announces that she will never be Sir Griffin&#39;s&#0160;bride.&#0160;She threatens both murder and suicide.&#0160;On the morning of the long anticipated day, she simply&#0160;refuses to leave her room.&#0160;Trollope tells us that she has gone mad.&#0160;And that&#39;s the end of the affair.</p>
<p>Lucinda doesn&#39;t quite fit into the space.&#0160;On the surface, the episode makes the point that women were offered no place in society except obedient wife.&#0160;But this is&#0160;not comedy of manners;&#0160; it&#39;s pathology.&#0160;Sir Griffin is a sadistic monster.&#0160;Lucinda does not want to submit, and therefore&#0160;&quot;chooses&quot; insanity. Trollope does not follow Lucinda into her madness; instead, he dismisses her from his novel&#0160;in exactly the same way that the English society dismisses such women. Trollope can&#39;t&#0160;make a drop of sense out of the situation that he himself created. Lucinda deserves, and will earn,&#0160;a novel of her own.&#0160;But it won&#39;t be written&#0160;by Anthony Trollope.</p>

				<p>It had been a while&#0160;since I last flew Frontier --the airline&#0160;with the cute furry anthropomorphic talking mammals on their tails. There have been changes -- all of them&#0160;for the worse. There&#39;s now an extra charge for each piece of luggage. Those free meals&#0160;are a thing of the remote past.&#0160; So&#0160;are the days when you would get the entire can of ginger ale or tomato juice. It&#39;s now a splash of juice in a cup of ice. No free TV -- you&#0160;swipe your card,&#0160;they swipe your cash. The seats are smaller, too. More rows, less leg room.&#0160; Wasn&#39;t there a time&#0160;when air travel was glamorous?&#0160;&#0160;Now it&#39;s just a big Greyhound in the sky, a&#0160;warehouse on wings.&#0160;</p>
<p>Not only was my seat&#0160;compressed, but the back didn&#39;t recline. Somehow I had been assigned a seat that backed onto the&#0160;emergency exit row. In earlier planes, such seats used to recline, but&#0160;I&#39;m guessing that&#0160;Frontier has gained a few inches by rendering the backs&#0160;immobile -- at the cost of my comfort (but not at reduced cost).</p>
<p>Adding to the insult&#0160;is&#0160;an unapologetic sign on&#0160;the back of the seat in front of me inscribed with the words&#0160; NO&#0160;RECLINE THIS ROW. I wonder what language the author of this sign thinks he is using. Not English, that&#39;s for sure.&#0160; &quot;No recline this row&quot; does not even come close to parsing.&#0160;What would it have cost Frontier to affix a sign that read &quot;the seats in this row do not recline.&quot;&#0160; Where do they outsource their signs -- to the writers of 1940s cowboy and faux-Indian movies?&#0160; No recline this row! Come on, frontiersmen; you can do better than that. If you have no respect for me, at least have a little respect for the language. The talking animals speak better English.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>To the chief of sign-makers at&#0160;Frontier I say, &quot;No hire this job.&quot;</p>
<p>There was another sign for me to stare out while I sat there,&#0160;miserably cramped, watching the clock.&#0160; &quot;LIFE VEST UNDER YOUR SEAT.&quot; Isn&#39;t Frontier banging the frugality drum a little too hard?&#0160; The sentence might have read, &quot;Life vest IS under your seat.&quot; How much could a trifling copulative verb cost?&#0160; If Frontier wanted to be truly prodigal, it could&#0160;even have raised the cash to provide an&#0160;indefinite article:&#0160; &quot;A life vest is under your seat.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;Wow. A complete sentence!. What a concept!</p>
<p>(Orignally posted 2011: &#0160;2013 update: no free beverage at all nowadays; &#0160;the cart is only for paying customers. I didn&#39;t bother to ask how much for the plastic cup of water. My prediction: &#0160;next time, there will be a charge to use the bathroom.)</p>
