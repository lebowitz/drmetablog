		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>There can&#39;t be a disease in fiction that demands more vigorous suspension of disbelief than movie amnesia. <em>And Now, Ladies and Gentleman,</em> a latter production of the great Claud Lelouch, pushes the&#0160; disbelievery to the breaking point. It asks us to accept not one but two identical and fanciful cases of the affliction. Both Valentin Valentin, played by Jeremy Irons, and Jane Lester, played by Patricia Kaas suffer from symmetrical &quot;blackout&quot; periods in which memory evaporates.</p>
<p>What, prithee, are the odds?</p>
<p>Duelling amnesias are mighty unlikely, but such is the premise of the film. Although I doubt that there&#39;s much in the scientific literature about the romantic potential of mutual amnesia, in this film the disease becomes a mild erotic stimulant. Why the heck not, I say. </p>
<p>&#0160;Inasmuch as no one but confirmed amnesiaphiles are ever going to see this film, let me spoil it at once by saying that both Valentin, a jewel thief, and Jane, a chantoosie, find themselves in Fez in Morocco. There they are healed, and after much ado, set out to circumnavigate the earth in a racing boat called <em>Ladies and Gentlemen</em> (hence the film&#39;s odd title). Valentin, a traditionalist, takes the orthodox medical route and goes to a local surgeon, who shows him and us an MRI generated picture of his brain disfigured by a great white splotch (&quot;It&#39;s a wonder he can remember anything,&quot; says the Doc.) Valentin undergoes radical surgery but Jane, taking an easier route, is cured by making a pilgrimage to a local Moroccan saint. How&#0160; unjudgmental and egalitarian to equate medicine and mystery;&#0160; and also, by the way, how very nonsensical.&#0160;</p>
<p> The film is well made --&#0160; replete with all kinds of fancy effects and flashbacks and dream sequences. I love the idea of draining color from the characters&#39; faces to signify that they have begun another of their symmetrical &quot;blackouts.&quot; But aside from the amnesias, there&#39;s not much to wonder at, at least not if you&#39;ve seen your share of caper/jewel thief films.&#0160;</p>
<p> I loved the exotic North African locales. I&#39;m chagrined to report that I didn&#39;t recognize the wondrous Claudia Cardinale, who was 63 when the film was made. Claudia had been a great friend to my youthful imagination. </p>
<p>The amnesia that afflicts Valentin and Jane is, as far as I know, unique in that it comes and goes, appears and disappears. Less like an amnesia than an allergy -- here one moment, then gone. But as a plot device, constant. </p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2012/12/dowdgod-1.html">Maureen Dowd's Theology for the New Millenium </a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Fifty years ago I enjoyed arguing with people of religion about the existence of god, but nowadays I find it to be a singularly unprofitable exercise. The believers and the atheists are so entrenched in their positions hat no one ever convinces anyone of anything. Moreover, the faithful are so damned touchy that it&#39;s no fun to talk to them! They are easily offended, I think, because the weaker their evidence and logic, the more intense their compensatory passion.</p>
<p> I give thanks that at this my moment in history and geography, the true believers may be angry with me but they don&#39;t have the power to bludgeon me into obedience. (In general, the less intelligible the religion, the greater its reliance and economic and corporeal sanctions to compel allegiance.)&#0160; </p>
<p>These philosophical musings are inspired by a <em>New York Times</em> article that has received an ungodly amount of attention. Maureen Dowd, who has made a career out of cracking wise at figures of authority, especially Clintons, has given over her space this Christmas week to a column on theology (or, as it is sometimes called, the Subject without an Object). She endorses the argument of a priest-friend. He (the priest) makes an end run around the classic Problem of Evil -- which is, that inasmuch as the world is very obviously a thoroughfare of woe, then an omniscient god must be either powerless or malicious. Here&#39;s Dowd&#39;s priests&#39;s formulation: &quot;If we believe, as we do, that God is 
all-powerful and all-knowing, why doesn’t He use this knowledge and 
power for good in the face of the evils that touch our lives?&quot; </p>
<p>A very good question indeed and one that believers in a beneficent deity have failed to resolve yea all these many centuries. Dowd&#39;s priest&#39;s answer (which is loaded with a bunch of transparently obvious smuggled assumptions) is that &quot;for whatever reason, God has
 chosen to enter the world today through others, through us....&#0160; We are human and mortal. We
 will suffer and die. But how we are with one another in that suffering 
and dying makes all the difference as to whether God’s presence is felt 
or not and whether we are comforted or not.&quot;</p>
<p>Let me try to understand this argument. This new twenty-first century god, the &quot;dowdgod&quot; let us call him, has entirely disappeared<em></em>. He doesn&#39;t actually <em>do</em> anything at all. He&#39;s so hidden -- <em>absconditus</em>, in the traditional language of theology&#0160; --&#0160; that he permits all kinds of suffering and instead chooses to manifest himself merely as a comforting presence.</p>
<p> Is that the argument that Dowd thinks is worth a column of valuable newsprint? Yes, so it seems to be. Astonishing. </p>
<p>Faith,&quot; the priest continues, &quot;is lived in family and community, and God 
is experienced in family and community. We need one another to be in God’s 
presence....&quot; (No god for the solitary, then.) &quot;When my younger brother, Brian, died suddenly at 44 years old,
 I was asking “Why?” and I experienced family and friends as 
unconditional love in the flesh....&#0160; The many ways 
that people reached out to me let me know that I was not alone. They 
really were the presence of God to me. 
Suffering isolates us. Loving presence brings us back, makes us belong.&quot; His animating idea: the love of friends is a manifestation of the deity. Wow. How shallow, how trivial, how wrong!</p>
<p>No one would disagree with the notion that suffering isolates us and that friends and family console us.&#0160; I can&#39;t argue with such a proposition. It&#39;s plainly obvious. But what in the world does such an observation have to do with the existence or the nature of a supernatural being? It&#39;s not evidence for god, it&#39;s not proof of god; if anything, it&#39;s the contrary of a proof. Human beings console us, not &quot;god&quot;; the god part, the theology part, is utterly supererogatory and unnecessary. What Dowd&#39;s priest has done is to change the word &quot;compassion&quot; into the word &quot;god.&quot; But we know that compassion is not supernatural; it&#39;s entirely and essentially natural.</p>
<p>So the dowdgod turns out to be no more than a feature of human nature that &quot;soothes broken hearts.&quot; But what does it mean to believe in, or worship, the dowdgod. Not much.&#0160; All a person has to do is to notice that it helps to have some folks around when you&#39;re in pain -- and then to re-label the good feelings that emanate from friends as god. It&#39;s so very easy, so undeniable. And utterly meaningless.</p>
<p>And what a nice old friendly god it engenders. Whatever happened to Augustine, Calvin, Luther. Those tough old guys are turning over in their graves. The dowdgod is a far cry from from Jehovah, from Allah, and certainly from the demanding Jesus who came to bring not peace but a sword. Those were gods to reckon with. But now, out with Jupiter Tonans, the thunderer, and in with Jupiter Manus-tenens, the hand-holder. Or Jupiter Sussurans, the whisperer. </p>
<p>It hardly matters whether one believes or doesn&#39;t believe in a god so weak-kneed and thin-blooded, so positively humane. </p>
<p>Maureen Dowd might say, if she were surrounded by compassionate friends &quot;You make me feel god.&quot; In the same situation, I might might say, &quot;You make me feel good.&quot; The difference is only one minuscule &quot;o&quot; vowel, which, honestly, is very like a zero. And zero is all that this new theology offers.</p>

				<p>I doubt that I know any more about strigils than your average man in the street. I had read about them for years, of course, but I had never seen one with my own eyes until yesterday, when I took myself down to the Pompeii exhibit in Denver. There they were, kind of stuck away in the corner -- two bronze beauties. &#0160; </p>
<p>Strigils were used for cleaning the body, ancient Roman style. Early loofahs. The one posted below looks a lot like the one I saw yesterday -- a garden-variety Denver/Pompeii specimen that was retrieved from under 20 feet of Vesuvian ash:&#0160; </p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef017ee664efaf970d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Strigil2" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef017ee664efaf970d" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef017ee664efaf970d-800wi" title="Strigil2" /></a><br /><br /></p>
<p>&#0160;Here&#39;s another strigil, this one a little more elaborate.&#0160; </p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef017ee664f37a970d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Strigil" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef017ee664f37a970d" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef017ee664f37a970d-800wi" title="Strigil" /></a><br /><br /></p>
<p>They&#39;re kind of formidable, aren&#39;t they?&#0160; </p>
<p>If, two thousand years ago, you had been patrician enough to go to the <em>thermae </em>for your ablutions, you would have left the <em>calida piscina,</em> the warm bath, and hastened to the <em>destrictarium</em>, which was a room dedicated to strigiling. There you would have applied a mixture of olive oil and pumice to your skin, and then one of your slaves, who might be an <em>aliptes</em>, a masseur, or a simple <em>balneator</em>, a bath attendant, would have strigiled you clean.&#0160;&#0160; </p>
<p>But why olive oil and pumice? Greasy and gritty. Why not soap?&#0160; Did the ancients have soap?&#0160; Who invented soap?</p>
<p>Fortunately, there&#39;s a website devoted to these important questions. Its forthright, unapologetic url is soaphistory.net. </p>
<p>The first traces of soap appeared among the Babylonians, some 5000 years ago. The recipe: mix animal fat with wood ash and boil. So soaps were around, but -- <em>mirabile dictu</em> -- they weren&#39;t used for personal hygiene. They were used for cleaning wool and cleaning pots; Pliny, who was there for the explosion of Mt. Vesuvius, and knew all there was to know, records only that soap was used as a hair pomade.</p>
<p> The world we have lost was a far dirtier place than we like to imagine. In point of fact, our familiar cake soaps and their widespread use are an industrial revolution-nineteenth century invention.</p>
<p>Considering the effectiveness and convenience of modern soaps, I&#39;m not looking for a strigil revival -- no Mr. Strigil at every streetcorner. Nevertheless, there&#39;s not a brush or a washcloth in the modern world that can match the beauty of the best of the ancient strigils. Here, for example, is an old Etruscan strigil with a naked-girl handle (she herself brandishes a mini-strigil). It&#39;s less useful than a cake of Ivory, but -- let&#39;s face it--&#0160; a heck of a lot more glamorous.&#0160; </p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>George Drysdale (1823-1904) wrote, anonymously, <em>Physical, Sexual, and Natural Religion</em> (1854), a pioneering guide to contraception and sexual disease that was condemned by the pious as &quot;the Bible of the Brothel.&quot; </p>
<p>Drysdale arrived at his progressive ideas after an adolescence and young manhood crippled by sexual ignorance and sexual panic. At the age of fifteen, he &quot;accidentally&#39;&#39; discovered masturbation and found that the practice offered an &#39;easy mode of satisfying his passions, which had long been the source of unrest and torment to his vivid imagination.&#39; He masturbated, poor Victorian fellow, two or three times a day and involuntarily endured occasional nighttime &#39;discharges&#39;. He was overcome with guilt and even more so tortured by the fear that, as he was instructed by prevailing doctrine, the &#39;loss&#39; of semen would sap his strength and inevitably lead him to madness. Hard to believe -- but such notions were commonplace among our recent, ignorant ancestors.&#0160;&#0160; </p>
<p>It gets worse. He was so distressed by his uncontrollable onanism that on trip to Hungary, he faked a suicide, leaving his clothes and identification beside a river.</p>
<p> And worse still. While in Hungary, he underwent a series of procedures to deaden and destroy the nerve endings of the penis &quot;by inserting into the urethra a thin metal rod coated in a caustic substance. He submitted to this procedure seven or eight times.&quot; It didn&#39;t work -- at least in the sense that it didn&#39;t diminish his passion for masturbation. I also suspect that it might have hurt.</p>
<p>It gets better, though. He resurrected himself and came back to his family after he consulted a doctor who offered the breathtakingly brilliant prescription that he &quot;try coition.&quot; Intercourse with prostitutes, he discovered, quite cured his urge to masturbate. Holy moley, what a revelation! What a fucking breakthrough!</p>
<p>Drysdale never married but in later life he lived for many years with a woman named Susannah Spring.&#0160; </p>
<p>Now, if you were writing a novel about a person who &quot;dies&quot; and returns to life and you called his mistress or partner or whatever she was by the name Spring, with its obvious overtones of rebirth, you would be justifiably accused of moralism or allegorizing or heavy-handedness. Nevertheless, truth is truth to the end of the chapter and Susannah Spring she was.</p>
<p> I hope George and Susannah were happy together. I hope they frequently and joyously &quot;tried coition.&quot; The poor boy deserved a few good years.&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; </p>
<p>(I&#39;ve pilfered the story of George Drysdale from Kate Summerscale&#39;s revelatory&#0160; <em>Mrs.Robinson&#39;s Disgrace</em> [New York, 2012]).</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Every year, football becomes harder and harder to watch. When the quarterback is blitzed and has his clock cleaned, or a receiver on a crossing pattern gets his bell rung, I no longer think, brilliant play. Instead, I think, pain and concussion. </p>
<p>Not a game goes by but that a lineman leaves the field of sport on a gurney, to admiring huzzahs and applause from the comfortable spectators.</p>
<p>Have I become more timorous -- or more compassionate?&#0160; I still admire the skill level of the players but I&#39;m distressed because these gladiators have become permanently injured for my amusement. </p>
<p>There&#39;s a <em>Washington Post</em> article about a lineman named Tre Johnson, who left the game in 2003 after nine seasons in the NFL. Johnson, who earned two degrees before he was drafted, is now a highly-regarded middle-school social studies teacher at the private Landon School outside Washington. His is a post-career success story.</p>
<p>The<em> Post</em> article offers some information about Johnson&#39;s present state of health. He&#39;s forty-something years old and for three years has been walking three miles, twice daily, in order to shed some weight.&#0160; More power to him, he&#39;s now under 400 pounds and hoping to get back to his playing weight of 275. He suffers from diabetes, high cholesterol and elevated blood pressure. He&#39;s already endured nineteen surgeries (seven on his shoulders, seven on his knees, an
 elbow, hands and Achilles’ tendon). &quot;He can&#39;t sleep more than three hours at a stretch. There’s not a 
morning he doesn’t wake up in pain, and it takes a full hour to get 
moving in tolerable discomfort.&quot; Although when he played, no one kept track of concussions, Johnson has some sort of brain injury, because he can&#39;t tolerate bright or fluorescent lights. To what degree his banged-around brain has been seriously disabled will not become clear for a few more years.</p>
<p>Tre Johnson is doing well, but what about other ex-players who are not quite so healthy?</p>

				<p>The ol&#39; amnesia gimmick plus &quot;screwball&quot; comedy plus W. S. Van Dyke plus Willam Powell and Myrna Loy equals <em>&quot;I Love You Again&quot;</em> (1940).</p>
<p> Workaholic, unfun Larry Wilson gets conked on the head and wakes up as an amusing grifter named George Cary. (Hollywood amnesia will do that to you, apparently -- completely revise your personality.) But in his new and at the same time prior state, Larry/Geoge has to come to terms with Larry&#39;s wife Kay, who wants a divorce from the melancholy cheapskate half of the compound hero. And yet It comes to pass that Kay&#0160; prefers the grifter.</p>
<p> Much forced hilarity ensues.&#0160;</p>
<p>Once again, amnesia proves to be the most malleable of maladies. Bop on the head, he&#39;s Larry; another boy, he&#39;s George. Amnesia is a gas, even to the pont that Myrna Loy, unhappy with what she&#39;s got, picks up a vase to re-transform William Powell into the way she wants him. Mechanical (not medical) amnesia anticipates Danny Kaye in <em>The Court Jester: </em>a snap of the finger he&#39;s a duellist; another snap and he&#39;s a clown. </p>
It&#39;s obvious a) that amnesia easily combines with the Jekyll-Hyde doppelganger scenario, and b) that even by 1940, movie-amnesia could be a target of ridicule.&#0160; <br />

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>The ancient Romans did not allow swords to be carried within the <em>pomerium</em>, the sacred central precincts of their city.</p>
<p>They were able to maintain the prohibition because they did not have a National Sword Associaion to argue that if swords are banned, only criminals with have swords; or that swords don&#39;t kill, people kill; or that it&#39;s a violation of personal liberty for free men to be forced to check their swords at the city wall. Nor was there a fanatic Roman electorate ruthless enough to donate to the campaigns of every soft-brained <em>aedile</em>, <em>quaestor</em>, <em>praetor</em>, or <em>consul</em> willing to proclaim the sanctity of swordsmen&#39;s rights.</p>
<p>Is it the case that swords were also prohibited in the Roman classroom?&#0160; I don&#39;t know -- but I suspect as much.</p>
<p>Here at the University of Colorado, in the infant millenium, guns may not be carried into the sacred precincts of the football stadium. However, they&#39;re sure-as-hell legal in classrooms, and have been ever since a State Supreme Court ruling forced the U to allow students with Colorado concealed weapon permits to carry their guns on campus -- even on days when exams and papers are returned to students by an historically-unarmed faculty.&#0160;</p>
<p>So what about swords? Why should guns be allowed in class and swords prohibited? I don&#39;t mean the modern rapier, which is so long that their presence would create, in every classroom, a noisy clatter and might even cause unwary students to trip and fall. I&#39;m thinking rather of the Roman short sword, the famous <em>gladius</em>, which can easily be worn, in an unthreatening manner, under the toga or ski jacket.</p>
<p>Rapier (noisy and prone to cause accidents):</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef017ee5f0a13d970d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Rapier" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef017ee5f0a13d970d" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef017ee5f0a13d970d-800wi" title="Rapier" /></a><br /><em>Gladius</em> (inoffensive):</p>
<p>&#0160;&#0160; <a class="asset-img-link" href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef017c344d0c1f970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Gladius" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef017c344d0c1f970b" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef017c344d0c1f970b-800wi" title="Gladius" /></a><br />In point of fact, why the pusillanimous resistance to <em>gladii</em> at football games?&#0160; Fifty-thousand spectators, highly-partisan fans, gargantuan quantities of illegal booze and dope, and short swords -- what could possibly go wrong?</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Many years ago, when I was young and invulnerable, it was most amusing that Mr. Barkis, the &quot;willin&#39;&quot; carrier in <em>David Copperfield</em>, offered up his shillings with such agony.</p>
<p> Barkis is bedridden with a cripplingly painful illness. He has a locked box of coins, and although he has become &quot;near,&quot; he has the generous impulse to give David a guinea. However, to fetch the money costs him a martyrdom. &quot;He endured unheard-of agonies in crawling out of bed alone, and taking it from that unlucky box....&#0160; We heard him uttering suppressed groans of the most dismal nature. This procedure racked him in every joint.&quot; &#0160; </p>
<p>Barkis&#39;s pain was, once upon a time, comic. Nowadays, alas, I can only imagine that Barkis has ruptured a disc, and must endure a chronic, unameliorable, incurable torture that will only end with his death.</p>
<p>And then there&#39;s the Fat Boy, in <em>Pickwick Papers</em>, who cannot prevent himself from falling asleep. What&#39;s so funny about chronic fatigue or narcolepsy? At my present advanced age, I tend to fall asleep every time I lie down with a book, even if the book is a&#0160; wild extravagant wonderful novel by Charles Dickens. Inopportune sleep by day is almost as unpleasant as insomnia or nightmares (or insomnia plus nightmares) at night. &#0160; &#0160;&#0160;&#0160; </p>
<p>I think also of Mr F.&#39;s demented Aunt, in <em>Little Dorrit</em> , who can no longer follow the conversation, but &quot;after regarding the company for ten minutes with a malevolent gaze, 
delivered the following fearful remark:&#39;When we lived at Henley, 
Barnes&#39;s gander was stole by tinkers.&#39;&quot;&#39;&#0160;</p>
<p> Is her senility, or as we would now say, her Alzheimer&#39;s, so very amusing.</p>
<p> It were, but now it ain&#39;t no longer.</p>
<p>Dickens died young, at 58, so there is no way to know whether his sense of humor would been softened by the ravages of disease and age.</p>

				<p>The Republicans now draw most of their strength from the former &quot;slave states.&quot; Here&#39;s the evidence and the map:&#0160;</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef017d3d6c8dc5970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Slave states" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef017d3d6c8dc5970c image-full" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef017d3d6c8dc5970c-800wi" title="Slave states" /></a></p>
<p>In 2012, Republicans won only 55 electoral votes from the free states. Obama carried 332.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s coincidence or merely an association.&#0160; I think it&#39;s a cause.</p>
<p> In order to support slavery, a person has to deform and distort his brain; he has to learn to make or accept arguments that are innocent of fact and logic and fellow-feeling.&#0160; He has to damage his intelligence and ruin his morals, and, apparently, he must pass the consequences on to his children and grand-children. </p>
<p>And so the sins of slavery continue to be visited upon us, yea even unto the seventh generation.&#0160; </p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I prefer my opera to be aural rather than&#0160;visual.&#0160;Opera is a form that is made&#0160;for listening, not watching -- at least in my view.&#0160;The music, Mozart or Verdi, is frequently transcendent and most satisfying. But on those occasions&#0160;when I venture to the&#0160;opera house and I have to deal with the cultic, cachectic audience&#0160;and the grand-opera worshippers&#0160;as well as the ridiculous plots, the unhandsome singers, the interminable intermissions, the staginess and artifice and the general all-around&#0160;silliness -- as well as&#0160;pay through the nose for the privilege of doing so, well then, I&#39;m not always a happy fellow.</p>
<p>I know the sound of Verdi&#39;s <em>Otello</em>&#0160;moderately well, having played the Placido Domingo version often enough for the laser to have bored&#0160;holes into the cd. Moreover, as it happens, I&#39;m moderately familiar with Shakespeare&#39;s play). But I had never seen a performance of <em>Otello&#0160;</em>until this past Saturday when we betook ourselves and our bagels and our Granny Smiths&#0160;to the Century Theatre to watch the Metropolitan Opera&#39;s Live in HD performance.&#0160;It was, frankly, glorious -- Renee Fleming in the electronic flesh,&#0160;moving us to tears&#0160;with the willow song (along with Verdi&#39;s bonus, dubious&#0160;Ave Maria).&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>She was superb; so were the&#0160;orchestra, the costumes, the sets, even the overacting, villainous Iago, who would have twirled his mustachios, if he had had them, and the&#0160;non-acting, expressionless Othello.</p>
<p>Our &quot;guide,&quot; a robust, comfortable mezzo whose&#0160;name I should know but didn&#39;t catch, made the claim that Verdi&#39;s<em> Otello</em> improved upon Shakespeare&#39;s <em>Othello.</em> A highly dubious claim, I think, but then,&#0160;I don&#39;t know how to measure the value of the grand &quot;Othello music,&quot; that Shakespeareans so much admire, against the cellos and the bassoons. Whether for better or worse, however, there&#39;s&#0160;a heck of a lot&#0160;in Shakespeare&#39;s play that didn&#39;t make it across the centuries and genres and into Verdi&#39;s opera. More than can be said in a paragraph or a&#0160;blaguepost.&#0160;</p>
<p>For starters, Shakespeare created a multi-layered society, not just elaborate sets. His city of Venice has a sense of itself as&#0160;a successful, orderly, civilized, and advanced community.&#0160;Into this world strides&#0160;Othello,&#0160;not only an&#0160;outlander but an&#0160;African and a erotic exotic.&#0160;Although Venice needs his soldiership, he&#39;s&#0160;still a black man in a racist world who marries a willful patrician lady who prefers&#0160;him to&#0160; the &quot;wealthy curled darlings of the nation.&quot; It&#39;s an unlikely, perilous match: he&#39;s&#0160;&quot;declined into the vale of years&quot; while she&#39;s very very young. He&#39;s a soldier who&#39;s been around the world; she&#39;s&#0160;the secluded mistress of the house affairs.&#0160;He&#39;s commanding; she&#39;s&#0160;naive.&#0160; </p>
<p>Verdi must have loved <em>Othello</em>, although not necessarily for the right reasons. How could a play that ends on a bed, with a climactic murder-suicide, not have excited the instincts of the composer of <em>Aida</em>. Nothing more appropriate for grand opera than Othello and Desdemona -- and yet o so simple a representation compared with Shakespeare&#39;s rich figures and complex society.</p>
<p>Imagine a <em>Merchant of Venice</em> in which Shylock is not Jewish, or a <em>King Lear</em> in which Lear is a troubled forty-something and you&#39;re well on your way to grasping an <em>Othello&#0160;</em>in which&#0160;melanin is replaced with melodrama.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; </p>
<p>As a result, even&#0160;when Verdi brought tears to my eyes, it was because I was seeing through the opera to the play that lies beneath it.</p>
<p>And sometimes I was crying because I so desperately missed the beauties and the profundity that&#0160;Verdi had not seen fit to include. </p>

				<p>I find it utterly fascinating that Romney and Obama, who are so unlike in so many ways and yet both to the best of our knowledge good &quot;family men,&quot; are both descended from polygamists.&#0160;</p>
<p>Barack&#39;s great-grandfather Obama Opiyo had five wives and his grandfather, Hussein Onyango, had at least four. Such was the Luo tradition. Barack&#39;s father&#39;s bigamy was unlawful rather than traditional -- he left what used to be called a &quot;grass widow&quot; behind when he escaped Kenya.</p>
<p>Both of Mitt&#39;s great-grandfathers, Miles&#0160;Romney and Helaman&#0160;Pratt&#0160;were polygamists. Miles had four wives and thirty&#0160;children, Helaman had five wive&#0160;and who knows how many offspring. Both families fled the U. S. en masse when a divine revelation and the enforcement of the Morrill Act ended polygamy in 1890.</p>
<p>And yet preachers and politicians continue to proclaim that &quot;marriage is between one man and one woman, and always has been, since the time of Adam and Eve.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>It ain&#39;t so. Nothing could be more ahistorical or more false. The biblical patriarchs were all polygamists and King Solomon himself, a model of wisdom, we are told, collected an astonishing, exhausting household of 300 wives and 700 concubines. Plural marriage was part of Jewish tradition way into the first millennium. Another Abrahamic religion, Islam, is notably polygynous even as it is furiously anti-polyandrous. Marriages over the world have taken every shape imaginable, sometimes formally, sometimes informally. The idea that marriage is&#0160; permanent and unchanging is a canard belied by the immediate and symmetrical family histories of our two candidates.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I was half-way through this neglected Cold War paranoia-mystery-Hitchcocky black-and-white (and noir all over) amnesia movie when I realized that I was watching a lineal ancestor of the Jason Bourne films. It&#39;s all there: the trauma, the amnesia, the shadowy organization determined to eliminate the amnesiac, the assassins, the hair-breadth &#39;scapes, the chases, the murky plotting.</p>
<p>David Stillwell (note the encouraging onomastic pun in his surname) played by the ever-upright Gregory Peck, has accidentally defenestrated his mentor and has gone into what this film calls &quot;unconscious amnesia.&quot; He&#39;s got to figure it all out, which he does via Bourneian flashbacks, even while being pursued by a bunch of very bad guys, who fortunately, are most amateurish with their pistols.</p>
<p>There&#39;s also a dollop of&#0160;Bond in the mix:&#0160;a nuclear secret,&#0160;a threat to world peace and in addition a possibly helpful, possibly dangerous former mistress.&#0160;</p>
<p>And there&#39;s Walter Matthau as a shambling amateurish detective.&#0160;Early Walter Matthau -- taking&#0160;a few first steps on the road to becoming&#0160;the real Walter Matthau.&#0160;</p>
<p>It was a superior&#0160;movie during the first mysterious hour, but as the&#0160;mystery unravelled, it turned into cliche and incoherence.&#0160;Too bad, because the noir atmosphere was splendidly realized and the shots of 1960s Manhattan a genuine treat.&#0160;</p>
<p><em>Mirage</em> is&#0160;a political movie, but it&#39;s hard to track its politics. Howard Fast, who wrote the novel from which the screenplay is adapted, leaned far left while the director, Edward Dmytryk, leaned right.&#0160;The film teeter-totters.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p><em>Mirage</em>&#0160;was remade three years later as <em>Jigsaw</em>,&#0160;in which&#0160;an LSD overdose was substituted for amnesia.&#0160;<em>Jigsaw&#0160;</em>doesn&#39;t seem to be available on Netflix, but I&#39;ll look for it. &quot;Unconscious amnesia&quot; apparently mutated, during the hippie years, into &quot;drug amnesia.&quot; A new genre</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>All that is good and all that is bad about opera is summarized by the&#0160;following splendid sentence.&#0160;It comes from&#0160;a plot summary of Donizetti&#39;s <em>L&#39;Elisir d&#39;Amore</em>. Prepare to savor.&#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;At the pre-wedding feast, Adina and Dulcamara entertain the guests with a barcarole.&quot;</p>
<p>Is that genius, or what?&#0160;</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the situation: the plot&#39;s a little thin and needs to be padded. Barcaroles were big in the 1840s.&#0160;By good fortune, Donizetti just happens to have one in his drawer, or perhaps he&#0160;has been thinking about gondoliers since his last trip to Venice.&#0160;So let&#39;s slip a barcarole in there.&#0160;</p>
<p>Moreover, the barcarole is beautiful. Perfectly wonderful and enjoyable.&#0160;It&#39;s as lovely as the excuse for its performance is ridiculous.</p>
<p>That&#39;s&#0160;why we love grand opera -- its inevitable and constant juxtaposition of glorious and absurd.&#0160;</p>
<p>Thanks, Metropolitan Opera in HD, for bringing it to our attention. Let&#39;s hope for many more afternoons of such transcendent, splendid silliness.</p>
<p>Ah that in real life we could while away our empty hours with barcaroles.</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>There&#39;s been so much noise about Governor Romney stonewalling calls to release his tax returns&#0160;and so much commentary about the one he did release, that the anomalies in running-mate Paul Ryan&#39;s tax returns have been overlooked.&#0160;</p>
<p>When Ryan made his 2011 taxes public, he had to &quot;amend&quot; what he and his lobbyist wife had initially reported. It seems that he had &quot;inadvertently&quot; failed to report $61,122 in income. Now sixty grand might be chicken feed for the Governor, but it&#39;s a big hunk for the Representative. It raises his total income to $323,416 and bumps up his taxes by $19,917. The sixty-thousand bucks comes from an income-producing trust that he inherited from his wife&#39;s mother, a successful Oklahoma attorney. Moreover, on June 6 of this year, Ryan amended two years of financial disclosure reports that he filed with the clerk of the House of Representatives which show that the trust produced income of between $100,001 and $1 million.</p>
<p>So Ryan&#0160;&quot;forgot&quot; that he&#0160;had inherited a small fortune&#0160;from his mother-in-law, and he &quot;forgot&quot; to report&#0160;to the IRS just about 20% of his income.&#0160; Fortunately,&#0160;he remembered both of these facts when he began to come under consideration for national office and knew that his finances would be closely scrutinized.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Ryan is&#0160;a&#0160;supposedly a policy wonk, touted for his&#0160;attention to detail.&#0160;He&#39;s an expert in&#0160;taxation and expenditure -- or&#0160;so we&#39;re told.&#0160;&#0160;But he&#39;s not, apparently, attentive to his own affairs.</p>
<p>He&#39;s also the person who&#0160;claimed to have run a sub-five minute marathon and to have climbed o-so-many&#0160;of Colorado&#39;s mountains.</p>
<p>So, constant reader, here are your&#0160;choices.&#0160;Either Paul Ryan (a) &quot;inadvertently forgot&quot; to include $60,000&#0160;worth of income&#0160;on his 2011 taxes, or (b) he&#39;s a untrustworthy, lying scumbag who suits the facts to the situation, and who&#0160;was hoping to get away without paying his fair share and only came clean when it looked as though someone would notice.&#0160;</p>
<p>We report;&#0160; you decide.</p>
<p>(I&#39;m trying to think, if I were the recipient of a $60,000 a year inheritance, which I&#39;m not, whether I could possibly &quot;forget&quot; to report it as income.&#0160;Nope, can&#39;t imagine such a circumstance.)</p>

				<p>I read with enthusiasm Richard Fortey&#39;s <em>Horseshoe Crabs and Velvet Worms </em>(New York, 2012), a pop biology book which describes&#0160;various plants and animals that originated millenia ago and that survive outwardly&#0160;unchanged to the present day.&#0160;It&#39;s a great subject and might have been&#0160;a great book if Fortey had been less anecdotal and more informative,&#0160;and if he&#0160;not just blathered into&#0160;the tape recorder but had paid attention to&#0160;organization and prose style.</p>
<p>Ever since my summers at <a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2006/03/makamah.html" target="_self">Makamah</a>&#0160;in the 1940s, I&#39;ve had an affection for horseshoe crabs.&#0160;They were abundant then, although scary and definitely not-to-be-stepped-on, and although I can&#39;t say for sure, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised to find that they are very rare now, especially in populated areas like the Sound. I would not have known that horseshoe crabs date from the&#0160;pre-hemoglobin era and that their blood (or blood-equivalent) is based not on iron but on copper.&#0160;I did not know anything about velvet worms or the various ancient slimes with&#0160;which Fortey is so taken, but I am well-acquainted with horsetails, which, however primitive they may be, continue to thrive rather wonderfully around our West Bradford pond.&#0160;</p>
<p>Of all Fortey&#39;s species, my favorite is unquestionably the&#0160;welwitschia, or, as it is sometimes called, the tweeblaarkanniedood, or khurob, or nyanka, or onyango --&#0160;a plant which&#0160;is no less exotic than its various names.&#0160;</p>
<p>It&#39;s the only plant in its order&#0160;(although it can claim&#0160;fossil relatives) and it hangs on in Namibia and Angola.&#0160;It&#39;s a very distant relative of pines and spruces, having diverged in the late Permian. Welwitschia has an extremely odd growth habit. It makes only two true leaves in its lifetime, but the leaves, which might be imagined as very wide ribbons,&#0160;grow constantly throughout the long life of the plant.&#0160;The leaves can be fifteen feet long;&#0160; the plant can live for a thousand and some think&#0160;even two thousand years.&#0160; Here&#39;s a welwitschia: it&#39;s not a classically handsome plant, not a garden beauty.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>At the Perfect Pear, our local eatery, dinner was less than ambrosial, but&#0160;halfway through the mashed potatoes, the&#0160;room was suddenly illuminated by an astonishingly beautiful young woman who arrived (drums, and trumpets, and more trumpets) with&#0160;bland boyfriend in tow. She was lambent and glowing -- so lovely that I felt the urge to get up and whisper in her ear that her brilliance&#0160;had refreshed and cheered my entire day.</p>
<p>Of course I did no such thing.&#0160; I&#39;m not that kind of guy.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Later, I fell into a reverie&#0160;and brought to&#0160;mind&#0160;the very few magnificently beautiful women whom&#0160;I had encountered in my life. Now I don&#39;t mean women who are merely or very attractive, of whom there are, thankfully, many; nor women upon whom one&#39;s&#0160;youthful self has lavished an intense passing crush. I mean women who are&#0160;goddess-beautiful. Women around whose brows&#0160;flames flicker, and who, when they walk, do not touch their feet to the ground. Here they are:</p>
<p>In Ithaca, Margaret C., a sylph or naiad. In Cambridge, the young Aphrodite who sprawled so fetchingly in Widener&#39;s periodical room, unconscious of the attention she garnered. At the pottery, Mariel ----- (&quot;Ariel with an M,&quot;she said), a psychologist, who, though already greying, was a perfect Juno. Students: in New York, Ms. ----- Pavony, who glowed for almost an entire silent semester, right up to the precise moment that she contributed to the discussion in the squeaky voice and accent of a 1930s M-G-M telephone operator. In Denver, Ms. {exotic first name] Samuels, who, I&#39;m happy to say, remained silent on the rare days she deigned to come to class. A Hindu fertility goddess, yes -- but perhaps also a daughter of Zion. On the airplane: the radiant Denver actress, who confided to me that her best part &quot;so far&quot; was a Midol commercial. On the bus: the young lady with the electric green eyes. At the Folger: the luscious student from France, as lovely as a young woman can possibly be, who said to me, &quot;Can I ask you a question about Shakespeare? Why do some of the lines stop in the middle of the page and some go right to the margin?&quot; Oh, would that she had not asked!</p>
<p>And while I mused&#0160;over my small handful of&#0160;goddesses excellently bright, I remembered that on two separate occasions,&#0160;forty or fifty years ago, an older gentleman had approached Mrs. Dr. Metablog to say, in these or equivalent words, &quot;thank you for being so beautiful.&quot;</p>
<p>At the time, I was taken aback, but&#0160;now, in my pre-dotage, I fully comprehend.</p>
<p>(It stands to reason that I&#0160;must also have encountered young men of great beauty, but, try as I will, I can&#39;t bring any to mind.)</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Here&#39;s a case of double amnesia, in which a second&#0160;case of the disease is overlain over the first (as usual, once the amnesia genie is activated, screenwriters cry havoc and let slip the dogs of anything goes).</p>
<p>Our hero, played by a tired Liam Neeson, awakes from a coma not remembering much but thinking he&#39;s Dr. Martin Harris, a geneticist.&#0160;He has no identification, and no one knows him, even his young wife.&#0160;Turns out, he&#39;s not Dr. Harris at all, but a professional assassin who has somehow forgotten that his alias is an alias.&#0160;It takes an&#0160;innocent&#0160;new girlfriend and several car chases and some highly-choreographed fist fights before he comes to his senses.&#0160;Once he realizes that he&#39;s a professional killer,&#0160;however, he turns over a new leaf and becomes a Good Guy. He&#0160;thwarts the intended assassination and with solemn steps and slow, begins a new moral life.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the question that occurred to me:&#0160; a guy is a long-time, career assassin.&#0160;He has an accident and&#0160;forgets that he was a murderer.&#0160;Then little by little he remembers. Is it probable that his personality would change and he would be reborn to innocence and good citizenship,&#0160;I only ask because that&#39;s the red herring that <em>Unknown&#39;</em>s audience is asked to masticate?&#0160;I myself don&#39;t buy it.</p>
<p>Neeson asks, over and over, &quot;Who am I?&quot;&#0160; In serious works of literature (cf. Lear&#39;s &quot;Who is it that can tell me who I am&#39;), such a question is tragic.&#0160; In amnesia movies, &quot;Who am I&quot; is not tragic but merely mcguffinic.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Unaware that I was choosing a splashy and controversial best-seller, I selected from the library&#39;s new book shelf something called <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Unorthodox</span> (New York, 2012), by one Deborah Feldman, and a sadder, more dispiriting book I have rarely read.</p>
<p>Ms. Feldman had the misfortune to be raised in the Satmar branch of the Hasidic movement&#0160;-- a sect that, at least as she describes it, is unhappy, puritanical, finicky, repressive, ferociously anti-rational, patriarchal, and bossy. Boys study Talmud but girls are not educated past a high school -- what would be the point, when, as Deborah&#39;s&#0160;grandfather once told her, &quot;girls belong in the kitchen?&quot;&#0160;Feldman&#39;s memoir is not just dreary, it&#39;s ostentatiously lurid. Its subtitle is &quot;the scandalous rejection of my Hasidic roots&quot; -- and the attention-mongering scandals that she recounts are mostly sexual in nature.&#0160;</p>
<p>There is a old story that John Ruskin collapsed in a heap when he discovered, on his wedding night, that his bride had pubic hair. Feldman out-Victorians the great Victorian, claiming that she did not know that she had a vagina, an entrance, an opening, &quot;down there.&quot; Is such ignorance possible in this age?&#0160; And then she explores her sexual failings, mostly her vaginismus-induced post-honeymoon extended virginity -- which she blames on her Satmar upbringing (although want of curiosity might also be a factor).</p>
<p>Feldman&#39;s memoir has upset the Hasidic community and there is at least one website devoted entirely to attacking its veracity. And in fact the memoir does contain the commonplace omissions and elisions of autobiography --&#0160; none of which seem to invalidate the whole. However, the defenders of the sect miss the point (as does Ms. Feldman).</p>
<p>The Satmar movement isn&#39;t reprehensible because it dishonors brains and women and especially women&#39;s brains. It&#39;s reprehensible because it is erected on a lie. &quot;We learn in school that God sent Hitler to punish the Jews for enlightening themselves. He came to clean us up, eliminate all the assimilated Jews....&quot;&#0160; What an absurd and odious doctrine! Are we expected to entertain the hypothesis&#0160;that six million Jews died for eating lobster?&#0160; &quot;The first and greatest Satmar rebbe said that if we became model Jews, just like in the olden days, then something like the Holocaust wouldn&#39;t happen again, because God would be pleased with us.&quot; So Hitler and the Nazis and the SS and the camps are a) the fault of the Jews themselves, and b) God can be placated if all Jewish women wear thick stockings and wigs and cover themselves from collarbone to wrist and knee.&#0160; It&#39;s a brainless argument, and one that, if you think about it for a few seconds,&#0160;gives the victory to Hitler. Plus, it&#39;s an argument that creates a god who is even crueler and more idiotic than usual.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Indoctrinated with this criminal bullshit, the survivors of the Shoah and their descendants voluntarily re-ghettoize themselves and, of their own foolish accord, imprison themselves&#0160;into a new dark age of their own invention.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s what I learned from this book. Satmar is a check-your-brains-at-the-door cult that controls 130,000 adherents who manifest all the symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder. It&#39;s &quot;bad things will happen to me if I step on a crack on the sidewalk&quot; raised several painful orders of magnitude. &#0160;</p>
<p>Ms. Feldman may have escaped the cult but she&#39;s still in the dark. She&#39;s left Satmar behind because she couldn&#39;t read the books she wanted to read or wear the clothes she wanted to wear and she couldn&#39;t locate her own vagina. But it&#39;s not her vagina that readers should worry about;&#0160; it&#39;s her brain.&#0160;&#0160;</p>

				<p>At two-and-a-half, Lola has become very precise. Grandpa: &quot;That&#39;s a nice white sweater you&#39;re wearing.&quot; Lola: &quot;It&#39;s a jacket.&quot; Grandpa: &quot;You&#39;re tired. Why don&#39;t you put your head down on the bed.&quot; Lola: &quot;It&#39;s not a bed; it&#39;s a pad.&quot; Grandpa: &quot;It&#39;s a nice blue pad.&quot; Lola: &quot;It&#39;s green.&quot;</p>

				<p>I was almost asleep but semi-conscious and I heard a noise outside. It could have been the wind knocking over a chair, but it might also have been a raccoon, a skunk, or a groundhog. Or even a coyote, a beast that we hear but almost never encounter. Whatever it was, I was immediately electrified, the &quot;flight or fight&quot; response fully engaged. Ready to go hand to hand with a groundhog or any other rodent. But then I thought, hey, I&#39;m an apex predator. Why I am being so skittish, so fearful? I&#39;m not a prey animal. I can hold my own with anything out there.</p>
<p>The first hand axes date from about 2.5 million years ago. (A hand axe is nothing more than a piece of flint or other stone, knapped into a point on one side, adapted for cutting or throwing). The first spearpoint appears 250,000 years ago. Spears for throwing, or lances for poking are a major breakthrough for hunting or self defense.</p>
<p>I wonder why it took 2.25 million years for one of my hominid ancestors to think to mount an axe on a shaft of wood. How hard could it have been? Eventually the bow and arrow appears in the archeological record, but not until 25,000 years ago. The pace was picking up. My point, however, is that for a couple of millions of years, my forebears were not predators.&#0160;They&#0160; were prey, hiding from the European lion (50% larger than the modern African lion), from the&#0160;giant hyenas, from the cave bear, from big old snakes, and other extinct mega-predators. Cowering&#0160;on&#0160;the savannah, clutching a hand axe, for millions of years.&#0160;It hardwires the brain.</p>
<p>No wonder that&#0160;a noise in the night makes me fearful.&#0160;Two million years&#0160;as prey&#0160;doesn&#39;t disappear from the DNA just because we&#39;ve recently eliminated&#0160;or neutralized all the major predators.&#0160;</p>
<p>I think that human beings haven&#39;t realized that they are predators and are almost entirely shaped by the prey experience. As a result, we&#39;re afraid of animals; we&#39;re afraid of our shadows; we&#39;re afraid of noises in the night. We&#39;re afraid of each other.I doubt&#0160;that we&#39;ll ever grow up and learn to comport ourselves confidently but not aggressively.&#0160;As a species, we&#39;re&#0160;just plain scared.&#0160;We should be lions, not chickens.&#0160;</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>The most widely-known as well as the most notorious poem of the second half of the twentieth century is Philip Larkin&#39;s &quot;This Be the Verse.&quot;&#0160; For those of you who don&#39;t know the poem by heart, here it is in its brief and startling entirety.</p>
<p>They fuck you up, your mum and dad.</p>
<p>&#0160; They may not mean to, but they do.</p>
<p>They fill you with the faults they had</p>
<p>&#0160; And add some extra, just for you.</p>
<p>But they were fucked up in the turn</p>
<p>&#0160; By fools in old style hats and coats,</p>
<p>Who half the time were soppy-stern,</p>
<p>&#0160; And half at one another&#39;s throats.</p>
<p>Man adds on misery to man.</p>
<p>&#0160; It deepens like a coastal shelf.</p>
<p>Get out as early as you can,</p>
<p>&#0160; And don&#39;t have any kids yourself.</p>
<p>Pessimistic?&#0160; Jaded?&#0160; Angry?&#0160; Yes, I think it&#39;s fair to call it so. And let&#39;s also add, unsubtle with a vengeance.</p>
<p>Larkin is hyperbolically illogical. It can&#39;t be true that every generation is more deranged than the one that preceded it. When were the good times? A few generations ago? In the Dark Ages? In antiquity?&#0160; No, in Larkin&#39;s view, it&#39;s been all downhill, all the time. No doubt those early primates were already fucking up their kids when they came down from the trees and started to walk upright on the savannah. &quot;There&#39;s only one piece of roasted rhinoceros left. You take it. I don&#39;t mind being hungry.&quot;</p>
<p>Despite its dyspepsia and illogicality, &quot;This Be the Verse&quot; is a curiously lovable poem. Whenever I&#39;ve heard it read or recited, audiences react not with horror but with amusement. The poem&#39;s misanthropy is so absolute and its language so blunt that it can&#39;t help but provoke tittering.</p>
<p>The laughter arises because the poem doesn&#39;t earn its pessimism. It&#39;s too fluent and too easy -- unlike, say, <em>King Lear, </em>where the sublunary world is rank with incest, betrayal, and murder. After three thousand lines and five full horrific acts, Shakespeare earns the standing to conclude that life is miserable and that &quot;humanity must perforce/ Prey on itself, like monsters of the deep.&quot; So it is in <em>Oedipus, </em>where the events lend credibility to the difficult apercu that it&#39;s best not to be born at all, next best to die very young.</p>
<p>While Shakespeare and Sophocles are philosophically serious, Larkin is merely flip. There&#39;s a monumental disproportion between his gloom and the light-verse vessel in which his gloom is contained. And so arises the off-kilter comedy.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a whiny poem. &quot;Poor poor pitiful me. I had a difficult mommy.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>If &quot;This Be the Verse&quot; is in fact the most popular poem of the last fifty years, it supersedes Robert Frost&#39;s &quot;Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening.&quot; What a remarkable devolution! While Frost endures, Larkin abhors.</p>
<p>I doubt whether Larkin had &quot;Stopping by Woods&quot; in mind, but he certainly glosses Robert Louis Stevenson&#39;s &quot;Requiem&quot; -- the poem from which he drew his title. Stevenson&#39;s performance is charming, gentle, self-effacing, and modest.&#0160;</p>
<p>Under the wide and starry sky,</p>
<p>Dig the grave and let me lie.</p>
<p>Glad did I live and gladly die.</p>
<p>And laid me down with a will.</p>
<p>This be the verse you grave for me:</p>
<p><em>Here he lies where he longed to be.</em></p>
<p><em>Home is the sailor, home from the sea,</em></p>
<p><em>And the hunter home from the hill. </em></p>
<p>Stevenson praises the adventurous life lived well and brought to completion. Death may end it all but it also closes the circle. There is no completion, no circles in Larkin, where natural processes are crudely truncated: &quot;don&#39;t have any kids yourself.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This Be the Verse&quot; is a hilarious and wonderful piece of joking, but its victimology is unsettling. It&#39;s tempting to claim that it satirizes its own pessimism, but, I&#39;m sorry to say, it does not. Larkin loves to wallow in his own gloom.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s another Victorian variation on the <em>thema Larkiniana</em>.</p>
<p>Is life a thorn?</p>
<p>Then count it not a whit.</p>
<p>Man is well done with it.</p>
<p>As soon as he&#39;s born,</p>
<p>He should all means assay</p>
<p>To put the plague away.</p>
<p>Pessimistic, yes. But Colonel Fairfax, even-handed, also entertains the possibility that life might be a boon (which, as we all know, is true at least some of the time).&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I&#39;ve been reading about the peculiar metamorphosis of the starfish, <em>Luidia sarsi</em>, which eats shellfish and dwells in the muddy sediment of seashores from Norway to the Mediterranean. Its diaphanous larvae are bilaterally symmetrical; the adult form, with its five arms, is radially symmetrical, a most irregular circumstance. Moreover, the adult emerges from the larva in a different way than the butterfly from the caterpillar, where the structure dissolves and reforms. The starfish develops from a cluster of cells lining the internal cavity of the larva.&quot;&quot;Here it grows and matures, an alien existence independent of the larval body structures, axis, bilateral symmetry, and form, imbued with a complete disregard for every embodiment of its larval stage.&quot;&#0160; Eventually, the starfish emerges, and, most oddly, the larva continues on its way &quot;swimming the pelagic waters and grazing on its vegetarian diet of algae&quot;. Essentially, the starfish develops from what might be called stem cells that are carried within the larva. It&#39;s all very alien, or perhaps even Alien.</p>
<p>The theory presented in Frank Ryan&#39;s <em>The Mysteries of Metamorphosis</em> (White River Junction, 2011) is that at one time the larva and the starfish were two different creatures (from two different phyla). Somewhere in the dark backward and abyss of time, sperm from the one creature encountered an egg of the other (both creatures eject enormous amounts of reproductive material into the sea) and cross-phyletic cross-fertilization occurred and the resultant chimera prospered.&#0160;</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef016305bb8f93970d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Starfish" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef016305bb8f93970d" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef016305bb8f93970d-800wi" title="Starfish" /></a><br /><br /></p>
<p>Biologists resist the hypothesis because of the challenge it poses to the standard view of the evolutionary branching of life. I&#39;m in no position to judge the theory&#39;s truth or falsity, but I&#39;m attracted to the idea because it makes life forms so much more complex and unpredictable, and because it overturns conventional thinking.</p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2012/05/tumb.html">A Tumbrilism Revival</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>When rich people betray that they don&#39;t have the least clue how ordinary people live, they might coin a &quot;tumbrilism.&quot; The perfect tumbrilism is callous, contemptuous, supercilious, insulting, and grotesquely ignorant.</p>
<p>The word &quot;tumbrilism&quot; seems to derive from tumbril, the cart that carried victims to the guillotine during the French Revolution. The mother of all tumbrilisms is Queen Marie Antoinette, who when told that the peasants had no bread, is supposed to have replied, &quot;qu&#39;ils mangent de la brioche<em>,&quot; </em>usually translated as&#0160; &quot;let them eat cake.&quot; This classic trumbrilism derives from Rousseau and was not assigned to Marie until a couple of generations after she took her tumble.</p>
<p>Here are two good Congressional tumbrilisms: a) Fred Heinemann (R-North Carolina): &quot;When I see someone who is making anywhere from $300,000 to $750,000 a year, that&#39;s middle class.&quot; b) Congressman John Fleming (R, Louisiana): &quot;The amount that I have to reinvest in my business and feed my family is more like $600,000 ... and so by the time I feed my family, I have maybe $400,000 left over.<img alt="" src="https://bay154.mail.live.com/mail/clear.gif" title="Mark this message as unread" />&quot; And a gubernatorial tumbrilism: Paul LePage (R, Maine): &quot;Maine&#39;s welfare program is cannibalizing the rest of state government. To all you able-bodied people out there: &quot;Get off the couch and get yourself a job.&#39;&quot;</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a classic tumbrilism from the world of sports, courtesy of Jose Canseco, who once had a ball bounce off his shoulder and into the stands for a home run: &quot;You know my life, this financial thing, is a very complicated issue. Obviously, when you make all that money, people think, &#39;OK, let&#39;s assume it is $35 million.&#39; People have to understand that $35 million, you&#39;re paying the government 41 percent. That leaves you with about $17 or $18 million, not even. Then you&#39;re taking care of your whole family.&quot;</p>
<p>But the modern master of the tumbrilism is Mitt Romney, who, when asked about his worth, replied, &quot;It’s between $150 and about $200 some-odd million dollars, I think that’s what the estimates are.”<img alt="" src="https://bay154.mail.live.com/mail/clear.gif" title="Keep this message at the top of your inbox" /></p>
<p>Other priceless Romney tumbrilisms:</p>
<p>“I’m not concerned about the very poor. We have a safety net there.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This feels good, being back in Michigan. You know, the trees are the right height. The streets are just right. I like the fact that most of the cars I see are Detroit-made automobiles. I drive a Mustang and a Chevy pick-up truck. Ann drives a couple of Cadillacs, actually.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I like being able to fire people who provide services to me.&quot;<img alt="" src="https://bay154.mail.live.com/mail/clear.gif" title="Keep this message at the top of your inbox" /></p>
<p>&quot;Even if you have a child 2 years of age, you need to go to work. And people said, &#39;Well that&#39;s heartless.&#39; And I said, &#39;No, no, I&#39;m willing to spend more giving day care to allow those parents to go back to work. It&#39;ll cost the state more providing that daycare, but I want the individuals to have the dignity of work.&#39;&quot;</p>
<p>Unlike the dubious provenance of &quot;let them eat cake,&quot; these tumbrilisms, though astonishingly naive and self-satisfied, are pure and genuine. Their Mittness is well-witnessed.&#0160; &#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I imagine that the writers of <em>Cowboys and Aliens </em>had a grand old time inserting into their screenplay as many as possible of both Westerns and sci-fi/horror cliches. They did very well: there&#39;s a loner cowboy with cigarillo and fists of steel, a domineering cattleman and his feckless son, a timid barkeep, a posse on horseback tracking abducted relatives a la <em>The Searchers</em>, a band of Chiricuara Apaches fighting for their own survival, innocent distressed maidens, etc., etc., and at the end, a hero riding off into the sunset. On the other side of the ledger, computer graphic aliens resembling the velociraptors in <em>Jurassic Park</em> (except for the slimy green blood) attacking us poor mortals, multiple abductions, and o my gosh even a little boy hiding from a creepy creature in a crevice in the rock, and then our intrepid James Bond-y macho hero sneaking into the spaceship to free the captives and dynamite the mother ship, my o my what a bounty.</p>
<p>And to these cliches, the unsatisfied writers added a bonus -- a dollop of movie amnesia. Why not? Jake Lonergan awakes in the desert not knowing who he is, why he is wounded, and without a clue as to why he has a futuristic bracelet soldered to his wrist. Like most movie amnesiacs, he remains fully functional and unimpaired. He&#39;s not the least bit agitated by his loss of memory. But then comes a truly embarrassing, semi-racist moment. The Indians, who as everyone knows are noble and in touch with the human soul in a way that we products of western civilization can never be, treat his amnesia with a frothy brew (perhaps mescaline, but who can tell?). Memory spontaneously returns; Jake remembers that he escaped from the mother ship, knows where it has been parked, and also knows about the secret entrance. And so to work.</p>
<p>Later on, the released abductees are all amnesiac, but they&#39;re cured instantly (the movie is long enough) without Apache influence.</p>
<p>So now we can add alien abduction to the long list of precipitants of movie amnesia.</p>
<p>This film could have been a gas except that its makers forgot about the comedy that&#39;s inherent in the title and in the conception. Too bad. As it stands, it&#39;s a solemn, noisy, elaborate, expensive, flimsy chimera.&#0160;</p>
<p>At one point in the quest, the posse comes across an enormous structure that looks like a paddle-wheeler right there in the middle of the desert. &quot;There&#39;s no river within five hundred miles that can handle that thing.&quot; But they continue along, the boat is never mentioned again and plays no part in the story -- thereby proving that even screenwriters can suffer disabling bouts of amnesia.</p>
