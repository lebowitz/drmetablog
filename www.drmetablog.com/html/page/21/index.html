		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>As a rule, I&#39;m as fickle as the legendary varying flag, but just now I have made a firm unwavering commitment. My absolutely most favorite line of poetry -- are you ready now, readers -- is (drumroll)l: &quot;If you really want my peaches, gotta shake my tree.&quot;</p>
<p>Is that poetry or what? It&#39;s teasingly inexplicit yet at the same time very, very suggestive.</p>
<p>I first encountered the line in a mid-1950s doo-wopper by The Clovers (later famous for &quot;Love Potion Number Nine&quot;) called &quot;Lovey Dovey.&quot;</p>
<p>Well, you&#39;re the cutest thing that I did ever see<br />I really love your peaches, want to shake your tree. <br />Lovey dovey, lovey dovey all the time<br />Lovey dovey, I can&#39;t get you out of my mind.</p>
<p>The line&#39;s subversive sexuality penetrated even our twin-bed, Eisenhower-era, Ozzie-and-Harriet world.</p>
<p>Peaches/trees has a complicated history. Wikipedia tracks it to a song composed by Irving Berlin in May 1914: “If you don&#39;t want my peaches/ You&#39;d better stop shaking my tree,” but I&#39;d be willing to bet the orchard that Irving did not invent but borrowed the line, probably from something bluesy. Berlin&#39;s peaches warn us off, but Bessie Smith&#39;s 1923 peaches are both active and abundant: &quot;If you don&#39;t like my peaches then let my orchard be.&quot; Bessie was the kind of gal whose peaches would be given away by the basketful. Blind Lemon Jefferson&#39;s 1929 peaches, on the other hand, are proprietary: (&quot;you swore nobody’d pick your fruit but me/ I found three kid men shaking down your peaches free&quot;). Ah yes, we must all be faithful to just a single source of fruit.</p>
<p>I&#39;d wager that the peaches have appeared in fifty or a hundred songs in the last century.</p>
<p>The line floats from song to song, but wherever it settles, it&#39;s always suggestive of sexual desires and needs. Even when peaches are forbidden fruit, they&#39;re also ripe and luscious oozers of juice. Shake that tree properly and they fall into right into your mouth.&#0160;</p>
<p>Andrew Marvell would have loved &quot;If you really want my peaches, gotta shake my tree.&quot;&#0160; Here&#39;s his witty mid-seventeenth century version of the trope. It&#39;s in a stanza from his best poem, &quot;The Garden.&quot;</p>
<p>What wondrous life is this I lead! <br />Ripe apples drop about my head;<br />The luscious clusters of the vine <br />Upon my mouth do crush their wine;<br />The nectarine and curious peach <br />Into my hands themselves do reach;<br />Stumbling on melons as I pass, <br />Insnared with flowers, I fall on grass.</p>
<p>Marvell&#39;s garden is not for strolling and smelling. It&#39;s a garden in which the fruits attack the &quot;speaker&quot; in an active, science-fictiony way. No nibbling here. Instead, &quot;The luscious clusters of the vine,/Upon my mouth do crush their wine.&quot; &quot;Luscious clusters... crush&quot; is one sensous mouth-filling phrase. And those fine fruits, &quot;the nectarine and curious (curious =s unusual, not investigative) peach&quot; require no shaking whatsoever. These fruits are animatronic.</p>
<p>Marvell&#39;s &quot;Garden&quot; is as good a version of pomological love as Irving Berlin&#39;s -- without even taking into account the brilliant and accomplished iambic tetrameter couplets.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>In my daughter&#39;s basement I found a dried-up, stained, pages-hanging-out 1959 paperback edition of William Golding&#39;s <em>Lord of the Flies. </em>On the cover: &quot;Copyright 1954.&quot; &quot;Over 4,450,000 copies in print.&quot; &quot;Sixty-second impression.&quot; &quot;Now Available For Students And Teachers: the Casebook Edition containing the full text of the novel, critical essays, notes, and bibliography.&quot; <em>Lord of the Flies </em>leaped into public prominence in the mid-1950s and quickly became a classroom staple. A quick googling found half a dozen websites designed to help high school students generate reports on the novel&#39;s &quot;symbolism,&quot; etc.</p>
<p>I didn&#39;t like <em>Lord of the Flies </em>when I read it back then and it&#39;s become less likable-- and less worthy of respect-- over the last half-century. It&#39;s a variation on <em>Robinson Crusoe</em>, except that this time a score of boys land (how? and not a one of them injured!!) on an uninhabited island in the Pacific. They very quickly degenerate into savages, murder two of their own number, and are hunting down the last boy who possesses a modicum of civility when a naval officer (<em>nauta ex machina?</em>) arrives to take command. <em>Lord of the Flies </em>is a dyspeptic, dystopian novel; it&#39;s also, according to the websites, a story of the contest between civilization and barbarism and, -- guess what? -- it&#39;s barbarism by a country mile.&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Robinson Crusoe himself was no perfect model of psychological health, but Defoe&#39;s story has been admired for centuries (it&#39;s the most reprinted novel in history) at least in part because it asserts that a resourceful human being can triumph over a bad situation. Crusoe reads his Bible, keeps a calendar and a diary, domesticates sheep, develops a working agricultural system, learns pottery, carpentry and other crafts, and builds himself both a summer and a winter domicile. <em>Lord of the Flies,</em> on the contrary, is entirely pessimistic about human capabilities: its flat, bookless, unskilled characters devolve rapidly into war-painted, violent tribesmen. <em>Robinson Crusoe </em>embodied Age of Reason optimism; <em>Lord of the Flies </em>is a post-Nazi novel in which there is no culture, government is nothing more than incipient dictatorship, and religion equals cruel scapegoating.&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>Why was it imagined that <em>Lord of the Flies </em>had something of value to say about about human nature?&#0160; It&#39;s a sure thing that if Golding had written a novel in which an isolated group of people behave like reborn Crusoes and work cooperatively to tame the forest and create a communal utopia, he would have been derided as a simpleton. No room in the Cold War inn or on the best-seller lists or in high school curricula for optimism!&#0160;</p>
<p>Golding arranges it so that the descent into barbarism appears to be not circumstantial but inevitable. He banishes from his island women and therefore any need for reciprocity in social institutions. (Violence without heterosexual sex--just what&#39;s needed in the high school classroom!). Moreover, the boys who land on the island are not a representative set of human beings: they&#39;re English public school children who&#39;ve already internalized poisonous notions of hierarchy, hazing, power and class. When, at the outset, they choose a chief, they&#39;re really selecting a head boy for whom lesser creatures will &quot;fag.&quot; Of the island&#39;s inhabitants, the only one with more brain than earwax is the physically repulsive Piggy, while the only boy whose instincts are democratic is slow, tongue-tied, and indecisive. Meanwhile, Jack, to whom Golding grants leadership abilities, is a slick soulless demagogue. The author may appear to be impartial, but in fact he&#39;s stacked the deck so that the emergence of proto-fascism appears &quot;natural.&quot; Golding, both a student and a teacher in English public schools, seems to think that adolescents of his own circle somehow represent common humanity. His analysis of culture is therefore as shallow as a parking-lot puddle. And because it&#39;s so shallow, the novel is a treasure-trove for the kind of teaching where the identification of &quot;symbols&quot; substitutes for genuine thought, or emotion, or aesthetic revelation. It&#39;s a convenient opportunity -- a casebook -- for the kind of bad reading that has damaged generations of students.&#0160;</p>
<p>Golding&#39;s island abounds not in intelligence but in absurdities. Is it credible that three or four pre-adolescent boys armed only with sharpened sticks could a) confront a wild boar and b) actually bring down a mature sow, and that the sow would lie still, or allow herself to be held to the ground while one of the boys repeatedly stabs and eventually kills the animal with a penknife, and c) that the same boys, using no other tools than the single penknife, could quickly skin, butcher and behead the sow, and then d) cut and drive into the ground a post stout enough on which to mount that head?&#0160; Or e) that a few boys could dislodge and push a rock that is &quot;as big as a tank.&quot; Or that f) there could exist an uninhabited Pacific atoll so small that a group of boys could systematically search every inch of it like beaters on a hunt, but yet so large that, without experiencing much in the way of rain, it could have streams and pools of fresh water and, in addition, g) an inexhaustible supply of wild pigs (indigenous? feral?). If <em>Lord of the Flies</em> is an allegory, then perhaps such howlers don&#39;t matter. Yet even an allegory should not cause a reader to guffaw at inappropriate moments.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Knowing little of the finny tribe, I borrowed the Bradford Public Library&#39;s copy of Langdon&#39;s introductory <em>Fishes of Vermont </em>(2006). It&#39;s an excellent, informative, helpful guide. With Langdon&#39;s help, I can now declare that it&#39;s undeniably the brown bullhead, a species of catfish, that has been multiplying in our pond. The bullhead, a villainous omnivore, is one of the causes of the steep decline of our population of frogs. The big, plug-ugly, bebarbelled brute gobbles frog-egg globules.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>Readers of this blague will not be astonished to learn that Dr. M .has fallen deeply in love with fish names. Take the brown bullhead, for example. It&#39;s also known by such evocative and lunatic denominations as the horned pout, the mudcat, and the minister. Minister?&#0160; To whom, or under what circumstances, would a brown bullhead minister?</p>
<p>My favorite Vermont fish, nomenclature-wise, is the slimy sculpin, also performing under such titles as the blob, the chucklehead, the rock cusk, the stargazer, and the cockatouch. The slimy sculpin should not be confused with its near cousin, the mottled sculpin -- which can also be addressed as the slowfish or gudgeon.</p>
<p>&#0160; <a class="asset-img-link" href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef016766beb0fe970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Slimy sculpin" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef016766beb0fe970b" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef016766beb0fe970b-800wi" title="Slimy sculpin" /></a></p>
<p>Many of the common Vermont fishes have lost their colorful historic names. The bowfin was once called the John A. Gindle, the stonecat was the doogler, the lake trout was the togue or longue, the burbot was variously ling or lawyer (lawyer? minister? why not accountant? or dentist?), the quillback was the buffalo, and the gar was the needlenose. On the other hand, the blandly-named pond perch of olden days is trending in the reverse direction: it&#39;s now called the pumpkinseed -- a name which seems curiously vegetarian for a predatory denizen of the deep.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>If I had known that there was a fish called the cisco (known on jolly days as the tollibee and on prosaic days as the sand herring), I would long ago have promoted Galen Cisco to my all-time-great Baseball-Fish Team, adding him to such piscine luminaries as Catfish Hunter, Dizzy Trout, Chico Salmon, Sid Bream, Bobby Sturgeon, Art &quot;Red&quot; Herring, and Shad Roe.</p>
<p>No Sculpins in MLB that I can recall, but In a more poetic universe, &quot;Slimy&quot; Sculpin would have been a spitball pitcher, or perhaps even a team owner.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I was talking on the telephone with a fan of the Washington Nationals and for some reason neither of us could recall the name of the lanky, scraggly-bearded shaggy-haired high-salaried power-hitting right fielder who once played for the Phillies and had a hard time last season but seemed to be starting out well this year, and whose grandfather played shortstop for the Pirates fifty year or so years ago.</p>
<p>Inasmuch as I once had near-perfect recall of such trivia, I was frustrated by the failure of memory. But I decided that this time I wasn&#39;t going to google the Nationals&#39; roster but instead was going to force myself to cough up that name, no matter how many polysaccharides had clogged my synaptic pathways. I set my search memory program on full blast, and after about 45 minutes, while I was scrubbing the sink, out popped the moniker. I called the Washington fan and whispered into the telephone, triumphantly, these three syllables: Jay Son Werth.&#0160;</p>
<p>How does the human brain do that? You can&#39;t bring up a word or phrase, and then, an hour or a day later, there it is! Tiny chemical processes or electrical impulses chase from synapse to synapse until they just happen to happen upon the neuron or neurons where &quot;Jayson Werth&quot; is stored? Really? Hard to fathom. However it&#39;s accomplished, it&#39;s superbly miraculous.</p>
<p>But o-so-slow compared to the instant recall of my golden olden days.</p>
<p>So now I have this idea for a TV game show, modeled after College Quiz Bowl, but called Senior Bowl. The format: when a question is asked, competitors start the clock, which can run for, let&#39;s say, a couple of days. And also start the videotape machine. Competitors go about their business and the first person with the correct answer wins the round. When the tape is carefully and dramatically edited, it&#39;s perfect reality TV for oldsters.</p>
<p>Announcer: &quot;Congratulations to prizewinner Vivian de St. Vrain, who was able to correctly identify the singer of &quot;Duke of Earl&quot; in only 17 hours, 12 minutes, and 43 seconds!&quot;</p>
<p>A major breakthrough in golden-years tv.</p>
<p>And by the way, I can now proclaim to all the waiting world that the name of Jayson Werth&#39;s shortstop grandfather is -- &quot;Ducky&quot; Schofield.</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I&#39;ve been reading about the early colonization of New York city, a subject that I&#39;ve not approached since my days in elementary school in the 1950s, where, in retrospect, it seemed that we went over the ground quite regularly -- Henry Hudson, the purchase of Manhattan Island, New Amsterdam, Peter Stuyvesant, and the English acquisition of the Dutch colonies. As we learned it, it was a sunny story, untroubled and inevitable -- a path leading from pleasant but primitive beginnings to its inevitable culmination in the Greatest City in the Greatest Country on earth. There were large helpings of nationalism and triumphalism -- attitudes that I&#39;ve come to loathe -- along with the insistence that America was chosen among all the nations for peace and tolerance.&#0160;</p>
<p>It appears, however, that there are events recounted in Russell Shorto&#39;s <em>The Island at the Center of the World</em> (New York, 2004) that, if they had been mentioned, might have diluted our tadpole triumphalism. Kieft&#39;s War, for example, was never discussed.</p>
<p>Willem Kieft was one of the Dutch governors of the new colony, and he was a pioneer in genocidal racism. A small group of indians had camped at Corlaer&#39;s Hook (now the Lower East Side) and a larger group had settled near what is now Jersey City in New Jersey. The Indians (Wickquassgeck and Tappan) sought sanctuary from the Dutch against the Mohawks, to whom they had fallen behind in their tribute payments. Kieft, for reasons of his own, launched an unprovoked attack. According to a contemporary chronicler, &quot;infants were torn from their mother&#39;s breasts, and hacked to pieces in the presence of their parents, and the pieces thrown into the fire and in the water, and other sucklings, being bound to small boards, were cut, stuck,and pierced and miserably massacred in a manner to move a heart of stone. Some were thrown into the river, and when the fathers and mothers endeavored to save them, the soldiers would not let them come on land but made both parents and children drown.... Some came to our people in the country with their hands, some with their legs cut off, and some holding their entrails in their arms....&#0160; After this exploit, the soldiers were were rewarded for their service, and Director Kieft thanked them.&quot;</p>
<p>Such atrocities (there were many others) were omitted from the P. S. 217 curriculum.&#0160;</p>
<p>When I read these stories, I feel as though I was tricked. I&#39;m indignant and angry.</p>
<p>It&#39;s all part of a grand deception in which every child is indoctrinated with the idea that his own group is wiser, kinder, and better than the others.</p>
<p>If our great country were truly superior, we would have shown it by telling the truth, the whole truth, not a purged and sanitized half-truth.&#0160;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I&#39;ve now read the first three of the quintet of the much-praised Patrick Melrose novels by Edward St. Aubyn, and that&#39;s all I&#39;m going to read. It&#39;s been a long time since I&#39;ve encountered anything so nasty.&#0160; Is there a word for a place in which every single individual is evil, snobbish, vindictive, petty, and cruel. <em>Kakatopia</em>, perhaps. In St. Aubyn&#39;s world, Iago would have been an innocent. True enough that he was jealous, obsessed, manipulative and murderous, but I doubt that even Iago would have anally penetrated his five-year-old son.</p>
<p>And moreover: if I were a handsome, rich young woman (or a plain poor one) and my date asked me to get down on all fours and eat some squashed figs off the patio floor without benefit of fork or knife, I would run away screaming, slam the door, and let a few years lapse before resuming social activity. So, I hope, would everywoman. In the world of St. Aubyn&#39;s fiction, <em>reader, she marries him</em>, and the couple live miserably ever after.</p>
<p>The dilemma that&#39;s posed by these novels is that in addition to being richly kakatopic, they&#39;re also amusing, clever, and arch, with dialogue that might have been written by a jaded Oscar Wilde. So I laughed -- but whenever I laughed I felt dirty and complicit.</p>
<p>So no more St. Aubyn for me. These novels transcend satire and transmute into ugly spewing. Not for me, thanks.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Abkhazian has fifty-eight consonants. By contrast, English, a  language which is not consonant-poor, has twenty-three: the ones for  which there are the alphabetic letters such as b, d, f, etc. plus sh,  ch, dz, ng, the occasional trilled r, and the two sounds that are  indicated by th (voiced in &#39;soothe&#39; and unvoiced in &#39;sooth&#39;).  Twenty-three consonants can make an infinite number of words;  fifty-eight consonants are more than a mouthful. How can the human  speech apparatus produce so many distinguishable sounds?&#0160; &quot;By utilizing  all points of articulation from the lips back to the larynx,&quot; says an  Abhakazian linguist, and &quot;by associating with plain consonants such  secondary features as labialization, palatalisation, and  pharyngalisation.&quot; More simply, everywhere that tongue, lips, teeth,  palate, or throat can either stop the flow of air or allow air to pass  through must be put into play. Moreover, If I understand correctly, a  sound made by vibrating, for instance, the area of the uvular might  occur in both labialized (i.e. rounded lips) and unlabialized variants.</p>
<p>I&#39;m guessing that Abkhazian would be formidably difficult to  understand, especially for those who are acquainted only with  Indo-European languages.&#0160;</p>
<p>Abkhazian is one of the indigenous North West Caucasian languages,  distantly related to Circassian and the now extinct Ubykh. It may be  descended from Hattic, which may have been spoken in the empire of the  Hittites. There are something like a million Abkhazian speakers, half in  Abkhazia itself, a country that borders the Black Sea to the northwest  of Georgia, and half in Turkey and other locations in the Abkhazian  diaspora. Written language came only in the mid-nineteenth century to  the wild Caucasus. Abkhazians have been described as 20% Muslim, 80%  Christian, and 100% pagan, their religion &quot;a peculiar mosaic of  fragments of religious beliefs&quot; in which &quot;Christian ceremonies, Muslim  rites, and pagan observances are so closely interwoven that it seems  impossible to separate them.&quot;</p>
<p>Though the Abkhazian consonant system is daunting, it&#39;s a relief to  learn that the language uses only one vowel - ah - and also that both  the extinct Ubykh and a still existing dialect of Abkhazian named Bzyp  (pronunciation??) employed &quot;a minimum of eighty consonants.&quot; Is eighty  the record?</p>

				<p>I imagine that the &quot;pitch&quot; went something like this:</p>
<p>&quot;Ok, we have the star, Dana Carvey, who&#39;s hot right now. He&#39;s a funny man. He&#39;s going to play a detective who watches <em>The Maltese Falcon</em> on the tv and thinks he&#39;s Humphrey Bogart. And there&#39;s a coin that&#39;s worth seven million dollars and a bunch of guys are after it. But here&#39;s the gimmick. Carvey has amnesia and he doesn&#39;t know that he has the coin. And then the real kicker -- not only does he have amnesia, but he has a kind of amnesia that starts over every time he goes to sleep, so he doesn&#39;t even know what he did yesterday.. Ain&#39;t that terrific?&quot;</p>
<p>Well, it must have been terrific, because someone decided to put some money into the film, and someone managed to persuade James Earl Jones and Michael Gambon to take supporting roles in this bird-brained turkey.</p>
<p>Did anyone say, &quot;Does amnesia work that way? Is there a kind of amnesia that begins again every morning.&quot;</p>
<p>If they did, I know what the answer would have been. &quot;Who cares? This is not real amnesia, it&#39;s movie amnesia&quot;&#0160; --which is, once again, the most malleable of maladies.</p>
<p>So here&#39;s a new genre, the amnesiac-gumshoe farce. A small, unpromising genre.</p>
<p>It&#39;s an unfunny movie that hovers between D (for dumb) minus and F (phony). I doubt anyone&#39;s ever heard of it, except for hardcore amnesia fans. And even they were disappointed.&#0160;</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I prefer to hear rather than to see grand opera. The cd and the radio are my preferred media. Stay at home, sit in a comfortable chair, listen carefully, be ravished.</p>
<p>When you go to the opera, you re-discover that the plot is all silliness, the characters incomprehensible, and the intermissions interminable.&#0160;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there I was, yesterday, at the Met&#39;s HD screening of Verdi&#39;s <em>La Traviata</em>, the most melodic and romantic of operas. The orchestra and the singing were, as expected, glorious. But the staging was all strained novelty and misguided cleverness.</p>
<p>Can there be an opera less in need of cross-dressing and a gay subtext that <em>La Traviata</em>?&#0160; Why would anyone want to clothe both the male and female choristers in severe, gray, men&#39;s business suits?&#0160; If the story is all about boy-girl romance and sexual intensity and sexual pleasure, why not encourage the men and gaily-dressed women to dance and flirt and try to get together after the downright way of generation?</p>
<p>Opera, when I take the trouble to see it, should be as pleasing to my eye as it is rewarding to my ear.&#0160;</p>
<p>But this time, officers of the Metropolitan Opera, I was forced to shut my eyes, and just listen. It was just like staying at home, except that the chair was less comfortable.&#0160;</p>
<p>Addendum:&#0160; today I read an interview in the April 26 NYRB with the tenor Jonas Kaufmann. Here&#39;s an excerpt:</p>
<p>&quot;You see, the conductor believes that the audience is only coming to hear the orchestra and is not interested in the story, the sets, the singers. The director believes it&#39;s an all visual thing. So there is this constant fight over what each person believes is the most&#0160; important part. I&#39;ve seen semi-staged or concert performances of operas that were more thrilling than staged ones. Why? Because it&#39;s better to have nothing than to have something so disturbing that it distracts you from enjoying the music and that doesn&#39;t allow the music to create its magic.&quot;</p>
<p>Exactly my point.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>In 1904, at the age of 20, my grandmother Sonia Chafetz Uzilewski (later Green) disembarked at Ellis Island. Because of her age, and because she lived within an immigrant community, she never acquired much English, and as a result my conversations with her were strictly utilitarian. I was curious about the old country (White Russia, now Belarus) but she spoke little about it and what she did say was difficult for me to construe. Two pieces of information about her childhood have stayed with me: first, that in the old country, they brought the cow into the house in the winter &quot;to keep warm&quot; and secondly, that, as a girl, she &quot;slept over the fireplace.&quot;</p>
<p>I was puzzled. All I could imagine was a house like my own pleasant childhood home, but with a cow on the carpet and a young lady perched precariously on the narrow mantle over the fireplace (if we had had a fireplace, which we didn&#39;t). Frankly, I couldn&#39;t make much sense out of her story.&#0160;</p>
<p>It wasn&#39;t until I happened to find myself in benighted Lithuania in 2003 that I figured out the cow-in-the-living-room puzzle. I visited one of those large open-air museums which are not uncommon in eastern Europe, in which traditional peasant dwellings, along with churches, mills, foundries, etc. have been&#0160; rescued and sprinkled around a landscape. At such sites, a very common form of low-end dwelling consists of a barn or animal shelter on the dirt ground floor, with a wooden second floor for human habitation erected just above. I believe that when grandma said that they brought the cow into the house, she meant that they stabled the cow down below, and that some of the heat from the animal disseminated into the living quarters -- as would, incidentally, some of its pungent effluvia.</p>
<p>So one problem was solved, but the mantle-sleeping remained a mystery. However, just this past week the <em>New Yorker </em>featured an essay on traditional Russian cooking in which there was a paragraph on a long-ago-and-far-away kind of stove. Here&#39;s the pertinent section.</p>
<p>&quot;A traditional Russian kitchen starts with a <em>pech</em>, a huge brick oven with many winding vents designed to retain the heat from a wood fire. A <em>pech</em> was once the centerpiece of&#0160;traditional peasant homes; it took up about a quarter of the available living space. It heated and ventilated the house, it dried food; children and the elderly slept on ledges built into it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Children and the elderly slept on ledges built into it.&quot;</em> Mystery solved!</p>
<p>Sonia told me that she slept over the fire, which I interpreted as a fireplace. But I was wrong. She slept over the stove. For all I know, she might even have used the world<em> pech</em>, which I couldn&#39;t possibly have translated or understood.</p>
<p>Now I know, that like other children at the very bottom of the nineteenth-century Russian social ladder, she slept on a ledge built into a <em>pech</em>, with the cow lowing just a few feet below her.&#0160;</p>
<p>Need I mention once again how glad I am that she decided to pull up stakes and head for new world.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><em>Somewhere in the Night </em>is an early Joseph Mankiewicz film noir with amnesia at its center. George Taylor, an injured ex-Marine played monochromatically by John Hodiak, returns from the South Pacific not knowing who he is are what he was<em> --&#0160; </em>except that he has a clue that he was on the shady side of the law. There&#39;s an involuted, convoluted and confusing plot that pushes all the noirish buttons: a chanteuse with a heart of gold and also a dame who&#39;s nothing but trouble, a missing briefcase stuffed with 2 million bucks, a funny farm where a witness to murder is imprisoned, a cynical police lieutenant, and even a polysyllabic European gangster who derives from both Sidney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre. Everything is recycled, and so is the amnesia. George Taylor might&#0160; just as well have been a returning veteran with a perfect memory, or been a gumshoe, or a shamus and the film would have been just as good (or just as bad). It&#39;s surprising that when the money is recovered and the villains are punished, George gets the girl but, contrary to precedent, doesn&#39;t recover his memory. The film simply forgets his affliction and leaves him hanging. Perhaps it&#39;s romantic -- after all, if you win the love of the lady, what does memory matter?&#0160; Or perhaps the amnesia is so trivial, so perfunctory, so much a gimmick, that it can be shunted aside.&#0160;</p>
<p>Although not a good flim, it&#39;s partially redeemed by Richard Conte&#39;s turn as a smarmy nightclub owner, Sheldon Leonard&#39;s two minutes as a dumb cuckold, and Harry Morgan&#39;s thirty seconds as a bath attendant. Those guys are genuine pros.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I&#39;m sure that I once before read a book called <em>The Art of Fielding</em>, perhaps in the 1960s, but it wasn&#39;t a baseball novel; it was a old-fashioned critical monograph about Henry Fielding, the author of <em>Shamela</em>, J<em>oseph Andrews</em>, <em>Tom Jones</em>, <em>Amelia</em>, and <em>Jonathan Wild</em>. (For what it&#39;s worth, Chad Harbach, who contributed this year&#39;s <em>The Art of Fielding</em>, though a skillful plotter, doesn&#39;t have the range or the release or the depth to play in Henry F&#39;s league.)</p>
<p>I generally stay away from big-selling first novels. I prefer to let them marinate for a decade or two, check out their staying power, before I make an eight-hour commitment (not counting naps) to a 400-pager. It&#39;s an economy of my own: there are too many great old things that I haven&#39;t gotten around to yet. But I must say that Harbach&#39;s <em>Fielding</em>, highly recommended by friends, kept me engaged right down to the last sentence. Plot, plot, plot, is the formula, and there were enough surprises and twists in the story to keep even a skeptic like myself turning pages enthusiastically. It&#39;s a hybrid novel, a genre-crosser, with baseball books and academic novels (and a touch of <em>Death in Venice) </em>in its bloodline.&#0160;</p>
<p>What&#39;s best, beside the surprises in the plotting? The characters, most of whom defy or challenge stereotypes, what a blessing. What&#39;s worst? The style: not a memorable sentence or turn of phrase in the entire bland (ninth-grade vocabulary, straight-ahead syntax) book. Most disappointing: the killing off of an important character just when his situation becomes interesting and troubling. Harbach, in my opinion, punts just&#0160; when he should have pulled the goalie and swung for the fences.&#0160;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Why are dog owners such horrid scofflaws?&#0160; According to our local police-lady, there are fifty-three signs distributed around the downtown mall that either say, in clear language, No Pets, or else picture a dog bisected with a diagonal line. But it&#39;s impossible to take a walk without encountering two or three or half a dozen people obliviously or defiantly parading Rover or Spot.</p>
<p>I think it&#39;s reasonable to assume that the owners can read, or if &quot;No Pets&quot; is too difficult to construe, that they could interpret the icons. It&#39;s possible that they&#39;re just unobservant, and don&#39;t notice the signs, but I suspect not. The signs are hard to miss.</p>
<p>I suspect that the dog people just assume that they&#39;re above the law. They love their pooch, love its barking, love its scat, love the way it playfully lunges at small children, and they can&#39;t imagine that anyone in the world would take exception to their prerogative.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>It&#39;s the same on the mountain trails. Just because the sign says, All Dogs Must Be On Leash, doesn&#39;t mean that the law applies to Me.</p>
<p>I once said to a dog owner who was walking his big dogs off-leash, &quot;You know that you&#39;re breaking the law.&quot; He barked at me: &quot;Get a life.&quot; Another time a bulldog attacked me on the street, and I was warding him off with my briefcase when the owner called him back. I said, &quot;Dogs are supposed to be on leash.&quot; He said, &quot;What are you, the dog warden?&quot; A friend was knocked off her bicycle by a large, aggressive dog. The owner, who should have knelt on ground glass in apology, said only, &quot;He doesn&#39;t like bicycles.&quot;</p>
<p>And many other such stories, but you get my point.</p>

				<p>On our pleasant, prosperous downtown mall, we have entertainers and buskers of many stripes --everyone&#0160; from fire-eaters, magicians, and left-behind 50s folkie guitarists to Zip Code Man. Some are excellent (the occasional string quartet or visiting bluegrass band) and some are horrible (the bam-bam-bam drummers and the pathetic <a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2010/05/ditch-the-didge.html" target="_self">didgedoorists</a>.</p>
<p>We also have a contortionist, whom I personally find difficult to watch.</p>
<p>To me, the contortionist is not so much an entertainer as he is an allegory of the human condition. He&#39;s what they used to call in earlier centuries an emblem.</p>
<p>While other performers try to attract an audience by subtlety and guile, our contortionist merely shouts, &quot;Look at me. Everybody, look at me&quot; -- which I take as a metaphor or icon or emblem. When he calls out, &quot;Look at me,&quot; he&#39;s simply doing what the rest of us want to do but don&#39;t have the courage to do: call attention to ourselves, ask for praise. We&#39;re all saying, &quot;Look at me,&quot; but, becaused we&#39;re civilized and mannerly beings, we strive to do so by being indirect or ironic or clever.&#0160; Not the contortionist. He&#39;s honest about himself and about the true, elemental state of mankind. He shouts, &quot;Look at me&quot; -- and then he ties himself into knots.</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Our peaceful town, not long ago provincial and off-the-track, has now become <em>molto</em> trendy. Only a generation ago, we were bland, undistinguished, white-bread; and now we&#39;re America&#39;s happiest city, America&#39;s slimmest city, America&#39;s healthiest city, and, just recently, America&#39;s foodiest city.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not the slimmest, nor the happiest, nor the healthiest, so It&#39;s embarrassing for me to live where I fall so far below the standard. When I&#39;m melancholy, I feel as though I&#39;m a traitor to the common good. And I confess that never even heard the word &quot;foody&quot; until I read that we were now &quot;foodiest.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>I don&#39;t usually frequent the expensive new restaurants -- they&#39;re too exotic for my mac-and-cheese palate. But I was taken to one of our fanciest new places recently and listened in at a conversation between patrons and waiter at the next table. I transcribe it exactly as it occurred. Honest to Pete.</p>
<p>Patron A:&#0160; &quot;I think I&#39;ll start with the julienned watermelon radish. Is that served with tzitziki?&quot;-</p>
<p>Waiter:&#0160; &quot;Just a dollop.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>Patron B:&#0160; &quot;I&#39;ll have the hedgehog mushrooms with panko crumbs. Are your bulgogi sliders marinated or grilled?&quot;</p>
<p>Waiter:&#0160; &quot;Marinated, then lightly grilled. Then dusted with sudachi zest.&quot;</p>
<p>Patron: A:&#0160; &quot;I think I&#39;ll also have the clear gel of agar and turnip puree with chestnut crumbs. Are your chestnut crumbs domestic or foreign?&quot;</p>
<p>Waiter:&#0160; &quot;I believe they&#39;re Italian.&quot;</p>
<p>Patron B:&#0160; &quot;I see that you have coconut tofu cream. Do you serve that separately, or with the grapefruit curd marscapone?&quot;</p>
<p>Waiter:&#0160; &quot;I believe that the chef likes to combine it with the date marmalade and harissa.&quot;</p>
<p>Patron A:&#0160; &quot;For a main dish, I&#39;ll have the lamb <em>en crepinette</em>. To Patron B (aside whispering):&#0160; &quot;Roasted in caul fat.&quot;</p>
<p>Patron B (aside, annoyed):&#0160; &quot;I know that. (To the waiter):&#0160; I think I&#39;ll go with the squid ink and hot sesame oil soup.&quot;</p>
<p>Waiter:&#0160; &quot;Excellent choice, madam.&quot;</p>
<p>Patron B:&#0160; &quot;And then the braised rabbit with lobster knuckles and pil-pil dill. Is your pil-pil wild or domestic?&#39;</p>
<p>Waiter:&#0160; &quot;Wild, certainly.&quot;</p>
<p>Patron B:&#0160; &quot;And along with that, I&#39;d like a side of pickled ramps and fermented garlic, with a poached duck egg.&quot;</p>
<p>Patron A: &quot;Waiter, may I change my mind. I think I&#39;d prefer the singed octopus in almond puree. Or maybe the snails with liquified parsley, or just something simple, like sea urchin served over discs of scallop with a hamachi and farro salad.&quot;</p>
<p>Patron B: &quot;I think I&#39;ll change my order as well. I think I&#39;ll go with the espelettes in pistachio yogurt sauce. Or the veal sweetbreads with sheepmilk dumplings. Or the okroshka with quail eggs.&quot;</p>
<p>The conversation went on like this for ever and ever, and I began to feel myself out of place, so I left and went up to Marie&#39;s in North Boulder and ordered a hamburger <em>en bun</em> with raw <em>oignon</em> and an old favorite of mine, <em>pomme frites francaises avec sauce de tomate.</em> It was mighty satisfying.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I&#39;ve now sometimes zoomed but&#0160;sometimes plodded&#0160;through seventeen hours of <em>Downton Abbey</em>.&#0160;The series is lovely to look at but also at various times lugubrious, false, and shamelessly gimmicky -- but apparently I&#39;m easily seduced.&#0160;Let me&#0160;confess: I fell for it, mostly, but always against my better judgment.&#0160;Let&#39;s face it, the primitive parts of my brain simply overwhelmed my higher critical faculties. I laughed and cried, even when I knew that I was being cheated and manipulated.&#0160;</p>
<p>My favorite parts:&#0160;Mr. Pamuk and his Nelson Rockefeller departure&#0160;(&quot;he came, and went),&quot; which took me totally by surprise, as did Anna&#39;s and Lady Grantham&#39;s resourceful disposal of the&#0160;corpse. Lady Sybil as a nurse, in part because she was doing useful work for the first time in her pampered&#0160;life, and&#0160;in part because she looked so fetching&#0160;in the&#0160;uniform. My favorite performers -- Maggie Smith, reprising her role in Gosford Park (a much superior&#0160;great house fiction), and Mr Carson&#39;s eyebrows, perpetually raised&#0160;in shock at&#0160;modern shenanigans.&#0160;</p>
<p>The series is pure, undiluted soap.&#0160;It is also, as they used to say in&#0160;<em>Variety,&#0160;</em>a &quot;costumer.&quot;&#0160;Query -- would I have spent seventeen hours watching a&#0160;television program set in a mansion in Dubuque, Iowa, in 2012 in which a soldier returns paralyzed from the wars and miraculously regains his mobility,&#0160;where terrible culinary disasters occur because the cook almost goes blind,&#0160;where granny shows her goodwill by losing a flower show, in which the family is traumatized when a daughter runs off with the chauffeur,&#0160;or where a presumably innocent servant is sentenced to death&#0160;for the murder of his wayward wife. I don&#39;t think so. I would have said, &quot;cornball soap opera&quot; and clicked back to the NBA.&#0160;Or to the advertisements for zirconite jewelry. And yet I went on. And on. And continued on even after <em>Downton Abbey&#0160;</em>not only jumped the shark but vaulted the great white whale, Moby Dick himself, when it introduced into the plot a bout of supposed amnesia. Amnesia! Is there anything soapier?</p>
<p>Or perhaps my reluctant fascination proves that&#0160;the traditional formulas retain their power.&#0160;Here&#39;s a formula of comedy:&#0160;&quot;artificial difficulties overcome.&quot;&#0160;In <em>Downton Abbey,&#0160;</em>Lady Mary and Matthew are destined for one another, and every viewer knows it, even as steaming piles of artificial difficulties are strewn and heaped in their path.&#0160;Shakespeare could slice through the impediments in two hours traffic on the stage, but here it&#39;s seventeen anguished hours until heir and heiress finally figure it out. And here&#39;s&#0160;another formula of comedy: always bring it to conclusion with a feast and a dance.&#0160;They did, and, sucker that I am,&#0160;I was elated. Even though I saw the scam coming a mile down the o-so-picturesque road&#0160;&#0160;</p>

				<p>I can&#39;t remember a time when I wasn&#39;t at home in a library. Although very much a schoolyard urchin, passionate about baseball, trading cards and punchball (or any kind of game played with a spaldeen), I rarely failed my weekly trip to the storefront Avenue J branch of the BPL, where there were cases upon half-height cases of juvenile and later &quot;young adult&quot; books. I read like a hungry larva, without direction or discrimination. A few years later, when I reached Erasmus Hall, my after-school employment was to shelve books at 75 cents an hour at the BPL branch at McDonald Avenue (accumulating the $900 which paid my full first-year tuition at Cornell). I not only mastered the Dewey Decimal System but also absorbed everything that the library had to offer in the 612.6 area of knowledge. At college, I was dazzled by McGraw, my first real library. In my senior year, I was granted a stack pass, and therefore was able to waste many hours not only in aimless browsing, but also lolling in long by-passed and superseded libraries-within-the-library. I doubt that those most pleasant out-of-the-way nineteenth-century nooks and corners survived modernization, more&#39;s the pity. Later, in Cambridge, it was first Widener (where genuine incunabula sat unprotected on the shelves), then Houghton, my first experience with rare books, which, I discovered, are to be savored not only with the eyes, but with the fingertips and the nose. Thence to Colorado, where, without the resources of a major library, I dutifully read STC books on microfilm -- which made me queasy, or on microfiche -- which produced genuine nausea. In 1976-77, I spent one day a week at the British Library, studying sometimes in the old circular reading room, where on downpour days buckets were distributed around the room to deal with the leaks, and at other times in the North Library, where I read big hunks of the perpetually exciting Thomason Tracts. In the early 80s, I was able to enjoy the Huntington in San Marino, where the highlight of the day was lunchtime among the exotic cacti and succulents. Later, at the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, I found not only an unequalled trove of books and mss., but also camaraderie with similarly-obsessed specialists. There was always someone who could answer the obscurest of questions, and there were even a few times when I was able to return the favor. At a cafeteria lunch, once, I asked (faux-naively) &quot;what do we do with the orts?&quot; and everyone at the table knew exactly what I meant -- orts the word that Shakespeare used in <em>Troilus and Cressida</em> to refer to the uneaten portions of a meal.&#0160;</p>
<p>Now I&#39;ve come full circle and the Boulder Public is my three-times-a-week destination. Not great holdings, but through the miracle of an efficient interlibrary loan system, and supplemented by googlebooks and other electronic resources, I can find enough to satisfy my unsteady, dilettante brain.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>It wasn&#39;t until I reached college that discovered&#0160;poetry.&#0160;My comic-book super-hero&#0160;and baseball-infused brain was until then, poetry-wise,&#0160;an almost complete <em>tabula rasa</em>.&#0160;I say &quot;almost&quot;&#0160;because at eight or nine&#0160;eight years old&#0160;I had memorized two great classics of American literature: &quot;Casey at the Bat&quot; and also the poem by Grantland Rice about Tinkers, Evers, and Chance.&#0160;In additon, I knew the ubiquitous stercoraceous&#0160;distich the first line of which is &quot;Here I sit, broken-hearted&quot; and&#0160;a related gnomic verse&#0160;that begins, &quot;No matter how much you wiggle and dance.&quot;&#0160;Then in 1956 I left Flatbush&#0160;for higher&#0160;education and took a course in English Literature. The rest, as they say, is history.&#0160;It was sonnets and love poems of any kind, and rich luscious liquid poems by Marlowe and Keats and Hopkins that entranced me.&#0160;The more intellectual&#0160;poems were&#0160;too&#0160;taxing for my immature head.&#0160;<em>Lycidas</em>, which I now know to be the best poem in&#0160;the language, was utterly impenetrable for at least a decade, although I admit that I immediately&#0160;responded to its music:&#0160;&quot;With nectar pure&#0160;his oozy locks he laves.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>One of&#0160;my teachers sagely observed&#0160;that&#0160;certain poets and certain poems were for youth, some for maturity, and some for old age. &quot;You may no longer&#0160;like then what you&#0160;like now.&quot; Which has come to pass. And as&#0160;an example of poetry for the latter years, he adduced&#0160;Tennyson&#39;s &quot;Ulysses.&quot;&#0160;&quot;This poem may not mean much to you now, but it will some day, if you live long enough.&quot;&#0160;I remember that I was much taken with the touchstone line &quot;Far on the ringing plains of windy Troy&quot; but I thought that&#0160;&quot;Ulysses&quot;&#0160;was far too much about a really old guy trying to cheer himself up and I did not see it holding a place in any future I could envision.&#0160;</p>
<p>Well, folks, I&#39;ve now arrived at the so-called golden years, or, more properly, the endgame, or extra innings (which in some sports is called&#0160;sudden death) and guess what? &quot;Ulysses&quot; has returned,&#0160;front and center,&#0160;exactly as was predicted 50+ years ago.&#0160;It&#39;s right on target.&#0160;</p>
<p>Tennyson&#39;s Ulysses is Homer&#39;s adventurer a generation older, kinging it in Ithaca, but bored, unchallenged, and unstimulated.&#0160;&quot;It little profits that an idle king,/ By this still hearth, among these barren crags,/ Matched with an aged wife, I mete and dole/ Unequal laws unto a savage race,/ That hoard and sleep, and feed,/ And know not me.&quot;</p>
<p>To put it vulgarly, Ulysses plans&#0160;to bust out of the old folks&#0160;home.&#0160;He&#39;s been a warrior, a hero, and a roving explorer.&#0160;He &quot;cannot rest from travel.&quot;&#0160;He needs to search&#0160;&quot;beyond the utmost bound of human thought.&quot;&#0160;He leaves Penelope, and he leaves the government of Ithaca to his bureaucratically-minded &#0160;son Telemachus.&#0160;The last lines of the poem, the leave-taking,&#0160;are most stirring: &#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Come, my friends</p>
<p>&quot;Tis not too late to seek a newer world.</p>
<p>Push off, and sitting well in order smite</p>
<p>The sounding furrows;&#0160;for my purpose holds</p>
<p>To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths</p>
<p>Of all the western stars, until I die.</p>
<p>It may be that the gulfs will wash us down:</p>
<p>It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles,</p>
<p>And see the great Achilles, whom we knew.</p>
<p>Though much is taken, much abides,</p>
<p>And though we are not now that strength which in old days</p>
<p>Moved earth and heaven, that&#0160;which we are, we are;</p>
<p>One equal temper of heroic hearts&#0160;</p>
<p>Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will</p>
<p>To strive to seek, to find, and not to yield.</p>
<p>Yes, I know -- the diction is a little antiquated and artificial, the urge to get away a trifle too vehement. But nevertheless I&#39;m moved by the resilience, the perserverance.&#0160;Though tear-inducing, the poem is anything but lachrymose. And it&#39;s&#0160;accepting: &quot;that which we are, we are.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#39;s lately become&#0160;the fashion to interpret &quot;Ulysses&quot; as a poem about capitalism and imperialism. In this reading, Ulysses is just another white male, off to conquer and colonialize The Alien Other.&#0160;Or to see it as a poem about male priviliege: he&#39;s a bad husband,&#0160;abandoning the family. Or to conceive the poem as a structure of ironies, in which Ulysses doesn&#39;t realize that he undermines his own suppositions.&#0160;There&#39;s a tad of truth in these arguments, as there always is, because Tennyson was caught up in a Victorian striving that he didn&#39;t fully or consciously assimilate.&#0160;But frankly, I feel sorry for readers who can&#39;t hear the verve and excitement in Ulysses&#39;s expansive view of things.&#0160;</p>
<p>Moreover,&#0160;it turns out that Tennyson was absolutely correct to proclaim that&#0160;there is a time in life when &quot;not to yield&quot; is an act of daily heroism.&#0160;</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I like to think that I have a sense of humor, but I just don&#39;t get this one-liner by Rick Santorum&#39;s Daddy Warbucks, Foster Friess. &quot;And this contraceptive thing, my gosh, it&#39;s so--it&#39;s  such--inexpensive, you know, back in my days, they used Bayer Aspirin  for contraception. The gals put it between their knees and it wasn&#39;t  that costly.&quot; So what&#39;s funny here? If the &quot;gals&quot; keep an aspirin between their knees, they can&#39;t have sex and therefore can&#39;t get pregnant? Is that it? Is that The Joke?</p>
<p>First of all, let&#39;s all chip in to send FF a copy of the Kama Sutra (or even an elementary how to do it manual), where he can find some exotic and some extremely obvious positions in which women can get pregnant and still keep their knees together.</p>
<p>But why aspirin? Why Bayer aspirin? What do I not understand? Why an aspirin between the knees rather than, say, a bible?&#0160; Or a book by Newt Gingrich? Or a copy of the <em>The Joy of Sex</em>.</p>
<p>Foster Friess says all this aspirin fun took place &quot;back in my day.&quot; I would like to say that FF is a year younger than I, and that I a) never heard the joke (if it&#39;s a joke) back then, and b) never heard tell of a single woman who used knee-aspirin as a contraceptive.&#0160;</p>
<p>I did some internet research on the aspirin-contraceptive connection and discovered that there&#39;s a story going around in high schools that taking three aspirin and drinking a Coke before intercourse will prevent conception. Advice to young people: do not bank on it.</p>
<p>Will the Santorum administration, immediately upon taking office in 2013, ban aspirin?&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>In Alfred Hitchcock&#39;s <em>Spellbound</em> (1945), man suffers traumatic shock, man loses memory, man relives experience and regains memory. It&#39;s garden-variety Hollywood amnesia, <em>hortus hollywoodiensis</em>. The amnesia is neither credible nor possible, but it doesn&#39;t matter, because it&#39;s the world of film, where the most malleable of mental afflictions takes whatever form is convenient for the writer or director or the presiding mogul.</p>
<p>John Ballantine, played by handsome young Gregory Peck is the amnesiac and the questions the movie poses are, when will he recover his memory, how much help he will require from luscious psychoanalyst Ingrid Bergman, and how many times he can he whine &quot;I can&#39;t remember&quot; and still get the girl. Bergman has a more complex problem: how to be a smart and also a real woman (always a problem in Hitchcock&#39;s wonderful world of misogyny). She makes use of that old dodge, a pair of glasses; when they&#39;re off, she&#39;s feminine, but when she dons them, she&#39;s intelligent. When did Hollywood decided that eyeglasses were a symbol for brains?</p>
<p>But if she has brains, why is she attracted to a man who doesn&#39;t know who he is but is convinced that he might be a murderer. It&#39;s as though the film itself doesn&#39;t take amnesia seriously and treats it as a plot-device rather than the distressing disorder that it would be to an actual sufferer.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>It&#39;s a silly but engaging movie, perhaps too much of an advertisement for psychoanalysis -- which it endorses without a shred of skepticism. I suspect that the psychoanalytic themes, which haven&#39;t fared at all well these seventy years, will eventually doom the movie to oblivion.</p>
<p>There are some tense echt-Hitchcock moments when it appears that the amnesiac might be dangerous, but Peck and Bergman are just too pretty to be killer and victim.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I enjoy fighting off a sneeze. It takes practice and concentration. When the sneeze urge emerges, without warning, the battle is joined. On the side of the sneeze -- dust or some other foreign particles passing through the nasal hairs, reaching&#0160; the nasal mucosa, releasing a flood of histamines which irritate the nerve cells and signal the brain to stimulate the trigeminal network and activate the pharyngeal and tracheal muscles, producing a noisy, 100-mile-an-hour blast of microbes and snot. On the side of restraint -- nothing but enormous personal discipline and the desire not to surrender to animal nature. There are some, who are less committed to mind-over-body, who employ the fingertips to pinch the end of the nose, or, alternatively, who press a knuckle against the philtrum, the infranasal depression which Shakespeare, curiously, called &quot;the valley&quot; -- but frankly, when it comes to resisting sternutation, digital success is only half a loaf. It&#39;s far more rewarding to think one&#39;s way to a rare victory in the lifelong sneezomachia. Not to sneeze is a triumph of the will.</p>
<p>Which is not to assert that a good sneeze gives no pleasure, if a person would give oneself over to it. It&#39;s simply that the sneeze, especially one of the window-rattling variety, is entirely anarchic and inartistic, which might be why there is so slight a sneeze literature. Although hard to believe, it&#39;s a fact that Puck is the only character in all of Shakespeare&#39;s plays who deigns to mention the sneeze, but he weakens its disruptive force by employing the archaism &quot;neeze.&quot; The best-known literary sneeze (or, at least, the only one that now comes to mind) occurs in Pope&#39;s <em>Rape of the Lock</em>, when Belinda, ravished by Sir Plume&#39;s &quot;glittering forfex,&quot; throws snuff in the baron&#39;s nose. Immediately &quot;with starting tears each eye o&#39;erflows,/ And the high dome re-echoes to his nose.&quot;</p>
<p>Snuff artificially stimulates sneezing, which may or may not be be why Michael, Tsar of all the Russians, proposed amputating the noses of snuffers. Michael&#39;s contemporary, Pope Urban VIII, merely threatened excommunication. Some say that the practice of saying &quot;God bless you&quot; to sneezers originated with Pope Gregory the Great, and has to do with the superstition that the soul leaves the sneezing body, perhaps nasally.</p>
<p>Why is it that no one ever says &quot;God bless you&quot; to farters, who are as much in need of divine intervention as sneezers. Society demands that farting, though shameful (and belching, though comic), should be controlled; sneezing is, except for the most determined among us, uncontrollable.&#0160;&#0160;</p>

				<p>As a boy, I naturally assumed that Riis Park was named for Harold (Peewee). Later, I learned that Jacob Riis was a well-known reformer whose 1890 book, <em>How the Other Half Lives</em>, a chronicle of life in New York&#39;s slums, shocked&#0160; Gilded Age complacency. Nowadays, Riis is known more for his pioneering photography than for his writing.&#0160; Here are three of his images:&#0160;  <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef016301767e89970d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Scrubs" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef016301767e89970d" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef016301767e89970d-800wi" title="Scrubs" /></a></p>
<p>The young lady on the left is known to history simply as &quot;Katie.&quot; When Riis asked her what she did, she replied, &quot;I scrubs.&quot; She was a laundress. She was nine years old.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve now read a adulatory life of Jacob Riis by Tom Buk-Swienty. I learned that one of the worst New York slums, Mulberry Bend, had a population density of 2,047 per acre. Fifty per cent of Mulberry Bend&#39;s children died before their fifth birthday. Every year, about 100 Manhattan infants were found dead in the streets. In addition, another 500 children were abandoned by their parents. I also learned that in 1883, when Cornelius Vanderbilt moved into his new chateau on the corner of Fifth Avenue and 52nd Street, he threw a housewarming ball for 1200 guests. &quot;$155,730 was spent on costumes alone.&quot;</p>

				<p>Today it&#39;s Santorum, who has staked out positions to the right of the Pope, where there isn&#39;t all that much room. Yesterday it was Gingrich. Before that, in their turn, Perry, Cain, Bachmann.&#0160; Each month brings a new anti-Romney and just as inevitably, his/her decline.</p>
<p>The extremists who control the Republican party want a candidate who is strictly, or extremely, or &quot;severely&quot; conservative and who can still appear sane enough to be elected.</p>
<p>But it can&#39;t be done.&#0160; It&#39;s a hunt that&#39;s doomed to come up empty.</p>
<p>The &quot;base,&quot; whether fundamentalist or libertarian or drown-the-government-in-the-bathtub, has established a series of tests which make it impossible for their candidate to be both sane and sincere. There can be no such animal.</p>
<p>The candidate must reject evolution and profess to believe in some variety of creationism.</p>
<p>He must believe, or profess to believe, that global warming is a hoax -- a conspiracy theory devised by geologists and meteorologists and climate historians. The candidate must be profoundly anti-science and anti-rational.</p>
<p>He must believe in some variety of &quot;trickle-down economics,&quot; even though several rounds of tax cuts have benefited the rich at the expense of everyone else. (It hasn&#39;t been trickle down, it&#39;s been gush up.) He must believe that any attempt to remedy the situation is &quot;class warfare.&quot; And he must also believe that it&#39;s no problem that the richer are getting out-of-control richer and the poor are becoming poorer and more numerous.</p>
<p>He must believe that the mortgage crisis and the recession was caused by quasi-government entities like Fannie and Freddie and not by the speculations and peculations of de-regulated banks and brokers.</p>
<p>He must believe that the solution to the problem of illegal immigration is to build a larger, taller wall, even though for every wall there&#39;s a ladder and that there&#39;s not a leaf of lettuce that would be harvested or a roof patched in all of America without undocumented labor.</p>
<p>He must believe that gay people are gay by choice and aren&#39;t entitled to equal status under the law. How do they know? The bible tells them so.&#0160;</p>
<p>They must profess to believe that the invasion of Iraq, the worst foreign policy blunder in our history, was a good idea.</p>
<p>And they must believe that Barack Obama fronts a socialist-secular conspiracy, other members of which are the press, the universities, and the &quot;elite,&quot; who want more than anything else to take away their guns.&#0160;</p>
<p>Does this sorry bunch of Republican candidates believe all this nonsense, or do they pander to the base? Are they idiots or are they liars?&#0160; Fools or knaves? We report, you decide.</p>

				<p>I have to admit that I&#39;m thoroughly taken with the Jeremy Lin story. It&#39;s so wonderfully, ridiculously improbable. Asian-American guy, Harvard!! economics grad, plays OK with the Erie Bayhawks and the Reno Bighorns but is released by two not-so-strong NBA teams. A last-resort number 4 point guard on the Knicks, sleeping on a couch in his brother&#39;s apartment, he comes off the bench to lead the worst team in the league to five straight wins, drops 38 on Kobe and the Lakers, etc. etc. Tyson Chandler, grumpy all season long, is now smiling. It&#39;s not just Frank Merriwell; it&#39;s everyone&#39;s secret dream. And a morality play to boot-- keep trying, persevere, trust your own abilities, take advantage of the opportunities. An inspiration and a message in the same package.&#0160;</p>
<p>It can&#39;t last. JLin can&#39;t keep on averaging 27/8. The Knicks will eventually lose (though let&#39;s hope not tonight against shakey Toronto). One of those top point-guard defenders, such as Avery Bradley, is going to eat him alive one of these days. But he&#39;s the real deal and if he stays healthy, remains coachable, works on his three and on his left hand, he could have a great, historic career.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it&#39;s absolutely fascinating. Ama&#39;re returns tonight; that should be easy. The test will come when Carmelo&#39;s groin heals. Can Lin and Anthony work and play well together? I&#39;ll be watching.</p>
<p>And congratulations to Tommie Amaker, Lin&#39;s Harvard coach; he&#39;s got to be one heck of a proud guy.</p>
<p>Another person who&#39;s mighty&#0160;happy: David Stern, who&#39;s been struggling to get a toehold for the NBA in the world&#39;s largest untapped market.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Eric Sanderson&#39;s <em>Mannahatta</em> (New York: Abrams, 2009) reconstructs Manhattan as it would have appeared to Henry Hudson when he sailed the Half-Moon into the harbor in 1609. The glory of the book lies in its illustrations.&#0160; Here&#39;s a conjectural reconstruction of old Manhattan island: <br /><a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef016301560963970d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Mannahatta2" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef016301560963970d" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef016301560963970d-800wi" title="Mannahatta2" /></a></p>
<p>And here&#39;s a clever juxtaposition of ancient and modern:</p>
<p><a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef0167624b359e970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Mannahatta3" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef0167624b359e970b" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef0167624b359e970b-800wi" title="Mannahatta3" /></a></p>
<p>In 1609, the island of Manhattan was home to between 400 and 1000 Lenape Indians. They lived on fish, shellfish (leaving behind extensive middens), deer and other wildlife, on fruits and berries. They practiced some small-scale farming of corn, squash, and beans. Sanderson estimates that the Lenape had lived on Manhattan for 10,000 years, or 400 generations.</p>
<p>Why so few people? The land was fertile, the seas abundant, the weather not particularly harsh. While the Lenape sat still in Manhattan, advanced civilizations were created by the Mayans, the Aztecs and the Incas. Along the banks of the Mississippi, the city of Cahokia rose and fell. And yet the Lenape never domesticated a single animal beside the dog and left behind no pottery, weaving, or metals. They remained stuck in the paleolithic. Why, I wonder. Perhaps things were too good.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Lenape lived in harmony with the island for a very long time. What are the odds that our present civilization, which has totally transformed Manhattan in 400 short years, or just 16 generations, will last one tenth as long?&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><em>February 24</em>:&#0160; Still curious about the want of population growth or technological development among the Lenape, I read C. A. Weslager&#39;s T<em>he Delaware Indians, A History</em> (1972) (Lenapes were called by their Anglo name, Delaware, for many years). Wenslager does not suggest that the Lenape ever achieved larger populations. Nor does he point to any archeological evidence of cultural achievement. Still, I&#39;m mildly suspicious that there may be more to the story.&#0160; We know that Verrazzano contacted the Lenapes 90 years before Hudson sailed into the harbor, and no one knows what diseases he might have introduced.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Who knows what crimes or dark deeds my black-sheep Uncle Max had committed that made made him such a pariah in our o-so-respectable family, but they must have been something awful. Although he was my father&#39;s older brother, his name was never mentioned except with embarrassment or distaste.</p>
<p>Inasmuch as I&#39;m now the &quot;patriarch,&quot; it&#39;s time to get the family stuff on the record for the benefit of the kids, the grandkids, and the extended mishpucha. So here&#39;s all I know about my mysterious uncle. Spoiler alert: it doesn&#39;t add up to villainy.</p>
<p>Max was the oldest of the four (Sol, Mollie, and Mannie succeeded him). He would have been born about 1895, just about the time the family escaped the Ukraine for the Lower East Side. He studied at Albany State Teachers College for a while, but I don&#39;t think he earned a degree. He lived in Paris during the 1920s and perhaps 1930s. He was invited to but did not attend my parents&#39; wedding. He was divorced (a source of immeasurable shame in those years). My mother said, &quot;Uncle Max is very selfish.&quot; There was something shady about the way he made his living, but I don&#39;t know the details, except that, for a while, he ghost-wrote doctoral dissertations. He lived with a woman to whom he wasn&#39;t married. He died of a heart attack during the 1950s.&#0160;</p>
<p>I met him three times. Once, he came to a family gathering, My father wouldn&#39;t speak to him. Another time he paid a weekday afternoon call to our East 9 Street home. I found him in the kitchen talking with my mother: &quot;This is your Uncle Max.&quot; And then, when I was thirteen, he called and asked if he could take me to the finals of the NCAA basketball tournament at Madison Square Garden. After a lot of discussion and negotiation, I was allowed to meet him at the arena. Max was a small man, hard of hearing, and very ordinary.&#0160; He tried hard to be congenial. He told me that he had taken &quot;Robert&quot; as a middle name. Frankly, he seemed no more menacing or odd than any other of my uncle-ry or than other men of his generation. What else do I remember of that evening?&#0160; During the game, an errant pass hit off a player&#39;s head and bounced into the basket.</p>
<p>I never saw Max again.</p>
<p>And yet my father once confessed to me that he told Max that &quot;if he ever did that again, I&#39;d kill him.&quot; My father, mildest of men, threatened someone with violent death?&#0160; Because he did what?&#0160; Dad wouldn&#39;t say.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a spooky story, and I&#39;m going to tell it exactly the way it happened, no embroidery or exaggeration. On the night of my father&#39;s funeral, my brothers and I and our wives gathered around the formica kitchen table in the old house. Uncle Max&#39;s name came up. I said, &quot;I know the name of the woman who he lived with.&quot; &quot;What is it?&quot;&#0160; &quot;It&#39;s Sarah Clyne, spelled with a C and a Y.&quot; There was a Manhattan telephone book (five inches thick and at least two thousand pages). I picked up the book and it fell open. I put my finger on a name. The name was Sarah Clyne. &quot;I said, did you see what happened?&#0160; I just opened the book at random and my finger fell on the name Sarah Clyne, Max&#39;s lady. It seems like a sign that I should call her.&quot;</p>
<p>But I didn&#39;t.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the only picture of Max of which I have knowledge. He&#39;s with &quot;little grandma.&quot; The picture is taken in front of 334 Eastern Parkway in Brooklyn.</p>

				<p>Next summer&#39;s vegetable seeds have arrived in the mail. Hard choices; the gardening will is infinite and the execution confined; which is to say that there just isn&#39;t enough room to grow all the varieties we&#39;d want. But in addition to the old reliables, we try to make room for some exotics and antiques. This year: &#0160; two kinds of heirloom tomatoes. Rose (an Amish favorite), and Black Giant. Pasillo Bajio (an intense black hot pepper, for the pepper-lovers in the family). Ma-Zu Purple Chinese Eggplant, supposedly a favorite of Taiwanese gardeners. Black Beauty Zucchini. Suyo Long Cucumbers (&quot;very mild and sweet&quot;). Romanesco Italia Broccoli (&quot;spiralling apple-green heads&quot;). Ching Chong Bok Choy, an early, cold-weather kind. Russian Red (some call it Ragged Jack) kale. Two kinds of beets: Albino, a Dutch variety, and Crapaudine, unfortunately named, but supposedly the oldest beet still in cultivation. And also carrots, so easy to grow in our rich sandy soil, both a new variety (Cosmic Purple) and an old one (Jaune Obtuse du Doubs, a French carrot which dates to 1894).</p>
<p>It&#39;s going to be a good summer. We&#39;re in the midst of a January snowstorm right now, but I can imagine myself tilling in a load of manure, raking up, and setting out the stakes and twine. It&#39;s going to be a good summer.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>There&#39;s an event in Shakespeare&#39;s <em>Cymbeline</em> that both intrigues and baffles me -- perhaps because I have so pedestrian an imagination. Iachimo wagers that he can seduce Imogen, but he&#39;s forcibly rebuffed by the young princess. Unwilling to lose his bet, he resorts to a nasty subterfuge and smuggles himself into Imogen&#39;s bedroom while she&#39;s asleep. Iachimo&#39;s plan is to memorize some &quot;natural notes about her body&quot; so that he can claim to have &quot;pick&#39;d the lock and ta&#39;en/The treasure of her Honour.&quot; Scoundrel that he is, he&#0160; lifts up her blanket and peeps under her nightclothes. There he discovers &quot;on her left Brest/ A mole, Cinque-spotted: Like the Crimson drops/ I&#39;th&#39; bottome of a Cowslippe.&quot; Armed with this intimacy, he prepares to confront Imogen&#39;s beloved Posthumus Leonatus and win the wager. It&#39;s a troublesome bit of business, and performers must decide whether to present the scene chastely, or erotically, or pruriently.</p>
<p>But there&#39;s also a problem of credibility that most moderns might overlook, but which troubles me. The first Imogen, the Imogen of 1610, was not a young woman but a pre-adolescent male actor. When Iachimo studied him/her closely enough to see the five-spotted mole, he saw no female breast at all. He pretended that he saw it and persuaded the audience that he had done so. Talk about efferontery. Talk about &quot;suspension of disbelief.&quot;</p>
<p>How was the scene played? How did Shakespeare convince the playgoers that the absence of a breast equals the presence of a breast?&#0160; And how did he do so without causing some of the cruder members of the audience to ruin the scene by guffawing or tittering.</p>
<p>It would seem that the playwright would try to hide or disguise the fact that his female characters were not female and that Imogen was a beardless, breastless boy. But in this scene, Shakespeare is anything but apologetic. In fact, he thrusts theatrical trickery right in the face of the audience. &quot;I can make you believe anything,&quot; he seems to say. And why, indeed, should we boggle at a boy with breasts, when in the same scene, Imogen sleeps, even though she&#39;s not really sleeping. And Iachimo soliloquizes aloud and everyone in the audience conspires to pretend that Imogen doesn&#39;t know that he&#39;s there and wouldn&#39;t be awakened by his voice. So why not also agree to suspend our disbelief in the boy&#39;s female traits.</p>
<p>Perhaps it&#39;s my own downright mid-Westerm positivism, but the breastedness of the boy seems to me to present a different order of illusion than the belief in say, a highly-conventionalized device like the soliloquy. But Shakespeare does not compromise. Iachimo stares at an empty space, and says, that&#39;s a breast right there. And he looks at it not fleetingly or glancingly, but with great particularity. Look, there&#39;s a mole. There are five spots on it. Trust me.&#0160;</p>
<p>The breasts, it must be conceded, are literary rather than real. Those crimson drops and the attendant cowslip are out of pastoral poetry, not out of observation. It would be tempting to claim that <em>Cymbeline</em> was written for the page rather than the stage If we didn&#39;t know better. Simon Forman, mountebank and astrologer, attended a performance of <em>Cymbeline </em>at the Globe in 1611 and reported that Iachimo &quot;vewed her [i.e.Imogen] in her bed and the markes of her body.&quot; He saw &quot;her&quot;; he did not see a boy pretending to be &quot;her&quot; and he didn&#39;t make any fuss about her bosom. Case closed, perhaps.</p>
<p>Imogen&#39;s are not Shakespeare&#39;s only imaginary breasts. Lady Macbeth&#39;s breasts, though psychologically crucial, are less problematical because they are alluded to rather than unveiled. They&#39;re functional. &quot;I have given Sucke, and know/ How tender &#39;tis to loue the Babe that milkes me,/ I would, while it was smyling in my Face,/ Haue pluckt my Nipple from his Bonelesse Gummes,/ And dasht the Braines out, had I so sworne.&quot; For me, it&#39;s easier to believe that the actor that played vicious Lady M. is a boy than to believe that the character ever either bore or loved an infant (there&#39;s no other mention of her manchild in the play). Nevertheless, Shakespeare had no compunctions about calling attention to the boy actor&#39;s absent nipples and even more so, his unlikely lactatory prowess. Lady Macbeth&#39;s breasts must be the least welcoming in literature, but they&#39;re not incredible.</p>
<p>An even more remarkable instance of nursing brings Cleopatra to her end. Cleopatra kills herself when she applies the asp to his/her non-existent breast. &quot;Peace, peace:/ Dost thou not see my Baby at my breast/ That suckes the Nurse asleepe?&quot; Cleopatra&#39;s quintessential mothering engenders a dimension of feminity that she has denied until the moment of death. In this case, the intensity of&#0160; Cleopatra&#39;s language overwhelms any possible skepticism about her womanliness. Cleopatra&#39;s breasts are credible. More than credible -- unquestionable and undeniable.</p>
<p>They are a Shakespearean miracle.</p>
