		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>My first purchase for the new Kindle was a &quot;set&quot; of fifty novels by Anthony Trollope for $4.95 -- or ten cents for each spacious, digressive, leisurely book, many of which I have read in the past as three-volume baggy monsters. Initiating a 21st-century electronic device with classic Victorian novels tickles me.</p>
<p>The Kindle fits nicely with my latter-day anti-clutter neurosis. No need to buy a new bookcase. No need, even, to dust the volumes.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>It&#39;s a new way of reading, but whether for better or worse I can&#39;t yet say. The Kindle is portable and easy on the wrist. There&#39;s a built-in light for cloudy days and the middles of nights. But I&#39;m used to knowing where I am in a novel. How many pages I&#39;ve read, how many to go are elements crucial to the experience. I miss, frankly, the heft of the book, the gratification of accumulating all those turned pages. (The Kindle notes the percentage of the book that you&#39;ve read, which is helpful but not satisfying. And when you buy fifty novels in a bundle, the K tells you only that you started <em>The Eustace Diamonds </em>at, say, 26% and finished at 29% -- information which is utterly useless.)&#0160;</p>
<p><em>Can You Believe Her? </em>clearly signaled that it was coming to an end, but <em>Phineas Finn</em>, this time through, came to a conclusion that seemed to be far more hasty than in previous readings. I was surprised that Trollope left so much unresolved. But then, perhaps he had a sequel already in mind.</p>
<p>I need to remind myself that the first readers of these novels didn&#39;t read them in book form. They read them as periodic installments in magazines. The experience of reading a novel in the course of a year or eighteen months was profoundly different from zooming through 800 pages in a few days. While there&#39;s&#0160; nothing &quot;authentic&quot; about &quot;kindling,&quot; the kind of Trollope-reading at which I&#39;ve had a lifetime of practice is&#0160; equally artificial. &#0160;&#0160;</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Here&#39;s a sad childhood memory.</p>
<p>Just around the corner from us, on Ditmas Avenue, there lived the ugliest man I&#39;ve ever seen in my entire life. He was a small, always solitary old man. He was not deformed, just plain ugly.&#0160;His nose and mouth stuck way out, but his chin receded; he had very long canine teeth and the world&#39;s saddest eyes. He walked the ugliest little dog.&#0160;</p>
<p>I confess that when we passed in the street, I looked away, even though I was fascinated enough by his repulsiveness to steal a surreptitious backward glance. I imagine that everyone else whom he passed averted their eyes as well, and that the poor fellow lived in a world not only without friends, but even without eye contact.</p>
<p>Later I learned that he made his living my exhibiting himself nightly at a Coney Island freak show.&#0160;He was the &quot;Dog-Faced Man.&quot;</p>
<p>This was in the late 1940s or early 1950s.&#0160;I hope that freak shows are a thing of the past.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Reposted from January, 2007, and just as pertinent&#0160;now as it was then:</p>
<p>High on the list of <em>The New York Times&#39;</em> &quot;most e-mailed articles&quot; is one that&#39;s catchily titled &quot;What Shamu Taught Me About a Happy Marriage,&quot; by a writer named Amy Sutherland. Apparently it&#39;s a well-regarded, influential essay. I think it&#39;s misleading and wrong-headed, and I think that couples who heed its advice will soon find themselves not in a happy marriage but in one that&#39;s sterile and empty.</p>
<p>Amy&#39;s column is at <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/25/fashion/25love.html?ex=1169528400&amp;en=7c808a42b50f67a0&amp;ei=5070">this address</a>, and will be available unless and until the strapped and greedy <em>Times</em> decides to put it behind a paid wall. A summary: poor Amy is perpetually annoyed by Scott, her husband of twelve years. He loses his keys and asks her help finding them; he keeps her waiting at restaurants; he &quot;hovers around her in the kitchen asking if she has read this or that piece in the New Yorker.&quot; She&#39;s tried nagging, but it doesn&#39;t work. As it happens, Amy is writing a book on animal training and she&#39;s watched people &quot;do the seemingly impossible,&quot; such as &#39;teaching baboons to skateboard&quot; and &quot;hyenas to pirouette on command.&quot; She decides to adopt the animal model and &quot;train&quot; her husband. &quot;If he threw one dirty shirt into the hamper, I&#39;d thank him. If he threw in two, I&#39;d kiss him.&quot; She rewards &quot;approximations.&quot; She uses &quot;least reinforcing syndrome&quot; in which the trainer doesn&#39;t respond in any way when an animal does something wrong -- just stands and stares. When Scott loses his keys, she ignores his pleas for help, and eventually he finds them by himself. By the end of the article, Scott has changed. &quot;After two years of exotic animal training, my marriage is far smoother, my husband much easier to love.&quot;</p>
<p>What&#39;s so awful about this advice? Let&#39;s take the shirts-on-the-floor crisis. Amy can imagine only two methods to deal with this problem. There&#39;s nagging, which she now rejects, and there&#39;s re-training. But there are other responses. The first is for Amy to gain a bit of perspective. Marriage isn&#39;t about whether the dirty shirts are in the hamper or on the floor. People have had long and happy marriages without resolving such issues. Amy seems to assume that getting her way about the shirts is crucial. But when she and Scott married, they agreed to love, honor, and respect each other; they didn&#39;t agree that every single shirt would immediately find its way into a hamper. Perhaps Amy should re-think her priorities and try to keep the larger picture in view. Secondly, Amy can&#39;t seem to imagine any ground between nagging and animal training. But there is -- there&#39;s an enormous territory. There&#39;s discussion, negotiation, and compromise. Amy: &quot;It bothers me that you expect me to pick up your shirts.&quot; Scott: &quot;I&#39;ll try not to drop them. I&#39;ll pick them up myself.&quot; Amy: &quot;And I&#39;ll try not to make such a big deal out of it.&quot;</p>
<p>When Scott comes into the kitchen and wants to read to her from a <em>New Yorker</em> article, Amy could say, if she had any imagination, &quot;Oh, good. Scott wants to involve me in his intellectual life. He wants to talk to me.&quot; But she doesn&#39;t see it that way; she wants him out of the room so she can &quot;concentrate on the simmering pans.&quot; But what&#39;s important about marriage, or about life? Is it the pans, or is it the conversation? Once again, Amy has it all wrong. She cares about her cooking, and getting the soup exactly right, more than she cares about the marriage. It shouldn&#39;t be beyond her ability to stir and to listen at the same time; it&#39;s been known to happen. Amy is, let&#39;s face it, a bit of a narcissist. She wants to make Scott into an extension of herself; she wants to subordinate the marriage to her own convenience.</p>
<p>Readers and friends, here&#39;s my opinion. If your spouse comes to you and says, &quot;I&#39;ve lost my keys, I&#39;m distressed,&quot; you should stop whatever you&#39;re doing and you should start searching. When you do so, you&#39;re treating your spouse with respect and you&#39;re taking your marriage seriously. And if you happen to misplace your own keys, it&#39;s perfectly fair to ask your spouse to help find them. Because sometimes finding keys is a team activity. I&#39;ll go even further: sometimes it&#39;s less important to find the lost keys than it is to search for them together.</p>
<p>But you should engage yourself with the problem of the keys, or the shirts, only if you want a relationship of equals. If you think that it&#39;s so important to train your spouse to stay out of your damn kitchen, then go ahead and follow Amy&#39;s advice. But you might wind up with not with a husband or wife, but with a pirouetting hyena or a skateboarding baboon.</p>
<p>Amy and Scott: here&#39;s some valuable advice. It comes to you courtesy of Mr. Hart, who lived a couple of houses down from us. He died at age 90, in the same month as his equally aged wife. The Harts had been married for 60 or so years. &quot;What&#39;s the secret of a long, happy marriage,&quot; he was asked. He said, &quot;find out what your wife wants and make sure that it happens.&quot; Which is, if you think about it for a moment, only a variation of the traditional golden rule and of its even more practical cousin: &quot;do unto others as they want to be done unto.&quot;</p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2011/08/downtown-bradford.html">Downtown Bradford</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>When we arrived in Bradford, Vermont in 1967 (during the troubled waning years of the LBJ presidency), I remarked to Mrs. Dr. M., &quot;this &quot;downtown&quot; looks like it hasn&#39;t changed a bit since the 1920s.&quot; The downtown was one block long then; it&#39;s no more extensive now, forty-four years later. And not much different.</p>
<p>We sat in the window of the Local Buzz, one of our newer enterprises (real coffee comes to Bradford, at last!) and watched the folks go by. Couples, the guy way too skinny and the lady way too fat. Young blonde guys, tattooed, trying desperately to grow their scruffy beards.&#0160;An occasional suit -- a lawyer or insurance agent. Tourists in campers, looking mighty skeptical. An occasional gaggle of bicyclists, coming from somewhere, going elsewhere, all a-helmeted and bespandexed. But very few guys in &quot;farmer greens.&quot; &#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>Nor have there been any new buildings to compromise the 1920s time-capsule. Stores have changed owners and purposes, of course. Gove (pronounced as in rove, not as in glove) and Bancroft was an independent pharmacy (the kind of place that had big old colored bottles in the window) that disappeared must be a quarter of a century ago and has been superseded by the new Kinney&#39;s out at the four corners (where also resides Orange County&#39;s only four-way traffic light). Similarly, Gove and Morrill, an independent hardware store, has been replaced with a shiny new Aubuchon (a northeastern chain). The old Gove and Morrill, three decades dead, was a great place of a young fellow to purchase his hardware needs. Lester Wakefield and Bart Morrill knew everything and gladly would they teach. They also had a bit of a machine shop in the basement and would drill out that rusted part for you, no charge. Their shop was a shrine of Yankee frugality. The Aubuchon employs what looks like minimum wage help -- the kids know how to run the Visa through the slot, but they know little else, so you&#39;re pretty much on your own. I&#39;m sure that Kinney&#39;s and Aubuchon make a better profit than the stores that they replaced.</p>
<p>And speaking of chains, we now have a Subway, which, I must be the most impoverished looking Subway in existence. Other eateries: Chan&#39;s House (the poorest, least authentic&#0160;Chinese restaurant in the entire occident).&#0160; And another house, the House of Pizza, which replaced, many years ago, The Chimes (a semi-glorified diner). In between the Chimes and the pizza place, there was for a few controversial years at that corner location a breakfast shop that was run by very very young, robotic Stepford girls, reputed to be members of the harem of some charismatic off-brand far right Christian cultist. The food was marvelously inexpensive but the place was o so creepy. &#0160;</p>
<p>There&#39;s a second-hand bookshop, Booked Solid, that&#0160;is loaded&#0160;with romances and &quot;genre&quot; paperbacks;&#0160;trade books that find their way to the shelves are accidental tourists.</p>
<p>Two&#0160;banks where there used to be just one.</p>
<p>The Paradise Cafe, Bradford&#39;s first venture into culinary artistry, lasted a year or two but then devolved into the Richardson Insurance Agency, though it is my impression that Kermit Richardson himself has long since&#0160;collected on his policy.&#0160;Taylor-Palmer insurance is &#0160;still in the same white clapboard house that it inhabited half a century ago, and Hod Palmer, after a brief foray into gourmet cooking, has been restored to the world of his fathers. The Colatina, an out-of-the-can red-sauce Italian restaurant, is still in&#0160;business, still enticing those Dartmouth boys to drive half an hour for some north of Hanover pizza. Perry Oil, which dominates its side of the street, is still going strong, still filling those propane tanks, and still run by genuine Perrys. Hill&#39;s, a kind of old-fashioned notion shop, like a Woolworth&#39;s &#0160;-- how come it hasn&#39;t been obliterated by a Target or a K-Mart? The&#0160;Bradford Public Library, now reroofed, is a handsome Victorian Gothic building, but lacks books. &#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;All is flux,&quot; Heraclitus used to say. But then he&#39;d never been to downtown Bradford.&#0160;&#0160; &#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>The number of Republicans who are waiting for&#0160;a signal from God about whether or not to run for president&#0160; of the USA continues to grow.&#0160;They&#39;re waiting and waiting and waiting.</p>
<p>And meanwhile, surprising is it may seem, God the Father revealed himself to&#0160;me -- me! --just last night. He woke me out of a sound&#0160;sleep (which is a kind of miracle in itself because I had taken a double dose of Ambien).&#0160;I have no idea why I was chosen as the Vessel of His Wisdom,&#0160;but, you know, God moves in mysterious ways.&#0160;I swear as I hope to go to Heaven that it was the one true God Who spoke to me.&#0160;</p>
<p>God said, and this is a direct, verbatim quote,&#0160;&quot;I do not want Rick Perry to run for President.&quot;&#0160;I asked Him&#0160;why, in His Infinite Majesty,&#0160;he was so opposed to a Perry candidacy.&#0160;He said (and here His Voice became so strong, so&#0160;&#39;out-of-a-whirlwind&#39;, that it actually rattled our windows --but they&#39;re old windows and the points and putty could stand replacing), &quot;because he&#39;s a doofus, and also because of he could only earn a &quot;D&quot; in the Shakespeare course at Texas A &amp; M. Imagine that. A &quot;D&quot; in Shakespeare?&quot; God was clearly outraged.&#0160;&quot;You are aware,&quot; he intoned, &quot;that according to Victor Hugo, &#39;after God, Shakespeare has created the most?&#39;&quot;</p>
<p>It was interesting to me&#0160;that God didn&#39;t look the way&#0160;He does in the&#0160;inspired Michelangelo ceiling, which is what I would have expected.&#0160;He looked more like Shazam in the old Captain Marvel comic books.&#0160;Old and bald, and kind of indistinct.&#0160;But it was definitely God.&#0160;I could feel it in my gut. Trust me.&#0160;</p>
<p>I asked Him if&#0160;He had any other&#0160;preferences in the upcoming election.&#0160;He sighed.&#0160;&quot;I don&#39;t want&#0160;either Bachmann or Palin&#0160;either.&#0160;They&#39;re&#0160;doofae.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;I wasn&#39;t surprised that God was so adamantine about B and P, because of their shallow religiosity and deficient knowledge of history,&#0160;but I was truly shocked that God called them by the faux-Latin feminine plural &quot;doofae.&quot; I mean, doofus isn&#39;t even a real Latin word, despite&#0160;its -us ending,&#0160;and so there&#39;s no singular feminine &quot;doofa.&quot;&#0160; I would have thought that God would have a better command of His Latinity. I was so taken aback that I forgot to ask Him how he felt about Newt, whom I myself would definitely prefer to be the Republican candidate. He&#39;s so adorable.</p>
<p>But the grammar of the Godhead&#0160;is beside the point.&#0160;The absolute true fact is that He&#0160;has spoken&#0160;quite plainly.&#0160;We mortals need to know no more but simply to walk humbly in His ways, which means that Perry and the two ladies should&#0160;take heed of this authentic Divine Intervention and decline to pursue elected office. For them to&#0160;continue to press forward, at this juncture and with this revelation, would be nothing short of blasphemy.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I&#39;m reconciled to the idea that death comes to all, but nevertheless, there are a few earthly things that I&#39;m genuinely going to miss.</p>
<p>Is there anything more wonderful, when you&#39;ve been out early in the morning in the rain or in a heavy dew, and your feet are wet and cold, than returning home and putting on clean, dry socks, especially&#0160;those excellent white cotton ones that they sell at Costco? &#0160;Definitely a moment that makes life worth living.&#0160;And also: purchasing, opening and playing a new music cd -- preferably one that you&#39;ve&#0160;thought about acquiring for a long time.&#0160;Another:&#0160;watching young&#0160;healthy athletic people run down the street, especially&#0160;women with long ponytails&#0160;a-bobbing. Also: the perennially pleasurably sound of a bat (wooden, not aluminum) connecting with a&#0160;high, hard one. Rum raisin ice cream. A well-made&#0160;glazed donut.&#0160;The sight of the first soft, red peony of the year just as it breaks the ground.&#0160;The waxy pink flower of the tamarack, always a surprise.&#0160;My Swiss Felco&#0160;#2 hand pruner (which our&#0160;cousins across the sea call it a secateur), a friend for many seasons, which fits my hand perfectly and which if you give it an occasional oiling and sharpening, cuts absolutely true.&#0160;The sound of rain on an uninsulated&#0160;metal roof -- and also like the clickety-clack and pinging of the roof on a cloudy day when the sun comes in and out and the roof alternately expands and contracts -- it&#39;s an&#0160;all-percussion symphony.&#0160;The old downtown of an old city that I&#39;m visiting for the first time. A one-year-old boy or girl learning to walk, at the stage when the strides are of unequal and inconsistent length, the child hovered over by admiring young parents, she with a hand outstretched, he recording the moment on tape; the child the center of the universe, thoroughly doted upon, as is exactly appropriate. A deep, luxurious weekend afternoon nap, so profound that when you wake up you don&#39;t know, for five seconds, where you are or what day it is.&#0160;A sleep so deep that <em>somnus imago mortis</em> kicks in;&#0160; nothing more satisfying: the kind of thing that makes a guy want to live a few more years.</p>

				<p>Lola and I brought some windfall apples to the horses.&#0160;The horses are Morgans, very friendly, but intimidatingly large to a 22-month-old child.&#0160;We stood&#0160;on one side of the gate, the horses trotted up to the other side as soon as we announced our presence. They like to lean over the fence and look in our pockets for apples.</p>
<p>Lola said, and I quote, &quot;Back Mommy.&quot; I contrued this opaque construction to mean &quot;I believe that I would now like to rejoin my mother back at the house as quickly as possible.&quot;</p>
<p>Lola is succinct, but she sure knows how to make herself understood.&#0160;</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Dr. M.: &#0160;&quot;The John Deere guy was over here the other day and he told us a story about a fellow who had a 450 just like ours. He had the forks on the tractor, the kind you use for picking up the round bales. He was working in his woods, trying to bring down a big hemlock. He notched and cut it, but left a hinge and the tree got hung up and wouldn&#39;t go over, so he tried to push the tree over with his forks. Somehow or other, he got the forks on either side of the tree. The hemlock came over, picked up his tractor, spun it 180 in the air, knocked off the canopy, drove the upright right into his chest, killed him on the spot.&quot;</p>
<p>Big Al: &#0160;&quot;I knew the guy. It was Howard Beck up in North Monroe. He was a low wattage kind of guy. It&#39;s amazing he lived as long as he did.&quot;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Hackett Hill Road is two twisty, depopulated, uphill-and-down miles long. It is unpaved and seriously washboarded. If you didn&#39;t know for sure that it was a public thoroughfare, you might think that you had accidentally turned into someone&#39;s long driveway.</p>
<p>Most of our guests arrive from the South Road side of things, which is an easier passage. We&#39;re just .2 from South Roadm a much easier ride than the long route, off of Route 25.&#0160;The GPS, which most people use nowadays, takes people the long way. &#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Directly adjacent to the graveyard, which is the only obvious remnant of the old community of West Bradford, lies our narrow driveway. It&#39;s inconspicuous and steep, but we&#39;ve posted a wooden sign with our street number. The number is an innovation; &#0160;we didn&#39;t have one until 9/11 -- nor did we need one, because there&#39;s no mail delivery on Hackett Hill. (We go to town to pick up mail; Muriel at the post office takes good care of our occasional packages and flyers and medical bills.) &#0160;</p>
<p>Some friends, new to rural Vermont, traveling from Denver with their two teenage daughters, came to visit us the other day. They were a bit intimidated and possibly a little anxious as a consequence of their slow passage along Hackett Hill Road. Although they were carefully following Sheila, which is what they&#39;ve named their GPS (ours is <a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2007/06/travels_with_do.html" target="_self">Dorcas</a>) they missed our sign and overshot their mark. Sheila, the idiot-savant, nevertheless announced, &quot;You have arrived at your destination, on left.&quot; On the left, of course, was only the cemetery with its lichen-encrusted marble gravestones. They were surprised and amused --their vehicle, I&#39;m told, filled with hilarity -- but were poised enough to continue to the end of the road, make a U, and initiate a most pleasant visit. &#0160;</p>

				<p>A: &#0160;&quot;What&#39;s that stand of trees that are down there by the brook?&quot;</p>
<p>Dr. M: &#0160;&quot;Cottonwoods. &#0160;I planted one of them must be thirty-five years ago. The big one. They reproduce like aspens, underground runners. Turned into a nice stand.&quot;</p>
<p>A: &#0160;&quot;When I was working the sawmill, sometimes the locals would bring in a tree they called &quot;barmagillion&quot; or &quot;bahmagillion.&quot; I could never figure out what it was. I looked in all the tree books. Never found it. We treated it just like poplar.&quot;</p>
<p>Dr. M: &#0160;&quot;Was it a poplar?. Cottonwoods are poplars.&quot;</p>
<p>A: &#0160;&quot;It took me twenty years to figure out what &#39;barmagillion&#39; was. Actually, I didn&#39;t figure it out. Neill was here with one of those telephones that does everything. He looked it up. It&#39;s actually &quot;balm of Gilead.&quot; &#0160;</p>
<p>(I looked it up also. &quot;Balm of Gilead&quot; is another name for what most people around here call &quot;balsam poplar.&quot; &#0160;It&#39;s not uncommon but not plentiful either, at least in these parts. I didn&#39;t know that the buds are covered with sticky resin used by bees to plug holes in their nests and by humans as a kind of perfume).&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>

<p>&quot;Barmagillion&quot; is distantly related to &quot;folk etymology,&quot; as for example when arthritis is called &quot;Arthur Wright.&quot;</p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2011/07/ladystallions.html">Lady Stallions!!!</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Lady Stallions!?! Not only a New Jersey soccer team, but an oxymoron of Shakespearean achievement. Not a simple oxymoron either, like Romeo&#39;s &quot;cold fire, sick health,&quot; but a figure of speech on the far frontier of Oxymoronia, along with such classics as Utah Jazz and Christian Science. What, pray tell, is a Lady Stallion? &#0160;Even in an age of gender fluidity, it&#39;s hard to get a grasp on this one. Oh, I understand the principle -- the men&#39;s team is the Stallions, and therefore it follows as night the day that the distaff team acquires the same name, prefixed with Lady. In the same way, we have, out here, the Buffs and the Lady Buffs. I would offer not the slightest demurral if the men&#39;s team was called the New Jersey Horses and women&#39;s team was the New Jersey Lady Horses. It&#39;s awkward but logical. Lady Horses may not be either a poetical or an intimidating moniker, but it doesn&#39;t boggle the grammatical mind. But a stallion is archetypically male, the snorting captain of his harem-herd of equine odalisques, groupies, wives, mistresses, and girlfriends. Against all challenges, he bites and kicks and if necessary injects himself with steroids and horse growth hormone in order to maintain his macho primacy. A lady stallion is therefore utterly impossible both emotionally and linguistically. The term is a travesty. Better to call them the New Jersey Mares, which makes linguistic sense. Or even better, the New Jersey Geldings (which are, in an odd &#0160;kind of a way, no-longer-male stallions). &#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>Although I myself would reserve the name Geldings for institutions named after gentleman who have made the sacrifice and earned the right: the Origen Divinity School Geldings or the St. Abelard Preparatory School Geldings. But that&#39;s a horse of another color. &#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Although particularly egregious, Lady Stallions do not stand solitary in their linguistic purgatory. Also competing are the Lady Rams (suggested alternative: Sheep), the Lady Bucks, and the Lady Bulls (alternative: Cows). No teams named the Goats. No Lady Boars (or Pigs either, for that matter). In defiance of all logic, there are the Oregon Lady Ducks, which is truly an impossibility, because properly, the men&#39;s team should be the Drakes, the women&#39;s the Ducks (or Lady Drakes). There are no teams, as far as I&#39;m aware, named either the Geese or the Lady Ganders; yes, there are the South Carolina Gamecocks, but I&#39;m going to guess that the distaff side is not named the Lady Gamecocks. Wait, I&#39;ll google it. OK, the South Carolina women&#39;s softball team is named ... the Gamecocks, which is bad enough, but could have been worse, because in my world of propriety, &quot;lady&quot; and &quot;cocks&quot; should never inhabit the same sentence. &#0160;</p>
<p>Dogs are a problem. No one calls their team the Dogs. But there are some breeds who are allowed to play. Bulldogs and Mastiffs and Greyhounds are in, Poodles are out. The University of Georgia proffers the Lady Bulldogs, but not one college, high school, or club has thought to give us either the Lady Dogs, or whatever is that word by which female dogs are denominated.</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I&#39;ve been reading about rugs and therefore learning all sorts of new words.&#0160;For example, a <span style="color: #ff00ff;">yastik </span>is a small rug or bag for designed to be sat upon and therefore serves a different purpose than a <span style="color: #ff00ff;">mafrash,</span> which is bag for transporting small objects.&#0160; Here&#39;s a mafrash:&#0160;<a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef014e89bfe91a970d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Mafrash" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef014e89bfe91a970d" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef014e89bfe91a970d-800wi" title="Mafrash" /></a></p>
<p>I have discovered&#0160;that many of the terms used to describe the patterns of &quot;oriental&quot; carpets are derived from architecture.&#0160;Moreover, it turns out that many of these words are entirely unfamiliar to me.&#0160;For example, an <span style="color: #ff00ff;">ogive</span> is &quot;the roundly tapered end of a object&quot; such as an arch.&#0160;It&#39;s a peculiar word whose etymology is anybody&#39;s guess.&#0160;The adjectival form is &quot;ogival.&quot;&#0160;&quot;Ogival&quot; forms are common on Turkish rugs.</p>
<p>&#0160;A <span style="color: #ff00ff;">merlon</span> on a medieval castle&#0160;is &quot;the solid part of a parapet.&quot;&#0160;I think a picture is called for here.&#0160;Merlons:&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;<a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef014e89bfddf3970d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Merlon" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef014e89bfddf3970d" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef014e89bfddf3970d-800wi" title="Merlon" /></a></p>
<p>Such forms, like giant teeth, frequently appear in the borders of rugs.&#0160;A <span style="color: #ff00ff;">crenelle</span> is a notch or open space between two merlons.&#0160;So in the picture above it&#39;s merlon, crenelle, merlon, crenelle, etc.&#0160;Merlon Crenelle sounds like the name of linebacker at Tulane or Louisiana State.&#0160; An even odder word is <span style="color: #ff00ff;">squinch</span>, which doesn&#39;t seem as though&#0160;it could possibly describe a part of a rug, but does. It sounds like a&#0160;palatalized variant of squint (or Shakespeare&#39;s squiny), or some sort of exotic citrus (would you mind passing me&#0160;a couple of those squinches?), but it is in fact&#0160;&quot;a piece of construction used for filling in the upper angles of a square room so as to form a proper base to receive an octagonal or spherical dome.&quot;&#0160;It&#39;s a filler of sorts, and as such is occasional knotted into a complex carpet, though I rather doubt that the women who wove the rugs&#0160;thought squinchwise.</p>
<p>A <span style="color: #2d2d2d;"><span style="color: #ff00ff;">spandrel</span>&#0160;is a space above an arch -- as illustrated here:&#0160; </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #2d2d2d;"><a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef0154339fdeea970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Spandrel1" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef0154339fdeea970c" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef0154339fdeea970c-800wi" title="Spandrel1" /></a>&#0160;<br />There are four blue spandrels in this fancy silk Heriz carpet: </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #2d2d2d;"><a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef0154339fdfb5970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Spandrel" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef0154339fdfb5970c image-full" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef0154339fdfb5970c-800wi" title="Spandrel" /></a>&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #2d2d2d;"><span style="color: #ff00ff;">Kufesque</span> is another word used to describe rug patterns, but it derives not from architecture but from writing.&#0160;Arabic was anciently written in Kufic, an angular, upright script. Illiterate weavers copied&#0160;and recopied Kufic inscriptions until they became meaningless but still remained beautiful. Many rugs have&#0160;kufesque borders.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #2d2d2d;">Strange to say, I had recent occasion to employ the word &quot;kufic&quot; in conversation.&#0160;It was my annual visit to the opthamologist.&#0160;&quot;Read the next line,&quot; I was told.&#0160;&quot;Looks like Kufic to me.&quot;&#0160;I believe the eye guy understood that I couldn&#39;t read the line, but I rather doubt that he&#0160;fully appreciated my inspired and accurate answer.&#0160;</span></p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>This 1966 black-and-white oddity boasts a&#0160;distinguished director (Delbert Mann, celebrated&#0160;for <em>Marty</em>) and a group&#0160;of excellent actresses&#0160;(Jean Simmons, Katherine Ross, Angela Lansbury and Suzanne Pleshette).&#0160;It&#39;s&#0160;ambitious and sometimes imaginative.&#0160;But frankly, even more than your run-of-the-mill amnesia movie, it&#39;s a mess.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>The amnesiac in this case is a young and puzzled James Garner, who&#0160;comes to consciousness in Central Park (there are good historical shots of 1960s NYC throughout)&#0160;and takes the <em>nom d&#39;oubli </em>Sam Buddwing.&#0160;We&#39;re not told how he found his way to&#0160;a park bench&#0160;but movie amnesia is so commonplace and so flexible that the audience has no difficulty going along for the ride. The rest of the film&#0160;tracks Buddwing through various encounters until he&#0160;recovers his memory with no more fuss than he lost it.&#0160;</p>
<p>Amnesia is&#0160;merely a plot device and not the film&#39;s true focus.&#0160;The theme seems to be&#0160;&quot;identity,&quot; which, if I remember, was a subject much in vogue&#0160;in the 1960s.&#0160;Buddwing says, more than once, &quot;I don&#39;t know who I am.&quot;&#0160;But so did all of us say the same thing, in those ancient days,&#0160;even without the provocation of amnesia.&#0160;Buddwing&#39;s&#0160;specific problem, as it gradually reveals itself,&#0160;is that he has made a series of &quot;inauthentic&quot; (as we used to say) choices.&#0160;He should have composed the octet rather than have gone for the commercial money.&#0160;He shouldn&#39;t have encouraged his wife&#0160;to abort the baby.&#0160;And he certainly should have prevented&#0160;both himself and Grace&#0160;(note signficant moniker!!) from drifting&#0160;into infidelity and alcohol.</p>
<p>More&#0160;&quot;don&#39;ts.&quot;&#0160;The&#0160;writer and director&#0160;shouldn&#39;t have tried to imitate Ingmar Bergman (the excrescent scene with the beggar who thinks he&#39;s God is embarrassingly derivative).&#0160;And they&#0160;shouldn&#39;t have indulged all the&#0160;Bergman-derived religiosity.&#0160;When a prayer &quot;O God, let her live&quot; is followed immediately by a resurrection, it&#39;s not a film --&#0160;it&#39;s propaganda.&#0160;Come to think of it, the creative team&#0160;should also have put some distance between themselves&#0160;and&#0160;the Kafkaeque surreal.&#0160;Moreover, they&#0160;should not have allowed the film to slide&#0160;into an&#0160;easy, superficial allegorizing.&#0160;Buddwing may say &quot;I&#39;m not everyman&quot; -- but the film desperately hopes that he will be taken as such.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Amnesia, it would appear, has the power to soften the brain of both writer and director.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>My mother had a pretty fair soprano and as a young adult performed in amateur musicals. She sang in that high, quavering style that I associate with artists of the 1920s and 1930s, such as Ruth Etting (&quot;America&#39;s Radio Sweetheart&quot;). I remember that sometimes, when&#0160;she wasn&#39;t busy putting the laundry through the wringer or&#0160;scrubbing the sink or dusting under the beds, she&#39;d sit at the old Hardman piano and sing the songs of her youth. She sang tin pan alley songs,&#0160;Gilbert and Sullivan ballads,&#0160;so-called&#0160;&quot;Negro spirituals,&quot;&#0160;and also what I now know to be&#0160;Victorian parlor songs.&#0160;Her taste was formed in the earlier part of the century (she was born in 1905) and had as far as I can tell ceased to change after about 1935 with the arrival of my older brother and diapers. My mother sang, for example,&#0160;1919&#39;s &quot;Look for the Silver Lining&quot;:&#0160;&quot;A heart, full of joy and gladness,/ Will always banish sadness and strife./So always look for the silver lining,/ And try to find the sunny side of life.&quot; She sang &quot;I&#39;ve been Working on the Railroad&quot; (first published in 1894) with the refrain &quot;Someone&#39;s in the kitchen with Dinah/ Someone&#39;s in the kitchen I know/ Someone&#39;s in the kitchen with Dinah/Strummin&#39; on the old&#0160;banjo.&quot;&#0160; Neither she nor I knew that &quot;Dinah&quot; was a generic name for a female slave, nor did we speculate about what the heck was going on in that kitchen. She sang&#0160;&quot;Oh, the old gray mare, she ain&#39;t what she used to be,/Many long years ago.&quot;&#0160; She sang a version of what I can now identify as Ed Haley&#39;s 1894&#0160;hit, &quot;The Fountain in the Park&quot;, with the familiar lyric &quot;While strolling in the park one day,/ In the merry,&#0160;merry month of May,/ I was taken by surprise/ by a pair of roguish eyes...&quot;&#0160; Sorry, but I can&#39;t remember the rest. She sang, &quot;Shine on harvest moon/ Up in the sky.&quot;&#0160; And also &quot;Aint She Sweet.&quot; And &quot;Home Sweet Home&quot; (&quot;Mid pleasures and palaces though we may roam,/ Be it ever so humble, there&#39;s no place like home&quot;).</p>
<p>But the song that stands most vividly in my memory was &quot;Bill&quot; from <em>Showboat</em>.&#0160;It&#39;s a lovely song, but I took it wrong.&#0160;When my mother sang &quot;I used to think that I would discover/ The perfect lover some day,&quot; I&#0160; decided that she was finding fault with my father, to whom I was most loyal. In my mind, my father was noble and manly and intelligent, and I resented her singing about &quot;Bill, who&#39;s not the type at all/ You&#39;d meet him on the street and never notice him.&quot; The&#0160;refrain was particularly painful to my seven-year-old self: &quot;And I can&#39;t explain,/ It&#39;s surely not his brain that makes me thrill./ I love him because he&#39;s I don&#39;t know,/Because he&#39;s just my Bill.&quot;</p>
<p>I&#39;ve since learned about fiction, and make-believe.&#0160; I can forgive her.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Regular readers of this blague know that Dr. M. is easily taken with&#0160;odd and unusual words.&#0160;Well, the poor doctor has&#0160;been enchanted&#0160;again.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Here follows&#0160;a&#0160;wordhoard excavated from&#0160;Barry Cunliffe&#39;s big <a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2011/06/lessons-from-neolithic-malta.html" target="_self">book</a>&#0160;on European&#0160;archaeology. Perhaps some doctormetablogians know one or two of these words,&#0160;but I doubt anyone knows all of them, and I confess that each one is absolutely new to me.</p>
<p>I&#39;m embarrassed but it&#39;s the awful truth.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Dillisk,</span>which sounds like a disk or circular form of dill, is in actual fact a kind of&#0160;sea lettuce or creatnach, an edible algae, much consumed during the Neolithic.&#0160;<span style="color: #0000ff;">Carragheen</span>, nowadays defined as &quot;a family of linear sulfated polysaccharides&quot; was at one time the name of a&#0160;food&#0160;derived from red algae -- apparently an ancient snackfood.&#0160;<span style="color: #0000ff;">Melitot</span> is an alternative name for sweet clover.&#0160;<span style="color: #0000ff;">Vetchlings <span style="color: #2d2d2d;">are sweet peas.&#0160;An <span style="color: #0000ff;">ard&#0160;<span style="color: #2d2d2d;">is a early plough -- no more than a spike that is dragged through the soil, most commonly&#0160;by oxen.&#0160;A </span></span></span>lynchet&#0160;</span>-as I&#39;m sure everyone knows, is not a minor vigilante hanging but rather a&#0160;&quot;ridge or terrace seen on the slopes of the Chalk,Oölitic, and Liassic escarpments in various parts of England, especially in Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire, Wiltshire, and Somerset.&quot; It&#39;s now public knowledge: Dr. M knows&#0160;zilch about&#0160;Oolitic escarpments.&#0160;A l<span style="color: #0000ff;">eister</span> is a breed of sheep.&#0160;A <span style="color: #0000ff;">lur</span> is not a way to catch fish, but is an&#0160;ancient&#0160;bronze horn, precursor of the trumpet (though stopless).&#0160; Here are a pair of&#0160;lurs.&#0160;<a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef014e89766aee970d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Lur" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef014e89766aee970d" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef014e89766aee970d-800wi" title="Lur" /></a></p>
<p>They look like high-end showerheads.&#0160;I can&#39;t imagine what they sound like.&#0160;A <span style="color: #0000ff;">cist</span> is not a&#0160;cyst.&#0160;It is a small stone coffin or ossuary.&#0160;An <span style="color: #0000ff;">orthostat </span>is an upright stone used as a member of a larger structure&#0160;(as opposed to a menhir, which usually stands alone).<span style="color: #2d2d2d;">&#0160;<span style="color: #0000ff;">Cob</span>&#0160;or cobb (or sometimes clom) is a building&#0160;material comprised&#0160;of&#0160;clay,sand, straw, water, and&#0160;soil, something like clench.&#0160;A <span style="color: #0000ff;">nuraghe</span></span><span style="color: #0000ff;">&#0160;</span>is a megalithic structure found in ancient Sardinia.&#0160;Eight thousand nuraghi (<em>mirabile dictu</em>!) are still in&#0160;existence. Here&#39;s one: <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef01538f8324fc970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Nuraghe" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef01538f8324fc970b" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef01538f8324fc970b-800wi" title="Nuraghe" /></a>&#0160;</p>
<p>A c<span style="color: #0000ff;">orbel&#0160;</span>is a stone that juts out of a wall to support a weight.&#0160;If it&#39;s not stone, but wood, it&#39;s called a&#0160;&quot;tassel&quot; or a &quot;bragger.&quot;&#0160;A <span style="color: #0000ff;">currach</span> is of course a kind of Irish boat, once constructed out&#0160;of animal hides, but now out of canvas.&#0160;It is much smaller than&#0160;a&#0160;<span style="color: #0000ff;">penteconter</span>, an ancient&#0160;Greek galley which is the ancestor of the warlike trireme and the fabled quinquireme.&#0160;<span style="color: #0000ff;">Strakes</span> are the planks that compose the hull of a wooden ship.&#0160;<span style="color: #0000ff;">Callais</span> is a green stone used for bead-making&#0160;in the&#0160;early part of the Bronze Age.<span style="color: #888888;">&#0160;</span><span style="color: #0000ff;">Skeumorphism</span>, my very favorite of all these exciting new words, is &quot;an element of design or structure that serves little or no purpose in the artifact fashioned from the new material but was essential to the object made from the original material.&quot;&#0160;Archeologists apparently use the term in a&#0160;more restricted&#0160;sense, as for example in the case of a&#0160;bronze vessel&#0160;which retains and imitates features of an antecedent clay pot. Or,&#0160;to take a wikipedian example,&#0160;&quot;decorative stone features of Greek temples such as mutules, guttae, and modillions that are derived from earlier wooden temples.&quot;&#0160;What are mutules, guttae, and modillions?&#0160;I don&#39;t know, but they sure do set the logo-curious mind all a-twitter.&#0160;&#0160;</p>

If, on the other hand, you&#39;re looking for heartfelt religion, there&#39;s &quot;No Hiding Place Down Here,&quot; which was later and better realized by Dorothy Love Coates and the Gospel Harmonettes. And also the very wistful and lovely &quot;Oh, I&#39;m thinking tonight of my blue eyes/ Who is sailing far over the sea/ I&#39;m thinking tonight of my blue eyes/ And I wonder if he ever thinks of me.&quot; But my favorite, nowadays, is, &quot;Will You Miss Me When I&#39;m Gone.&quot;&#0160;The lyrics are Victorian/goopy,&#0160;written (by A. P.) in a highly artificial off-the-wall&#0160;literary and poetical style --&#0160;but yet, when accompanied by guitar and autoharp, and song by Mother Maybelle, against all odds it comes out quintessentially beautiful.&#0160;&quot;Will You Miss Me&quot; taps into&#0160;the common fantasy of observing our own funeral. Her&#39;e&#39;s the lyric:&#0160; Stanza 1: &quot;When death shall close these eyelids,/ And this heart shall cease to beat,/And they lay me down to rest/&#0160;In some ?flowery ?boundary ?tree (the words are unintelligible). (2) Perhaps you&#39;ll plant a flower/&#0160;By my poor unworthy grave;/ Come and sit along beside me/ Where the roses nod and wave. (3) One sweet thought my soul shall cherish/When this fleeting life has flown/ This sweet thought will cheer when dying/ Will you miss me when I&#39;m gone?&#0160; (4)&#0160;When these lips shall never more/Press a kiss upon my brow,/ But lie cold and still in death/ Will you miss me then as now?&quot;&#0160;Chorus (after every stanza): &quot;Will you miss me,/ Will you miss me when I&#39;m gone?&quot;&#0160;In its lugubriousitude, &quot;Will You Miss me&quot; is very like the great Londonderry air, &quot;Danny Boy.&quot;</p>
<p>There&#39;s something luxurious about a good&#0160;gloomy wallow.&#0160;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Neolithic Malta presents&#0160;an e<em>xemplum</em> and a warning.&#0160;The island&#0160;received its first human inhabitants, who probably arrived from Sicily,&#0160;some time around 5000&#0160;BC.&#0160;After about 3600 BC, trade and other links with&#0160; the outside world waned.&#0160;Over the next thousand years or so, the people of Mlata built seventeen&#0160;monumental stone&#0160;temples unlike any elsewhere in the Mediterranean.&#0160;</p>
<p><a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef014e895b24e4970d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Manajdra" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef014e895b24e4970d" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef014e895b24e4970d-800wi" title="Manajdra" /></a>&#0160;</p>
<p>These are the remains of one of the seventeen.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a view of another:<a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef01538f67cf2e970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Hagarqim" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef01538f67cf2e970b" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef01538f67cf2e970b-800wi" title="Hagarqim" /></a>&#0160;<br />There&#39;s something truly remarkable about these megalithic temples, but it&#39;s troubling that a marginal and isolated culture would make such a huge and&#0160;economically unproductive&#0160;investment.&#0160;Indeed, starting about&#0160;2300 BC, this native Maltese culture&#0160;went into precipitous&#0160;decline.&#0160;A major cause&#0160;seems to have been the extreme deforestation and soil loss when the population increased and resources were overused.&#0160;The best guess is that the Maltese experienced an economic and spiritual crisis.</p>
<p>They did not, alas, confront the&#0160;environmental problem; instead, the evidence suggests that the people, probably led by an oppressive priestly caste, continued to make greater and greater investments in religious worship, no doubt hoping that their gods would rescue them from their predicament. &quot;In the end their expectations were not met and crisis ensued from which it took centuries to recover&quot; (Barry Cunliffe, <em>Europe Between the Oceans</em>, [Yale, 2008], p. 172.) The population disappeared, the culture was extinguished and&#0160;Malta was&#0160;deserted until the arrival of Bronze Age peoples around 2000 BC.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s go over this ground and make sure that we understand. The neolithic&#0160;inhabitants of Malta temporarily increased their&#0160;population at the expense of massive enviromental degradation, and then, as the standard of living dropped, decided that the best way to deal with the crisis was&#0160;to make mammoth investments in&#0160;priests and temples (rather than, say, birth control and&#0160;sustainable forestry and agriculture).&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Is there a moral here.&#0160; We report, you decide.&#0160;But I believe that I can hear the&#0160;debate. &quot;We&#39;ve already built fifteen temples and it hasn&#39;t worked.&#0160;Perhaps we should try something new, like planting trees.&quot;&#0160; &quot;Nonesense, young radical.&#0160;We must look to faith. Faith will reward us.&#0160;One more temple, this one really huge.&#0160;More stones over here!&quot;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef01538f5bb8f2970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Pazyryk" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef01538f5bb8f2970b image-full" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef01538f5bb8f2970b-800wi" title="Pazyryk" /></a>&#0160;<br />I&#39;ve been reading about rugs.&#0160;I&#39;m ignorant, but fortunately, there&#0160;are dozens of eaily-available and learned books, and&#0160;I&#39;m happy to say that our&#0160;local university library is going to keep me busy until my enthusiasm flags.</p>
<p>Everyone interested in rugs&#0160;knows that the Pazyryk carpet (which I didn&#39;t know about until a month ago) is the oldest known rug and about three thousand years older than the next contender.&#0160;It was discovered&#0160;in 1949 near the Mongolia-China border, in a Scythian tomb that had been flooded and frozen since about 2500 BCE. It&#39;s magnificent and it&#39;s mind-expanding.&#0160;It&#39;s been a long time since something has created in me such a reverent sense of gaga-hood and wowage.&#0160;</p>
<p>Although older than old, it&#39;s anything but primitive.&#0160;Centuries, perhaps millenia, of experimentation, learning, intelligence, craft, and effort preceded its making.&#0160;First our ancestors had to&#0160;domesticate sheep, which, I&#39;ve learned,&#0160;had to be selectively bred to become wooly rather than merely hairy.&#0160;Then came the invention of spinning and weaving.&#0160;And dyeing, which is a sophisticated and complicated art all of&#0160;itself. Moreover, it&#39;s obvious that the Pazyryk rug did not spring whole out of someone&#39;s brain --it&#39;s the climax of a long artistic tradition. While some scholars detect Persian influences, others think it wholly a&#0160;creation of the steppes.&#0160;The red dye, it&#39;s recently been discovered, is Polish cochineal.&#0160;How did the dye get to Mongolia?&#0160; I&#39;ve not read anything about the blue, but it looks like indigo, and if it is, the process of getting wool to take indigo is extremely complicated.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;<a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef01538f614fee970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Pazyrykdetail1" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef01538f614fee970b image-full" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef01538f614fee970b-800wi" title="Pazyrykdetail1" /></a></p>
<p>The detail, though faded (fifty-five hundred years of refrigeration take its&#0160;toll)&#0160;is worthy of the closest study:&#0160;mounted horsemen, saddle blankets and trappings, even&#0160;the decorated manes of the horses, are rendered, knot by knot, with great power.&#0160;</p>
<p>And then there are the happy moose (or possibly elk, or some ungulate that I don&#39;t know).</p>
<p>&#0160; <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef01538f6156b5970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Pazyrkymoose" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef01538f6156b5970b image-full" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef01538f6156b5970b-800wi" title="Pazyrkymoose" /></a></p>
<p>The rug now resides at the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg.&#0160; I intend to visit it some day, but&#0160;if the museum should want to put it out on&#0160;permanent loan to my living room, I would&#0160;promise to treat it with the utmost respect and appreciation.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Pound for pound, <em>Macbeth </em>is of all Shakespeare&#39;s plays the most unrelenting and horrifying.</p>
<p>One of&#0160;its greatest moments occurs&#0160;when Macbeth, seeking additional guidance, pays a second call on the witches.&#0160;&quot;How now,&quot; he demands, &quot;you secret, black, and midnight hags!/ What is&#39;t you do?&quot;&#0160;The witches&#39; response to his question, though exceedingly&#0160;laconic,&#0160;is far scarier than anything the most computer-aided-pixelbending&#0160;horror movie&#0160;could produce. They simply say: &quot;A deed without a name.&quot;&#0160;Every member of the audience, and every reader, knows&#0160;that the witches are&#0160;up to no good, but do they know how bad it is?&#0160; No. The audience now learns&#0160;that what the witches are doing&#0160;is&#0160;so loathsome that there&#39;s not even a &#0160;word for it in the English language (and Shakespeare, of all people,&#0160;had English&#0160;to spare).&#0160;What could they possibly mean by&#0160;&quot;a deed without a name?&quot;&#0160;Such a deed&#0160;must be superlatively evil, worse than anything that the most depraved reader or listener could possibly guess.&#0160;The immensely suggestive phrase &quot;A deed without a name&quot; pushes&#0160;the limits both of imagination and language.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Another magnificent&#0160;moment comes when Macbeth imagines that Banquo, whom he knows to have been murdered, has taken&#0160;a seat at his&#0160;feast. Macbeth is&#0160;startled and frightened, but he is also indignant -- so indignant that his outrage becomes almost comic. He lapses into&#0160;a reverie.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Blood hath been shed ere now, i&#39; the olden time, <br />Ere human statute purged the gentle weal; <br />Ay, and since too, murders have been perform&#39;d <br />Too terrible for the ear: the times has been, <br />That, when the brains were out, the man would die, <br />And there an end; but now they rise again, <br />With twenty mortal murders on their crowns, <br />And push us from our stools: this is more strange <br />Than such a murder is.</p>
<p>Macbeth asserts&#0160;that it used to be the case, both in olden times, before Scotland became civilized, and even into recent days,&#0160;that there was a natural order to things.&#0160;If you killed a man (&quot;when the brains were out&quot;), that person had the decency to stay dead (&quot;the man would die/ And there an end&quot;).&#0160;But now, in these degenerate times, murdered men return and &quot;push us from our stools.&quot;&#0160;Macbeth, who&#0160;is under the spell of demons and who has committed atrocity after atrocity,&#0160;claims to be more &quot;natural&quot; than the spectre of Banquo, who is &quot;unnatural.&quot;&#0160;In his eyes, killing&#0160;people is the new normal, and&#0160;it goes against the grain when you kill a guy&#0160;and he doesn&#39;t&#0160;stay killed.&#0160;It&#39;s odd and lovely that Macbeth believes that he has a sincere grievance with the world, especially when he&#39;s the one who has thrown things completely out of whack.&#0160;His exasperated complaint shapes itself into a weird, ironic, perverse nostalgia for better days.&#0160;We almost&#0160;-- but not quite --&#0160;feel for him.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>My first twelve years of formal schooling were pretty much a bust.&#0160;I blame my underachieving, unserious&#0160;self.&#0160;I was&#0160;much more interested in&#0160;punchball, the Dodgers,&#0160;comic books, and radio serials than&#0160;in the lessons, which were unchallenging and drab.&#0160;At school I learned reading, writing and &#39;rithmetic, for which I&#39;m grateful, and also&#0160;a little Latin. I was an autodidact, not a student, right out of the gate.&#0160;I liked to read and fortunately the Avenue J branch of the Brooklyn Public Library (though only a storefront)&#0160;was within walking distance;&#0160;so was the McDonald Avenue branch where, during&#0160;high school, I worked for 75 cents an hour shelving books.&#0160;I was an omnivorous reader and although I did not have a strong understanding or much of an imagination, I had an excellent memory.&#0160;Reading saved me.&#0160;Reading rescued me.&#0160;&quot;If it hadn&#39;t been for reading, we&#39;d have been entirely at the mercy of sex.&quot;</p>
<p>I don&#39;t blame my teachers. A few had thrown in the towel, but most of them tried their best. They were overworked, underprepared, unsupported, and in occasional cases prodigiously ignorant even of the subjects they taught. The conditions under which they worked were not propitious. At P. S. 217 classrooms were designed (!!!) for 48 students (pupils, we were called in those days) but on high-attendance days, there were always a few unenthusiastic kids lolling in improvised seats by the window. In most classes, lessons were taught; but in others, especially at Erasmus Hall High School, there was only disorder and hubbub -- and sometimes a tad of danger.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>My first grade teacher, Mrs. Callery was a diminutive gloomy woman. I remember telling my mother, &quot;Mrs. Callery doesn&#39;t like me.&quot; My mother said, &quot;You must be kind to her. She lost four of her boys in the war&quot; (it was 1944). I remember that I construed &quot;lost&quot; to mean &quot;misplaced&quot; and was therefore dumbfounded by Mrs. Callery&#39;s forgetfulness. White-haired Mrs. Sherwood, in third grade, left no impression except for her extreme old age (possibly 55), but Mrs. Cares (Sarah Cares!!, great name for a teacher) was quite kind. Mrs. Finsmith in fifth was a cipher, but Mrs. Donnelly, whose white hair was dyed a radiant blue, made it her business to make life as miserable as possible for me, and succeeded. My favorite teacher in those early years was extra-strict Mrs. McNulty, who insisted that we memorize fractions, decimals, and percentages, and taught us how to format a &quot;friendly letter.&quot; In seventh grade, we went &quot;departmental.&quot; I remember Mr. Harry Shapiro (&#39;the bald headed hero&quot;) who spoke of &quot;we scientists&quot;; Mrs. Georgia Kieselbach, an aloof music teacher who had a trained operatic mezzo; Mr. Maxwell Proshan, a pathetic incompetent, and the twin (as I remember them) art teachers, Mrs. Nellis and Mrs. Ennis. At Erasmus Hall, I had good instruction in Latin from old Miss Beulah Withee and even older Mr. Gabriel Cussen (who I now realize must have been an ex-priest) but bad lazy non-teaching from Harry Wedeck, a pretentious fake. Miss Edna Goetschius, a biology teacher, complained to me more than once that I didn&#39;t know how to stipple. Mr. Lindlar, an ineffectual physics teacher, would mysteriously disappear between classes and return reeking of alcohol. My mathematics teachers were competent (Mr. Ebersman), angry as all shit (Mrs. Altschul), or suicidal (Mrs. Bonime). An English teacher who was well-read and competent, Mrs. Harriet Felder, was an &quot;Oxfordian&quot; caught up in the conspiracy theory that Shakespeare wasn&#39;t Shakespeare. Walter Balletto, who whiled away our time teaching &quot;Discussion English,&quot; was more interested in his own theatricality than in any instruction he might have rendered. I later learned that he lived with his mother and collected Kirsten Flagstad records, information which my 1950s self could not even begin to assimilate. I remember also an art teacher, Mrs. Schauben, who kept her protruding ears in check with a thin rubber band; perhaps we weren&#39;t supposed to notice, but I&#39;ve never forgotten. The gym teachers were simple-minded jokesters, although I remember thinking even then that the martinet Mr. Eis would have been more at home in the SS than at EHHS.&#0160;</p>
<p>It was, in retrospect, quite a zoo. But I know that some of my coevals, who were smart enough to choose their teachers wisely and take it all seriously,&#0160;managed to get themselves a decent education. I didn&#39;t; my only success was to get out alive and then move on.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a good picture of Erasmus Hall High School in the old days. A Gothic pile.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Our understanding of the human brain is mighty slim.&#0160; As a consequence our therapies for insanity, for head injuries, and for dementia are primitive.</p>
<p>When John Donne was dying in 1633, his physicians tied pigeons to his feet.&#0160;Present-day medicine&#0160;offers remedies for Alzheimer&#39;s sufferers&#0160;that are&#0160;no more effective than pigeon tying. Brainwise,&#0160;we linger in the dark ages (which, by the way, has now been rebranded as &quot;late antiquity&quot;). Or the early medieval period.</p>
<p>Not to say that nothing is known about the brain.&#0160;There have been advances.</p>
<p>To bring myself up-to-date, I read <em>The Tell-Tale Brain </em>by V. S. Ramachandran, a book which has been making a stir in pop-science circles.&#0160;Ramachandran&#39;s sensible thesis is that there are structures in the human brain that are either undeveloped or that simply&#0160;don&#39;t exist in&#0160;the brains of apes. To posit so is simply common sense. Human beings do things that apes don&#39;t: they study themselves in the mirror,&#0160;they compose and play&#0160;piano sonatas, and they think about their place in the universe.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Ramachandran is an ingenious experimenter&#0160;but he gets beyond his depth when he waxes philosophical -- which he does far too often.&#0160;Here&#39;s an example&#0160;of the kind of thinking that&#0160;rubs me wrong.</p>
<p>&quot;I get chills,&quot; says Ramachandran,&#0160;&quot;whenever I hear Macbeth&#39;s immortal soliloquy&#0160;&#39;Out out, brief candle!/Life&#39;s but a walking shadow, a poor player/&#0160;That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,/&#0160;And then is heard no more.&#0160;It is a tale/&#0160;Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,/&#0160;Signifying nothing.&#39;&quot;&#0160; He says that &quot;these&#0160; words are one of the most profound and deeply moving remarks about life that anyone has ever made!&quot;</p>
<p>I don&#39;t question Ramachandran&#39;s chills, which are his own business, but I&#39;m bothered by his unthinking&#0160;Bardolatry (&quot;immortal solilquy&quot;; &quot;profound&quot;;&#0160; &quot;that anyone has ever made&quot;).&#0160; Poor Will doesn&#39;t need any more&#0160;reverent cliches to be shoveled upon him. He&#39;s already buried under heaps of them.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Bardolatry such as Ramachandran&#39;s obstructs thinking.&#0160;What does it mean to say that Macbeth&#39;s soliloquy is &quot;profound... about life?&quot;&#0160; Let&#39;s go to the tape.</p>
<p>When Macbeth says these words, he&#39;s under the spell of the&#0160;witches, who are &quot;instruments of darkness.&quot;&#0160; At their suggestion, he&#39;s murdered his king, murdered his closest friend Banquo and Banquo&#39;s son Fleance, and he&#39;s &quot;savagely slaughtered&quot; Macduff&#39;s wife and children (&quot;All my pretty ones...&#0160; All my pretty chickens and their dam/&#0160;At one fell swoop&quot;). Moreover,&#0160;he&#39;s committed uncatalogued atrocities&#0160;innumerable: &quot;Each new morn/ New widows howl, new orphans cry.&quot; His brain is &quot;filled with scorpions&quot; and just before he utters the soliloquy that gives Ramachandran the goosebumps, he learns that his wife, burdened&#0160;with guilt, has done herself in. Macbeth is not in a good way.&#0160;</p>
<p>Macbeth is not a role-model and his philosophical ruminations are neither insightful or profound. Quite the opposite.&#0160;Though Macbeth is undeniably eloquent, he&#39;s become a&#0160;shallow nihilist. Life, in fact, is not &quot;a tale told by an idiot&quot; and in Shakespeare&#39;s late-medieval religious universe, only&#0160;someone in the throes of the deepest despair, and certain that he is damned for all eternity, would think so.&#0160;Macbeth has learned exactly the wrong lesson.&#0160;So, apparently, has Ramachandran.</p>
<p>Gosh, great literature can sometimes be dangerous, can&#39;t it?</p>
<p>It&#39;s no secret that&#0160;the universe with its billions and billions of galaxies will go on very well without us.&#0160; Shakespeare, like everyone else, knew&#0160;that when looked at from the strictly scientific point of view, human beings are&#0160;no more than&#0160;&quot;many a thousand grains/ That issue out of dust.&quot;&#0160; But just because we&#39;re tiny and it&#39;s enormous, we&#39;re not&#0160;compelled&#0160;to admire the despairing and empty philosphy to which Macbeth subscribes.</p>
<p>Not while there are red wheelbarrows, winter love in dark corners,&#0160;and &quot;little nameless, unremembered acts/ Of kindness and of love.&quot;&#0160;</p>

				<p>I don&#39;t like gore.&#0160;I’m the kind of person who won’t recklessly channel-surf for fear that the changer gizmo will maliciously lock onto our 24/7 surgery channel, where some poor soul&#39;s innards will be on garish hi-def display, And yet, despite my squeamishness, I steeled myself and read right through Katrina Firlik&#39;s <em>Another Day in the Frontal Lobe</em>,&#0160; which is a young neurosurgeon’s bildungs-autobiography. Of course, I allowed myself the indulgence of zooming through some of the more gruesome parts.&#0160;How much does a guy need to know about maggot infestations in the living brain?</p>
<p>I’m grateful to Firlik for her vivid stories, for the occasional moment of black humor and also for offering a forthright glimpse into an alternative world.&#0160;Nevertheless, I&#39;m sorry to report, <em>Another Day </em>is not a good book.&#0160;It&#39;s too transparently a package shaped by agent and editor for short-term commercial appeal. The author is so anxious to be cute and to be loved –- she must have been one of those front-row, admiring-eyes-glued-to-the-professor straight-A pupils -- that whenever she comes up against a controversial topic, such as the irrational funding of our medical system or the egomania of surgeons or the morality of expensive, hopeless last-minute-before-dying&#0160;surgical interventions, she hints at concern but then swerves and punts.&#0160;She doesn&#39;t want to offend a single potential buyer.</p>
<p>Not a courageous writer, she is not an admirable being either: what can one say about a highly-skilled professional who turns down job after job in the American hinterland and elects to live in New Canaan, Connecticut, because, she admits, it would be impossible to find a good Japanese restaurant in the sticks?, and who in one sentence notes that her rich town has more neurosurgeons than all of sub-Sahara Africa and in another reveals that she works on spines rather than brains nowadays because spines are more lucrative.</p>
<p>Hey, Katrina, the next time you publish something, sacrifice some of that royalty money and write directly from your heart (even though it&#39;s one cold and stony organ).&#0160;</p>
<p>Readers of this blague will not be surprised to learn that Dr. M. was much intrigued by the book&#39;s medical vocabulary.&#0160;<em>Another Day </em>serves up a feast of beautiful and exotic words:&#0160;venous infarct, dura, spicule, rongeur, neuroma, glioma, glioblastoma (you don’t want one!), bone dust, debulk, pachygyria. The ugliest of all: intubated.&#0160; My personal favorite, and a word that I&#39;ve now put in the running for Word of the Year: bezoar.</p>
<p>How could I have lived all these years without knowing the wonderful word bezoar?&#0160; Could there be a surer index of my ignorance of medicine?&#0160;A bezoar, as everyone but me seems to know, is a concretion of indigestible stuff stuck somewhere in the digestive tract – hairballs, medicines, bits of food. Sometimes they can be dissolved, but on occasions they can only be removed by surgery. A bezoar was formerly thought to be a magical antidote for poisons –- so score another couple of strikes against our ignorant superstitious ancestors. The most common kind of bezoar is the phytobezoar, which is a collection of lignin, cellulose, or tannin of food fibers.&#0160;Common sources are&#0160;celery, grapes, raisins, prunes, and pumpkins, all of which, if you’re like me, you’ve probably unwittingly eaten without having given a thought to their bezoar-potential and therefore neglected a splendid opportunity for hypochondria.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>A bezoar caused by eating persimmons (an especially dangerous fruit, bezoarwise), earns its very own word-- diospyrobezoar -- an odd amalgam of Greek and Persian linguistic roots and a word which, just as soon as a suitable opening arises, I intend to enthusiastically insinuate into the conversation.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><em>Act of Violence</em>&#0160;(1948) says as much about the immediate post-war years&#0160;(and my own first decade of life) as any film I know.&#0160;In it, an ex-army-officer who survived a German POW camp has acquired a pretty wife and a sunny suburban California home, but he is&#0160;guilt-ridden&#0160;because&#0160;while in the camp&#0160;he betrayed his&#0160;fellow prisoners.&#0160;He&#39;s pursued by a revenge-obsessed&#0160;former comrade.&#0160;The film is not, for once, a melodrama.&#0160; Good and evil, innocence and experience&#0160;intermingle in the main characters, and, most rewardingly,&#0160;in&#0160;the smaller parts.&#0160;Mary Astor (otherwise Brigid O&#39;Shaughnessy in&#0160;<em>The Maltese Falcon</em>) turns in a brilliant performance as a tired, opportunistic but ultimately decent prostitute.&#0160;In fact, women&#0160;in this film (in addition to Mary Astor, Janet Leigh and Phyllis Thaxter) are for once as complex and cliche-free&#0160;as the male leads (Van Heflin and the always pitch-perfect Robert Ryan).</p>
<p>The story-telling is flawless and economical, the mood is sombre and intense.&#0160;The unsettling themes are the burden of the past,&#0160;the menace of the future, trepidation at the unknown, and the expiation of guilt.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Robert L. Richards, who wrote&#0160;the spare screenplay, was fingered as a leftist and blacklisted.&#0160;He lost his promising career, became a carpenter,&#0160;and died, embittered, in exile.&#0160;is it necessary to note&#0160;that&#0160;A<em>ct of Violence</em> is a not the least bit subversive?&#0160; It&#39;s a genuinely patriotic film.&#0160;Fred Zinnemann, the director, escaped from&#0160;the Nazis but left both his parents behind.&#0160;They&#0160;were murdered in the camps.&#0160;Zinnemann was therefore superbly&#0160;positioned&#0160;to bring to the screen an exploration of the &quot;guilt of the survivor.&quot;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>We watched <em>The Next Three Days </em>because we admired Paul Haggis&#39;s two previous films -- <em>Crash </em>and <em>In the Valley of Elah.&#0160;</em>This one is not quite as innovative,&#0160;but it&#39;s worth watching and is definitely&#0160;the second-best English teacher movie ever made in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (<em>Wonder Boys,&#0160;</em>based on the Michael Chabon novel, is more engaging&#0160;and original).&#0160;&#0160;The story, in brief, is that a woman is erroneously convicted of murder, her appeals fail, she&#39;s in for life, but&#0160;her husband breaks her out of jail.</p>
<p>The plot is hard to swallow, and is told with&#0160;so much intercutting of pursuers and pursued,&#0160;red-herring clues, and car chases that it sometime seems like a Bourne adventure.&#0160;But it&#39;s also an endearing&#0160;family values film -- husband and wife and kid all cocooned up in the last scene.&#0160;&#0160;Elizabeth Banks is beautiful and expressionless and Russell Crowe is merely expressionless, but they&#39;re&#0160;sweetly devoted to one another.&#0160;I fell for it, perhaps because&#0160;I just don&#39;t see all that many&#0160;togetherness thrillers.</p>
<p>In Hollywoodland,&#0160;90% of English teachers are rigid, authoritarian jerks who don&#39;t appreciate the brilliance of their eccentric students (who&#0160;will grow up to become successful script-writers), and exactly 9% are charismatic and inspiring but&#0160;a bit dangerous (Jean Brodie for example).&#0160;Rare indeed is the English teacher who&#0160;outwits the cops, kills a couple of the bad guys&#0160;who get in his way,&#0160;and&#0160;makes it safely to Venezuela.&#0160;Cop # 1 (with admiration):&#0160;&quot;This&#0160;guy&#39;s a teacher?&quot;&#0160; Cop # 2:&#0160; &quot;Yeah, at a community college.&quot;</p>
<p>In the mandatory theme-enhancing classroom scene, our hero lectures on&#0160;<em>Don</em>&#0160;<em>Quixote</em>.&#0160; As in quixotic.&#0160;Get it?&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>It&#39;s election season once again.&#0160;I&#39;m thinking of making a run for city council in our progressive western town. Here&#39;s my revised&#0160;platform, voters.&#0160; &#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>1.&#0160; NO LEAF BLOWERS.&#0160; Rationale: it&#39;s a horrible noisy unecological machine that can easily be replaced with a broom.&#0160;And everyone knows that single-stroke engines are major polluters.</p>
<p>2.&#0160; ALL MALL PERFORMERS MUST BE JURIED.&#0160;Rationale:&#0160;no more off-key singing.&#0160;No more bad juggling.&#0160; No more ugly balloon animals.&#0160;No more noisy drummers or whining didgeredoos.</p>
<p>3.&#0160; EVERY RESTAURANT MUST KEEP A PIG.&#0160;Rationale:&#0160;a perfect, ecologically-sound solution to the waste food problem.&#0160;Come to think of it, let&#39;s require a piggery of all institutions with lunchrooms, such as high schools and hospitals.&#0160;Let&#39;s fatten up those porkers, turn them into bacon and savory spare ribs.&#0160;</p>
<p>4.&#0160; NO &quot;HOLIDAY&quot; LIGHTS.&#0160;Rationale:&#0160;waste of electricity and other scarce resources.&#0160;Global warming. Bad taste.&#0160;Bad theology.&#0160;Bauble-olatry.&#0160;</p>
<p>5.&#0160; NEW ANNUAL HOLIDAY:&#0160;Charles Darwin&#39;s birthday, February 12.&#0160;Rationale: uncontroversial celebration of a great thinker.&#0160;(I reject out of hand those extremists who propose to celebrate Darwin&#39;s birthday on December 25.&#0160;I&#39;m a uniter, not a divider.)</p>
<p>6.&#0160; NO MUSIC WRITTEN AFTER 1897.&#0160;Rationale:&#0160;obvious.&#0160;Why 1897?&#0160; Death of Johannes Brahms. Also, no amplified music of any kind in an automobile that is audible outside the vehicle.&#0160;Higher fines and jail terms hip hop and for excessively patriotic &quot;country.&quot;&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>7.&#0160; NO SMOKERS.&#0160; Rationale:&#0160; lung cancer, heart attacks, emphysema, ashes, disgusting odor, cigarette litter on the sidewalk.&#0160;Note:&#0160;not &quot;no smoking&quot;-- &quot;no smokers.&quot;&#0160;No going outside of city limits to light up and then re-entering.</p>
<p>8.&#0160; NO VISIBLE TATTOOS.&#0160;Why only &quot;visible &quot;tattoos?&#0160; Because whole-body inspections might be&#0160;considered intrusive by squishy civil libertarians.&#0160;Also, no nose rings, navel rings,&#0160;or other bodily piercings.&#0160;Except earrings.&#0160;I rather like earrings. But no more than&#0160;one per ear.&#0160;</p>
<p>9.&#0160; ANNUAL JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL PRAIRIE DOG SHOOT AND BARBECUE. Let&#0160;them kids exercise their Second Amendment rights;&#0160;eliminate them pesky varmints;&#0160; learn to cook. One platform position, three social benefits.</p>
<p>10. NO DOGS PERMITTED WITHIN CITY LIMITS.&#0160;Rationale:&#0160;fatal dog attacks, dog bites, barking dogs, squealing&#0160;dogs, ubiquitous dog &quot;waste,&quot; dogs carrying on in parks and open space, the goopy indulgence of dog &quot;guardians,&quot;&#0160;the ecological disaster of dog food.&#0160;But what about seeing-eye dogs, you ask?&#0160; Well, that&#39;s a slippery slope, ain&#39;t it.&#0160;Sorry folks, no dogs (except for purposes of vivisection). &#0160;</p>
<p>11.&#0160; NO MORE COLLEGE FOOTBALL.&#0160;Rationale:&#0160;I don&#39;t like college football.</p>
<p>12.&#0160; NO &quot;FACILITATORS&quot; WITH WHITEBOARDS OR FLIPCHARTS AT&#0160;MEETINGS.&#0160;Goodness gracious, am I ever tired of those things.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>That&#39;s about it.&#0160;I feel that I have my finger on the pulse of the electorate.&#0160;It&#39;s going to be a landslide.&#0160;Tell me that life won&#39;t be better as soon as we enact these new laws</p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2011/05/reposted-philip-roths-pseudo-pastoral.html">Reposted: Philip Roth's Pseudo-Pastoral</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>A couple of years&#0160;ago, when I had journeyed through roughly half of his writings, I made some preliminary <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2007/12/interim-report.html">observations</a> about the fictional world invented by Philip Roth. In the course of discussion, I advanced two hypotheses. The first was that Roth hated children, whom he regarded as encumbrances to male freedom and pleasure. The second is that although Roth had invented a boatload of adult male narcissists, he had not created a single mensch -- a caring, responsible, mature man. In Roth&#39;s vision of the world, I suggested, &quot;only a schmuck would be a mensch.&quot;</p>
<div class="entry-content">
<div class="entry-body">
<p>After a pause for rest and rehabilitation, I&#39;ve now resumed my upriver voyage to the heart of the Rothworld. I&#39;ve just finished reading <em>American Pastoral</em> (1997), a novel set during the difficult, still-controversial Vietnam war. I must boast that my hypotheses about children and menschdom are fully confirmed by the new evidence provided by <em>American Pastoral.&#0160;</em>In this novel, children are indeed hateful, and the mensch who has at last made an appearance is nothing more than a schmeggegy. Roth has given us Seymour &quot;Swede&quot; Levov, an archetypal mensch, and behold, what a poor naive schmuck is he! Levov nurtures everyone he encounters, but Roth works it so that his virtue leads directly to his downfall.&#0160;Poor Swede owns and manages an exemplary factory but he is betrayed by his workers; he&#39;s loyal to Newark, so Newark riots and pillages; he loves and supports his fragile wife only to discover that she&#39;s sleeping with his friend. Most of all, he adores his daughter, unamusingly called Merry, who turns out to be, just as we might expect, a devil child. She screams unaccountably from the moment of birth and stutters through her awkward childhood (Roth seems to think that colic and speech impediments are signs of inherent viciousness).&#0160;At adolescence, Merry transforms into an unhandsome Patty Hearst clone who participates in several senseless but deadly political bombings.&#0160;She then goes underground, only to return secretly in Newark to haunt Levov all the more.&#0160;Under this succession of attacks, Swede Levov&#39;s carefully-crafted menschdom is little-by-little exposed as naive schmuckhood.&#0160;If only Levov had taken the Zuckerman route: love only thyself, fuck &#39;em and forget &#39;em; abort when all else fails.</p>
<p>And now, for the benefit of younger readers, I pause for a few refresher sentences about the historiography of the Vietnamese catastrophe. The significance of this period is highly contested. For those on the left, the war was a foolish attempt to block a peasant uprising against neo-colonialist overlords. The Bundys and Lyndonites and Kissingers squandered fifty thousand American and two million Vietnamese lives (plus moral authority and treasure uncountable).&#0160;Nevertheless, as the left sees it, the war provided an opportunity for heroism:&#0160;for the first time in human history, a free and patriotic people, making use of peaceful assemblies, petitions, political activism, boycotts, and resistance to the draft, succeeded in turning an erring government from its mistaken path.&#0160;On the other hand, the right wing knows an entirely different Vietnam war.&#0160;For conservatives, the war against communism was lost because squishy liberals lost their nerve. Conservatives remember only the excesses of the anti-war movement: the culture of drugs, the sexual freedom, the violence, and of course, the bombings.</p>
<p><em>American Pastoral </em>is firmly of the right-hand file. Roth has performed a amazing piece of legerdemain.&#0160; He has written about the period of Vietnam, but he has omitted (or suppressed) both the atrocities of the war and the organized, largely peaceful opposition to it. In <em>American Pastoral</em>, resistance is not political but personal.&#0160;It&#39;s embodied in Swede&#39;s daughter Merry Levov, who is vacant, violent, angry and disgusting.&#0160;By stripping the novel of its historical context and coloration, Roth reduces the opposition to the war to an oedipal conflict between a demon child and her well-meaning but ineffectual father.The novel lacks even the decent ambiguity that Roth might have created if he had given Levov other and perhaps more reasonable children. But it&#39;s a good guess&#0160;that in a novel by Philip Roth, more children would have led not to a widening of focus or to a richer novel, but only to more tsouris.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a shame that so skillful an artist (and one who is not generally a right-winger) has written a novel that&#39;s only inches away from neocon propaganda.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef01538eb1a2c0970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Drood" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef01538eb1a2c0970b" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef01538eb1a2c0970b-800wi" title="Drood" /></a>&#0160;<br />I can&#39;t remember when I last read <em>The Mystery of Edwin Drood</em>, but I&#39;m certain that it was before 1997.&#0160; It was in that year that I passed the age that Dickens had attained when he left our planet, leaving Drood undone.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>This time, I&#0160;read <em>Drood </em>with a sense of Impending Doom.&#0160;I think&#0160;it&#39;s because Dickens died far too young -- in the prime of his age.&#0160; Not, however,&#0160;in the prime of his&#0160;genius&#0160; -- although one never knows&#0160;what he would have produced if he had lived to his&#0160;allotted three score and ten.&#0160;The novel struck me as a tired and eneravated performance.&#0160;&#0160;Too many of&#0160;the characters are recycled&#0160;from the&#0160;Dickens repertory company, the humor is too strenuous, the clues and&#0160;the red-herrings too obviously contrived.&#0160; It&#39;s only very near the moment of truncation,&#0160;when the splendid Mrs. Billicken makes her appearance, that&#0160;the novel feels inspired in the&#0160;old Dickens way.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>I also read in sadness.&#0160;When&#0160;we commit to reading a long,&#0160;densely plotted novel,&#0160;we&#0160;take it for granted that all its mysteries will&#0160;eventually be resolved.&#0160;&#0160;Such is the bargain that the novelist makes with his readers.&#0160;But this novel is different, because Dickens didn&#39;t make it to the end.&#0160;And so, we read it always tentatively, knowing that&#0160;its&#0160;mysteries will remain mysteries forever and ever.&#0160;So this time, alas,&#0160;<em>Drood </em>was a <em>memento mori -- </em>and goodness gracious, I already have enough of those.&#0160;</p>
