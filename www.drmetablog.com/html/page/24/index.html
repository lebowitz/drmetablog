		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>In 1895, my wise and courageous grandparents left the abysmal, backward Ukraine and struck out for the new world. Nine years later, my father was born in a cold-water flat in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn.&#0160;The date of his birth: December 22, 1904, exactly at the winter solstice. &quot;And they called his name, Emanuel, God with us.&quot; If he had been born in the old country, before the Russian authorities imposed legal cognomina upon us, he would have been named Emanuel ben Isaiah -- his father&#39;s name appended to his own as a patronymic.</p>
<p>Despite his traditional moniker and his commitment to the essence of Judaism, my father was fiercely hostile to the irrationalities of religion. His view -- and my grandfather Isaiah&#39;s even more strongly -- was that for a thousand years our lineage had been kept in poverty and darkness not just by the czars and the Cossacks but also by the rabbis.&#0160;In politics&#0160;my father and grandfather began as socialists and became New Dealers; in philosophy, they rejected theological doctrine and were among the children of the Enlightenment whom Moses Mendelssohn had led to the promised land of evidence and reason.&#0160;I doubt that any of my ancestors knew Karl Marx&#39;s sentence that &quot;the criticism of religion is the beginning of all criticism,&quot; but they spoke and acted as though such wisdom had been absorbed&#0160;from the cradle.&#0160;My brothers and I were taught to resist the exclusivity, superstition, and ceremony and especially the triumphalism of religion.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>We now have a religious controversy in our peaceful, progressive, and largely secular western town.&#0160;A group of orthodox Jews have petitioned the city council for permission to construct an <em>eruv</em>.&#0160;What is an <em>eruv</em>? It’s a “symbolic boundary that allows orthodox Jews to carry things, including their own children, outside their home during the Sabbath.&quot; (Carrying is considered work, and orthodoxy&#39;s strict interpretation of religious law prohibits sabbatical labor.) A latter-day <em>eruv </em>is constructed out of fishing line that is strung on utility poles; curiously, it may incorporate functioning electric and telephone wires. If you&#39;re within the lines, you&#39;re &quot;in&quot; your home.</p>
<p>I know that my forbears detested <em>eruvim </em>and similar expressions of irrational piety.&#0160;I myself am not enraged by these useless but harmless superstitions.&#0160;Constructing an <em>eruv </em>does not endanger our species; it&#39;s not like opposing contraception or prohibiting stem-cell research. An <em>eruv </em>consoles the believers and doesn&#39;t much bother the rest of us. Yet if there is a spirit in the sky, which I very much doubt, I would hope that he would not be so small-minded as to issue ukases about carrying infants on Saturdays; infants should be carried as much as they want, which is just about everywhere and always. And if the god of Abraham and Isaac has become so narrow as to promulgate an inside/outside-the-home rule, I would also hope that he would be intelligent enough not to be flummoxed by such transparent trickery as hanging mylar filament on poles.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>I have no intuitive conception of god, but I think that the orthodox trivialize our human and shared longing for transcendence when they sanctify such petty practices.&#0160;It would be far more pious for the orthodox to take every nickel spent to appease the Ancient of Days and bestow it on a poor Jewish family from Tashkent.&#0160;If the eruvim-makers&#0160;can&#39;t locate eligible Jews, there are Hondurans and Sudanese a-plenty who deserve their attention. When the believers&#0160;re-direct their enthusiasm and their resources toward truly charitable enterprises, they will honor the universal immigrant experience and they will also practice the very worthy Jewish virtue of compassion.&#0160;The effort spent to construct&#0160;an eruv is a foolish waste of time.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s my father&#39;s view:&#0160; &quot;It took us hundreds of years to fight our way out of the ghetto and they want to put themselves back in jail. If the rabbis had their way,&quot; he would say, &quot;Mahler and Bernstein and Gershwin would play accordion in a klezmer band in Bialystok, Einstein would balance the books for a caftan maker in Kiev, and a hundred and fifty Jewish Nobel Prize winners would squander their intelligence davening in a dismal Vilna synagogue.&quot;</p>
<p>I think it’s in a Wallace Markfield novel that an old Jewish guy confronts a group of twenty-something Jewish hippies/slackers in Miami Beach.&#0160;After a heated discussion, he admonishes them:&#0160; &quot;And don&#39;t ever be ashamed that you’re Jewish.&#0160;It’s enough that I’m ashamed that you’re Jewish.&quot;</p>
<p>Which is pretty much how I feel about the <em>eruvistas</em>.&#0160; Well, not exactly ashamed.&#0160; Embarrassed, perhaps, by their superstitious infatuation with the &quot;dark backward and abysm of time.&quot;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>The &quot;neo-noir&quot; film <em>Shattered&#0160;</em>(1991) was directed by&#0160;Wolfgang Petersen, who elicited&#0160;a mumble-mouth performance by Tom Berenger and an incoherent one from Greta Scacchi.&#0160;It&#39;s another&#0160;in the <a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2011/03/random-harvest-amnesia.html" target="_self">endless parade</a>&#0160;of&#0160;<a href=" http://www.drmetablog.com/2011/01/amnesia-in-films-the-bourne-identity.html" target="_self">amnesia movies</a>.&#0160;In this variant,&#0160;the central character, Dan Merrick, goes over the cliff in his Mercedes&#0160;and emerges not only disfigured but, it seems, without&#0160;the least knowledge of his own person or past. The film clearly demonstrates that movie amnesia can be just as flexible as a tricky plot demands. Amnesia in <em>Shattered</em> has nothing to do with&#0160;the real human brain and its&#0160;gesture to the facts of existence&#0160; is mighty perfunctory.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>DOCTOR&#0160;(authoritative, bearded): &quot;We call it psychogenic amnesia. Patient doesn&#39;t know his name, his family, his personal history.&#0160;Everything else he remembers. The&#0160;year, who&#39;s president.&#0160;He can drive a car, he can function professionally, but anything personal is out of reach.&quot;</p>
<p>And now&#0160;the gimmick (major spoiler coming up, so if you plan&#0160;to see the movie [which I cannot recommend], please&#0160;avert your innocent eyes). Not only does Dan Merrick not remember anything of his pre-accident past, he&#39;s not even Dan Merrick! &#0160;He&#39;s Judth Merrick&#39;s lover, Jack Stanton, transformed by plastic surgery into a simulacrum of Dan.&#0160;And he doesn&#39;t have the least clue that he&#39;s someone else.&#0160;</p>
<p>There&#39;s a exceedingly complicated plot which involves voluntary and involuntary impersonations,&#0160;a&#0160;private investigator out of Cliche Central, two&#0160;murders and three car crashes.&#0160;The incredible upshot is that the villain (the temptress-wife) is killed and that Jack permanently assumes the role of Dan.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Jack&#39;s&#0160;amnesia is cured in the last scene, but not before it has been mysteriously promulgated among&#0160; his&#0160;friends, acquaintances, and business associates,&#0160;all of whom are utterly deceived&#0160;by the plastic surgery and seem not to notice that there have also been&#0160;changes to&#0160;his voice, his walk, his&#0160;manner, and&#0160;his personality.&#0160;These poor folks&#0160;suffer from a devastating&#0160;manifestation of Hollywoodish&#0160;forgetfulness.&#0160;It could be&#0160;called &quot;contact amnesia.&quot;&#0160;An&#0160;absurd idea, but not more absurd than the plot of <em>Shattered.&#0160;</em></p>

				<p><a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef01538e8162d8970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Erasmus" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef01538e8162d8970b" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef01538e8162d8970b-800wi" title="Erasmus" /></a>&#0160;<br />&quot;Phoebe,&quot; she calls herself, but in the script she&#39;s just &quot;girl.&quot;&#0160;It&#39;s&#0160;the&#0160;last scene&#0160;of Joseph L. Mankiewicz&#39;s (Stuyvesant &#39;24)&#0160;<em>All about Eve</em>. &quot;Phoebe&quot; has sneaked into Eve Harrington&#39;s hotel room and has pretended to fall asleep. Eve accosts her and is about to call the police when the intruderess proclaims herself a fan of the actress. Here&#39;s their conversation:&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;GIRL&#0160;You know the Eve Harrington clubs - that they&#39;ve got in most of the girls&#39; high schools?<br /><br />EVE I&#39;ve heard of them.<br /><br />GIRL Ours was one of the first. Erasmus Hall. I&#39;m the president.<br /><br />EVE Erasmus Hall. That&#39;s in Brooklyn, isn&#39;t it?<br /><br />GIRL Lots of actresses come from Brooklyn. Barbara Stanwyck, Susan Hayward - of course, they&#39;re just movie stars.&quot;<br /><br />Phoebe might also have mentioned that both Barbara Stanwyck (Ruby Stevens) and Susan Hayward (Edythe Marrener) were not only from Brooklyn, but also from Erasmus Hall High School. Why doesn&#39;t she say so? Or is being a native of Brooklyn disability enough?&#0160;</p>
<p>Phoebe might have added to her list and mentioned that Mae West was also an alumna of the same high school. Cheers to Erasmus Hall, mother of actresses -- even though Erasmus&#39;s Barbra Streisand &#39;59 was still in braces and still in P. S. something or other when <em>All about Eve</em> was being exhibited at the Leader Theater on Coney Island Avenue.</p>
<p>Supposed Erasmian &quot;Phoebe&quot; was played by the young Barbara Bates, who was highly credible as an upwardly mobile Brooklynite. Her small part includes an iconic moment when, in the film&#39;s last scene, she appears in full narcissistic glory, preening in front of a triptych of mirrors as she tries on Eve&#39;s clothes. She is reflected in multiple, infinitely regressing fragments. Bates, a native of Denver, Colorado, did not, alas, live up to her early promise, but soon after the completion of this film fell into bouts of insanity that came to an end only when she took her own life in 1959.&#0160;</p>
<p>But why Erasmus?&#0160; Because its graduates had achieved a reputation for fierce ambition? Perhaps, but also because Erasmus (as Mankiewicz would well have known) was even more provincial -- as only the outer boroughs of New York can be provincial -- than Eve Harrington&#39;s childhood Wisconsin. &quot;Phoebe&quot; is another Eve and equally naive and countrified. She&#39;s a doppelganger on deck, a secret sharer <em>in ovo, </em>a Mr Hyde in the making; she&#39;s also defensive, megalomaniacal, unsophisticated, slightly loony, and ruthless. And so it was an excellent decision to root her in EHHS, where at least 20% of the students, if I remember correctly, had almost exactly the same traits of character.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>

				<p>Rajan Rondo is knocked down by Dwayne Wade and falls awkwardly dislocating his left elbow.&#0160; Even though it&#39;s gruesome, the&#0160;tape is repeated over and over again. We see Rondo&#39;s arm bend backwards and we see him writhe in pain.</p>
<p>Jeff Van Gundy:&#0160; &quot;It&#39;s horrible.&#0160;I can&#39;t watch.&quot;</p>
<p>Mark Jackson (a Brooklynite who doesn&#39;t like Van Gundy):&#0160; &quot;You can&#39;t look?&#0160; I always wondered where you were from.&#0160; Now I know.&#0160; You&#39;re from the suburbs.&quot;</p>
<p>Later, Rondo returns and heroically plays the fourth period with just one working arm.&#0160;</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><em>The New York&#0160;Time</em>s says&#0160;that former employees of Wells Fargo admit&#0160;that they &quot;systematically singled out blacks in Baltimore and suburban Maryland for high-interest subprime mortgages.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;&quot;These loans,&quot; Baltimore officials have claimed in a federal lawsuit against Wells Fargo, &quot;tipped hundreds of homeowners into foreclosure and cost the city tens of millions of dollars in taxes and city services.&quot;&#0160; Why did the bank act with such malice?&#0160; Because Wells Fargo &quot;saw the black community as fertile ground for subprime mortgages, as working-class blacks were hungry to be a part of the nation’s home-owning mania. Loan officers pushed customers who could have qualified for prime loans into subprime mortgages.&#0160;Wells Fargo employees picturesquely identified these transactions&#0160;as&#0160;&quot;ghetto loans&quot; made to&#0160;“mud people.”&#0160;</p>
<p>The city of Baltimore has filed a suit against Wells Fargo.&#0160;&#0160;&quot;The toll taken by such policies, Baltimore officials argue, &quot;is terrible. Data released by the city as part of the suit show that more than half the properties subject to foreclosure on a Wells Fargo loan from 2005 to 2008 now stand vacant. And 71 percent of those are in predominantly black neighborhoods.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#39;s called reverse redlining -- systematically marketing the most expensive and onerous loans to black customers.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>So here&#39;s the deal.&#0160; The city of Baltimore loses, the neighborhoods lose, individual families are financially crippled for a lifetime, and the CEO of Wells Fargo gets a 50% raise to $21,000,000 a year.&#0160;What a deal!&#0160;</p>
<p>What&#39;s going to happen to the suit?&#0160; It was filed in January, 2008.&#0160; Three years later, after a predictable spate&#0160;of legal wrangling, a federal judge has allowed the suit to go forward, but not before Wells Fargo &quot;succeeded in limiting the pretrial discovery the city has been able to get and in limiting the allegations and damages the city could claim if the case makes it to trial.&quot; A bank spokeswoman said Wells Fargo will “continue to defend ourselves vigorously.”</p>
<p>Here&#39;s what&#39;s going to happen.&#0160;The bank, which has far greater resources that the city, &#0160;will assign a couple of hundred lawyers to the case and wear down&#0160;Baltimore with various hair-splitting motions.&#0160;&#0160;Judges will retire and/or die. The case will be in the courts for an unknown number of Jarndyce and Jarndyce units of time.&#0160;After a generation or so,&#0160;when&#0160;most of the aggrieved will have long since left the earth,&#0160;Wells Fargo will settle for a slap on the wrist and pay a nominal fine, but admit to no guilt.&#0160;The bank will trumpet its vindication. Justice will not be served.&#0160; It will be bought.&#0160;</p>

<p>Can we possibly&#0160;imagine what will have happened to the many thousandes of&#0160;no-longer-occupied houses and to their one time oh-so hopeful purchasers?&#0160; Nothing good, trust me.&#0160;</p>

				<p>Why did the moron throw the clock out of the window?&#0160; Because he wanted to see time fly.&#0160;&amp;&amp;&amp;&#0160; How do you say &quot;refrigerator&quot; in Italian?&#0160; Ice-a box. &amp;&amp;&amp; Why do fireman wear read suspenders?&#0160; To hold their pants up. &amp;&amp;&amp; Knock-knock.&#0160;Who&#39;s there?&#0160; Anita.&#0160;Anita who?&#0160; Anita borrow a pencil. &amp;&amp;&amp;&#0160;&#0160;&quot;Over the Cliff&quot; by Hugo Furst. &#39;The Russian Surgeon&#39;s Revenge&quot; by I.

The friend&#0160;has a black eye and a&#0160;bloody nose.&#0160;&quot;What happened to you?&#0160; &quot;Guy beat me up.&quot; &quot;Why?&quot;&#0160; &quot;I don&#39;t know. I was looking for hotel I&#39;m supposed to stay&#0160;at, and I came upon this man&#0160;lying on top of a woman.&#0160;I asked him, how far is the Olde Log inn and he jumped up and hit me.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;&amp;&amp;&amp;&#0160;&#0160;Horse wants to try out for the Dodgers.&#0160;Leo Durocher says, sure he&#39;s a horse but the Dodgers are&#0160;in the dumps; let&#39;s see what he can do. &quot;Can you throw?&quot; Horse picks up a ball, walks to the pitching mound, and throws a 105 mile fastball right down the middle of the plate. &quot;Can you hit?&quot; Horse picks up a bat and steps to the plate.&#0160;On the first swing, he hits a tremendous line drive off the scoreboard in right field. &quot;Run,&quot; says Durocher.&#0160;&quot;Run,&quot; says the horse. &quot;Why do you think I&#39;m here? &#0160;If I could run I&#39;d be at Hialeah.&quot;&#0160;&amp;&amp;&amp; Man is knocked down by a bus. He&#39;s lying in the road, bleeding to death. A friend comes by, says, Solly, how&#0160;you doink? Solly says, &quot;I make a living.&quot; &amp;&amp;&amp;&#0160; Truman, Churchill, and Stalin are driving in a car down a narrow road.&#0160;There&#39;s a cow in the middle of the road, blocking the way.&#0160;Churchill gets out of the car, waves his hands and screams at the cow, but he can&#39;t get it to budge.&#0160;Truman gets out, picks up a stick and starts beating the cow.&#0160;It still won&#39;t move.&#0160;Stalin gets out, walks up to the cow and whispers something into the cow&#39;s ear.&#0160;The cow bolts and disappears into the woods.&#0160;They get back into the car.&#0160;Truman and Churchill say to Stalin, &quot;What in the world&#0160;did you say to the cow to get her to run like that.&#0160;Stalin says, &quot;I told her I&#39;d put her on a collective farm.&quot; &amp;&amp;&amp; Man is in a nightclub. Everyone&#39;s singing and dancing. He gets an urge to take a dump. Can&#39;t find the toilet. He&#39;s having a hard time holding it in. Waiter tells him the bathroom is upstairs.&#0160; He goes up to the next floor, can&#39;t find the toilet. He&#39;s about to explode.Finally he sees a hole in the floor. He squats and lets fly with a tremendous load. He gets dressed, goes downstairs. Everyone has disappeared; no music, no dancing, no drinking. He finds the waiter. &quot;What happened?&quot; Waiter says, &quot;Where were you when the shit hit the fan?&quot;&#0160; &amp;&amp;&amp; The mayor of Muncie, Indiana is scheduled to preside at a ceremony honoring a local girl-made-good now called&#0160;Lolita Lamour, but who grew up in Muncie under the name Flora Faye Fluck.&#0160;But he&#39;s worried that he might mispronounce the name and embarrass himself.&#0160;He practices:&#0160; Flora Faye Fluck.&#0160;Flora Faye Fluck.&#0160; Finally, the big day arrives.&#0160;The mayor&#0160;makes his speech.&#0160;&quot;And here she is, ladies and gentleman, Lolita&#0160;Lamour, known to all of her friends&#0160;here in Muncie as Flora Faye Klunt.&quot;&#0160;&amp;&amp;&amp;&#0160;&#0160;A man&#0160;is walking on&#0160;a beach.&#0160;He comes upon a naked woman lying on the shore.&#0160;He jumps on her, screws her, and continues on his way.&#0160;After a half-a-mile he meets three or four members of&#0160;a&#0160;search party.&#0160;One of them says, &quot;A woman has drowned. Have you seen a dead body on the beach.&quot;&#0160;Man says, &quot;O my god.&#0160;Was she dead?&#0160; I thought she was English.&quot;&#0160; &amp;&amp;&amp;&#0160; A scorpion say to a turtle, &quot;I need to get to the other side of the Dead Sea.&#0160; Let me climb on your back and you swim across.&quot;&#0160; Turtle says, &quot;But if you&#39;re on my back, you could sting me.&quot; Scorpion says, &quot;Why would I do that?&#0160; If I sting you, we&#39;d both drown.&quot; Turtle says, &quot;OK, get on my back.&quot;&#0160; They get to the middle of the Dead Sea, and the scorpion stings the turtle. Turtle says, &quot;Why did you do that?&quot; Scorpion answers, &quot;Because this is the Middle East.&quot; &amp;&amp;&amp;&#0160; An airplane is flying over the Atlantic Ocean.&#0160; Suddenly, the loudspeaker comes on. &quot;This is your pilot.&#0160;If you look out of the window on the right&#0160;side of the plane, you can see smoke coming out of the #1 engine.&#0160;If you look out the left side, you can see flames coming out of the #2 engine.&#0160;Now look down.&#0160;If you look closely, you can see a small life-raft floating&#0160;in the ocean.&#0160;I am speaking to you from that raft.&quot;&#0160;&amp;&amp;&amp; Searching for the meaning of life, a man travels to Tibet,&#0160;climbs the highest mountain,&#0160;comes to a monastery where the wisest man in the world lives.&#0160;He asks the monk, &quot;What is the meaning of life.&quot;&#0160;The monk says, &quot;life ... is a barrel.&quot;&#0160; The man goes back to Cleveland, thinks about it for five years.&#0160;What does it mean, life is a barrel?&#0160; He can&#39;t figure it out, so he gets back on the boat, travels to Tibet, climbs the mountain, finds the monk, and asks him, &quot;What did you mean, life is a barrel.&quot;&#0160;The monk shrugs his shoulders.&#0160;&quot;OK, so life isn&#39;t a barrel.&quot; &amp;&amp;&amp;&#0160; Old guy, maybe a bluesman, bottle of hooch in a brown paper bag, sits on a&#0160;bench in the middle of the night, downtown,&#0160;playing air-sax, nodding.&#0160;Young fellow comes by, cheerful, asks him, &quot;Crosstown buses run&#0160;this way?&quot;&#0160; Blues guy looks&#0160;up, pauses for a second, and then drawls, &quot;Doo--dah, doo-dah.&quot;&#0160;&amp;&amp;&amp; A man, 93, and his wife, 91, go to the rabbi and tell him that they&#39;re miserable and want a divorce.&#0160;The rabbi says, &quot;You&#39;ve been unhappy all these years and you wait seventy years to get a divorce.&#0160;What are you thinking?&quot;&#0160;Man says, &quot;We wanted to wait until the children were all dead.&quot;&#0160; &amp;&amp;&amp;&#0160; &quot;My brain!&#0160; My second favorite organ.&quot; (W. Allen). &amp;&amp;&amp;&#0160; Man goes to the rabbi in distress.&#0160;He says that his wife is trying to poison him.&#0160;&quot;How do you know that?&#0160; &quot;I saw&#0160;her putting stuff in my coffee.&quot;&#0160;Rabbi says, &quot;It&#39;s got to be a mistake.&#0160;I&#39;ll talk to her.&quot;&#0160;Two days later, the rabbi calls him.&#0160;&quot;Your wife came in.&#0160;I talked to her for three hours.Three hours straight I talk to her.&quot;&#0160;&quot;So what&#39;s your advice?&quot; &quot;Drink the poison.&quot;&#0160;&amp;&amp;&amp; Man goes to see his doctor. The doctor says, &quot;I have good news and bad news. The bad news is that you have terminal cancer and you&#39;re going to be dead in a month.&quot; &quot;So what&#39;s the good news.&quot; &quot;Well,&quot; the doctor says, &quot;You see that cute nurse over there. I finally fucked her.&quot; &amp;&amp;&amp; An older guy is walking down the street. He meets a friend and they chat for a few minutes. Man starts to leave, turns back to his friend, and says, &quot;By the way, when we met, was I walking north or south?&quot;&#0160;&quot;You were going south.&quot;&#0160;&quot;Good,&quot; says the guy, &quot;then I&#39;ve already had my &#0160;lunch.&quot; &amp;&amp;&amp; George W. Bush goes for dinner&#0160;at the ADL where he&#39;s served a bowl of matzo ball soup. He looks at it suspiciously, but then, remembering all the strange foods he&#39;s eaten at ceremonial dinners, takes a bite. Not bad.&#0160;He turns to his host: &quot;Tell me,&quot; he says, &quot;do the Jews eat any other part of the matzo, or only the balls?&quot; &amp;&amp;&amp; Two old guys are ritually washing a corpse.The first one says, &quot;Look at the schlong on this guy. He&#39;s a horse.&quot;&#0160;The second guy says, &quot;It&#39;s just like mine.&quot; First guy says, &quot;You have a dong like this.&#0160;I don&#39;t believe it. I&#39;ve never seen anything half&#0160;as large.&quot;&#0160; The second&#0160;guy says, &quot;I said it was like mine.&#0160;I didn&#39;t mean mine was just as large.&#0160; I meant mine is&#0160;just as dead.&quot;&#0160; &amp;&amp;&amp;&#0160; Knock-knock.&#0160; Who&#39;s there?&#0160; &quot;Yo mama.&quot;&#0160; &quot;Yo mama who.&quot;&#0160;&quot;Yo mama.&#0160;This is no joke.&#0160;Open the damn door and let me in.&quot;</p>

				<p><a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef01538e40d2c1970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Holbein philadelphis" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef01538e40d2c1970b" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef01538e40d2c1970b-800wi" title="Holbein philadelphis" /></a></p>
<p>What is this remarkable&#0160;object? It&#39;s a seventeenth-century Turkish rug&#0160;that now resides&#0160;in the Philadelphia Museum of Art.&#0160;It&#39;s of a type called a &quot;Holbein.&quot;&#0160; And just why, pray tell,&#0160;should a class of rugs be named after a sixteenth-century&#0160;German painter?&#0160;Was Holbein a closet weaver?&#0160;Or an importer of rugs?&#0160; No.&#0160;The answer is that&#0160;rugs of this sort appear prominently in paintings by Holbein,&#0160;and, inasmuch as&#0160;textiles deteriorate more rapidly than oil paintings,&#0160;much more&#0160;is known about early Turkish rugs from their representation in European art than from the bits and fragments that have managed to survive.&#0160;Hence &quot;Holbein.&quot;</p>
<p>It may be not be easy to see&#0160;in the picture (rugs need to be seen and handled in person) but&#0160;on closer inspection, it&#39;s&#0160;clear that there&#39;s a repeating geometric pattern in the field within the rug&#39;s borders.&#0160; That pattern is the hallmark of the &quot;Holbein&quot; rug.</p>
<p>Look again at&#0160;Holbein&#39;s best-known&#0160;picture, &quot;The Ambassadors.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef0154321cfd5e970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Holbein-ambassadors" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef0154321cfd5e970c image-full" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef0154321cfd5e970c-800wi" title="Holbein-ambassadors" /></a>&#0160;<br />The canvas is loaded with realistic and iconographic detail, and, moreover,&#0160;it&#39;s easy to be&#0160;transfixed&#0160;by the floating&#0160;magic-realism-ish anamorphic death&#39;s head that dominates the bottom quarter of the canvas.&#0160;But look, on the table, under the very up-to-date scientific instruments, a&#0160;Turkish rug!&#0160; Look again.</p>
<p><a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef014e883db856970d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Ambassadors detail" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef014e883db856970d" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef014e883db856970d-800wi" title="Ambassadors detail" /></a>&#0160;<br />The rug that&#39;s depicted is comprised a series of squares of which the&#0160;right side of one and the left side of the other are clearly visible.&#0160; It&#39;s a very handsome &quot;Holbein.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>There&#39;s an even&#0160;clearer example in Holbein&#39;s &quot;Darmstadt Madonna.&quot;<a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef014e883dbbfe970d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Darmstadt madonna holbein" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef014e883dbbfe970d image-full" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef014e883dbbfe970d-800wi" title="Darmstadt madonna holbein" /></a>&#0160;<br />There it is, in its full anachronistic glory -- a lovely&#0160;example of&#0160;a &quot;Turkey carpet&quot; enriching the very&#0160; bottom of the picture.&#0160; The repeating geometric pattern is fully revealed.&#0160; It&#39;s not the same rug as the one in the&#0160;&quot;Ambassadors&quot; portrait, but it&#39;s clearly in the same style.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;Holbein&quot;&#0160;rugs don&#39;t just appear in Holbeins.&#0160; There&#39;s a great example in&#0160;Andrea del Verrocchio&#39;s &quot;Madonna with john the Baptist and Donatus&quot; (c. 1480).</p>
<p><a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef01538e4a5193970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Giovanni baptista verrochio" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef01538e4a5193970b image-full" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef01538e4a5193970b-800wi" title="Giovanni baptista verrochio" /></a>&#0160;<br />A sixteenth-century Turkish rug right at the feet of the madonna&#0160;and child. Anachronisticissimus.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>I pause here for a bit of autobiography. in the summer of 1968, Mrs. Dr. Metablog, struck by a sudden infatuation, bid for and won at a country auction in rural Vermont a small geometric ( 4&#39; x 5&#39;) rug. It&#39;s been with us now these forty years and &#0160;has been a constant source of visual pleasure. No, it&#39;s not a Holbein, but it&#39;s in the same phylum. it&#39;s a Konakghend prayer rug, perhaps dating from the late nineteenth century, and like many Kuba or Shirvan rugs, it&#39;s geometrical (rather than swirly or floral) in design. Something like a &quot;Holbein&quot; but not quite. I would love to have a &quot;Holbein&quot; on one of my otherwise blank walls. There&#39;s something mighty intriguing and suggestive about their cross-cultural links. But in the matter of antique rugs (as in other areas of art), my taste is infinitely in advance of my wallet. Instead of purchasing, we gratify our enthusiasm for rugs by going to exhibits, visiting the museums (including the almost unknown Textile Museum in DC), wandering into the better rug stores (NOT the ones that are declaring bankruptcy and in which EVERYTHING is now 70-80% off) where we pretend to be wealthy, and we study the rug books. Let me testify: &quot;oriental&quot; rugs are one of the great, great, great art forms.</p>
<p>Are genuine &quot;Holbeins&quot; still available?&#0160; (I mean old Turkish ones, not new sweatshop or machine made jobbies from India or China.)&#0160; Here&#39;s&#0160;one that was recently sold&#0160;on&#0160;Ebay.</p>
<p><a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef014e883dd875970d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Holbein phillips" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef014e883dd875970d image-full" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef014e883dd875970d-800wi" title="Holbein phillips" /></a>&#0160;<br />It&#39;s a mid-nineteenth-century beauty and, to judge from the picture, in remarkably fine shape for its age. It&#39;s described as a &quot;Yuntdag,&quot; which is a region in West Anatolia. If I had the cash or even the credit, I&#39;d jump on it. And then I would let a photographer take my picture while I pose in front of it, and by doing so connect myself to Holbein and Verrocchio-- to the aesthetic part of the tradition, that is, not to the Virgin part.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>While indulging a long, pleasant walk this morning, I happened upon a shop I had never before noticed.&#0160; It&#39;s called Juno&#39;s Studio of Contemporary Hair Artistry.&#0160; I ws curious as to whether a &quot;hair artistry studio&quot; was&#0160;what we called in the old days a &quot;barber shop&quot; or a &quot;beauty shop.&quot; I&#0160;tried to peek inside the shop&#0160;but the situation&#0160;was&#0160;a tad too &quot;architectooralooral&quot;&#0160;(in Mr. Joe Gargery&#39;s phrase) for me to feel&#0160; comfortable doing so.&#0160;Nevertheless, I was sufficiently intrigued&#0160;about &quot;contemporary hair artistry&quot; to visit&#0160;Juno&#39;s website. I am now&#0160;prepared to&#0160;&quot;share&quot; with my readership what I have learned. The following paragraph comes to you absolutely&#0160;<em>verbatim.&#0160; </em></p>
<p>&quot;Jules Juno’s passion for the hair industry pulses through her life and work at every turn and every look, as her creative spirit is continuously fueled by the rhythms, themes and movements of the subtle and deep rich nuances of the world around her -&#0160;from the street to the flora, feathers and fur of nature, to the lines of fashion&#0160;and art in all its forms. Aligned closely with the powerful totem of Raven and ready to celebrate newness in light of every full moon, she dwells in the magic of change and transformation. Often called the “Hair Shaman” and “Keeper of the Hair” by her devoted clients, Jules believes in the sacredness of being trusted to work her creative magic on the high chakra space of one’s head.&quot;</p>
<p>I can&#0160;tell you one person whose brilliant (though graying) mane&#0160;Juno&#39;s not going work her creative magic upon (even though&#0160;the hair industry pulses through every deep rich nuance of its rhythms, themes and movements). Mine, that&#39;s who&#39;s. Keep your ever-loving hands off my high chakra space, Hair Shaman!!&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Upon further investigation, Juno (her real name?) turns out to be a&#0160;disciple of&#0160;Minnesotan Horst Rechelbacher -- under whose tutelage she taught &quot;for a triune of years before&#0160;adventuring her creative genius as a platform artist.&quot;&#0160; In our town, she plans to &quot;keep the fires of inspiration burning and push the edges of hair design.&quot;</p>
<p>And while here, she will also&#0160;&quot;push the edges&quot; of New Age Bullshit.</p>
<p>By the way, what the heck is&#0160;a &quot;platform artist?&quot;&#0160; And what distinguishes a &quot;triune of years&quot; from &quot;three years?&quot;&#0160;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef014e88232db0970d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Gauguin1" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef014e88232db0970d" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef014e88232db0970d-800wi" title="Gauguin1" /></a>&#0160;</p>
<p>I visited the quirky but impressive Gauguin exhibition at the National Gallery.</p>
<p>Some of the Tahitian paintings are genuinely &quot;iconic&quot; but certainly worth viewing in real life, where they&#39;re a ton more wonderful than in the familiar reproductions.</p>
<p>&#0160;In my great ignorance, I had not a shred of knowledge of Gauguin&#39;s carvings, and was frankly, dazzled by their beauty. Illustrations do&#0160;scant justice. Even more than the paintings, the sculptures need to be seen.&#0160;(They also need to be handled, but art galleries don&#39;t exactly encourage&#0160;tactile familiarity. I hate the nasty beeper that goes off when you I bring my near-sighted eyes close to the object.)</p>
<p>&quot;Soyez amoureuses,&quot; one of Gauguin&#39;s most interesting carvings, is made of painted linden wood.&#0160; It&#39;s a hefty 97cm x 75cm. Here&#39;s what the artist said of it:</p>
<p>I have been working for 2 months on a large (painted wood) carving and I&#39;m&#0160;bold enough to believe it&#39;s the best thing I&#39;ve done up to now as far as strength and balance are concerned (although the literary side of it seems crazy to many people. A monster, who looks like me, is holding a naked woman by the hand -- that&#39;s the main subject.&#0160; The spaces are filled by smaller figures.)&#0160;At the top there&#39;s a town, some sort of Babylon, and at the bottom the countryside with a few imaginary flowers (a desolate old woman) and a fox, the prophetic animal of perversity among the Indians... Despite the inscription, the people look sad, in contradiction to the title.</p>
<p>Like Blake and Yeats, Gauguin had developed his own private mythology.</p>
<p>The sculpture was exhibited in Brussels in 1891 and provoked a &quot;critical storm&quot; -- but what sort of tempest my catalog&#0160;don&#39;t say.&#0160;</p>
<p>This carving was lent to the National Gallery by the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston which apparently has other Gauguin sculptures.</p>
<p>Now I have an incentive for another&#0160;visit to New England.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>When Manny Ramirez visited George Washington High School, his former baseball coach, Steve Mandl, asked hm to say&#0160;something to his players about the art of hittiing.&#0160;&#0160;Ramirez, one of the most&#0160;spectacular batters&#0160;of all time&#0160;(555 home runs, .585 slugging, .313 batting average), thought for a few moments and then pronounced&#0160;&quot;see the ball, hit the ball.&quot;&#0160; From which we can derive that he is not looking at a post-retirement career as a hitting coach.&#0160; He may be the idiot savant of hitting.&#0160;</p>
<p>Good thing the coach didn&#39;t ask him about fielding.&#0160; &quot;See the ball, fumble&#0160;the ball.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;See the ball, hit the ball&quot; is&#0160;universal &#0160;wisdom that transcends its baseball context -- like Wayne Gretzky&#39;s famous &quot;skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it is.&quot;</p>
<p>I&#39;ve heard the masterful sentence ascribed also to Pete Rose.&#0160; But it&#39;s more far more appropriate to Manny.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>It&#39;s bad enough to be born into and involuntarily indoctrinated into a religion, but if a person has&#0160;the good fortune to be born into&#0160;a family of non-believers, why should he or she regress&#0160;to dogma and doctrine and fantasies of the afterlife?</p>
<p>But then, I&#39;m tone deaf and colorblind to religion.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Nevertheless (you can trust me here, dear blog-reader), I&#39;ve read more than my share of the kind of autobiography called the &quot;conversion narrative&quot; in which the writer describes how he or she came to locate and embrace some particular god or creed. &quot;Conversion narratives&quot; generally take one of two shapes.&#0160;In some&#0160;of them, the subject experiences a sudden blinding insight (after the style Saul/Paul on the road to Damascus); in others, the&#0160;author endures a&#0160;long dark night of the soul that is painfully and gradually superseded with&#0160;&quot;enlightenment&quot; (Newman&#39;s <em>Apologia</em>&#0160;is the archetype).</p>
<p>G. Willow Wilson&#39;s memoir&#0160;<em>The Butterfly Mosque&#0160;</em>(New York, 2010)&#0160;describes&#0160;a conversion of a&#0160;sort&#0160;that I&#39;ve never before encountered -- it lacks not only a&#0160;voice from the clouds and but also a scalding of the heart. Wilson simply sets out with a&#0160;desire to convert and then hunts for an appropriate religion -- a most odd and unusual&#0160; procedure. In college, Wilson&#0160;reports, she was &quot;in the market for a philosophy.&quot;&#0160;Soon after, she&#0160;became a Muslim -- essentially because she wanted to be something and couldn&#39;t think of anything better.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the key paragraph: &quot;I discovered&#0160;I was a monotheist....&#0160; That rules out polytheism.&#0160; I also have a problem with authority, which rules out any religion with a priesthood.... And I cannot believe that having given us these bodies, God thinks we should be virgins unless we desperately feel a need to reproduce.&#0160;That rules out any religion that is against family planning or sex for fun....&#0160; Islam is antiauthoritarian, sex-positive monotheism.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#39;s a series of reasons so quirky that it&#39;s hard to take seriously. &#0160;If I were G. Willow&#39;s spiritual counselor, and she came to me with such a shallow&#0160;argument, I would have said, &quot;go home, young lady, take a couple of years and try to think more deeply.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;I discovered I was a monotheist&quot;? Mere mysticism, no more more&#0160;persuasive than&#0160;&quot;I discovered I believed in only one angel.&quot;&#0160;Islam has no priesthood?&#0160; Depends on how you define priest, doesn&#39;t it. No Roman-style priest who acts as an intermediary to&#0160;God, but a heck of a priestly establishment nonetheless -- boatloads of imans and mullahs and ayatollahs all laying claim to special forms of knowledge. Is Islam sex-friendly?&#0160; Perhaps in theory, but in practice it&#39;s hard to find a more misogynist or homophobic operation&#0160;out there in monotheismland -- and I suspect that&#0160;sex is more cheerful when it&#39;s shared by equal partners.</p>
<p>On the whole, Islam does not meet Wilson&#39;s three criteria nearly as well as the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, which is monotheist to a overcooked fault, supports not a single&#0160;priest (only a website), and as far as I know, expresses not the slightest antagonism to sex in any form or coloration.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p><em>The Butterfly Mosque </em>offers its readers some very sensitive insights into Egyptian society and especially into American-Muslim relations. It&#39;s also a fine little love story&#0160;-- a young American woman finds a sweet young man in Cairo and tactfully negotiates the profound cultural barriers that might have divided them. Sometimes it seems a little like Romeo and Juliet&#0160;gone all sentimental and gooey -- as though the young lady would be secretly happier if her marriage had caused a Montague-Capulet feud. It doesn&#39;t because both&#0160;Omar&#39;s family and G. Willow&#39;s parents are urbane, sophisticated, open, loving, practical and non-ideological &#0160;and offer no resistance whatsoever to the exogamous marriage. And Wilson is honest enough to admit it.</p>
<p>I worry about the stability of this conversion. &#0160;When a new religion is embraced for such superficial reasons, it can be shucked equally as easily. &#0160;It wouldn&#39;t surprise me if G. Willow returns, some day, to the steady rationality of her parents. Let&#39;s hope so.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>The foulest, most obscene word in the English language, at least as far as sound is concerned, is, by all odds, &quot;kumquat.&quot;&#0160; It&#39;s hard to say whether it&#39;s the &quot;kum&quot; or the &quot;quat&quot; that is more reprehensible, but the two together, o my goodness gracious! &quot;Kum&quot; is linked to Fr. &quot;con&quot; and ME (Middle English) &quot;queynte&quot; as well as to the common colloquialism for sexual climax. &quot;Quat&quot; recalls Shakespeare&#39;s &quot;quatch buttock&quot; and also &quot;quatch&quot; in its exceedingly vulgar modern urban signification. Readers attentive to language will also hear in &quot;quat&quot; an echo of Robert Browning&#39;s famous &quot;twat.&quot; (PG-13 rated note: Having encountered in an anonymous 1660 poem the couplet &quot;They talk&#39;d of his having a Cardinall&#39;s Hat; /They&#39;d send him as soon an Old Nun&#39;s Twat,&quot; Browning took &quot;twat&quot; to refer to article of clothing and so composed the following: &quot;Then owls and bats/ Cowls and twats/ Monks and nuns in a cloister&#39;s moods/ Adjourn to the oak-stump pantry.&quot;&#0160; It would appear that Browning was insufficiently alert to obscenity.)</p>
<p>&quot;Kumquat&quot; should properly be used in formulations such as &quot;why don&#39;t you shove it up your kumquat?&quot; or &quot;eat my kumquat,&quot; or &quot;your mother is a kumquat.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>If only Kobe Bryant hadn&#39;t called the referee a &quot;fucking f-gg-t&quot; but had called him a &quot;fucking kumquat&quot; instead. He would not been fined $100,000 and he would have enjoyed a far more satisfactory vituperative experience.&#0160;</p>
<p>Incidentally, one of the most popular varieties of kumquat is the &quot;fukushu.&quot; Honest.&#0160;&#0160; <strong><br /></strong></p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Yesterday I renewed my expired driver&#39;s license. I was worried about the eye exam because of the cataracts, but I passed easily. Believe me, the bar for visual acuity is not set very high.</p>
<p>On my previous license, &quot;hair&quot; was &quot;brown&quot;;&#0160; this time, it&#39;s &quot;gray.&quot;</p>
<p>The clerk asked, &quot;Are you willing to be an organ donor?&quot;&#0160; &quot;Sure,&quot; I answered, &quot;but I don&#39;t know whether&#0160; anyone would want my organs.&quot;</p>
<p>Surely no one would want my myopic, be-cataracted eyes. Nor my ears (although they would be&#0160; supplemented with an expensive set of hearing aids at no extra charge). My heart?&#0160; Well, if it came with a &quot;Use at Own Risk&quot; label and a whole library of erratic ECG printouts. Certainly not my spine, which was a &quot;second&quot; or &quot;factory reject&quot; right from the womb. I would not recommend it even at a severe markdown. My liver -- I think I can recommend my liver. It&#39;s barely been used and should command a premium. My prostate -- now there&#39;s a bargain in the making. A prostate is supposed to be the size of a walnut, but mine is more like a potato, perhaps a Yukon Gold -- and yet as far as I know it is cancer free. It could be chopped up and transplanted into three or four men.</p>
<p>My best organ, if it&#39;s an organ, is definitely my knees, both right and left.&#0160; I&#39;m at the age where knee-replacement is commonplace, but I have the knees of a twenty-five year old: flexible, functioning, pain-free, even if somewhat prone to hyperextension. Some linebacker who&#39;s abused his own would be overjoyed to extend his career with a perfectly wonderful set of knees. Or a basketball player, preferably someone who wants to regain his &quot;hops.&quot; Maybe, in someone else&#39;s body, my knees could finally win the trophies and renown that they deserve.</p>

				<p>Her language consists mostly of nouns: &quot;baby&quot; -- both herself and her beloved doll; &quot;wawa&quot; (water);&#0160; &quot;mommy&quot;;&#0160; &quot;daddy&quot;; &quot;ayi&quot; (Chinese for aunt);&#0160; &quot;didi&quot; (Chinese jiějie, older sister); &quot;paopao&quot; (Chinese, grandmother); &quot;pock&quot; (pocket); &quot;book&quot;; &quot;ball&quot;: &quot;eye&quot;; &quot;nose&quot; etc.&#0160; Her words are occasionally less specified than they will soon become; for example, &quot;duck&quot; seems to mean &quot;bird.&quot; At the zoo, she identified an emu as a duck. Similarly, &quot;gogo&quot; (Chinese for dog), means mammal, even including the zoo&#39;s llama. &quot;Up&quot; can mean either up or down; it seems to signify a change of position. &quot;No&quot; occasionallly means &quot;yes&quot;; she seems to conceive it as a response to a question. There is, however, no ambiguity to her very definitive &quot;mine.&quot;</p>
<p>When she slid down the slide in the park, her audience exclaimed &quot;whee.&quot;&#0160; Lola responded, &quot;I do whee,&quot; understanding &quot;whee&quot; to be the name of the action rather than an exclamation of pleasure.&#0160;</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>There&#39;s been a re-birth of nativism in the &quot;give me your tired, your poor&quot; land that I love. The right-wingers, who need someone to hate, have decided that anti-Hispanic and anti-Muslim noise-making is just what our beleaguered country needs right now.</p>
<p>All of which brought to mind a painful memory. Sometime in the 1970s, I was sitting in a coffee room at the U. -- a rare event for me -- and a group of people were recalling happy moments from their various childhoods. One of the participants was a grey-haired woman perhaps 15 years older than I. She was a secretary or administrative assistant at not mine but some other department. She was a kindly, competent, unpretentious woman with whom I occasionally exhanged a few words of greeting or business.</p>
<p>&#0160;I can&#39;t remember exactly what the other participants ibn the discussion remembered from their early days -- probably hunting trips with dad, hitting the winning single in a softball game, a romp with the family dog -- but I will never forget what Masako recalled: &quot;When I was in the internment camp in Utah, one day Marian Anderson came to sing for us.&quot;</p>

				<p>Telephone conversation with an&#0160;eighty-two year old cousin.&#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;Evreryone down here, all they ever talk about is their pains, their doctors, their diets, their diseases.&#0160; Now&#0160;I have something to talk about.&#0160; For years I went to this doctor, maybe forty years, he&#39;s almost as old as I am&#0160; Every time I go into see him, with a sore knee or pains in the chest or whatever,&#0160;he&#39;d look at it, and he&#39;d say,&#0160;&#39;what can you expect at your age?&#0160; You&#39;re lucky to be alive.&#39; &#0160;I&#39;d go in with a sore throat.&#0160; He&#39;d say, &#39;Can you swallow.&#0160;So what it hurts.&#0160;You&#39;re too old to worry.&#39;&#0160;If I had a headache, he&#39;d say,&#0160;&#39;whatever happens, happens.&#0160; You&#39;re old, enjoy the day.&#39;&#0160;Finally he retired.&#0160;He took a job as a&#0160;dance instructor on a cruise ship. I&#39;m not kidding. He leads exercises or something.&#0160;So I went to a younger doctor.&#0160;He listens to me breathe, pokes around a bit, puts me in the hospital, and&#0160;now&#0160;I have three stents.&quot;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Yesterday&#39;s&#0160;NYTimes reports&#0160;that it&#39;s the&#0160;75th&#0160;anniversary of the first publication of <em>The Story of Ferdinand </em>by Munro Leaf.&#0160; This brief novel about a pacific&#0160;bull was the&#0160;first book that I knew and loved. It was The Book of my first few years on earth and I&#39;ve probably read it, to myself and to my children, twenty times more than I&#39;ve read <em>King Lear </em>and <em>Hamlet</em> combined. I&#39;ve never tested myself, but I might be able to recite it from beginning to end with only an occasional prompt. I believe that several leaves from my 1942 codex are still the the family archives (and by archives, I mean those plastic boxes in the basement),</p>
<p><a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef0147e3bcb022970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Ferdinand" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef0147e3bcb022970b" height="203" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef0147e3bcb022970b-800wi" title="Ferdinand" width="159" /></a>I did&#0160;not know that &quot;Ferdimam&quot;&#0160;(as the kids call it)&#0160;was thought by many to be a subversive, unpatriotic allegory and that it had been banned by Franco and burned by Hitler. As a child, it never occured to me that Ferdinand was a&#0160;pacifist -- I thought he was sensible.Why be killed in a bullfight when you can sit and smell the flowers?</p>
<p>It was the book&#39;s language that engaged me,&#0160;especially the one sentence that was my first taste of pure, immortal, transcendent poetry:&#0160;&quot;Flags were flying, bands were playing... and all the lovely ladies had flowers in their hair.&quot;&#0160; Not even Shakespeare ever composed a more glorious&#0160;succession of iambs.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>When I was a child, haircuts were perpetrated at Joe&#39;s Barber Shop on Coney Island Avenue. It was a pleasant place: there were wall-to-wall mirrors on either side of Joe Montuori&#39;s shop, and a boy sitting in the chair could lose himself in the series of infinitely-regressing images. Joe always had a friend or two in the shop with whom he spoke incomprehensible rapid-fire Italian.&#0160;The haircutting itself was an ordeal. Joe charged 75 cents a head, but my mother had driven a bargain: three haircuts (myself and my two brothers) for $1.80.&#0160;Joe revenged himself on me by a) working the electric buzzer as rapidly as possible, and b) frequently re-arranging the angle of my head with a blow from the heel of his hand.&#0160;Back home, my mother would sigh and say, &quot;Turn around.&#0160;Let&#39;s see what he did to you this time.&quot;</p>
<p>I&#39;m not big on personal adornment, and, perhaps because of my early hair-chopping experiences, I&#39;ve never been comfortable in the barber&#39;s seat. As soon as the cloth is fastened around my neck I feel hogtied and hopeless.&#0160;&quot;What are they going to do to me today?&quot;&#0160;Once, on the west side of Manhattan, in the late 1960s, when my hair was rather long (it seems absurd that you could signal your opposition to the war in Vietnam by letting your hair grow, but such was the case), I walked into a shop and asked the barber to &quot;leave it long.&quot; He immediately transformed me into a rabid supporter of carpet-bombing.&#0160;Also in New York: when I naively wandered into a shop with a specialized clientele, a hair technician employing a razor and a variety of gels and lotions turned me into someone whose hair was giving off signals with which the rest of his body was not in accord.&#0160;In Hanover, New Hampshire, in an upstairs &#39;salon,&#39; the barber suddenly stopped work, drew back, studied me for fifteen or twenty seconds, and asked, &quot;Are you Jewish.&quot; I mumbled something about not really wanting to discuss my ethnicity with him, whereupon he launched into a disquisition of which I understood not much and remember less, except that that it involved prophecy, the Book of Isaiah, and The Hatching of the Egg. He hauled out his heavily annotated King James Version and pointed me to various passages underlined in coded colors.&#0160;As it happens, I&#39;m more conversant than most people with scripture, and so I can assert with moderate authority that his reading of the Bible was -- how shall I say -- original.&#0160;It took me an hour to extricate myself from his insistent and wayward scholarship: fifteen minutes of hair-cutting and forty-five minutes of exegetical enthusiasm.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>For a decade or so, when our finances were perilous, my wife cut my hair. There were some benefits (a guy could cop a feel while being ministered to) but I must admit that although my good woman was earnest and effective, she never fully mastered tonsorial technique. She had the habit of yanking upwards on the strands with the scissors, with the result that each snip produced a stab of pain -- although nothing more intense than might have been alleviated by the injection of a dozen or score shots of novocaine directly into the scalp. And then there were the ear nicks.</p>
<p>After a while, I returned hair responsibility to the world of commerce.&#0160;I had success for many years with Liz of Chicago Hair across town.&#0160;Liz was good at her work and respected my multiple cowlicks. But then she started to raise her prices. When she reached $20, I would just hand her the Visa and ask her not to tell me what she charged. When she went to $30, I retaliated by spacing the haircuts further and further apart in order to keep my annual cost constant.&#0160;But when she broached the $40 barrier, the puritan in me rebelled.&#0160;I started to patronize the cheap ($14) barbershop across the street from the college. There&#39;s a rotating staff and it&#39;s hit-and-miss:&#0160;sometimes the results are acceptable, sometimes disastrous.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>When I come home from the expedition, my wife says, &quot;Let&#39;s see what they&#39;ve done to you today.&quot;</p>
<p>And then she sighs.&#0160;</p>

				<p>Sardines, by the tinful. Herrings, canned, either in wine sauce or in tomato sauce.&#0160;Whitefish. Lima beans which came into the house&#0160;dried but which were soaked to plump up, then boiled and mashed (but not&#0160;for me, if I could possibly avoid them).&#0160;Potatoes in any form, but usually mashed and buttered. No chicken or lamb chops, but lots of tongue.&#0160;(When I left home, I vowed never to eat tongue again, and I&#39;ve kept the faith.) Chopped chicken liver. Steak, when we could afford it.&#0160;Roast pork with applesauce.&#0160;Delicatessen meats -- salami, baloney, corned beef, frankfurters.&#0160;Baked beans, courtesy of Heinz.&#0160;Apples, right down to the stem.&#0160;Chocolate in any form, but especially white chocolate.&#0160;Halvah, a particular favorite.&#0160;Dates and figs, dried.&#0160;Black radishes and onions, covered with <a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2010/01/haute-cuisine-c-1945.html" target="_self">gribbinis</a>.&#0160;Tschav, borsht with huge helpings of sour cream. Corn on the cob.&#0160;No alcohol, nary a drop.&#0160;On hot days, no beer, but instead iced tea or iced coffee. Cheese, either Velveeta or swiss.&#0160;Good bread --&#0160;pumpernickel or rye.&#0160;Crumb cake direct&#0160; from Ebinger&#39;s Bakery.&#0160;Bacon and two eggs, sunnyside up or soft-boiled.&#0160;Cream o&#39; Wheat. Swee-Touch-Nee tea.&#0160;On Sunday morning, bagels and rolls, warm from the oven, eaten while reading&#0160;the <em>Times</em> (25 cents) and the <em>Eagle</em> (10 cents).&#0160;Ice cream, the more exotic the flavor the better.</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I was informed that the granddaughter had become interested in Egyptian mythology, so I decided to buy her a book on the topic. It&#39;s hard to know what to put in the hands of a young lady whose reading level is astonishing but who is just eight years old. I visited the &quot;young adult&quot; quarters at our local library and withdrew four books on the subject. Which one to buy?</p>
<p>The first book that I looked at was clearly inappropriate. It read as though it had been condensed out of the 11th edition of the Encyclopedia Brittanica. Hard words, unelucidated, and a patronizing, paleocolonialist point of view. The next book was too simple -- all pictures and treacle. The third book, a retelling of the story of Isis and Osiris, was moving along nicely until Seth tore the body of Osiris into fourteen pieces and scattered them all over the landscape. &quot;When Isis heard this, she paddled over the swamps in a little boat looking for the fragments of Osiris to put them back together again and make them whole. After much searching she found all the parts of Osiris except his phallus which had been swallowed by a fish.&quot; Can this story be recommended for eight-year-olds. Would it be appropriate for Sesame Street or Mr. Rogers?</p>
<p>Call me squeamish if you must. Diagnose me with an advanced case of castration anxiety. Stigmatize me as indifferent to the profound Jungian significance of this gruesome story. Say what you will -- I do not want to explain phallophagia to the young lady. Frankly, I don&#39;t even want to explain &quot;phallus.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>Book number four seemed to be acceptable and I have purchased a copy of it. I hope I made a good decision. Book number four is about Egyptian religion, not Egyptian mythology (&quot;mythology&quot; is an unquestionably loaded and derogatory word).</p>
<p>The book might be a little hard for the granddaughter and it might be a little too detailed. I&#39;m hoping that she skims or skips the section of the book that describes Egyptian embalming techniques. &quot;Inner organs were usually dried after removal and placed in special containers called canopic jars. The embalmer&#39;s tools included a spirally curved copper hook for breaking the ethmoid bone in the back of the nose to remove the brain, which was then discarded.&quot;</p>
<p>Eeew, as they say nowadays.</p>
<p>Perhaps I am just a tad squeamish.&#0160;</p>

				<p>In the old days, when I&#39;d whip up a big batch of spaghetti sauce, I&#39;d add a pound or so of ground beef and a generous portion of hot Italian sausage. But that was B. C. (before cholesterol). Nowadays, it&#39;s all vegetarian. Not nearly as tasty, but acceptable -- and appropriate, in its blandness, to these latter days.&#0160; To enrich the meatless mixture, I add a couple of cuisinarted carrots and a grated zucchini or two.&#0160;</p>
<p>At our local food market, a 6&quot; zucchini costs $1.00. An entire buck. I&#39;m not usually one to complain about the price of things. It&#39;s not helpful or cheerful to do so.&#0160; I pay the freight and and I&#39;m glad to be able to do so.&#0160; I don&#39;t grieve about the cost of cars or insurance or potatoes. Nevertheless, I&#39;m appalled when I plunk down that dollar for a short, skinny zucchini.&#0160;</p>
<p>The zucchini is an abundant fruit.&#0160; Production is measured in cornucopias. In August and September, at harvest time, it&#39;s impossible to keep up with them.&#0160; Just two small hills and there are so many zucchinis that we can&#39;t possibly eat them, can&#39;t give them away, and have to get out the backhoe and dig a trench to dispose of them. (In our part of Vermont, there&#39;s a local saying that in late summer you must keep the door of your car locked or someone will open it up and throw in a zucchini.)&#0160; And then there&#39;s always the hidden zuke that, hiding under an enormous leaf, has grown to the size of a three-year-old child, only heavier. &#0160;</p>
<p>I know that it shouldn&#39;t be so, but that dollar for a measly little zucchini irks me.&#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160;</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I have a favorite moment in <em>Diner </em>(1982), the first of Barry Levinson&#39;s quartet of Baltimore movies, and it&#39;s not the scene in which I made my silver-screen debut. It&#39;s when two of the working-class guys who hang out at the Fells Point hamburger joint find themselves taking a drive in the Maryland countryside. They happen upon a rich, well-tended young blonde woman riding an elegant horse (in her own spacious meadow). They stop the car try to chat her up but she&#39;s clearly out of their league. When she gallops off, one of the guys says to the other: &quot;Do you ever get the feeling that there&#39;s something going on that we don&#39;t know about?&quot;</p>
<p>I was thinking about that scene when I read that Moammar Ghaddafi&#39;s son Seif threw himself a birthday party at some spectacular resort in the West Indies and paid the pop singer Mariah Carey $1,000,000 smackerootis to sing four songs. You read it right -- one millions bucks. The article didin&#39;t say whether she had to pay for her own motel and continental breakfast and transportation but I&#39;m going to guess that expenses were extra.&#0160;</p>
<p>I tried to calculate whether I had earned $1M in my working life. I can&#39;t remember and I don&#39;t have the records, but I know that I started at $3600 and&#0160; by 1966 I was already pulling down $7800. I think that in my first decade of employment I earned well under $100,000. Yeah, I know, them was different dollars -- but still.</p>
<p>A working guy who makes $40,000 would take 25 years to earn what Mariah Carey took home for twenty minutes of effort.&#0160;</p>
<p>But it&#39;s not what she earned so much as what he paid. The Ghaddafi clan of brutes, lunatics, oil-bloated twits, and kleptocrats has been looting the Libyans for forty years. No wonder that the family is willing to commit mass murder to hold on to their hoard. (In his defence, Seif claimed that it wasn&#39;t him; it was his brother Muatassim.) Here&#39;s a question: how many years does it take your run-of-the-mill Libyan to earn $1M?&#0160;</p>
<p>I think that the average Libyan would understand the point of view of the diner guys. There&#39;s something going on out there, and it ain&#39;t all good.</p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2011/03/random-harvest-amnesia.html">Amnesia in Films:  Random Harvest (1942) </a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>In Mervyn LeRoy&#39;s <em>Random Harvest</em> (1942), amnesia is not merely a plot gimmick. The amnesia of Charles Rainier, a shell-shocked World War I veteran, is the principal subject of the film. Rainier (Ronald Colman) begins in Condition A (amnesiac but solid citizen and loving husband) but is hit by a cab in Liverpool and transitions to Condition B (aristocratic, efficient, but passionless, and with no knowledge of the three years between the war and the cab). Will he remember the lost years and reintegrate the two parts of his hstory?&#0160; Well, yes, he does, but only with the decades-long assistance of his patient-Griselda wife Paula/Margaret (excellently played by the ageless Greer Garson).&#0160;<em> <br /></em></p>
<p>It&#39;s kind of a soap-opera-y film and I&#39;m embarrassed to confess that it moved me. The last scene, in which Rainier finally remembers that he had long ago loved and married Margaret under her real name Paula, is a curious kind of anagnorisis. Although they&#39;ve known each other for decades, true recognition comes suddenly and joyfully. And I bought it, much against my will. Dropped a reluctant tear.&#0160;</p>
<p>Because of the amnesia, Charles has two different lives, but he doesn&#39;t, as in other films, have two different personalities. He&#39;s kindly, steadfast, and rather boring in both states. The film offers little in the way of a theory of amnesia. &quot;As one door opens, another closes&quot; says a friendly but passive psychiatrist, whose expertise is validated only by his middle-European accent.&#0160;</p>
<p>In most films, diseases resemble their manifestations in real life. Amnesia, on the other hand, can be anything the screenwriter says it it is. It&#39;s a mighty elastic phenomenon, unmoored to medical experience or knowledge. However imagined, the total amnesia of characters in films is a great plot device. The audience is always in the know and therefore feels superior to the poor character/actor who stumbles toward an understanding of his own self. It&#39;s hard to believe that Shakespeare was able to write forty plays without ever resorting to amnesia.&#0160;</p>
<p>At a social event a few days ago I met a psychologist who works at the AFB in Colorado Springs with veterans of Afghanistan and Iraq. I asked her if she had ever encountered a case of amnesia. She said that many injured personnel can&#39;t remember the moments just before they were wounded, but that she&#39;d never enountered a case of movie-style amnesia. Or heard of one. And, she added, trust me, I&#39;ve dealt with many kinds of mental disturbances.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I went to a forum, sponsored by local Dems, with our congressman. Fifty or sixty of my friends and neighbors were in attendance. Our congressman is a good person -- smart, informed, energetic, and progressive. He described the situation in the House of Representatives -- the difficulty of serving in the minority, especially when so many members of the majority side aren&#39;t serious about governing. The audience was sympathetic but there was an undercurrent of impatience. Why can&#39;t the Dems make it clear that cutting taxes and cutting the deficit are incompatible goals?&#0160; Why do the Dems always lose the messaging wars? Our congressman&#39;s answers were not always satisfactory to his liberal constituents.&#0160;</p>
<p>I understand his plight;&#0160; i&#39;s easy to stand outside and criticize. But I also felt that he didn&#39;t appreciate how damn dangerous these right-wing Republicans and tea-partiers have become. The gap between rich and poor is becoming larger and less ameliorable. We could lose our democracy to the corporations.</p>
<p>Afterwards, I asked him, semi-privately, if the new Republican congressman can be educated. Will they ever come to realize that governing is a hard job that can&#39;t be done with slogans and a simplistic ideology.&#0160; He didn&#39;t think much of my question and didn&#39;t answer it.&#0160;</p>
<p>I was filled with foreboding when I left for the forum. I returned home even more pessimistic about the future.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>A good friend, a distinguished biologist, asked me to read his cancer manuscript.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>When I read science books (popularizations, for the most part), I usually do so with only half a brain. I&#39;m lazy; I skip the hard parts. But because I was being asked for a serious opinion, I read this book closely. In all honesty,&#0160; It hurt my head. The hardest chapters were those on the workings of the cell. I last studied cells in high school biology class with Miss Goetschius.&#0160; It was 1957, before there was anything known about DNA.&#0160; We copied elementary pictures of cells from the textbook. &quot;You don&#39;t know how to stipple,&quot; Miss Goetschius complained. There&#39;s a thousand times more known about cells than back then in the dark ages, and I haven&#39;t gotten any smarter.&#0160;</p>
<p>Cells are spectacularly complicated&#0160; -- no wonder it took billions of years for them to evolve. Once the single cell had achieved a level of efficiency, the rest of evolution -- even including us -- was piece of cake.</p>
<p>Reading about the lives of cells and about cancer (which is what happens when cells go wrong) confirmed and strengthened my ideas about life and death.&#0160; Life,our life, is almost entirely an accident. It&#39;s an accident that cells incorporated pieces of bacteria to form mitochondria; it&#39;s an accident that they agglutinated in the way that they did to form multicellular creatures; it&#39;s an accident that we&#39;re here. But more than that: the success and the deterioriation of the cells that make us are part of the same process. The end of life is implicit in its inception. Cancer is exactly as natural as breathing.&#0160;</p>
<p>It&#39;s trivial;&#0160; t&#39;s what everyone knows, it&#39;s what we&#39;ve always known. It&#39;s a cliche: &quot;death is a natural part of life.&quot; And yet it&#39;s strangely comforting. Whatever comes next -- cancer, heart disease, Alzheimer&#39;s -- is perfectly natural. Of course it will lead to death. But it&#39;s also life.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
