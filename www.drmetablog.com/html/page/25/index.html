					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2011/02/footlocker.html">Ducks/ Bad Corporate Names </a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>It is possible that in the entire history of capitalism in America, the silliest name that has ever been devised for a business is &quot;Lady Footlocker.&quot; I understand the reasoning behind the name: &quot;Footlocker&quot; was a successful athletic goods store for men and the geniuses in charge wanted to hive off a parallel enterprise for women. How to do so? Well, right here, in our state, as all basketball enthusiasts know, we have the Colorado Buffs and the Lady Buffs; why not, by analogy, Lady Footlocker -- except for the intractable fact that footlockers don&#39;t exhibit gender. A female footlocker? Goodness gracious. Not that the name &quot;Lady Buffs&quot; is at all is satisfactory -- although inasmuch as a female buffalo is properly a cow -- well, things could be worse. Which inevitably calls up the question of what to call the distaff version of Oregon&#39;s famous Ducks. Lady Ducks? The obstacle here is that &quot;duck&quot; is already female (&quot;drake&quot; the male &quot;duck&quot;), so Lady Ducks would be excessively hyperfeminine. The finest solution to this onomastic puzzle would be to change the men&#39;s team to Drakes -- and then the female version would be immediately obvious. But what about the related question: what to do for a mascot for Drake University of Des Moines, Iowa. My choice would be Drake Monks, but I would accept Drake Drakes. No such luck; in defiance of all mascot logic, they&#39;re the Drake Bulldogs -- and I&#39;m going to guess that the women&#39;s team is called the Lady Bulldogs, but I don&#39;t know for sure. It&#39;s a horrid moniker, but still orders of magnitude superior to Lady Footlocker.</p>
<p>But is Lady Footlocker the worst corporate name, as I&#39;ve asserted? I can offer two other nominees. The first is Unisys (formerly Sperry-Rand); &quot;siss&quot; is a syllable that should never be found in any corporation&#39;s name (except in conjunction with -tem) especially if it expects to be taken seriously. My other nominee:&#0160; a cleaning product that I use, which is called &quot;Mr. Leather.&quot; Entirely too S &amp; M for my taste.</p>
<p>The question of worst corporate name is the kind of&#0160; topic for which the internet is designed. If you google &quot;worse corporate names,&quot; you find several lists.&#0160;Here follow some of my favorites:&#0160;Casket Basement; Chainsaw Cottage; Hung Fat Lingerie; Stiff Nipples Air Conditioning (<a href="http://www.anecdotoff.com/2007/12/09/stiff-nipples-air-conditioning-service.html" target="_self">you think that&#0160; I&#39;m making this up; check here;</a> Blood&#39;s Seafood and Caterer; B. S. Liquidators;&#0160; Dodo Mortuary; Cramps Liquors; Beaver Cleaners; Lynch Tree; PMS Firearms; Master Bait and Tackle; Knobs and Knockers. There are dozens more, but none, I think, quite so quintessentially absurd as Lady Footlocker.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Charles Dickens and I are intimate friends and have been so since 1952, when, delighted and astonished, I zoomed through&#0160;<em>David Copperfield</em> -- the first of ten or a dozen readings.&#0160;At this very moment, I&#39;m renewing our long asymmetrical friendship by re-reading the fifteen novels (fourteen and a half, actually, inasmuch as Dickens collapsed while&#0160;<em>Drood</em> was still in process).&#0160;It&#39;s my third pilgrimage through the collected works; first in the summer of 1969, again sometime in the early 1980s, and now once again (no doubt the last).&#0160;I know a couple of the novels almost word for word -- <em>Great Expectations</em>, for example, -- but others, such as <em>Barnaby Rudge</em>&#0160; -- gosh, I don&#39;t think that I could say any more about it than that&#0160;it&#39;s a historical novel and that it contains both riots and a conspicuous cherry ribbon. I don&#39;t know any more about <em>Barnaby Rudge </em>than your&#0160;average man on the street.&#0160;Despite these blank spots, my relationship with Dickens has been enduring and satisfying.&#0160;Troubled, some of the time, but always rich and complex.&#0160;</p>
<p>He&#39;s the best of novelists; he&#39;s the worst of novelists. Dickens&#39; formula is &quot;make &#39;em laugh, make&#39; em cry, make &#39;em wait.&quot; Waiting must have come easier in previous centuries. It&#39;s a good thing that I&#39;m a patient person, because these 800-pagers can wear a reader down. There are times in almost every one of the novels in which I would be happier if there was a trifle less waiting. On the other hand, laughing and crying have remained a splendid part of the Dickens experience. No matter how much I steel myself against the obvious tearjerker death or disaster looming at chapter&#39;s end, I still fall into the Dickens trap and besprinkle my Penguin with hot tears -- not as plentiful, I think, as those that I let fall when poor David&#39;s mother died in 1952, but no less genuine. And when Aunt Betsey threatens to tread on Miss Murdstone&#39;s bonnet or when Trabb&#39;s boy lashes himself with his empty blue bag -- well, even after all these years, I can&#39;t help but break into loud laughter. When he goes after Chadband and Creakle and Podsnap, he&#39;s unequalled. No one can equal Dickens for comedy. &#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>I am convinced that the finest moment in all of nineteenth-century literature occurs just in <em>Bleak House</em>, just after the death of poor Jo the crossing sweeper, when Dickens stops the novel right in its tracks and directs the full&#0160; force of his indignation at his own indifferent country:&#0160;&quot;Dead, your Majesty. Dead, my lords and gentlemen. Dead, Right Reverends and Wrong Reverends of every order. Dead, men and women, born with Heavenly compassion in your hearts. And dying thus around us every day.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;There has never been another writer who had the magnificent effrontery, the bravura daring, to so attack his readers, high and low.&#0160;Dickens is a force of nature, not to be judged by ordinary canons of literary excellence.&#0160;</p>
<p>But Dickens can also be awful -- sentimental, gooey, repetitive, obsessive.&#0160;Sometimes the satire is ill-aimed.&#0160;Why is it so ridiculous to be concerned with the victims of imperialism?&#0160; Perhaps the denizens of Borrioboola-Gha, on the left bank of the NIger, need all the help they can get.&#0160;Why should Mr. Guppy or young John Chivery to be so pilloried, just because they dare to love above their stations?&#0160;&#0160;Why does Dickens have so much trouble with ambitious or wronged women?&#0160; Don&#39;t Miss Dartle and Miss Wade have a right to be angry?&#0160;And what about Dickens&#39; Jewish problem?&#0160;His bigotry disfigures the page and makes the philosemitic Mr. Riah even more offensive than horrid old Fagin.&#0160;And then there are all those monsters of goodness:&#0160;the weak-tea Brownlows and Clennams.&#0160;Dickens is sometimes faulted for his caricatures, but his grotesques are a thousand times more realistic and more interesting than his faultless, blameless, bowel-less goody-goodies.&#0160;And there are moments of high stupidity, such as Mr. Krook&#39;s death by spontaneous combustion.&#0160;Goodness gracious -- the greatest of hearts supported by the most ordinary of brains.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Up next in my final passage through the novels, already two-thirds of the way to the finish line: <em>Dombey and Son</em>,&#0160; where I&#39;m going to cry at Paul&#39;s death, be offended by perfect Walter Gay, giggle at Mr. Toots, marvel at Edith Grainger, and spend far too much time transfixed by Carker&#39;s teeth.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><em>Laura </em>is a stylish noir mystery that maintains its fascination even after the passage of sixty years. It is cleverly written and handsomely cinematographed but it also comes with some murky psychological baggage. At the heart of the enigma lies Waldo Lydecker (played by Clifton Webb). He&#39;s so head-over-heels in love and so ferociously jealous of Laura (the ingenue Gene Tierney) that he&#39;ll resort to anything, even murder, to keep her from other men. The premise is good whodunit fare, but it would make more obvious sense if Lydecker weren&#39;t both old and gay.</p>
<p>Clifton Webb was fifty-five when the picture was made, but he looks and acts ten or fifteen years older. He may be a bachelor, but he&#39;s not an eligible one. There&#39;s a story that Webb had a clause in his contract with Twentieth-Century Fox that barred the company from alluding to his homosexuality, but the prohibition, if it existed, didn&#39;t stop him from playing Lydecker with a pronounced gay affect. He&#39;s fussy, he&#39;s bitchy, he&#39;s a queen -- in short a stage homosexual in every aspect except that he&#39;s not obviously interested in men. Well, not overtly;&#0160; but it is a surprise that he exposes himself to the detective Mark McPherson [Dana Andrews] when he steps out of a bathtub and asks McPherson to throw him a robe.)</p>
<p>A clue to Lydecker&#39;s character occurs in the film&#39;s first scene. He spies on Detective McPherson, who&#39;s wandering around Lydecker&#39;s apartment, browsing an extensive collection of fragile <em>objets d&#39;art</em>. McPherson goes to pick up a piece of glass and Lydecker calls out &quot;Careful, that&#39;s very valuable&quot; (I&#39;m quoting from memory). From this incident we learn two things:&#0160; that Lydecker is a collector of beautiful works of art, and that he&#39;s willing to let people look but not touch. These same two traits control Lydecker&#39;s relations to Laura: he cherishes her beauty and molds her in a Pygmalion-like way, but he&#39;s hyper-protective. For him, she becomes an untouchable work of art (the portrait of Laura, on which the camera focuses so obsessively, is the metaphorical signifier of her place in his mental world).&#0160; His cool sexuality (he&#39;s perfectly content with twice-a-week dinners) and his age (he&#39;s more interested in fathering Laura than in making love to her) are less powerful than his pygmalionism.&#0160;</p>
<p>By transforming Laura into a work of art, Lydecker attempts to preserve her virginity. He therefore shoos away her potential lovers. He destroys the career of Jacoby, the painter, by writing a vitriolic attack on him; he collects revealing information about the southern gigolo Carpenter (Vincent Price). He competes with McPherson.&#0160; t&#39;s a neat turn that to do so he becomes a detective himself -- loitering in the snow outside Laura&#39;s apartment, eavesdropping behind a post in a night club, etc.&#0160; Eventually he comes to understand that he can&#39;t preserve Laura&#39;s &quot;purity&quot;; it&#39;s then that the film turns to violence. After all is lost, he gives away the game when he says to McPherson, with visceral horror, &quot;I suppose you&#39;ll have a disgustingly earthy relationship&quot; [i.e. with Laura].&#0160;</p>
<p>It&#39;s fascinating that McPherson, though he has all the outward marks of the macho gumshoe, is himself tepid about sexuality. He lacks charisma, emotion, lust. The film allows him and Laura only one slight awkward peck of a kiss. The detective is not a creature of passion, but he may be, like Lydecker, a lover of art;&#0160; it&#39;s revealed, climactically, that Laura&#39;s portrait will be auctioned and that McPherson has put in a bid on it.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Jason Bourne has contracted the worst case of amnesia in movie history and it&#39;s going to last for at least four long films (three of them already released). Bourne&#39;s type of amnesia is very convenient for plotting because he doesn&#39;t know who he is but yet retains an astonishing range of martial and intellectual skills. He&#39;s a born-again innocent (a murderer with a newly minted heart of gold) who is shocked to discover that before he lost the marbles of memory, he was a professional murderer. He&#39;s rather charming in an idiot-savant-assassin way, but I suspect that his particular variety of amnesia is not very well known to non-Hollywood neurologists.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>It&#39;s a curious idea -- that an individual can be cleansed of his previous sins by losing his memory. And yet <em>The Bourne Identity </em>doesn&#39;t make much of this interesting moral question. &quot;Who am I&quot; is not investigated in the vocabulary of tragedy, as in Lear&#39;s &quot;Who is it who can tell me who I am&quot; but as in &quot;what&#39;s my name, what&#39;s my address, what&#39;s my phone number.&quot; Pertinent questions, surely, but not profound ones.&#0160;</p>
<p>On the other hand, King Lear never climbed down the outside of a building, handholds in the cracks between blocks of marble, nor, as far as I can remember, did he plummet&#0160;his Fiat down a series&#0160;of flights of stone stairs while being chased&#0160;by a posse of sirening motorcyclists .&#0160; &#0160;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Yesterday we watched and heard Puccini&#39;s <em>La Fanciulla del West</em> imported digitally from the big apple&#39;s Metropolitan Opera. It was shown on the enormous screen at our local Century Theater. I was overwhelmed. I usually watch opera from the nosebleed seats, which are expensive enough. With the new technology, and with the telescopic close-ups, I could look right up Deborah Voight&#39;s nostrils and into her mouth. I swear I saw her well-trained uvula vibrating. &#0160;</p>
<p><em>The Girl of the Golden West</em> is a fascinating cultural stew.&#0160; t&#39;s set in the gold-rush California of the dime novels. The play on which it&#39;s based was written by David Belasco, a London-born Sephardic Jew. The &quot;West&quot; is not real but mythological -- replete with gunslingers, a big-time bar room brawl, poker cheats, a cringe-making Indian squaw and papoose, a tough, mustachioed sheriff and a Calamity Jane-style heroine. Yet it&#39;s sung (sung!) in Italian. &quot;Dick Johnson,&quot; the romantic lead, was performed by Marcello Giordani, a chubby tenor from&#0160; Augusta, Sicily.&#0160; Interviewed during one of the far-too-long intermissions, Giordani was asked if he had any trouble playing a last-century horseback westerner. &quot;Not at all.&#0160; I grew up watching John Wayne movies.&quot; I admit to giggling at his answer, even though giggling is always inappropriate in Grand Opera. Giordani also claimed that he tried to walk like Wayne.&#0160; He didn&#39;t&#0160; -- he sashayed.&#0160;</p>
<p>John Wayne himself didn&#39;t walk the John Wayne walk until Raoul Walsh and John Ford transformed him from Marion Morrison, a furniture mover from Winterset, Iowa, into a mythological figure.&#0160;</p>
<p>Nothing in<em> La Fanciulla del West </em>actually touches ground. Or touches any ground that I recognize.&#0160;</p>
<p>Except that there are people who don&#39;t know it&#39;s a myth. Witness the recent events in Tombstone -- I mean Tucson -- Arizona. At this very moment, the Utah legislature is about to select its state weapon. The 1911 Browning pistol seems to be the gun of choice. In neighboring Arizona, it would probably be the Glock 9mm 30-round semi-automatic.</p>

				<p>Every little once in a while, a mountain lion creeps into the fold and snares a lamb, a calf, or a German shepherd. At even more infrequent intervals, a mountain lion attacks a human being (usually a child).&#0160; Whenever there&#39;s a human-lion interaction, there comes a deluge of letters to the local newspaper demanding that the authorities exercise “lethal control&quot; over the big cats. Killing catamounts is neither hard nor dangerous. They were hunted nearly to extinction in the nineteenth century. Dogs chase the animal up a tree. The brave hunter&#0160;takes aim and fires.</p>
<p>But Is it a good idea to extirpate the&#0160;mountain lion? In the United States, there’s an average of one death by mountain lion a year. Here in our county, there’s been one such death in the last hundred years. One is a very low number, especially when, in the country as a whole, snakes cause a dozen deaths each year, lightning claims seventy-five, bee and wasp stings a hundred. Dogs, when they’re not out hunting mountain lions, account for between twelve to twenty deaths a year – a couple of hundred a decade-- many of these, it&#39;s sad to say, infants in the crib. Given the numbers, It’s hard to believe that calls for the extermination of&#0160;mountain lions aren’t motivated less by facts than by fear.</p>
<p>Domesticated dogs are responsible not only for a dozen to a score of deaths, but also for an estimated 4 to 7 million (that’s right, million!) cases of dog-bite a year, almost 800,000 of which require medical attention. Dog bites cause 368,000 emergency room visits, or (do the math!) one thousand such visits a day.&#0160; The social cost of dog bites is estimated variously, but the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta claims that the direct medical costs of dog bites per year is $165 million, with many more millions in ancillary expenses.&#0160;</p>
<p>Mountain lions, which are relatively harmless, inspire terror, but dogs, which are far more dangerous, are our sacred cows -- loved, in my opinion, beyond all propriety. It’s hard not to cringe when otherwise sensible people – good decent people --tell me in all seriousness that Towser is a full member of their family, or that Fido is about to undergo surgery to replace a hip -- an operation the cost of which is more than the annual medical budget of whole villages in Africa or Asia. The run-of the-mill doggie in America enjoys a better diet and better medical care than half of the human beings on the planet -- a thoroughly indefensible skewing of resources. Dogs are not human beings, and it’s immoral sentimentality to treat them as such. It’s embarrassing.</p>
<p>The ancients, following Aristotle, divided their possessions into three categories: an object was an <em>instrumentum mutum</em>, an animal was an <em>instrumentum semivocale</em>, and a slave was an <em>instrumentum vocale</em>.&#0160; By eliding the differences between humans and animals, the Greeks and the Romans made slavery both easy and natural. Aristotle&#39;s notion underlay serfdom.</p>
<p>I used to worry that people who treated animals as humans would be tempted to treat humans as animals. But it&#39;s not so; the people I know who are sentimental about animals and &quot;animal rights&quot; are extraordinarily sensitive to human rights -- but then, perhaps my sample is skewed. All of my friends are sensitive to human rights; if they weren’t, they wouldn’t be my friends.</p>
<p>I wonder whether the love of dangerous dogs and the fear of the cats who are by and large indifferent to us isn’t an instinct acquired slowly over the last half million years. Our ancestors, armed, at best, with flint-headed spears, spent countless millennia at the mercy of feline predators larger, more powerful and more terrifying than 100-pound mountain lions (the extinct European lion, <em>panthera leo fossilis, </em>was taller, stronger, and and a foot and a half longer than the modern African lion). It was only some 50,000 years ago that an ancient Einstein conceived the idea of domesticating wolves and selecting their population for useful traits. Humans and proto-dogs started to cohabit; dwellings and caves came to be littered with coprolites. Co-evolution began, and over the course of time, dogs and humans came to be sensitive to each other&#39;s traits. Those early dogs were our first allies on this lonely, hostile planet. They could raise a ruckus when a couple or three lionesses prowled about the entrance to the cave.</p>
<p>We&#39;re indebted to dogs and so we tolerate their bad habits.&#0160; By the same token, we have inherited from our ancestors a primordial fear. Hence the over-hasty cry to exterminate the mountain lion.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Certainly not either by inheritance or conversion or moral stance. Yet Sarah Palin seems to imagine that she&#39;s Jewish -- in a peculiar, one-dimensional way. It&#39;s not always easy to guess at what&#39;s going on in that soup of a brain, but is it possible to determine what Sarah means when she claims to be a victim of a &quot;blood libel?&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>The actual&#0160;targets of the &quot;blood libel,&quot; it is no secret, are not overpaid Foxy commentators but ordinary Jews who, according to pious medieval preachers, Henry Ford, Nazi propagandists, and contemporary Syrian statesmen, make it a practice to drain innocent babes of their blood, which they then bake into matzos.&#0160;</p>
<p>Here are the exact words in which Sarah invokes this hideous accusation: &quot;journalists and pundits should not manufacture a blood libel that serves only to incite the very hatred and violence that they purport to condemn.” It&#39;s a confusing sentence, hard to explicate. Can we be confident that Sarah is learned enough to know that &quot;blood libel&quot; is a phrase with a long and agonizing history?&#0160; Are the &quot;hatred and violence,&quot; which she claims are visited upon her, designed to recall the pogroms (and worse) that have been precipitated by the &quot;blood libel&quot;?&#0160; If her sentence is to be taken seriously, Sarah believes that she is the victim of an attack analogous to the worst kind of anti-Semitic ravings. Just as Jews are accused of killing Christian children, so has Sarah herself been unjustly accused of killing Representative Gabrielle Giffords. In her scenario, in her analogy, she herself, Sarah Palin, is the Jew.&#0160;</p>
<p>In her daily deeds, Sarah Palin does not seem to understand or embrace aspects of Jewish tradition such as compassion, the centrality of community, a deep reverence for education and learning, fierce and informed intellectuality, and robust philanthropy. Pure and simple, she sees herself as a victim -- a condition or state of mind, which, in my opinion, is not only incorrect but dangerous to the polity and to her own self-regard.</p>
<p>In short, she&#39;s scammed herself.</p>

				<p>Eddie Rice has served in World War II, won a silver star, but lost his memory to a piece of shrapnel buried in this brain (the x-ray is flashed onto the screen). It&#39;s an &quot;organic&quot; rather than &quot;psychological&quot; amnesia and therefore incurable. Released from a hospital, Eddie returns home to L. A. to find that he was once Eddie Riccardi and that he was a no-good, double-crossing hood, hated by both police and former gang members and also distrusted by his ex-wife. Eddie Rice is a Dr. Jekyll, but his pre-amnesia self was a Mr. Hyde. It&#39;s a curious and unexplained transformation -- from evil to good. There is almost no psychological continuity between his ante- and post-trauma personality. Eddie the amnesiac is utterly untroubled to discover that he was once a monster. He extricates himself from the mob, jettisons his past, and starts a new life. His amnesia is a thing apart.&#0160;</p>
<p>The direction (by Robert&#0160;Florey) and the noir cinematography are splendid. John Payne, a fine, underappreciated actor, (as Rice/Riccardi) cannot&#0160;possibly convey the psychological complexity that should have been, but wasn&#39;t,&#0160;written into the script.</p>

				<p>This reminiscence will not mean much to anyone but my born-and-bred-in-Brooklyn readers.&#0160;</p>
<p>One of my smart schoolyard buddies, Jimmy Nolan, won a scholarship to Columbia. He was a year or two older than I, and the first of our gang/crowd to venture out of the neighborhood. The summer after his first college year, we were sitting in front of the candy store, drinking egg creams and practicing our spitting, when someone asked Jimmy &quot;what&#39;s it like up there.&quot; &quot;Up there&quot; was the far north, Morningside Heights, in Manhattan, where Columbia was located -- the end of the earth, kind of. Jimmy said, &quot;You might not believe this, but up there they pronounce &quot;hua,&quot; &quot;hor.&quot;</p>
<p>I remember thinking,&#0160;why would they do so?&#0160; Don&#39;t they know any better?</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Last night, on the big HDTV, with&#0160;the collaboration of&#0160;Netflix, and peering through our toes,&#0160;we watched the John Ford cavalry movie &quot;Rio Grande.&quot;&#0160;I first&#0160;saw this film in the year of its release (I was eleven years old) at the Leader Theater on Coney Island Avenue.&#0160;</p>
<p>In days of yore,&#0160;it was the custom for the neighborhood&#0160;urchins to take in a double bill on a rainy Saturday afternoon.&#0160; It was a good way for our harried mothers to dispose of us for four hours --&#0160;and on the cheap, inasmuch as&#0160;the price of admission was only fourteen cents.&#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;Rio Grande&quot; was a perfect kind of urchin movie. Good guys (cavalry) versus bad guys (Indians), lots of action, no overt sex. It offered much too much singing, but the slow periods would have been enlivened by hoots, whistles, popcorn-throwing, banging the head of the kid in the seat in front of you with the heel of your hand, primitive pre-flirting, and chasing in the aisles.</p>
<p>In 1950, Maureen O&#39;Hara (John Wayne&#39;s estranged wife), was puzzling if not inexplicable&#0160; -- merely an impediment to the action. Sixty years later, she is beautiful, dignified, even majestic. The poor Apaches, who for me and for my heedless comrades were nothing other than targets for cavalry bullets, are now unutterably tragic. John Wayne was then an immensely heroic figure, but with the passing of years. he has become a rigid incompetent dope.&#0160;</p>
<p>The West, in those days, was part Monument Valley, part myth;&#0160; now I live in a West that has nothing to do with Coney Island Avenue, even less with John Ford.&#0160;&#0160;</p>

				<p>Just back from the post office, where I mailed the granddaughter her gift, a zester. What is a zester, you ask?&#0160; It&#39;s a kitchen device designed to remove the &quot;zest,&quot; that is, the outermost skin of a citrus fruit.&#0160; The granddaughter&#39;s zester is an inch and a half wide and thirteen inches long, including its five inch handle. Essentially, it&#39;s a hand-held grater, very useful if you&#39;re a cooking enthusiast. And why, you ask, would I venture out in 15F, snowy weather to mail the zester to California, when the grand-daughter could have put it in her backpack when she returned home? Because, I was creditably advised, the zester would certainly be confiscated by airport security.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>What have we come to, when, rightly or&#0160;wrongly, we seriously entertain the idea that an eleven-year-old child could hijack an airplane armed only with a zester?&#0160;&#0160;What would she do, abrade the pilot to death?&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>The Sons of Confederate Veterans celebrated themselves with a&#0160;$100-per-person Secession Ball on Dec. 20 in Gaillard Municipal Auditorium in Charleston.&#0160; The event centered on a play highlighting key moments from the signing of South Carolina’s Ordinance of Secession 150 years ago.&#0160; Jeff Antley, who organized&#0160;the event, said that the Secession Ball honors South Carolinians&#0160;who stood up for their rights.&#0160; “The secession movement in South Carolina was a demonstration of freedom,” said Antley. “What I’m doing is honoring the men from this state who stood up for their self-government and their rights under law.&quot;</p>
<p>Is the act of secesion a &quot;demonstration of freedom?&quot;&#0160;&#0160;What sort of freedom?&#0160; Let us now read from&#0160;South Carolina&#39;s Articles of Secession, which asserts that the federal government has impinged upon states&#39; rights.&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000bf;">&quot;The right of property in slaves was recognized [under the Constitution] by giving to free persons distinct political rights, by giving them the right to represent, and burthening them with direct taxes for three-fifths of their slaves; by authorizing the importation of slaves for twenty years; and by stipulating for the rendition of fugitives from labor. </span><br /><br /><span style="color: #0000bf;">We affirm that these ends for which this Government was instituted have been defeated, and the Government itself has been made destructive of them by the action of the non-slaveholding States. Those States have assumed the right of deciding upon the propriety of our domestic institutions; and have denied the rights of property established in fifteen of the States and recognized by the Constitution; they have denounced as sinful the institution of slavery; they have permitted open establishment among them of societies, whose avowed object is to disturb the peace and to eloign the property of the citizens of other States. They have encouraged and assisted thousands of our slaves to leave their homes; and those who remain, have been incited by emissaries, books and pictures to servile insurrection. </span><br /><br /><span style="color: #0000bf;">For twenty-five years this agitation has been steadily increasing, until it has now secured to its aid the power of the common Government. Observing the forms of the Constitution, a sectional party has found within that Article establishing the Executive Department, the means of subverting the Constitution itself. A geographical line has been drawn across the Union, and all the States north of that line have united in the election of a man to the high office of President of the United States, whose opinions and purposes are hostile to slavery. He is to be entrusted with the administration of the common Government, because he has declared that that &quot;Government cannot endure permanently half slave, half free,&quot; and that the public mind must rest in the belief that slavery is in the course of ultimate extinction. </span><br /><br /><span style="color: #0000bf;">This sectional combination for the submersion of the Constitution, has been aided in some of the States by elevating to citizenship, persons who, by the supreme law of the land, are incapable of becoming citizens; and their votes have been used to inaugurate a new policy, hostile to the South, and destructive of its beliefs and safety.&quot;</span></p>
<p>Yes, it&#39;s true.&#0160; Citizens&#0160;of some states have not captured&#0160;fugitive slaves or returned them to their owners, have denounced slavery as sinful, have elected a president who is hostile to the &quot;peculiar institution,&quot; and&#0160;have (horror of horrors! even granted citizenship to former slaves.&#0160;</p>
<p>The South Carolina document is extraordinarily clear.&#0160; Can anyone fairly doubt that&#0160;there would have been no secession and therefore no&#0160;need for a Secession Ball except in defense of slavery?&#0160; The&#0160;&quot;demonstration of freedom&quot; is nothing more than a celebration of the&#0160; freedom of one person to own another.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Nowadays, when slavery is no longer defensible, &quot;conservative&quot; South Carolinians are reduced to protecting their guaranteed right to make life difficult for&#0160;gays and immigrants.&#0160; And keep women in their places.&#0160; A far cry from their glorious past.&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;But they continue to&#0160;nurture that&#0160;nostalgia&#0160;for the great old antebellum days. &#0160; <br /><br /></p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>In <em>Pickwick Papers, </em>Pickwick checks into the Great White Horse Inn in Ipswich,&#0160;is shown to his room by a chamber-maid only to discover&#0160;that he&#39;s left his watch downstairs.&#0160; He retrieves it but then cannot find his way back to his room.&#0160;&#0160;He&#39;s utterly, hopelessly lost. &quot;Rows of doors... branched&#0160;off in every possible direction.&#0160; A dozen times did he softly turn the handle of some bed-room door which resembled his own, when a gruff cry from within of &quot;Who the devil&#39;s that&quot; caused him to steal away....&#0160; He was reduced to the verge of despair when an open door attracted his attention.&#0160; He peeped in.... There were the two beds, whose situation he perfectly remembered.&quot;&#0160; Pickwick steps inside and has removed his clothes when another person enters the room.&#0160; He conceals himself.&#0160; Bad turns to worse.&#0160;&#0160;&quot;Mr. Pickwick almost fainted with horror and dismay.&#0160; Standing before the dressing-glass was a middle-aged woman in yellow curl-papers, busily&#0160;engaged in brushing her hair....&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; &#39;I never met with anything so awful as this,&#39; thought Mr. Pickwick, &#39;what a dreadful thing.&#39;&#0160; Uncertain how to proceed, Pickwick &#39;ha-hums.&#39;&#0160; &quot;Gracious Heaven!&quot; said the middle-aged lady, &quot;what&#39;s that?&quot;&#0160; &quot;It&#39;s -- it&#39;s -- only a gentleman, ma&#39;am.&quot;&#0160; &quot;A gentleman!&quot; said the lady, with a terrific scream.&#0160; &quot;It&#39;s all over!&quot; thought Mr. Pickwick.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>The expected complications ensue.&#0160; At last, Pickwick flees,&#0160;carrying his clothes and dropping his shoes.&#0160;&#0160;But the nightmare continues because he still can&#39;t locate his assigned chamber.&#0160;&#0160;Fortunately, he runs into his servant, Mr. Samuel Weller, who escorts him back home.</p>
<p>Clearly, Mr. Pickwick is directionally disabled.</p>
<p>Am I the only directionally-challenged person for whom&#0160;Pickwick&#39;s story is a horrible fear.&#0160;&#0160;I&#39;ve had repeated nightmares of exactly this complexion.&#0160; In fact, I&#39;ve dreamed this very dream dozens, perhaps scores of times.&#0160;&#0160;I check into a hotel, go for a walk in a strange city and then, for some reason, the elevator doesn&#39;t go to my floor, or the staircase comes to a sudden end, or the room numbers go from 401 to 405 when I know that my room is 403.&#0160; I wander endlessly until I wake up in a sweat, heart pounding.</p>
<p>And now I have to admit that&#0160;I once narrowly dodged this embarrassment.&#0160; In real life.&#0160;&#0160;I was staying at&#0160;a bed-and-breakfast somewhere in the west of Ireland.&#0160;&#0160;There was no private bathroom -- the facilities were&#0160;down the hall and a half a flight downstairs.&#0160;&#0160;In the middle of the night, after obeying a call of nature,&#0160;attempting to return to my room, I stepped&#0160;into a room that was not mine.&#0160; I was just about to get into bed with a strange party when I realized my predicament.&#0160;&#0160;Fortunately, I was able to escape without waking anyone.&#0160;&#0160;I found my own room (good thing there were only two to a floor) but I was in&#0160;quite a state for an hour or so.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>As I&#39;m writing this, I&#39;m guessing that most of my readers will harrumph their feelings of superiority.&#0160; &quot;Couldn&#39;t happen to me.&quot; My directionally dyslexic friends, however, will understand.&#0160; And they will also know why I sympathize and empathize with poor Pickwick.&#0160;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I watched <em>Rebel Without A Cause </em>last night in&#0160;a state of constant twitching puzzlement.&#0160; Why has this film&#0160;become a cult classic?&#0160; How can we account for the&#0160;iconic appeal of James Dean, who moves me not the least bit?&#0160; How did thirty-five-year-olds manage to pass for high school kids in 50s movies?&#0160; Why, in those ancient days, did every male seem to wear a tie and jacket round the clock?&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>The&#0160;movie seemed like a period piece, dug up from some archive&#0160; -- &#0160;which is&#0160;odd, because I was 16 and a high school student in 1955 when <em>Rebel Without&#0160;a Cause </em>was released.&#0160; It should have spoken to me then, or now.&#0160; But didn&#39;t and doesn&#39;t, not a bit.&#0160;</p>
<p>The&#0160;Eisenhower decade was the great age of&#0160;suburban &quot;juvenile delinquency,&quot; so-called.&#0160; What do these kids want?&#0160; They all have their expensive cars and the war is over.&#0160; The teen-agers, all of them, are utterly inarticulate.&#0160; They&#39;re also shockingly unfeeling.&#0160; When Buzz Gunderson dies in the &quot;chickie run,&quot; he is not mourned, even for a femtosecond, and within a few hours, his girlfriend Judy has fallen in love with Buzz&#39;s rival, Jim Stark.&#0160;</p>
<p>Nor, in this film, is the&#0160;adult generation is any&#0160;more admirable -- the wives and mothers are shrews, the men grotesquely henpecked.&#0160; The film has a strong gay subtext throughout -- most apparent in the Jim Stark-Plato relationship.&#0160; I&#39;m sure that I wouldn&#39;t have noticed it in 1955, but it kind of jumps at you nowadays.&#0160;</p>
<p>1950s juvenile delinquents came in two categories:&#0160; urban deprived and rich suburban alienated.&#0160; I was of neither one class nor the other.&#0160; True that we had to be constantly on our toes to keep clear of the one group, but the other (those depicted in this film) might just as well have been&#0160;living on another planet.</p>
<p>A dangerous planet, as it turned out, for the makers of <em>Rebel Without a Cause.&#0160; </em>James Dean was already dead when the film was released, having been killed in an automobile accident.&#0160; Sal Mineo was murdered in 1976.&#0160; Natalie Wood, drunk, drowned in 1981.&#0160; Nick Adams died of a drug overdose in 1968.&#0160; The film&#39;s talented director, Nicholas Ray, discovered his wife, Gloria Grahame, in bed with his thirteen-year-old son, whom she later married.&#0160; Ray died prematurely of drugs and alcohol.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>In order to illustrate the precarious social standing of Mr. Smouch, who takes Pickwick into custody for debt, Dickens described his carriage&#0160;as neither one thing or another.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;The vehicle was not exactly a gig, neither was it a stanhope.&#0160; It was not what is currently denominated a dog-cart, neither was it a taxed-cart, nor a chaise-cart, nor a guillotined cabriolet;&#0160; and yet it had something of the character of each and every of these machines.&#0160; It was painted a bright yellow, with the shafts and wheels picked out in black, and the driver sat, in the orthodox sporting style, on cushions piled about two feet above the rail.&#0160; The horse was a bay, a well-looking animal enough;&#0160; but with something of the flash and dog-fighting air about him, nevertheless, which accorded both&#0160;the vehicle and his master.&quot;</p>
<p>The original readers of <em>Pickwick Papers </em>would have known exactly what is meant by a &quot;guillotined cabriolet.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;I suspect that there&#39;s a joke there, but the joke has perished.&#0160;&#0160;I certainly don&#39;t get it.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Is there also joke in &quot;bright yellow?&quot;&#0160; What is the usual color of a gig or stanhope?</p>
<p>There might be all kinds of jokes in the following&#0160;list of&#0160;socially-crepuscular&#0160;horsedrawn vehicles, none of which precipitate hilarity, but of which the sum amuses me greatly:&#0160;&#0160;barouche, basket carriage, berlin, <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2006/01/new_words.html">britchka</a>, brougham, buckboard, buggy, cabriolet, caleche, cariole, carryall, chaise, chariot, clarence, concord wagon, coupe, croydon, curricle, cutter, daumont, dearborn, dennet, diligence, dog-cart, fiacre, fly, fourgon, four-wheeler, gig, go-cart, governess cart, hansom, herdic, jaunty car, jersey-wagon, kibitka, landau, <a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2010/04/horsedrawn-vehicle.html.html " target="_self">patache</a>, phaeton, pill-box, post-chaise, rockaway, shandrydan, shay, sociable, spider-phaeton, spring-van, stanhope, sulky, surrey, T-cart, telyezhka, tilbury, <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2008/01/the-tarantass.html">tarantass</a>, trap, troika, victoria, vis-a-vis, wagonette,&#0160;and&#0160;wurt.&#0160;</p>

				<p>Sometime in the early 1950s I was given a great gift: a hand-knitted gray-and-white Norwegian sweater. It may have been a bit too large for me, but I wore it almost every day through high school and college and for many years thereafter. True, it became a little ratty around the waist, but my mother-in-law, a skilled knitter, was able to repair it, and did so, more than once. The leather elbow patches were my own contribution, and if they&#0160;were not exactly symmetrically placed, so what?&#0160; I disagreed with those who felt that the beauty of the garment&#0160;was compromised by the vivid mustard stain on the right sleeve. I was still wearing the sweater in the 1980s, when my daughter begged it. Of course I gave it to her, but I now believe that she was in surreptitious league with other members of my family to get the sweater out of my hands and off my back. I&#39;ve never seen her wear it.</p>
<p>It was in the 1970s that I received another gift of an important garment -- a Guatemalan shirt -- a camisa -- of the sort worn in Todos Santos: a multicolored embroidered -- &#0160;or is it brocaded -- piece of fabric attached to a blue-and-white striped shift that hung&#0160;down to mid-thigh -- very convenient for use as towel or hot cloth. I loved that shirt&#0160;and wore it even to work. It&#39;s possible that some people dismissed me as an&#0160;eccentric or that others presumed that&#0160;I was making an anti-colonial statement, but in fact I just thought the shirt&#0160;was comfortable and handsome. I remember overhearing&#0160; a student&#0160;-- one of the brainless ones -- who hated college, hated literature, and hated me -- mumble under his breath (in those days I could still hear), &quot;Well, at least he&#39;s not a dull dresser.&quot; I don&#39;t know what became of the&#0160;camisa. I suspect that it was <em>desaparecida</em>.</p>
<p>Another favorite garment was a yellow leather shirt jacket which I wore until it shredded. This jacket ran into trouble on a cross-country trip when it was packed on top of the car, under a canvas. It lay too close to a dyed leather coat&#0160;(not mine) and during a flash Nebraska rainstorm was thoroughly&#0160; soaked and acquired a large purple stain. I didn&#39;t mind, because the stain was in the back, but I bowed to social pressure and gave it up, which was a shame, because I didn&#39;t get more than twenty years use out of it.&#0160;&#0160;And then there was that lovely orange-brown corduroy jacket that I bought at the Presbyterian thrift store for $2.00. That was real beauty.&#0160; So was the&#0160;tailored denim&#0160;suit coat&#0160;which I have vainly tried to replace&#0160;--&#0160;they just don&#39;t make them like that any more.&#0160;</p>
<p>Still another memorable&#0160;garment: a green hooded cotton sweatshirt that, after I had worn it for a decade or so, was nicely broken in.&#0160;It had lots of wear left in it, but I made the dreadful error&#0160;of mentioning to&#0160; my&#0160;daughter-in-law that, wearing it, I had twice been taken for a homeless person. She&#0160;snatched the sweatshirt away from me and&#0160;threw it into the garbage (I rescued it for rags). She then immediately went out and bought me a perfectly lovely new Carhartt hooded sweatshirt, very high quality, with a zipper and everything, which I have worn&#0160;every day during the cold months for two seasons and which will, within a dozen or so years, no doubt become quite comfortable.&#0160;</p>

				<p>In the summer of 1963, we were somewhere in southern Illinios on our first cross-country adventure (the first of many).&#0160; I was not an&#0160;experienced driver and the Nash Rambler was not a superb-handling car.&#0160; We were driving a&#0160;two-lane, and it was raining hard , and&#0160;something happened (can&#39;t remember what) that caused me to brake much&#0160;too hard. The&#0160;car spun out of control, first swinging&#0160;into the oncoming lane (empty, thank you very much) and then rotating into a three or four foot ditch on the right side of the road.</p>
<p>I was grateful&#0160;to be&#0160;alive but I knew that I was&#0160;in a predicament.&#0160; How to get the Rambler back on the road?&#0160;</p>
<p>Within a&#0160;minute, a small truck pulled up behind me.&#0160; A hale-fellow Elks-Lions-Rotary-Presbyterian kind of guy stepped out, assessed the situation, hitched a cable to the Rambler and winched us out of the ditch.&#0160; Took him two minutes max.&#0160; He said, &quot;you OK?&quot; and drove off.</p>
<p>Many thanks to that man.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>In 1984, I had to fly from&#0160;Lebanon, New Hampshire to Salt Lake City through Boston.&#0160; We were fogged in at Lebanon and I didn&#39;t arrive at Logan until a few minutes before my next leg was about to leave.&#0160; Logan consisted&#0160;then (probably still does) of half-a-dozen separate terminals linked by a bus line.&#0160;&#0160;I went up to a man in a uniform and I&#0160;asked him where, in the jumble, would I find&#0160;Continental.&#0160; I told him that I had&#0160;less than&#0160;twenty minutes&#0160;to board.&#0160; He said, &quot;wait right here.&#0160; I&#39;ll&#0160;get you there on time.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;He was not a policeman, as I thought,&#0160;but a uniformed chauffeur to some Rich Person.&#0160; After a few minutes he&#0160;returned, having launched&#0160;his&#0160;employer.&#0160;&#0160;He took me to&#0160;his extra-long Cadillac limousine and&#0160;speeded me to my terminal.</p>
<p>Many thanks to that man</p>
<p>And&#0160;to all the other&#0160;anonymous people who have helped me with life&#39;s travels and travails.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Am I becoming&#0160;sentimental?&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>

				<p>It&#39;s been a Charles Dickens revival here.&#0160; The Dickens&#0160;formula -- &quot;make them laugh, make them cry, make them wait&quot; -- works as well for me now as it did fifty years ago.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>I was curious to fill in the gaps in my knowledge, so&#0160;I trotted over&#0160;to the library and found a newish biography of Dickens.&#0160; It looked eminently respectable:&#0160; St. Martin&#39;s Press and its author a &quot;Professor of English Studies&quot; at the University of Stirling.&#0160;</p>
<p>But youch, what a travesty the new &quot;biography&quot;&#0160;turned out to be.&#0160;</p>
<p>Here follow&#0160;some sentences (none of which I&#39;ve altered in the least) from a book which&#0160;has the temerity to call itself <em>Charles Dickens, A Literary Life.&#0160;</em> Prepare yourself for&#0160;pretention, bathos, meandering metaphors&#0160;and syntactic peculiarities marinated in post-modern obfuscation.&#0160;&#0160;Savor these monstrosities.&#0160;<em>&#0160; </em></p>
<p>&quot;&#39;Dickens,&#39; a convenient and perhaps unavoidable label, masks a range of Dickenses, which, taken together, constitute a highly complex whole.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In short, this book will attempt to separate out at least some of the contextual forces that flowed through Dickens&#39;s pen along with the ink at the moment when he sat down to the ostensibly solitary and private process of making that series of black marks on white paper that we call novels.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Suffering is a crucial part of the artistic process and the artist is seen as quite different from the ordinary run of people through his possession of a creative power akin to that of God in His creation of the world.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This aspect of his career can be explored in a number of ways, in his deep respect for his own activity as a novelist as well as in an intense concern to extract his full pound of flesh financially from publishers and also, in a sense, from the public.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A dramatic opening and an exciting climax are desirable features of any narrative, but the desire to impose them on historical narratives may distort the flow that is an inherent aspect of historical process.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But the facts and arguments of this chapter show that the point at which Pickwick Papers came into being was one of turbulence in publishing which carried with it, as periods of turbulence always do, possibilities of movement in a variety of directions.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The serial violates the decorum appropriate to high art and the imagery of the passage embodies a distate of profusion which could be likened to a class-based disdain for the crowded urban environment and dislike of such new-fangled phenomena as the railway.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Public school meant the classics and, in England, university spelled Oxford or Cambridge, &#39;advantages&#39; which Dickens conspicuously lacked.&quot;</p>
<p>I could wisecrack about each of the above sentences, but I&#39;m in a more-in-sorrow-than-in-anger frame of mind.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;Why oh why do academics feel they have to write this way?&#0160;&#0160;Such woeful prose and trumpeting obviousness compromise the reputations of sober scholars and teachers.&#0160;</p>
<p>Does the author of this book realize that he&#39;s&#0160;bamboozling himself?&#0160; &#0160;&#0160;Does he know how&#0160;ridiculous he is?&#0160;</p>

				<p>My first railroad (not subway) trip was in 1945 -- a New York Central train from NYC to Glens Falls, New York.&#0160; I was dazzled but queasy;&#0160; it was a coal-burning engine&#0160;and the smoke was both visible and smellable.&#0160; I spent my infant time looking out the window and studying the adjacent&#0160;set of tracks as they combined and separated -- a most vivid memory.&#0160; I was born into a sedentary family&#0160;and have no further recollection of being in a train again until&#0160;1952 when Aunt Mollie took me to Washington.&#0160;We ate dinner on the train, a marvelous luxury.&#0160;&#0160;in 1956, testing my adolescent independence,&#0160;I voyaged&#0160;to Ithaca on the old Lehigh Valley R. R. (the &quot;Leaky V.), then in its dotage and quite seedy.&#0160; During the late 1950s, &#0160;I occasionally rode up to Utica NY on the NY Central.&#0160; The round-trip fare was an astonishingly steep&#0160;$20.50, or half a week&#39;s work.&#0160; But afterwards it was almost all automobiles.&#0160; I don&#39;t know that I was on a train again until 1975-76, when I commuted weekly from Canterbury (second class with the accompaniment of&#0160;Cadbury chocolates) to Charing Cross station.&#0160; Calais to Paris, 1976. I can remember&#0160;also Lugano to Florence to Rome, c. 1990, and Stockholm to Copenhagen a decade later.&#0160; NYC to DC, on Amtrak, many times&#0160;around the turn of the new millenium.&#0160; Not a great deal of train travel, but then, as we all know, the railroads are a&#0160;glorious but dying institution, at least in the US.&#0160; Nor adventuresome either:&#0160; no Orient Express or Trans-Siberian.&#0160; Planes?&#0160; My first trip was from NYC to Ithaca, on&#0160;a&#0160;12 seat Mohawk -- perhaps to this day my smallest plane and&#0160;bumpiest flight.&#0160; Many, many trips&#0160;from Boston to NYC (Eastern Airlines), from Logan to LaGuardia and back.&#0160; A dozen&#0160;or so jumps&#0160;across the water to Europe, all of them accompanied with headaches and disorientation.&#0160;&#0160;My longest so far:&#0160; Denver to Port Elizabeth, South Africa.&#0160; To Hawaii and back.&#0160;To San Jose, Costa Rica.&#0160; Innumerable,&#0160;far too many, &#0160;domestic flights from Denver to NYC, Denver to Oakland, Denver to DC -- all highly routinized.&#0160; At first, decades ago, flying was romantic;&#0160; dinner was served;&#0160; people dressed up for the experience.&#0160;&#0160;Now it&#39;s being sardined into a grudging Greyhound in the sky, with bodyscans and shoe checks to boot.&#0160; And waste:&#0160; all that time and money thrown into the sea&#0160;looking for plastic explosives&#0160;secreted&#0160;in &#0160;my retired-teacher/ grandpa orifices.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>The word Greyhound reminds me those horrible 1950s trips (midnight to 8am) from the Port Authority on 34th and 8th to Ithaca with &quot;rest stops&quot;&#0160;in East Stroudsburg and Scranton at 3am, with&#0160;no food available except rancid sandwiches from the slot machines.&#0160; I cannot shake the&#0160;memory of the awful smell of&#0160;spoiled tuna, gas fumes, eructations and flatulence on those filthy cramped buses.&#0160;&#0160;Nor of the degenerate displaying his private parts in the men&#39;s room in Hackettstown, New Jersey one slushy night.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>But put me in a car on a two-lane anywhere&#0160;west of the Mississippi, with no particular place to go,&#0160;and I&#39;m one happy guy.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Cherry pie in Hannibal, Missouri or breakfast at the Jesse James Cafe in Casey, Iowa.&#0160; Bliss!</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>As a youth, I could memorize poetry with great ease. &#0160;Nowadays, with a toe into the water of my&#0160;eighth decade,&#0160;what was once a snap has become a frustration.&#0160;&#0160;But inasmuch as the authorities continually remind us geezers that we need to keep the intelligence well-lubricated, I persist.&#0160;&#0160;Yet it now takes two or three hard weeks to memorize a speech in one of&#0160;Shakespeare&#39;s plays that, fifty years ago, I might have learned in less than an hour.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been trying to commit to the old brain&#0160;Othello&#39;s magnificent speech about wooing&#0160;Desdemona&#0160;-- the one with &quot;antres vast and deserts idle&quot; -- about which I reported <a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2010/11/antres-vast.html" target="_self">last week.</a>&#0160;&#0160; Instead of memorizing fluently and quickly, my swiss cheese brain continually&#0160;generates gaps, fissures and holes.&#0160; For example, take this passage.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>This to hear would Desdemona seriously incline</p>
<p>But still the house affairs would draw her thence</p>
<p>Which ever as she could with haste dispatch</p>
<p>She&#39;d come again, and with a greedy ear</p>
<p>Devour up my discourse.</p>
<p>There&#39;s no reason why this sentence shouldn&#39;t be easy enough.&#0160;&#0160;I read and study it, but when&#0160;I shut the book and try to recite, it comes up this way:</p>
<p>She&#39;d come again and with a&#0160; greedy [empty space]&#0160;</p>
<p>Devour up my discourse.&#0160;</p>
<p>The word &quot;ear&quot; has evaporated, or rather fallen into the&#0160;black hole of memory, or gotten stuck in the synaptic link between two nerve cells.</p>
<p>I peer into the book&#0160;once again and take a second crack.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>She&#39;d come again and with a greedy ear</p>
<p>Devour up my [empty space].&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Ear appears, discourse disappears.&#0160; And so on through the thirty-two line passages.&#0160; Nouns sink beneath the waves and then&#0160;bob to the surface.&#0160; And these lacunae occur again and again. And again.</p>
<p>It is fascinating to me that I retain the rhythm of the pentameter line and that I always&#0160;know that I am missing a two-syllable noun.&#0160; Nevertheless,&#0160;the precise word will not emerge -- at least at the moment that I need it.&#0160; But it&#39;s there, coated with polysaccharides, lurking in an&#0160;obscure empty space behind a neuron.&#0160;&#0160;It&#39;s astonishing that the words that disappear are almost always nouns.&#0160; I have very little trouble with other parts of speech.&#0160; But then noun-loss is a recognized characteristic&#0160;of&#0160;your &quot;mature&quot; brain.&#0160;</p>
<p>Because it has taken so&#0160;long to memorize, I have become extremely well-acquainted with the speech.&#0160; Slow motion has its advantages.&#0160;&#0160;Othello tells us that Desdemona would come &quot;with greedy ear [to] devour up [his] discourse.&quot;&#0160; It wasn&#39;t until I had gone over that sentence a hundred times that I realized that&#0160;Shakespeare used &quot;devour&quot; to connect with the &quot;cannibals that do each other eat&quot; in the earlier part of the speech.&#0160;&#0160;It&#39;s a purposeful&#0160;comparison:&#0160;while wandering and errant Othello encountered anthropophagi, domestic Desdemona, confined to house affairs, was only able to eat words.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Clever fellow, that Will S.&#0160;</p>

				<p>When I was a child, there were two neighborhood dentists.&#0160;&#0160;One was named Caress and the other was named Yankowitz. &#0160;My parents chose Nathan Caress, possibly for onomastic reasons, but they might have made a mistake; &#0160;Nathan Caress&#0160;should have been called Nathan Butcher. &#0160;Dentistry sixty years ago was much inferior to dentistry today, especially in our dark corner of the universe. &#0160;There was no anaesthetics, no novacaine. &#0160;Baby teeth that developed cavities were summarily yankowitzed with a pair of what looked like industrial pliers. &#0160;Adult teeth that needed repair were excavated with a low-speed mechanical drill, then sterilized with carbolic acid, and filled with a mercury compound that has over the years not doubt lowered my IQ by dozens or scores of points. Dentistry was painful. No, it wasn&#39;t painful, it was torture. &#0160;Dr. Caress, whose office was in the living room of his house on Rugby Road, had a big black ugly mole on his left cheek. I studied that mole for many too many hours.</p>
<p>Sometime in my early teens I was sent to an orthodontist, Irving Pollack, who had a very official suite of rooms in a high-rise on Joralemon Street, a subway ride away. &#0160;I am grateful to him because, although he made a miserable adolescence even more miserable, his &quot;appliances&quot; helped keep my mismatched, askew anthology of teeth in my head. &#0160;In fact, I have all but one of them to this day. &#0160;</p>
<p>No thanks to my next dentist, T. Gorfein of Cambridge, Massachusetts, a genuine criminal who asserted that I had twenty-two cavities and set out to fill them. I left him after a couple of weeks, not because I was wise enough to suspect that he was&#0160; a cheat,&#0160;but because while he was working on me, he called over his assistant and said -- genuine historical quote coming here -- &quot;Would you look at that sucker bleed.&quot; &#0160;At the university clinic, the dentist to whom I was assigned could find only two cavities, which she (my first female practitioner) painlessly filled. I must have had other dental experiences before Colorado&#39;s Amiot and Johnson, both of whom were competent but both of whom insisted on talking Republican nonsense to defenseless me while my mouth was filled with equipment and fat fingers. Johnson left a crown too high, causing enormous pain; searching for an alternative for his ham-handedness, I remembered that I had bus-commuted with a dental student who seemed intelligent. She became a dentista of high regard for many years until she took very early retirement from the trade -- I never knew why. She sold her practice to another competent woman who charges outrageous sky high prices for her services, but keeps me healthy.</p>
<p>So the score as we head into overtime: &#0160;one fake tooth, two root canal jobs, a couple of tender spots, two unerupted wisdom teeth waiting to cause trouble, but unabated ability to eat and enjoy corn on the cob. Nevertheless, lots of residual Caress-caused nervousness every time I need to see someone in the tooth business. &#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Our final stop on the road westward was Gothenburg, Nebraska.&#0160; We set up the old canvas tent in a park in the heart of town and slept to the screeching of cicadas (a sound new to me).&#0160; (In those days we couldn&#39;t possibly have afforded the $10 or $15 for a motel.)&#0160;&#0160;By noon the next day we had reached Crook, Colorado (population 128 in 2000 but considerably more in 1969 -- the town was then large enough to support a restaurant and a gas station). We ate lunch but when we got back into the green Dodge station wagon, purchased ($2500) for our new life in the Rockies, we discovered that something had gone terribly wrong with the gears and that the car would only go backwards. I worried that we were going to be stuck in Crook with two boys under four years old while we waited for a transmission part to be trucked in from Detroit. Filled with financial trepidation, I backed the car around the block (there was only one block, fortunately) to the town&#39;s lone mechanic. He said he&#39;d &quot;take a look.&quot; He did, got himself a great big screwdriver and banged away under the hood for a few minutes. &quot;Fixed it.&quot; When he charged me $1.00 for the service, I began to think well of Colorado. We piled back into the car and continued with the last 150 miles of the trip, gazing at the mountains in the distance and the arid steppes, populated only by the occasional cow -- with nary a human being in view.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>We made it to Boulder sometime in that &#0160;same afternoon. It took a while to find the house we had rented by mail. We missed it on the first pass and drove by the old Pioneer Cemetery, which became our first landmark. We had no idea that we had rented a cute small 1915 arts and crafts bungalow with the original fir woodwork still intact -- what a change from our Manhattan apartment overlooking Broadway. Our few sticks of furniture were delayed in transit (and would be for three weeks), so we all slept on air mattresses for the while.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>The Daughter (at whose request I am writing this reminiscence), was conceived before the furniture arrived.</p>
<p>Our landlord and next-door neighbor was Jack David Angus Ogilvy, a rangy cowboy and professor of Anglo-Saxon who was, contrary to all expectations, a distant relative of the queen of England.&#0160; (Was it 1969 or the next year that I met Jack&#39;s cousin, a pimply English boy named Angus, known across the sea as Lord Ogilvy)?&#0160; That was a surprise. Another surprise:&#0160; the alley behind our house was bordered with a huge crop of wild plums. The boys discovered the plums very soon after our arrival.</p>
<p>I was taken by surprise by the Colorado light.&#0160; &#0160;had always lived in the cloudy east, and that bright western sun was a complete surprise. High altitude, no humidity, and very big sky. I&#39;m still not quite used to it. &#0160;</p>
<p>Boulder was not the sophosticated, foodie, high-tech, trendy town it has become. It was all white bread, the downtown unMalled and still dominated by banks, car dealerships, Valentine&#39;s Hardware, Smith&#39;s Shoes, a big old Woolworth&#39;s and wide empty streets. There were only a few restaurants -- I remember the Harbin Inn, a mediocre Chinese joint, and the Gondolier ditto but Italian (still in business but much changed). And our favorite, the Aristocrat, a breakfast place with portions that could remedy in a single sitting those dangerous drops in cholesterol.</p>
<p>On our first day in town, we drove by Boulder High School. Mrs. Dr. M. said, &quot;That&#39;s where I want to teach when I go back to teaching.&quot; Which she did, a few years later and then for many years.&#0160;&#0160;</p>

				<p>One of my loyal readers (see &quot;Comments&quot; to previous post) wants to know how the word &quot;antres&quot; was pronounced. It&#39;s a reasonable inquiry but like many questions about Shakespeare, its answer is not easy.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>I myself pronounce &quot;antres&quot; just as I would &quot;antlers,&quot; but without the &quot;l&quot;. If I were to guess at an Elizabethan pronounciation (and it would be a guess, even though I&#39;ve stumbled through the volumes on Shakespearean pronunciation by Kokeritz and Cercignani), I would say the word with a more open initial vowel:&#0160; &quot;ahnters.&quot; But can we ever be certain how words were pronounced four hundred years ago?&#0160; Especially nonce-words like antres?&#0160;</p>
<p>Moreover,&#0160;Shakespeare did not spell antres, &quot;antres.&#39;&#0160; Antres is a brilliant editorial intervention that made its initial appearance&#0160;in Lewis Theobald&#39;s <em>The Works of Shakespeare </em>in 1733.</p>
<p>The&#0160;first time that <em>Othello&#0160;</em>saw print, in the 1622 quarto, antres was &quot;Antrees.&quot; The second time, in the first Folio of 1623, antres was &quot;Antars.&quot;&#0160; Are either one of these spellings, each of which yields a different pronounciation, authoritative?&#0160; It is impossible to know. With some plays, it&#39;s clear that F was set from Q, and that therefore any divergences are likely to be errors. But in the case of <em>Othello</em>, Q and F descend independently from a lost original (and it&#39;s been suggested that Q reveals evidence of the interpolations and misunderstandings of actors). Neither &quot;Anteers&quot; or &quot;Antars&quot; is definitive. Either pronunciation can therefore be justified.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>Perhaps Shakespeare changed his mind. Perhaps a scribe or a typesetter, struggling with a unique and unfamiliar work, took a guess. The rest is silence.&#0160; &#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2010/11/othello-anters.html">All About Antres</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>&quot;Antres&quot; is among the rarest of&#0160;rare words. Shakespeare&#39;s Othello speaks of &quot;antres vast and deserts idle&quot;&#0160;in the magnificent&#0160;oration&#0160;in which he&#0160;takes issue with the Venetian bigotry&#0160;that claimed that he&#0160;was only able to win white Desdemona by employing&#0160;drugs and witchcraft. No, it wasn&#39;t because he was a sorcerer; it was because he was accomplished, heroic, romantic. &quot;Antres&quot; is one of the exotic words that defines the great&#0160;African general&#0160;as a non-Venetian --&#0160;an outlander, an &quot;erring barbarian,&quot; an &quot;extravagant and wheeling stranger.&quot;</p>
<p>Shakespeare coined &quot;antres&quot; just for the occasion, deriving it&#0160;from Latin <em>antrum, </em>a cave. He never used &quot;antres&quot; again, nor did anyone else until Keats fleetingly revived the word&#0160;two centuries afterward. &quot;Antres&quot; never domesticated into English and remains curious&#0160;and&#0160;remote,&#0160;eternally&#0160;in need of an explanatory footnote. It is&#0160;unlikely that Shakespeare expected that a popular or even a courtly audience would&#0160;grasp &quot;antres&quot; at first hearing. It&#39;s a risky word, but Shakespeare didn&#39;t become Shakespeare without taking risks.</p>
<p>The playwright coupled&#0160;the neologism&#0160;&quot;antres&quot; to another shiny new Latinism to&#0160;produce &quot;antres vast,&quot; a phrase&#0160;which translates into the&#0160;language of&#0160;2017 as &quot;really big caves.&quot; Yet no translation can&#0160;do justice&#0160;to the spacious resonance of&#0160;&quot;antres vast.&quot; The caverns to which Othello refers are monstrously huge -- grown grander and even&#0160;more inaccessible because&#0160;Shakespeare ingeniously placed the modifier&#0160;after rather than before the noun. &quot;Antres vast&quot; are a hundredfold more mysterious --&#0160;darker, more echoic, more glinty with&#0160;stalactites&#0160;and stalagmites -- than &quot;vast antres.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;Antres vast&quot; occurs in tandem with a second&#0160;and equally remarkable&#0160;noun-adjective combination: &quot;deserts idle.&quot; Othello reports that before he came to Venice, he&#0160;had not only traversed &quot;rough quarries, rocks, and hills whose heads touch heaven&quot;&#0160;but&#0160;had also&#0160;dwelt among&#0160;&quot;antres vast and deserts idle.&quot; Strictly speaking, deserts cannot be&#0160;&quot;idle,&quot;&#0160;but they can be vacant or useless.&#0160;&quot;Deserts idle&quot; reinforces and augments &quot;antres vast.&quot; Taken together,&#0160;the two phrases are infinitely more evocative than either alone.</p>
<p>As a structure of sound, &quot;antres vast and deserts idle&quot; pivots on&#0160;the &quot;d&quot; of &quot;and&quot; and&#0160;the &quot;d&quot; of &quot;deserts&quot; and it positions&#0160;&quot;antres&quot; and &quot;idle&quot; in&#0160;symmetrical opposition. The&#0160;two key words are dissimilar yet cleverly interlinked,&#0160;each&#0160;comprised of an open vowel (<span style="color: #0000ff;">A</span>ntres, <span style="color: #0000ff;">I</span>dle), a dental (an<span style="color: #0000ff;">T</span>res, i<span style="color: #0000ff;">D</span>le), and a liquid (ant<span style="color: #0000ff;">R</span>es, id<span style="color: #0000ff;">L</span>e). It is not by&#0160;accident&#0160;that &quot;antres vast and deserts idle&quot; is such a euphonious&#0160;and mouth-filling phrase.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Shakespeare not only&#0160;invented&#0160;&quot;antres&quot; for Othello&#39;s&#0160;oration but also&#0160;took care to&#0160;surround it with&#0160;other linguistic novelties. For example:&#0160;Othello claims to have encountered&#0160;&quot;cannibals that each other eat/ The anthropophagi.&quot; &quot;Cannibal&quot; is now a commonplace noun,&#0160;but in 1604 it was a newcomer to the language. &quot;Cannibal&quot; derives from &quot;Carib,&quot; the name of a&#0160;recently-encountered people--reputed to be man-eaters --who gave&#0160;their appellation&#0160;to the sea in which they lived.&#0160;&quot;Cannibal&quot; was sufficiently strange--it had only made harbor in England (arriving by way of Spain) in the 1550s--that&#0160;Shakespeare felt a need to define it, which he did&#0160;once in English (&quot;that each other eat&quot;) and once in Greek (&quot;anthropophagi&quot;). &quot;Anthropophagi,&quot;&#0160;a word that&#0160;had originated with&#0160;Herodotus, was as new to&#0160;English--and as seldom employed--as &quot;cannibal.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;Antres vast,&quot; &quot;deserts idle,&quot; &quot;cannibals&quot; and &quot;anthropophagi&quot; play crucial parts in&#0160;Othello&#39;s stirring autobiographical fragment.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; &#0160;I spake of most disastrous chances,</p>
<p>Of moving accidents by flood and field,</p>
<p>Of hair-breadth&#0160;scapes i&#39;th&#39;imminent deadly breach,</p>
<p>Of being taken by the insolent foe</p>
<p>And sold&#0160;to slavery;&#0160; of my redemption thence,</p>
<p>And portance in my travel&#39;s history:</p>
<p>Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle,</p>
<p>Rough quarries, rocks, and hills whose heads touch heaven,</p>
<p>It was my hint to speak -- such was the process.</p>
<p>And of the cannibals&#0160;that each other eat,</p>
<p>The anthropophagi, and men whose heads</p>
<p>Do grow beneath their shoulders.</p>
<p>It&#39;s an astonishing story, each element&#0160;more incredible than the one that precedes it. Hair-breadth escapes?&#0160; Every hero&#0160;can boast of them. Redemption from slavery? A bit less likely. Hills whose heads touch heaven? A pardonable hyperbole. Cannibals?&#0160; Surely,&#0160;less&#0160;believable still. The Othello landscape then crosses the border from exotic to fabulous when it adduces&#0160;&quot;men whose heads/ Do grow beneath their shoulders.&quot; These headless men&#0160;are&#0160;the <em>blemmyae --&#0160;</em>Nubian or sometimes&#0160;Ethiopian -- who&#0160;were&#0160;a feature of&#0160; pseudo-anthropological folklore from Pliny to Sir Walter Raleigh. The skepticism that these monstrous creatures ought to provoke is diluted because the&#0160;road&#0160;to the blemmyes&#0160;passes through&#0160;&quot;antres vast and deserts idle.&quot; If audiences had not been lulled and seduced by &quot;antres,&quot; they might dismiss&#0160;Othello as a mere&#0160;braggart soldier--rather than admire him for the near-magician that he becomes in his self-dramatization.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Shakespeare had yet another purpose&#0160;for&#0160;&quot;antres vast.&quot; In the sentence that treads on the heels of the &quot;men whose heads/ Do&#0160;grow beneath their shoulders,&quot; Othello abruptly turned his attention to Desdemona. His language&#0160;dulls. &quot;This (i.e. his exotic narrative) to hear would Desdemona seriously incline,/ But still the house affairs would draw her hence.&quot;&#0160;Shakespeare strategically contrasts Othello&#39;s vocabulary to&#0160;Desdemona&#39;s when he&#0160;juxtaposes&#0160;&quot;antres vast&quot; to &quot;house affairs.&quot; Only the tinnest of ears&#0160;can fail to be struck by&#0160;the difference between the two phrases. Antres vast--house affairs; house affairs--antres vast. The gap between these two most pregnant phrases&#0160;is small enough to allow the electric impulses of sex and&#0160;romance to&#0160;spark,&#0160;but is too wide&#0160;to allow genuine understanding or empathy to shoot the gap.&#0160;The tragedy of Desdemona and Othello arises out of the unbridgeable space&#0160;between &quot;antres vast&quot; and &quot;house affairs.&quot;</p>
<p>Shakespeare therefore knew exactly what he was about when&#0160;he invented&#0160;the word &quot;antres.&quot;</p>
<p>If he had been&#0160;in a more antic&#0160;mood, less determined to&#0160;characterize&#0160;Othello&#39;s&#0160;massive dignity, he might have&#0160;coined a word from another&#0160;Latin word for cave,&#0160;e.g.&#0160;<em>spelunca</em>.&#0160;&#0160;But&#0160;&quot;spelunkies vast&quot; -- or even &quot;spelunkies splendid&quot;&#0160;-- could not&#0160;possibly do the work of&#0160;&quot;antres vast.&quot;&#0160;</p>

				<p>I have, on occasion, noted that modern readers of the great classic novels of the previous era&#0160;are unaware of&#0160;the social significance of horses and horse-drawn vehicles.&#0160; As I wrote, right here on this blague a couple of months ago, &quot;no, I&#39;m not obsessed, it&#39;s just that I have this little bee in my bonnet about the fact that we gasoline-era moderns understand exactly what is meant&#0160;when our&#0160;hero arrives in a&#0160;jeep, Jaguar, Jetta, or jalopy, but we are utterly clueless as to the valence of barouche, basket carriage, berlin, <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2006/01/new_words.html">britchka</a>, brougham, buckboard, buggy, cabriolet, caleche, cariole, carryall, chaise, chariot, clarence, concord wagon, coupe, croydon, curricle, cutter, daumont, dearborn, dennet, diligence, dog-cart, fiacre, fly, four-wheeler, gig, go-cart, governess cart, hansom, herdic, jaunty car, jersey-wagon, kibitka, landau, phaeton, post-chaise, rockaway, shandrydan, shay, spider-phaeton, spring-van, stanhope, sulky, surrey, T-cart, telyezhka, tilbury, <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2008/01/the-tarantass.html">tarantass</a>, trap, troika, victoria, vis-a-vis, wagonette, or&#0160;wurt.&quot;</p>
<p>I&#39;m not the only person who has taken note of the&#0160;variety of horse-drawn vehicles.&#0160; In an early essay (one of the <em>Sketches by Boz),&#0160;</em>Charles Dickens reported that the road to Greenwich Fair was &quot;in a state of perpetual bustle.&#0160; Cabs, hackney-coaches, &quot;shay&quot; carts, coal-waggons, stages, omnibuses, sociables, gigs, donkey-chaises -- all crammed with people... roll along at their utmost speed.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;What, pray tell, is a &quot;sociable?&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>In another of Dickens&#39;&#0160;sketches,&#0160;a newborn is taken to be christened in a&#0160;&quot;glass-carriage.&quot;&#0160;It can&#39;t be made of glass;&#0160; it must&#0160;be windowed.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>On an &quot;assembly night&quot;, &quot;a &#39;double-fly&#39; was ordered to be at the door of Oak Lodge at nine o&#39;clock precisely.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;A &quot;double-fly&quot; would appear to be twice as large as&#0160;your run-of-the-mill fly.&#0160; Twice as long?&#0160; Twice as wide?&#0160;</p>
<p>As little as I know about vehicles, it appears that I&#0160;know less about nineteenth-century clothes for men.&#0160; What does it mean that one of Dickens&#39;&#0160;characters wears &quot;cordury knee-smalls?&quot;&#0160; Fashionable or ridiculous?&#0160; What about &quot;spotless inexplicables?&quot;&#0160; &quot;Black knee-shorts?&quot;&#0160; &quot;A black-glazed stock?&quot;&#0160; &quot;Cloudy Berlins?&quot;&#0160; &quot;Drab shorts and continuations?&quot;&#0160;&#0160; &quot;Knee-cords and tops?&quot; What does it mean that a man had &quot;various particles of sawdust, looking like so many inverted commas, on his inexpressibles.&quot;&#0160; And what, finally, are&#0160;&quot;gamboge-coloured Bluchers?&quot;&#0160; I can&#39;t even begin to imagine.&#0160; Help!&#0160; I need an&#0160;annotated <em>Boz.&#0160;</em></p>

				<p>The Takacs Quartet graces us with&#0160;six superb concerts a year.&#0160; It&#39;s true that they sometimes hanker after strange new composers -- Psathos, Part etc. -- whose compositions set my teeth on edge&#0160;like the vile squealings of the wry-necked fife or like a&#0160;brazen canstick turned or like the gratings of&#0160;a dry wheel on an&#0160;axletree&#0160; -- but mostly they play what distinguished Quartets are ordained&#0160;to play, that is, the great central European tradition from&#0160;Haydn to Brahms.&#0160; But last night, the Takacs, eek and alas, ventured into new and&#0160;grim territory.&#0160;&#0160;<em>Horribile dictu, </em>they offered&#0160;an original, commissioned Drama&#0160;that purported&#0160;to be Serious and Illuminating.&#0160; It warn&#39;t.&#0160;&#0160;It was a interminable playlet about Beethoven&#39;s last years founded on&#0160;the composer&#39;s letters and conversation books.&#0160;&#0160;It was barren.&#0160; It was predictable, uninsightful, reductive, shallow, witless, dull,&#0160;and pretentious.&#0160; I started to squirm (boredom&#0160;feeding on embarrassment and embarrassment on boredom) after&#0160;a couple of minutes, then broke into a&#0160;sweat,&#0160;but after a few minutes resigned myself to my middle-of-the-row&#0160;captivity and I did what I always do in such situations -- recited&#0160;to myself long-ago-memorized poetry.&#0160;&#0160;When the Drama mercifully&#0160;ended, I was consoled to hear the woman in front of me (a member of the music faculty) say to her companion, &quot;Do you think they know how bad that was?&quot;</p>
<p>Do they?&#0160; I hope so.&#0160; I hope that the playwright, a tyro&#0160;named&#0160; ------ Morse, recognizes that he&#39;s not Tom Stoppard or even Tom Stoppard diluted to a 1% tincture, and that he takes up a profession that inflicts less pain on innocent bystanders.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>I left dispirited, especially for the actors, who tried to force a marriage of&#0160;Shakespearean style of performance&#0160;to&#0160;prosaic vocabulary and sentence structures.&#0160;&#0160;I do not use the word &quot;Shakespearean&quot; in a good way:&#0160; I refer to that highly artificial, unnatural way of speaking and moving that, inherited and debased from an ancient tradition,&#0160;has stupefied and narcotized dutiful culture-hungry audiences at summer festivals all over America.&#0160; Shakespeare himself was clear that he did not want his actors to strut and bellow, but strut and bellow was what they did&#0160;last night.&#0160; If the actors did not split the ears of all the groundlings, they certainly split mine.&#0160;&#0160;Why do they speak in that ridiculous manner&#0160;when their aim should be &quot;to hold the mirror up to nature.&quot;&#0160; It&#39;s wrong of me to say so, but I felt that I could look into the soul of the actor who played Beethoven and see a man&#0160;who imagined that &#0160;he was playing Lear at the Old Vic, when he was in fact performing in a play that might, just might, satisfy the requirements for an M.A. in creative writing at some off-brand college (&quot;he&#39;s worked very hard on this so we might as well pass him&quot;), and that he was going to show &quot;them&quot; how it&#39;s done, but instead he offered us sufferers a copy of a copy of a pale copy.</p>
<p>Egads, I&#39;m breaking into a sweat again just thinking about it.</p>
<p>I pay good money to hear the Takacs -- and concert after concert, I get my money&#39;s worth, and much more.&#0160; I want Schubert.&#0160; I want Mozart.&#0160; If I wanted amateur theatricals, I would go to he local dinner theater.&#0160; Or to the high school around the corner. &#0160;</p>

				<p>How come my friend Ken W. can hike for three days in the mountains, dig a hole and cache his supplies, and then, the next summer,&#0160;return to the exact spot&#0160;to retrieve his stuff, while I can&#39;t turn around twice without getting lost?&#0160; Why is it that&#0160;my college roommate, Allan K., could draw a detailed map of any place on earth from memory, while my friend Ellen P., equally intelligent, cannot remember whether Kansas is north or south of Nebraska or east or west of Missouri, or whether Wales is on the east coast or the west coast of Great Britain?&#0160; How come some people have perfect pitch and others can&#39;t tell if one note is higher or lower than another?&#0160; Why is it that some people who can&#39;t tie their shoelaces are brilliant at mathematics?</p>

<p>Why is it that the only act of the human brain&#0160;at which I am naturally&#0160;superior, gifted even unto genius&#0160;is&#0160;one of the least important?&#0160; I refer, of course, to&#0160;speling!&#0160;</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Here&#39;s a puzzle about a character&#39;s name&#0160;that will&#0160;interest detectives or dedicated Shakespeareans --&#0160;and&#0160;perhaps&#0160;only the most dedicated of Shakespearean detectives.</p>
<p>As everyone&#0160;knows,&#0160;the &quot;heroine&quot; and dominant figure in <em>Twelfth Night </em>is an audacious, sensitive, and intelligent young lady&#0160;to whom Shakespeare gave the name&#0160;Viola.&#0160;It is Viola who, shipwrecked on the&#0160;Illyrian shores, disguises herself as a man, enlists herself as a&#0160;servant to&#0160;Duke&#0160;(or Count) Orsino,&#0160;whom she rapidly&#0160;comes to admire,&#0160;and is then dispatched&#0160;by Orsino to woo in proxy his beloved, Lady Olivia the recalcitrant.&#0160;Viola has the&#0160;misfortune, while in mannish guise,&#0160;to provoke Olivia&#39;s romantic interest.&#0160;The complications&#0160;that arise from these mistakings take five amusing acts to resolve.&#0160;But it&#39;s&#0160;Viola&#39;s play, from first to last, and there is&#0160;no question about her identity or her name.&#0160;</p>
<p>Viola first comes on stage&#0160;in the second scene of the play.&#0160;The stage direction in the 1623 Folio is unambiguous.&#0160;<em>Enter Viola, a Captaine, and Saylors.&#0160;</em>In the speech headings throughout the play, Viola regularly appears as <em>Vio., </em>just as Maria is <em>Mar., </em>Clown is <em>Clo., </em>and Malvolio is <em>Mal.&#0160;</em>There is but one exception to this practice --&#0160;and here begins the mystery.&#0160;In the middle of Act 2, scene 5, Viola comes as ambassador to Olivia but&#0160;the stage direction reads, inexplicably<em>, Enter Violenta.&#0160;</em>Who is Violenta, what is she?&#0160;Inasmuch as Viola&#39;s name has been and will continue to be&#0160;Viola,&#0160;how did&#0160;it happen&#0160;that&#0160;just this one time she comes to be&#0160;called by&#0160;a similar but very different name?&#0160;The most likely explanation is that it&#39;s a mere slip&#0160;-- either an error of the&#0160;compositor who set the&#0160;Folio line, or an error of the scribe who&#0160;made a fair copy of Shakespeare&#39;s manuscript, or&#0160;of W. S. himself, nodding over his quill and inkhorn.</p>
<p>But for Shakespeareans, &quot;Violenta&quot; is most interesting name.&#0160;While the playwright&#0160;created no characters named Violenta, there was one time when he came very close to doing so.&#0160;The near-Violenta&#0160;almost appears in &#0160;<em>All&#39;s Well&#0160;That Ends Well,&#0160;</em>the play that is printed&#0160;in the Folio&#0160;just before <em>Twelfth Night.&#0160;</em>In <em>All&#39;s Well, </em>Helen, who is obsessed with Bertram, pursues her absconded and&#0160;disloyal husband to Florence. There she discovers that Bertram has been wooing a woman called Diana.&#0160;But&#0160;Diana was not originally conceived as Diana. She had a&#0160;momentary and evanescent&#0160;pre-existence as&#0160;Violenta.&#0160;<em>Enter old Widdow of&#0160;Florence, her daughter,&#0160;Violenta and Mariana, with other&#0160;Citizens.&quot;&#0160;</em>So says the stage direction, but&#0160;in the scene that the s.d. introduces,&#0160;there is no Violenta.&#0160;No person&#0160;of that name says a word.&#0160;In her stead&#0160;there appears&#0160;a Diana (or <em>Dia.),&#0160;</em>whose&#0160;entrance onto the stage is unannounced.&#0160;Diana appears where Violenta was heralded.&#0160;Clearly Shakespeare changed his mind.</p>
<p>It is therefore clear that the Folio compositors&#0160;were working with a&#0160;holograph that preserved Shakespeare&#39;s&#0160;first thoughts.&#0160;Diana, the&#0160;o-so-pure maid whom Bertram&#0160;cannot conquer, was orignally&#0160;intended to be Violenta, who, it&#0160;is reasonable to infer from her name,&#0160;would have repelled the young seducer&#39;s advances&#0160;not with virtue but with shrewishness.&#0160;Later,&#0160;when Shakespeare altered his conception,&#0160;Violenta turned into the&#0160;mirage or&#0160;ghost who both is and is not present in&#0160;<em>All&#39;s Well.&#0160;&#0160;</em></p>
<p>The Violenta of&#0160;<em>All&#39;s Well </em>can therefore be understood as a first pass at Diana.&#0160;But what possible explanation is&#0160;there for the substitution of Violenta for Viola in <em>Twelfth Night?&#0160;&#0160;</em>It&#39;s&#0160;a hard question, and&#0160;the not-entirely-satisfactory but best answer is that the typesetter&#0160;who worked on both of these plays&#0160;(Compositor B, so-called) carried the name from one play to the other.&#0160;Let us suppose&#0160;that he had just set &quot;<em>Enter... Violenta&quot; in </em><em>All&#39;s Well&#0160;</em>when he resumed&#0160;work on T<em>welfth&#0160;Night.&#0160;</em>There he&#0160;encountered the&#0160;abbreviation &quot;VIo.&quot; and, the longer name still reverberating in his mind,&#0160;expanded <em>Vio. </em>to <em>Violenta.&#0160;</em>&#0160;</p>
<p>That&#39;s the end of the story.&#0160;But there&#39;s a fascinating postscript.&#0160;When, in <em>All&#39;s Well,</em>&#0160;Bertram&#0160;makes his move on&#0160;Diana, there&#39;s this exchange (including&#0160;the introductory&#0160;stage direction):</p>
<p><em>Enter Bertram, and the Maide called Diana.</em></p>
<p><em>Ber.&#0160;</em>They told me that your name was&#0160;<em>Fontybell.</em></p>
<p><em>Dia.&#0160;</em>No, my good Lord, <em>Diana.</em></p>
<p>Fontybell?&#0160;Beautiful fountain?&#0160;It would seem that Diana/Violenta once had still another name.&#0160;Or that Shakespeare wants us to think so.</p>
<p>&quot;They told me that your name was Fontybell&quot; is a pure,&#0160;lovely, and haunting line of poetry,&#0160;but it&#39;s unrelated to anything else in the play.&#0160;It&#39;s a free-standing mystery, utterly without explanation.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
