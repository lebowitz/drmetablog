					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2010/10/sheep-news.html">Scary News from Longmont, Colorado</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Sometimes I can&#39;t make the slightest sense of what I read in the newspapers.&#0160; Here&#39;s an example.&#0160; But first some sheep news.</p>
<p>The desert bighorn sheep (<em>Ovis canadensis nelsoni), </em>smaller than the ordinary bighorn and&#0160;one of the rarest and most endagered our native mammals,&#0160;has been reduced to dry ranges in Nevada and California, near rocky cliffs in almost&#0160;waterless environments.&#0160;&quot;Hunting has been prohibited or controlled since the early 1900s, but much illegal poaching still occurs.&#0160; The subspecies <em>Ovis canadensis auduboni</em> of the Black Hills and adjacent areas has already become extinct.&quot;</p>
<p>Now the newspaper report.&#0160; The Longmont Times-Call celebrates a local heroine,&#0160;Ms. Sara Brandenburg.</p>
<p>&#0160;&quot;At&#0160;age 15, Brandenburg became the youngest female in the world to the earn the North American Grand Slam after shooting and killing four different species of North American wild sheep — a dall, a stone, a Rocky Mountain bighorn and a desert bighorn.&#0160; She shot a 230-pound dall sheep Aug. 17, 2009, in Alaska and pinned her final animal — a 220-pound stone sheep — in the Yukon Territory on Aug. 8, four days before her 16th birthday.The previous record-holder was a 32-year-old, according to the Grand Slam Club/Ovis.When she shot the stone sheep — the final one for her grand slam — tears poured down her face. “It’s a big emotional rush when you get it,” she said.&#0160;&#0160;While working on the record, Brandenburg, who is a sophomore at Longmont Christian School, missed two months of classes. She ended the year with a 4.0 grade-point average, in part because she hauled textbooks on hunts. Moments before shooting her desert bighorn sheep in Mexico’s Baja Desert, she was finishing algebra homework.&#0160; Her father, Rod Brandenburg, taught Sara and her older sister, Katey, 18, to hunt at an early age, instilling in them the same pioneer spirit his great-grandfather had when he moved from Germany to homestead in the 1870s in Westcliffe, Colo.&#0160;He estimated it cost about $120,000 to arrange for Sara to kill four sheep. When friends remark about the cost, Brandenburg says it was worth it.&#0160; “I couldn’t afford not to,” he said.&#0160; When he watched Sara shoot her final sheep, a wave of relief, exhilaration and admiration washed over him, he said.&#0160;&#0160;Last month, she took up archery and hopes to repeat the grand slam with a bow this time or advance to the Super 10 title, which is awarded to hunters who shoot and kill 10 North American big-game animals.&#0160; In addition to sheep, Sara Brandenburg also has shot and killed three antelopes, one white-tailed deer and one black bear, as well as a gemsbok, an eland, a wildebeest and a zebra during a hunting trip in South Africa.&quot;</p>
<p>I don&#39;t understand blood sports.&#0160; I find them repulsive and inhuman.&#0160;</p>
<p>Am I missing something?&#0160; The Brandenburg family values ($120,000 to kill four rare sheep) are disgusting, sociopathic, and barbaric.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;Are these people locked into&#0160;the Stone Age?&#0160;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>i&#39;&#39;ve read <em>All&#39;s Well that Ends Well </em>many times (thrice just in the last week), always with puzzlement and&#0160; dissatisfaction. It&#39;s a confused and confusing play. My best guess is&#0160;that&#0160;Shakespeare got going on some appealing but&#0160;intractable material and struggled with it for many years but was never able to bring it to a satisfactory conclusion.&#0160;</p>
<p>Until this last reading, I had never paid much attention to the King of France who is, I think, more of a plot mechanism than a rounded character. Shakespeare never even bothered to give him a first name -- he&#39;s &quot;King&quot; but whether Charles or Louis or Lothair we&#39;re never told. He plays a crucial part in the fable, because, dying of a &quot;fistula,&quot; he is cured by our heroine Helen and in exchange grants her the husband of her choice (her obsession, actually) -- the handsome soldier and crass lout Bertram. Later in the play, after Bertram has fled from the marriage, the King again intervenes to restore him (against his will) to Helen. The King is short-tempered and highly conscious of his regal status -- as Kings are in literature -- but he is not particularly eloquent or interesting.&#0160;</p>
<p>But in my most recent&#0160;reading, I&#0160;was struck by some lines that I had&#0160;not registered&#0160;in my salad days.&#0160;Helen urges the King to allow her to try her &quot;receipts&quot;&#0160;(i.e. prescriptions or drugs) on him. He resists, of course, simply so that Helen may overcome another contrived obstacle. But the King&#39;s sentences, fable apart,&#0160;are very pertinent, most particularly&#0160;to those of us who have staggered to life&#39;s endgame:&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; We thank you, maiden,</p>
<p>But may not be so credulous of cure,</p>
<p>When our most learned doctors leave us and</p>
<p>The congregated college have concluded</p>
<p>That laboring art can never ransom nature</p>
<p>From her inaidable estate. I say we must not</p>
<p>So stain our judgment, or corrupt our hope,</p>
<p>To prostitute our past-cure malady</p>
<p>To empirics, or to dissever so</p>
<p>Our great self and our credit to esteem</p>
<p>A senseless help, when help past sense we deem.</p>
<p>&quot;Empiric&quot; is Shakespearean for &quot;phonies.&quot;&#0160; The King&#0160;will not compromise his rationality or his dignity by indulging himself with the sixteenth-century version of&#0160;faith-healers,&#0160;herbalists, reiki masters, homeopaths,&#0160;naturists or any other of the enormous plague of quack-quacks who litter our anti-rational landscape.&#0160;</p>
<p>Good for him, I say, even though, as it turns out, he&#39;s wrong and the maiden successfully works her receipts. Shakespeare keeps us out of the sickroom, so we don&#39;t know exactly what she prescribes (just as well), but we do learn that the credulous bystanders attribute the cure not to science but to divine intervention. As the very orthodox and conventional Lafeu puts it, &quot;They say miracles are past, and we have our philosophical persons to make modern (i.e. routine, everyday) and familiar, things [that are] supernatural and causeless.&#0160;&#0160;Hence it is that we make trifles of terrors, ensconcing ourselves into seeming knowledge when we should submit ourselves to an unknown fear (i.e. fear of the unknown)&quot; -- an interpretation that might made sense in Shakespeare&#39;s scientifically-ignorant late medieval world, but which is no longer applicable.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I trust&#0160;that when my&#0160;time comes, I will follow the King&#39;s good example and&#0160;come to terms with reality rather than succumb to irrationality and &quot;esteem a senseless hope.&quot;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>A Chilean newspaper, <em>El Espectador</em>, has reported the results of a poll of its readers.&#0160;When asked about the recent rescue of the thirty-three Copiapo miners, 49% of readers attributed the success to&#0160;&quot;ciencia&quot; while 51% judged it a&#0160;&quot;milagro.&quot; A miracle?&#0160;&#0160;It what universe? &#0160;What could they be thinking? The rescue&#0160;was all hard work and ingenuity and&#0160;high speed percussive drilling. There&#39;s nothing the least bit supernatural about such a&#0160;triumph.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Nor does it do any good to blame those primitive superstitious Chileans. Americans would have divided&#0160; similarly -- with a higher score for &quot;milagro&quot; in our ultra-benighted South and a somewhat lower score in the only semi-benighted North. Even on my very own Facebook page, a number of friends of &quot;friends&quot; (not my own &quot;friends&quot; I&#39;m glad to say), posted exultantly, &quot;This proves that God is real.&quot;&#0160; No it doesn&#39;t -- it proves only that the true believers have no use for evidence or reason. Why does the great signifier in the sky get the credit for the rescue but no blame for the collapse that caused the disaster. And would the god-enthusiasts have abandoned their belief if the men had died. Not a chance. They would fallen back on the old bromide, not for us to question the will of god -- or employed some other kind of trapeze artist illogic.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>A miracle! Humbug! If a superman-like hand of god had come down from the heavens and drilled the hole, I would vote milagro also. Otherwise, ciencia.&#0160; &#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>What is a miracle, anyway?&#0160; I thought that David Hume finished off miracles a quarter of a millennium ago. Miracles are not &quot;unlikely events,&quot; he said. &#0160;&quot;They are events that are contrary to nature.&quot; The mine rescue may have been a long odds situation, but it wasn&#39;t unnatural. It was entirely in accord with what we know about the world and human psychology and the ciencia of mining. (Hume capped his argument by saying that there can be no such thing as a miracle, because if it happens, then it&#39;s not contrary to nature. It is nature.)&#0160;</p>
<p>But all of us use the word &quot;miracle&quot; very loosely. I may know, with one part of my brain, all about eggs and sperm and DNA, but I still feel that it&#39;s something of a miracle whenever a baby is born. Although it&#39;s a common miracle -- billions strong --I&#39;m awed by each and every newborn. As I am by the Chilean miners and their rescuers. I&#39;m awed, I&#39;m relieved, I&#39;m joyous, I&#39;m dazzled, but most of all, I&#39;m proud of the compassion, the resilience, and the intelligence of my fellow human beings --and there you have my understanding of the word &quot;milagro.&quot;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Even moderately serious baseball-watchers know that we&#39;ve just experienced a disaster of the Mickey Owens-Willie Davis-Bill Buckner variety. Poor Brooks Conrad, a journeyman infielder, playing for the Atlanta Braves in an important playoff game, committed three horrible errors. He bobbled a ball, dropped a popup, and then, with the game on the line, let a routine grounder go right through his legs. He was nutmegged, as they say in soccer. Game over, Atlanta eliminated. The hi-def TV camera focussed on him, allowing millions of Americans to lipread the poor guy&#39;s puzzled, exasperated, embarrassed, &quot;What the fuck.&quot; Interviewed after the game, Conrad was more decorous but no less defeated: &quot;I wanted to dig a hole and go to sleep in it.&quot;</p>
<p>Sleep won&#39;t do it, because Conrad&#39;s errors will be re-played forever and ever and ever.</p>
<p>The play that lost the game was one that Brooks Conrad has made time and time again -- at Arizona State, during his ten years in the minors, and during his three-year (229 at bats, 53 hits) and now completed major league career. He wouldn&#39;t have been in the game -- as a substitute for the injured Martin Prado -- if he didn&#39;t have the ability to put a glove on a pop fly or handle a ground ball. One of the announcers called it accurately:&#0160;&#0160;&quot;they say you make errors with the glove but in this case the problem is right between his ears.&quot;&#0160; Brooks Conrad somehow lost the ability to do things that should have been entirely routine &#0160;-- which is why I feel so sorry for him, and why I identify so strongly with him.&#0160; It could happen to anybody, anytime. I remember once driving along on a big four-lane and for a second I forgot which foot operated the accelerator and which the clutch.&#0160; I panicked, momentarily, but I recovered, and no one ever knew.&#0160; didn&#39;t have millions of people watching me and clucking.</p>
<p>I&#39;m glad to say that the next day, when Brooks took the field during warmups (he was mercifully held out of the game), Atlanta fans gave him a big cheer. &quot;We are all frail,&quot; as Angelo says, and it&#39;s not wrong for us to be reminded of it once in a while. But poor Brooks, condemned to a lifetime of waking up in the middle of the night, Buster Posey&#39;s grounder skidding past his glove and through his legs, runners endlessly, one after another, in an infinitely loop, crossing home plate to the deafening roar of the crowd.&#0160;</p>

				<p>Goodness gracious! I should have known that the two films were distant cousins -- after all, Woody Allen&#39;s film (one of his very best, and certainly his most genial) ends with an extended tribute to&#0160;Groucho&#0160;in which everyone wears phony mustaches and pretends to puff on stogies. But not having taken a look at <em>Horse Feathers </em>in twenty or thirty years, I&#0160;failed to realize how much Woody had borrowed. How&#0160;could I have forgotten&#0160;that <em>Everyone Says I Love You&#0160;</em>extracts&#0160;and transforms two songs from <em>Horse Feathers: </em>&quot;I&#39;m Through With Love&quot; as well as its&#0160;own title song. And of course&#0160;it shares its&#0160;liberated and episodic&#0160;series-of-skits structure not only with Groucho but with all vaudevillians. Not to mention a willingness to throw logic to the winds or under the bus for the sake of a gag. <em>Everyone Says I Love You&#0160;i</em>s&#0160;a lovely,&#0160;gentle film (much more mild than its raucous unsubtle predecessor).</p>
<p>Its exhilarating choreography is very distinctly not indebted to anything in the earlier film.</p>
<p>Some ambitious scholar could&#0160;write an illuminating&#0160;essay on Woody&#39;s Marxism.&#0160;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>The artistry of&#0160;<em>Romeo and Juliet </em>I.v.30-41 is, I fear, under-appreciated. It&#39;s an utterly revolutionary moment in the history of the drama, but it&#39;s so subtle, so art-that-hides-art, that it easily slips under the radar. Let me quote in full.</p>
<p><em>Capulet.&#0160; </em>Nay sit, nay sit, good cousin Capulet,</p>
<p>For you and I are past our dancing days.</p>
<p>How long is&#39;t now since last yourself and I</p>
<p>Were in a masque?</p>
<p><em>Cousin Capulet.&#0160;</em>&#0160;&#0160;By&#39;r Lady, thirty years.</p>
<p><em>Capulet.&#0160; </em>What, man, &#39;tis not so much, &#39;tis not so much.</p>
<p>&#39;Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio</p>
<p>Come Pentecost as quickly as it will,</p>
<p>Some five and twenty years: and then we masqu&#39;d.</p>
<p><em>Cousin Capulet.&#0160; </em>&quot;Tis more, &#39;tis more, his son is elder, sir:</p>
<p>His son is thirty.</p>
<p><em>Capulet.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; </em>Will you tell me that?</p>
<p>His son was but a ward two years ago.</p>
<p><em>Romeo.&#0160; </em>What lady&#39;s that which doth enrich the hand</p>
<p>Of yonder knight?</p>
<p><em>Romeo and Juliet </em>is a play of rhetorical experimentation. In its course, Shakespeare employs extravagant puns and wordplay, rhyme, prose, embedded sonnets, stichomythia, two passages of contrived, Petrarchan oxymora, outrageous bawdy, lament both real and parodic -- everything, in fact, that was in the garner&#0160;of a&#0160;1590s playwright.</p>
<p>The overlooked conversation between old Capulet and his cousin is an innovative&#0160;piece of rhetoric of Shakespeare&#39;s own invention. It&#39;s simply everyday, colloquial conversation -- in his time, a complete and utter novelty.</p>
<p>It&#39;s two old guys talking the way old guys talk when they&#39;re savoring the past. Repetitions: &quot;&#39;tis not so much, &#39;tis not so much&quot; and &quot;&#39;tis more, &#39;tis more&quot;; mock challenge: &quot;will you tell me that&quot;?; references to details known only to the participants: &quot;Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio...&quot;; homely exaggerations: &quot;His son was but a ward two years ago.&quot; Even though Shakespeare casts the passage in blank verse, he&#0160;manages to capture the authentic sound of real people engaged in real conversation.</p>
<p>But why?&#0160; It&#39;s all a trick or device to set off&#0160;the sentence of Romeo&#39;s that follows.</p>
<p>Unlike the Capulet cousins, Romeo is wholly captured by the language of&#0160;splendid and hyperbolic love-longing. Shakespeare therefore encourages&#0160;his audience to contrast&#0160;the everyday quality of &quot;His son was but a ward two years ago&quot; with Romeo&#39;s &quot;What lady&#39;s that which doth enrich the hand/ Of yonder knight.&quot; Needless to say, there are no knights at this&#0160;merchant-class gathering. &quot;Knights&quot; are a creation of Romeo&#39;s imagination. So is the&#0160;slightly&#0160;archaic phrase &quot;yonder knight,&quot;&#0160;which is directly out of the world of romance and clashes magnificently with the&#0160;context that Shakespeare has so carefully contrived. So too the&#0160;inversion &quot;what lady&#39;s that&quot; instead of &quot;who is that lady&quot; and the highly poetical (and supremely&#0160;beautiful) &quot;enrich the hand.&quot;</p>
<p>Romeo&#39;s sentence is at the same time very serious and highly comic -- a triumph of Shakespeare&#39;s original and&#0160; almost invisible craft.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I read <em>Anatomy of a Beast </em>by Michael McLeod, cover to cover, but I&#39;m gol-durned if I know why I did so.&#0160; A bad habit, finishing bad books.&#0160; And it is a bad book -- badly written and badly edited.&#0160; Well, I&#39;m exaggerating.&#0160; It&#39;s not all that bad.&#0160; There&#39;s enough material in its 222 padded-like-an-old mattress pages to make a good 2200 word essay.&#0160;&#0160;Why is this book published by the University of California Press when there are so many serious academic manuscripts unable to find a publisher.&#0160; <em>Anatomy of a Beast </em>has &quot;trade book&quot; written all over it -- the breathless first-person narrative, the transparently-contrived Quest, the anecdotal style.</p>
<p>Good golly, Miss Molly, I&#39;m allowing myself to get carried away.</p>
<p>What&#39;s it about?&#0160; <em>Anatomy of a Beast </em>examines the Bigfoot legend.&#0160; Finds it false, a concoction of fakery and gullibility.&#0160; So far so good.&#0160; But that&#39;s as far as it goes.&#0160; There&#39;s no persuasive analysis of the phenomenon and no serious attempt to relate it to other frauds, conspiracy theories and other spiritualisms <em>and</em> mass delusions.</p>
<p>Why is the famous Bigfoot film of 1968 still taken seriously years even after the man who wore the gorilla suit has confessed?&#0160;&#0160; I don&#39;t know.&#0160; Nor do I know why crop circles are given tv-time after the man who perpetrated the fraud&#0160;described exactly how he did so.&#0160; Why are there posters on billboards all over my town, today, &#0160;advertising &quot;A Course in Miracles&quot; to be offered by a guy whose credential is that he just returned from India having studied with some revered swami (and this 250 years after Hume&#39;s <em>Essay on Miracles)</em>?</p>
<p>Why do people -- apparently sensible people -- ask me if I think that Shakespeare really wrote the plays?&#0160;&#0160; Why do a majority of Americans not &quot;believe in&quot; evolution?&#0160;</p>
<p>Has the Age of Reason been cancelled?&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>A better, more challenging discussion of Bigfoot and other &quot;cryptozoological&quot; fantasies might have earned a place in the story.&#0160; Not this disappointing book.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I sometimes think that I must be the world&#39;s number one fan of Shakespeare&#39;s <em>Cymbeline, </em>which I have just re-read twice during the past week. Here&#39;s a play that is seldom performed, infrequently read, rarely referenced, and omitted from most university courses on Shakespeare. Although it&#39;s generally grouped with the last plays or, as they have come to be called, the romances, surely fifty people know <em>The Tempest </em>for everyone who is familiar with <em>The Winter&#39;s Tale </em>and ten people know <em>The Winter&#39;s Tale </em>for everyone who knows (or has even heard the name) of <em>Cymbeline. </em>Nevertheless, I love the play; it&#39;s perpetually entrancing.</p>
<p><em>Cymbeline </em>is the most densely plotted of all of Shakespeare&#39;s plays and as a result, it&#39;s difficult to follow, especially on the first dozen or score of readings. It&#39;s so dense with plot that, in order to cram everything in, Shakespeare devised a most elliptical and condensed style of speech. There are some sentences to which I must still refer to the footnotes for explication -- and sometimes the footnote says, &quot;seems to mean,&quot; or &quot;perhaps means, but might also mean.&quot;&#0160; Moreover, it&#39;s a hard play to read for those who don&#39;t come to it with a deep familiarity with other of Shakespeare plays, because sometimes the author seems to condense into a phrase or two an idea which he had explored more fully in an earlier work. For example, in a number of the comedies there is an opening scene in which characters discuss their unhappiness -- simply in order to establish a situation in which the play can proceed from sadness to joy. And frequently there&#39;s an early reference to the contrast between private emotion and public posture.&#0160; n terse, economical <em>Cymbeline, </em>Shakespeare gets these forms out of the way in a flash. An otherwise unknown &quot;Gentleman&quot; begins the play: &quot;You do not meet a man but frowns. Our bloods/ No more obey the heavens than our courtiers/ Still seem as does the King.&quot;&#0160; And we&#39;re off and running.&#0160; (Brief translation of the proceeding lines: everyone is sad because they attend to the King&#39;s disposition.) It&#39;s a forbidding start -- but it covers an enormous lot of ground. As it must, because <em>Cymbeline </em>brings on stage a wicked queen and her doltish son, a physician expert in drugs that cause a person to simulate death (just as in <em>Romeo),</em> a fair princess later to disguise herself as a page, two brothers stolen from the court in swaddling clothes who will become military heroes, an invasion of England by Roman forces, a low-born suitor of great worth who will suffer exile but eventually return to claim his bride, an Italian schemer who wagers than he can seduce a princess, and, moreover, the dream-vision appearance of the hero&#39;s dead mother, father and brothers -- and finally a guest appearance of Jove himself who descends on a machine to intervene and prophesy. The play spends four and a half acts tying up thick plot-knots and then a half an act unloosening them. Twenty-four misunderstandings are clarified in couple of hundred lines. The conclusion is a miracle -- or rather, a succession of miracles. <em>Cymbeline </em>is as manipulative as manipulative can be, but I&#39;ve never been able to read its last lines without dropping real tears.</p>
<p>My favorite scene, just to give an idea of how complicated and outrageous a play it is, comes when Imogen (or in some modern texts Innogen), the princess, awakes from drugged sleep to discover the ass Cloten (who &quot;Cannot take two from twenty, for his heart,/ And leave eighteen) to be dead, his head having been struck off, but wearing the clothes of her lover Posthumus Leonatus (a long story). Imogen naturally takes the one for the other, their bodies being apparently of the same stature. She mourns her headless enemy as though he were her friend. It&#39;s a truly bizarre, grotesque and wonderful scene. It is, as Imogen says in another context, &quot;beyond beyond.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p><em>Cymbeline </em>is a rare treasure -- but it&#39;s not for the faint of heart, not for skimmers.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>It&#39;s an ancient commonplace -- sleep is the image of death. &#0160;In some versions, it&#39;s a preparation for death: God has provided us with sleep to get us ready for our inevitable end. &#0160;&quot;Somnus imago mortis&quot; is all over Shakespeare: &#0160;&quot;sleep thou ape of death,&quot; &#0160;&quot;death-counterfeiting sleep,&quot; etc.</p>
<p>My own personal sleep is so wracked with awakenings and nightmares and night-sweats and fluff in the lung and a feverish tongue that I can&#39;t easily think of it as a preparation for anything. &#0160;For me, sleep is rather a task, an effort, than a period of oblivion. &#0160;I want my tombstone to be inscribed with the motto, &quot;No more insomnia, forever.&quot;</p>
<p>But just six weeks ago, I experienced&#0160;a pure &quot;somnus imago mortis&quot; moment. &#0160;I was on a gurney, drugged, prepared for surgery. &#0160;I was wheeled into a room.&#0160; Time came to a complete halt. &#0160;And then several hours later I was awakened. Nothing -- nothing -- intervened from the time that I was put under until the moment when I came to. (Perhaps there was an amnesic in the drug cocktail -- I wouldn&#39;t know.)</p>
<p>It was such a profound and eventless sleep that it has, in fact, prepared me for the sleep of death. &#0160;There was not a whisper, not a thought, nothing. &#0160;Now, at last, I know how it will be.</p>
<p>In the hospital, there was a very welcome rebirth.&#0160; But why, then, does&#0160;the phrase, &quot;I have been half in love with easeful death&quot; continue to resonate in my brain?</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Shakespeare&#39;s <em>The Merry Wives of Windsor </em>is a moderately successful play but not among Shakespeare&#39;s greatest hits. Nevertheless, there are two fragments of first-class witty dialogue that continue to tickle me even after all these years. The first is Falstaff&#39;s indignation at Parson Evans&#39;s Welsh-accented transformation of the words &quot;cheese&quot; and &quot;butter.&quot; EVANS:&#0160; Seese is not good to give putter. Your belly is all putter.&quot;&#0160; FALSTAFF:&#0160; &quot;&#39;Seese&#39; and &#39;putter.&#39;&#0160; Have I lived to stand at the taunt of one that makes fritters of English.&quot; There&#39;s no mystery about the the imaginatively inappropriate word &quot; fritters&quot; -- it simply means chopped meat fried in a batter.&#0160; I don&#39;t know why &quot;fritters&quot; amuses me so, but it does. It&#39;s off-target and off-kilter and yet so very concrete and specific.&#0160;</p>
<p>The second, and even funnier moment, is when Anne Page, one of the few sensible characters in the play, makes it clear that she won&#39;t marry the foolish Dr. Caius. &quot;Alas,&quot; she says, &quot;I had rather be set quick i&#39;th&#39;earth/ And bowled to death with turnips.&quot;&#0160; &quot;Set quick&quot; means &quot;buried alive,&quot; presumably up to the neck, but it&#39;s the lovely, unexpected &quot;turnips&quot; that produces the laughter, perhaps because no one before or since has thought to employ the usually harmless vegetable&#0160;as a deadly weapon. &#0160;I read the police blotters, I should know.&#0160;</p>
<p>For the record, Shakespeare never, In the 38+ plays, used either word again. He knew that he had squeezed meaning enough out of both &quot;fritters&quot; and &quot;turnips.&quot;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>There are many curious ideas and events in Shakespeare&#39;s <em>Tempest. </em>Here&#39;s a trivial one that both bothers and amuses me. For what reason does Prospero keep Caliban in his service and close to home even after he has tried to rape Miranda? Here&#39;s the puzzling explanation offered by the great magus himself:&#0160; &quot;We cannot miss [do without] him.&#0160; He does make our fire,/ Fetch in our wood, and serves in offices/ That profit us.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>The very vague &quot;serves in offices/ That profit us&quot; tells us that even Shakespeare had a hard time justifying Caliban, whose only occupation, it would seem, is to keep the Prosperian fireplace well stoked. He&#39;s certainly not keeping the books.</p>
<p>My puzzle: Prospero is a great magician. He can raise storms, put people into trances, devise supernatural banquets and shows, release spirits from cloven pines, and even (though we don&#39;t see it) raise the dead (&quot;Graves at my command/ Have waked their sleepers, oped, and let &#39;em forth.&quot;) If he&#39;s so supremely golldarned powerful why can&#39;t he magically gather his own firewood? Come to think of it, why does he need firewood at all? Instead of using a stove or fireplace, why does&#39;t he just command Ariel to warm things up a bit.</p>
<p>Now I am aware that my concern here is a little on the ridiculous side. Shakespeare is simply making up an excuse to keep Caliban around because Caliban is essential to the play. Nevertheless, it&#39;s an odd justification -- although in truth no odder than that Shakespeare feels it necessary to give Caliban a practical, down-to-earth function in such a wildly unmoored-to-reality play.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>(When I was a teacher I would always run aground of the engineering student who would explain to me that Gregor Samsa&#39;s metamorphosis into a beetle was unrealistic because a beetle of human size couldn&#39;t be supported on insect legs and would be too large to breathe through spirochetes. &quot;It&#39;s a story,&quot; I would respond. &quot;A fiction. You have to suspend disbelief. You can&#39;t accept the transformation but boggle at Gregor&#39;s breathing.&quot;)</p>
<p>Similarly, it is foolish for me to believe, so to speak, in Caliban, and yet to worry about his log-carrying. Or about the temperature of Prospero&#39;s home.&#0160;</p>
<p>But I think there is a point to be made about Shakespeare. He could imagine magic but he could not get his mind around practical, down-to-earth post-Baconian technology. He had no trouble making his characters fly, but he couldn&#39;t imagine a room (or a cave) being heated except by wood, magically chainsawed and laboriously stacked. In <em>Cymbeline</em>, impatient Imogen, in need of quick transport to Milford Haven, asks for a horse with wings, not a helicopter. Shakespeare was not a technological visionary.&#0160; &#0160;</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Not only Shakespeare specialists, but lay readers and playgoers are puzzled by&#0160;Caliban&#39;s mysterious &quot;scamels.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>From the context, it&#39;s clear that scamels are an easily obtained food. Listen as Caliban lists some of the items he can gather from his island&#39;s prodigious storehouse:</p>
<p>I prithee let me bring thee where crabs grow;</p>
<p>And I with my long nails will dig thee pig-nuts,</p>
<p>Show thee a jay&#39;s nest, and instruct thee how</p>
<p>To snare the nimble marmoset.&#0160; I&#39;ll bring thee</p>
<p>To clust&#39;ring filberts, and sometimes I&#39;ll get thee</p>
<p>Young scamels from the rock.</p>
<p>Alas and alack, there is no such thing as a &quot;scamel.&quot;</p>
<p>Caliban&#39;s taste in food is catholic, as is to be expected of a hunter-gatherer.&#0160;Nevertheless, his is not an appealing diet. &quot;Crabs&quot; could refer either to crustaceans or to crab-apples. &quot;Pig-nuts&quot; are barely edible tubers.&#0160;A &quot;jay&#39;s nest&quot; does not sound gourmetish, and even if Caliban means the jays themselves, he&#39;s not chosen a species of bird famous for flavor.&#0160;The &quot;nimble marmoset&quot; is a small monkey which a 1613 pamphlet (too late for <em>The Tempest, </em>written c. 1611) acknowledged to be &quot;good meat&quot;. &quot;Filberts&quot;&#0160; Shakespeare&#39;s spelling is &#39;Philbirts&#39;) are also called hazelnuts, the North American variety of which -- the unappetizing beaked hazelnut -- is better browsed by our native deer than by <em>homines sapientes</em>.&#0160;But what, prithee, are these peculiar scamels?</p>
<p>Among the older guesses: shamois (young kids); scannel (a kind of hawk); scams (a dialectical word for limpets, or snails); seamar, or wild trefoil; sarcelle, the French word for the teal; scallion; seagull.</p>
<p>But modern scholarship has coalesced around &quot;sea-mell.&quot; It&#39;s now thought (by 90% of those who have studied the question) that Shakespeare knew a manuscript report&#0160;about a shipwreck called &quot;A true repertory of the wreck and redemption of Sir Thomas Gates, Knight, upon and from the islands of the Bermudas...July 15, 1610,&quot; which was not printed until 1625 in <em>Purchas his Pilgrimes.&#0160;</em>Among the details that Shakespeare found in the &quot;true repertory&quot; was a brief account of a bird called a &quot;sea-meawe&quot;:&#0160;&quot;a kind of web-footed fowl there is, the bigness of an English plover... [which] hovering in the air made a strange hollow and harsh howling.... Our men found a pretty way to take them, which was by standing on the <strong>rocks </strong>or sands ... whereof the birds would come flocking to that place nearer and nearer.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sea-meawes&quot;&#0160; (a variant of seamell)&#0160;was the word that Shakespeare encountered in the manuscript letter.</p>
<p>I believe that he read the second letter of sea-meawe not as an &quot;e&quot; but as a &quot;c&quot;, or, alternatively, Shakespeare&#39;s own ms &quot;e&quot; was misread as a &quot;c&quot; by Ralph Crane, the scrivener who prepared a fair copy of Shakespeare&#39;s holograph for publication -- &#0160;or perhaps even the compositor&#0160; who was assigned to set the Folio page A5v misread Crane&#39;s fair copy. A &quot;scamel,&quot; I&#39;m .9 positive, is a seabird hunted from a rock; it&#39;s a sea-mew or sea-mell.</p>
<p><em>The Tempest </em>is filled with words compounded of the prefix &quot;sea&quot; and a second element: sea-nymphs, sea-sorrow, sea-change, sea-swallowed, sea-marge. Why would Shakespeare not have been enchanted by the fortuitous &quot;seamell?&quot; Scamel indeed!</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Regular readers of Dr. Metablog know that the good doctor has been flat on his back for&#0160;a couple of months.&#0160;&#0160;However, I&#39;m glad to say, the crisis has passed and I&#39;m upright once again.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>While lying there I had an opportunity to think about old times. I began to recall some things that my father used to say.&#0160; I wouldn&#39;t say proverbs or gnomic wisdom or anything so formal -- just sentences that would occasionally, casually, pass his lips.&#0160;&#0160;Here are a few of them, lightly annotated.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>1.&quot;Never omit an opportunity to do a someone a favor, and never be embarrassed to accept a favor.&quot; My father would say, &quot;people like to help each other.&quot;&#0160; My own experience has confirmed my father&#39;s wisdom and I&#39;ve tried to follow his example. However, there was a time that I ran into a stone wall with this one,&#0160; I was forced into close dealings with a man whom it was impossible to help -- because whenever I did something for him, he thought that it meant that he had outwitted me. My favor, offered freely, became his triumph. Needless to say, our relationship did not prosper.&#0160;</p>
<p>2.&#0160; &quot;Anyone can get rich if he makes it the entire effort of his life.&quot;&#0160; My father was the least materialistic person I&#39;ve ever known. He had no possessions and wanted none. Not only did money hold no allure, but he was contemptuous of those who felt the need to acquire it. But was he right? Can &quot;anyone&quot; get rich?&#0160; I don&#39;t think so. I&#39;ve known people who tried and have gone down in flames.&#0160; But I certainly understand my father&#39;s point.</p>
<p>3.&#0160;&#0160;&quot;When the stock market is going up, everyone&#39;s a genius.&quot; I know that my father owned one stock in his entire life -- because a friend insisted. He would have kept his cash in the mattress if he could have. I think that recent world economic events confirm his sentence and lead to a corollary -- &quot;sometimes the geniuses only seem to be geniuses.&quot;</p>
<p>4.&#0160; &quot;Never get into an argument with a drunk.&quot; He was certainly 100% on target on this one. There&#39;s just no odds -- even if you win the argument, the drunk doesn&#39;t know it. Plus the jerk is liable to throw the beer bottle at you. (I doubt that my father was drunk a single time in his entire life. I was drunk once, in 1962, and it was enough).&#0160;</p>
<p>5.&#0160; &quot;Try to do the things you&#39;re not good at.&quot; He said that when he was younger he would say, &quot;I don&#39;t like to swim&quot; when the truth of the matter was that he wasn&#39;t a good swimmer. (He was a fine athlete.)&#0160; He would counsel me -- &quot;do what if you&#39;re not good at it. Try it.&quot;&#0160; I wish I could say that I&#39;ve honored this precept, but in all honesty, I haven&#39;t. Sorry, pop.</p>
<p>6.&#0160; &quot;Don&#39;t forget to wash behind your ears.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>7.&#0160;&#0160;&quot;Always try to appeal to the better side of human nature.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;For example, in raising children, you should not punish a child; instead, you should say, &quot;you don&#39;t want to be the kind of person who would do such-and--such.&quot;&#0160; I believe this saying of his to be practical and useful. Needless to say, my father didn&#39;t respect&#0160; that side of the political/ religious/ social spectrum that considers human beings to be fallen, inherently depraved and selfish creatures. He was basically optimistic -- though his optimism was certainly tempered by the public events of his last decade.</p>
<p>8.&#0160; &quot;Never run with the crowd for the sake of being one of the boys.&quot;&#0160; This saying was central to his view of the world. I believe it came out of some particular experience of his youth but he never shared the details with me. I can certainly say that I&#39;ve honored this precept -- perhaps to a fault. I could have been more sociable, more &quot;clubbable&quot;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Miss Dusenberry, an English teacher at Erasmus Hall High School, was a formidable presence.</p>
<p>It was 1954 or 1955 and I was a junior, carrying just sixteen years of experience on my skinny back. To my shy, inhibited self, Miss Dusenberry (Edna? Grace?) was perceived as ancient (50s), statuesque (5&#39; 10&quot;), domineering (she spoke authoritatively on all things literary) and wildly eccentric. She wore fragrant cosmetics and bedecked herself with so many bracelets and bangles that, striding imperiously around the room, she jingled atonally and constantly.</p>
<p>My schoolwork did not please her. Miss Dusenberry derailed my educational career, demoting me from the honors track in English (where the bright students were grouped and where lessons were taught) to the general track where classrooms were disorderly, students ranged from noncompliant to sociopathic, and it was assumed that nothing would be learned, and it wasn&#39;t.</p>
<p>Yesterday, on an odd nostalgic impulse, I re-read Hawthorne&#39;s <em>Young Goodman Brown </em>for the first time in close to sixty years. The story is more shocking to me now than it could possibly have been in the 50s, when I had no background to understand puritanism or the manichean view of the world. The story is more alarming in what it takes for granted about American culture than for what it consciously critiques. Hawthorne&#39;s world is not and never has been, my America.&#0160;</p>
<p>Not only was I distressed by the story, but my mind flew back, or regressed, to Miss Dusenberry herself, who tried to present the story to unsophisticated, un-empathetic me back there in the Duke Snider/Joe McCarthy/Sid Caesar era. No wonder that I flopped in Miss D&#39;s class. Good grief, was I ever unwordly/unPuritan! On my intellectual horizon, the big worry was whether Roy or Gil might go hitless two days in a row. I had not the merest tad of experience (or even reading) to bring to bear on the elucidation of a dark allegorical treatment of severe Calvinist soul-sickness. Didn&#39;t, for that matter, know what Christians were talking about, except that the women and the kids dressed up and went to mass on Sundays (in our Neapolitan and Sicilian immigrant neighborhood, men stayed home and washed the car). There were no devils, real, imaginary, or allegorical in my deep, mysterious forests -- and no forests either, in concrete Brooklyn. I had no concept of spiritual despair or sin or damnation or salvation or any such things -- still don&#39;t in fact -- not in any personal way.&#0160;</p>
<p>Anyway, back in Erasmus Hall,&#0160;Miss Dusenberry led the class through some stories by Hawthorne.&#0160;We might even have read <em>The House of Seven Gables -- </em>that other novel, the one with the A-word, would have been far too sexual and embarrassing. Then came the unit exam and that&#39;s when the allegorical world of Calvinism hit the fan of naive Flatbush literalism. The topic on which we were assigned to write an in-class essay was -- &quot;Is there balm in Gilead?&quot;</p>
<p>I got to&#0160;tell you, I was buffaloed.&#0160;</p>
<p>It&#39;s easy to look back now, sixty years later, and translate Miss Dusenberry&#39;s question into &quot;in Hawthorne&#39;s view, is there hope for spiritual redemption in a fallen universe?&quot; An invitation, I must say, to turn the bullshittery up to eleven. But I didn&#39;t know the word &quot;balm&quot; and I had never heard of &quot;Gilead.&quot; I didn&#39;t know the hymn and I most certainly didn&#39;t know that there was any such thing as a Book of Jeremiah which contained relevant dark sentences to be interpreted allegorically or mystically.</p>
<p>So I failed, ignominiously. Not the worst failure of my childhood -- being thrown out at home plate when I had been sent in as a pinch-runner was a far greater ignominy. But to tell truth, I&#39;ve never made my peace with Miss Dusenberry. Her bangles occasionally rattle my sleep.</p>
<p>Hawthorne? well, I&#39;ve just kind of set him to one side.&#0160;&#0160;</p>

				<p>Regular readers of this blague&#0160;have got to be wondering -- where have you gone, Dr. Metablog?&#0160;A hungry readership turns&#0160;their lonely eyes to you (woo woo woo}. We&#39;re missing your pithy and astute commentary. All these athletic contests come and gone, even including the World Cup, and all those political follies,&#0160;and not a word of commentary?&#0160; How can it be, Dr. M? Cat got your tongue?&#0160;</p>
<p>Well, dear blogreaders, the fact of the matter is that Dr. M. has been sidelined with an injury and has been languishing on the disabled list. Ruptured his disc, he did. L5 if you want to be specific. On his back now these last two weeks, gulping the oxycodone, enduring a series of trips down there to the regional hospital. Dependent on family and friends for succor and sustenance</p>
<p>Lying here, solitary for longer periods than is his wont, Dr. M,, who never had a mind for philosophy, has had an opportunity to meditate on a subject of particular relevance to his condition. He&#39;s been thinking about pain. About dealing with pain.</p>
<p>Sometimes even Dr. M has to deal with very practical problems.</p>
<p>At the hospital,&#0160;various &quot;providers&quot; ask me, over and over again, to&#0160;&quot;put a number from 1 to 10 on the degree of your&#0160;discomfort.&quot;&#0160; &quot;Imagine,&quot; they say,&#0160;that 10 is the worst pain that you can conceive, what is your number?&quot; For me, this becomes a very difficult question, and one to which I don&#39;t know how to respond honestly or accurately. For one thing,&#0160; I have a rather vivid imagination, and for another, I&#39;ve read more than is healthy&#0160;about ingenious systems of&#0160;medieval and&#0160;&quot;renaissance&quot; torture. It&#39;s true that my back hurts,&#0160;and the&#0160;pain is real, but it&#39;s nothing compared to the worst that human beings have endured or can be compelled&#0160;to endure. I&#39;m sorry to say that I can imagine pain an order of magnitude beyond what my questioner can begin to conceptualize.&#0160;</p>
<p>But if I should say, &quot;one&quot; on a scale of one to ten, they&#39;d throw me out of the hospital and give my place to a more deserving&#0160;patient. So I say, &quot;eight and a half&quot; or &quot;nine&quot; -- not because such a&#0160;number has the least bit of&#0160;meaning but because I think I&#39;ve given my interrogators&#0160;the magic number that will allow me to get the care I need.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>I have a friend who had a very painful form of arthritis, but couldn&#39;t get the attention of the medical establishment for many horrible months -- until he answered the pain question with &quot;I&#39;m going to go out in the backyard and shoot myself.&quot; Then he was diagnosed and put on medication in an hour.</p>
<p>Moreover,&#0160;I don&#39;t know how to measure my pain against another&#39;s. My eight might be someone else&#39;s five, or vice versa.&#0160;I don&#39;t want to be theatrical (I can&#39;t bear to be a spectacle), but I also have no desire to be excessively stoical. A ruptured disc hurts. Ask anyone who&#39;s been there.&#0160;Is it equivalent to childbirth? I suspect not.&#0160;I know that burns are supposed to be infinitely more agonizing. I got to the point of&#0160;wincing and moaning and feeling faint, but not to fainting or writhing or screaming. And&#0160;I could always get relief from oxycodone, which is not always the case in more serious situations. I even had some morphine, which, at the time, was surprisingly ineffective. Now I&#39;m on the road to recovery, I believe, and the pain is very much handled with those horse-size ibuprofen. But ten days ago it was all narcotics, all the time. And I was grateful for them. Very much so.</p>
<p>I am reminded once again&#0160;that pain is&#0160;isolating. It separates you from your friends. You live in the pain, and with the pain, and you deal with the pain. You can&#39;t communicate it and you don&#39;t want to communicate it.</p>
<p>I fault myself for not having been sufficiently empathetic during my lifetime to the pain that other people have experienced.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>While I&#39;ve been lying here, I&#39;ve read two books by daring people who do not hesitate to court pain. The kind of person who decides to climb an unclimbable mountain, break his leg and then drags himself miles, freezing, starving, crippled. The kind of person who leaves warm hearth and happy home to walk to the South Pole dragging a two hundred kilogram sledge. These folks endure all sorts of horrors, voluntarily. Then they write books about their pain (whole paragraphs which I involuntarily skim and skip). When I read these stories, I feel like a wimp to complain about a ruptured disc. On the other hand, I feel sane -- not to have deliberately injured myself for the sake of some wild, inexplicable impulse.</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><span class="firstwords">There&#39;s an article&#0160;in the current <em>Harvard Magazine</em>&#0160;on the subject of caregiving. (I&#39;ve been thinking about caregiving quite a bit the last while, because I&#39;ve been the recipient of a lot of it, having been bedridden for a couple of weeks with a slipped, or herniated, or ruptured disc). Taking care of me has been a chore, performed with great grace and generosity&#0160;by Mrs. Dr. M, by Dr. M&#39;s oldest son, and by his son&#39;s wonderful wife.&#0160; </span></p>
<p><span class="firstwords">The article on caregiving begins with a striking, unsettling anecdote.&#0160; </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000bf;"><span class="firstwords">In </span>1966, <span class="firstwords">as a visiting medical student at a</span> London teaching hospital, I interviewed a husband and wife, in their early twenties, who had recently experienced a truly calamitous health catastrophe. On their wedding night, in their first experience of sexual intercourse, a malformed blood vessel in the husband’s brain burst, leaving him with a disabling paralysis of the right side of his body. Stunned and guilt-ridden, the couple clutched hands and cried silently as they shared their suffering with me. My job was to get the neurological examination right and diagnose where the rupture had taken place.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000bf;"><span style="color: #000000;">The author&#39;s point is that a diagnosis is incomplete in the absence of compassion, not only in this most dramatic case but in more ordinary occasions.&#0160;&#0160;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000bf;"><span style="color: #000000;">It has been difficult for me to keep my mind off this&#0160;traumatized young couple --- stepping enthusiastically and it would appear naively into a first adventure in sexual expression only to be overwhelmed by an out-of-the-blue horror. It&#39;s a sorrow beyond ordinary sorrow. I wish that the author had added a paragraph in which he reported that the young man recovered, that surgery corrected the defect, and that the couple went on to live a long and satisfying life. I fear that the absence of such a report means that there was no good news. Starting with an aneurysm in the brain, it&#39;s easy to descend into scenarios of doom.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000bf;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ah life! So many potential disasters out there, so many bullets to dodge.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000bf;"><span style="color: #000000;">Even while I&#39;m lying here, unable to get around without pain, I know that I&#39;ve lived a most fortunate life. No intercourse-related aneurysms, for one thing.</span></span></p>

				<p>I would have been six or seven years old, so it was&#0160;1945 or 1946. I was visiting the apartment at 334 Eastern Parkway where my grandmother lived with&#0160;Aunt Mollie. Mollie and my father were engaged in an earnest conversation of which I understood not a whit. I suspect that&#0160;they were speaking the language of the old country. Very likely they didn&#39;t want me to know what they were saying.</p>
<p>I was on the floor studying what I now realize was some sort of halftone illustration. Perhaps a magazine illustration -- something from Life or Look or Collier&#39;s. Halftone is a style of reproduction in which a picture is comprised of a myriad of tiny dots. When halftones are done inexpensively, as in comic books, the dots are plainly visible. When they&#39;re done expertly, they&#39;re almost beyond the perception of the human eye. But they&#39;re not invisible to the inspection&#0160;of a small child.</p>
<p>I said to my father and to my aunt something to the effect that&#0160;&quot;if you look at this picture closely, you can see a lot of dots.&quot; I passed the illustration to my father. He said, &quot;No, there are no dots there.&quot; I said, &quot;Look again. I can see dots.&quot;&#0160; He looked again and so did Mollie. &quot;Nope, no dots,&quot; they both agreed. They handed back&#0160;the picture and resumed&#0160;their discussion. I had been, in modern terms, totally dissed. &#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;Who are you going to believe? Me, or your own eyes?&quot; says&#0160;Chicolini in <em>Duck Soup.</em></p>
<p>I was shocked. My father, whom I knew to be correct in all things -- to deny the existence of something that I could plainly detect. And my aunt as well. Two adults, neither one who had ever been wrong about anything! What was going on here? What was a child to think? It was a moment of great revelation, and a turning point in my worldly experience.</p>
<p>Well, I wasn&#39;t about to argue with such formidable figures. But I knew in my heart that I was right and they were wrong, wrong, wrong.</p>
<p>I also knew that I had to choose between Authority and my own senses. And of course I chose sensation. The picture was made out of dots, no matter what they said.</p>
<p>But my infant mind did not rest. At that moment, I knew that I would never ever put blind trust in authority, never again. If my own father couldn&#39;t see the dots and I could, then how could I believe anything that was contrary to the evidence of my senses. My infant bosom got its back up, and I became a skeptic -- and I&#39;ve remained a skeptic.</p>
<p>It was&#0160;not until many years later that I realized that&#0160;the senses themselves could be untrustworthy.&#0160; But by that time, my habits were fixed. In a contest between authority&#0160;and the evidence of the senses -- it would be sense all the way.&#0160;&#0160;</p>

				<p>It had been a while since I last flew Frontier --the airline with the cute furry anthropomorphic talking mammals on their tails. There have been some changes -- all of them for the worse. There&#39;s now an extra charge for each piece of luggage. Those free meals are a thing of the remote past. So are the days when you would get the entire can of ginger ale or tomato juice. It&#39;s now a splash of juice in a cup of ice. No free TV -- you swipe your card, they swipe your cash. The seats are smaller, too. More rows,less leg room. Wasn&#39;t there a time when air travel was glamorous? Now it&#39;s just a big Greyhound in the sky, a warehouse on wings.&#0160;</p>
<p>Not only was my seat compressed, but the back didn&#39;t recline.&#0160; Somehow I had signed up for a seat that bordered on the emergency exit row. In earlier planes, such seats used to recline, but I&#39;m guessing that Frontier has gained a few inches by rendering the backs immobile -- at the cost of my comfort (but not at reduced cost).</p>
<p>Adding to the insult is an unapologetic sign on the back of the seat in front of me inscribed with the words NO RECLINE THIS SEAT. I wonder what language the author of this sign think he is using. Not English, that&#39;s for sure. &quot;No recline this seat&quot; does not even come close to parsing. What would it have cost Frontier to affix a sign that read &quot;the seats in this row do not recline.&quot; Where do they outsource their signs -- to Mars? No recline this seat!!&#0160; Come on, frontiersmen; you can do better than that. If you have no respect for me, at least have a little respect for the language. The talking animals speak better English.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>To the chief of sign-makers at&#0160;Frontier I say, &quot;No hire this job.&quot;</p>
<p>There was another sign for me to stare out while I sat there, miserably cramped, watching the clock. &quot;LIFE VEST UNDER YOUR SEAT.&quot;&#0160; Is Frontier banging the frugality drum a little too hard? The sentence might have read, &quot;Life vest IS under your seat.&quot;&#0160; How much could a trifling copulative verb cost?&#0160; If Frontier wanted to be truly prodigal, it could even have raised the cash to provide an indefinite article: &quot;A life vest is under your seat.&quot; Wow. A complete sentence!. What a concept!&#0160;</p>

				<p>&quot;I grew up in Durban and in Cape Town. It was a privileged enclave. I had no idea what was going on except that when I competed in sports, there were kids who had no shoes. That was my first awareness. I went to government schools, but everyone was white. The teachers were not allowed to talk politics but we knew how they felt. When I was eighteen and finished high school, I could either go into the &quot;police&quot; or to jail.&#0160; f you were in the police or in the army, you were going to fight the guerrillas in Angola or you were going to put down the natives. My mother was British, so I had a British passport. I left the country. I was a triathlete. Sometimes we were sent to train in South Africa. I knew then that I could never come back. I lived in France for fourteen years. We lived in southern France, in Marseilles and in Avignon. There were many Arabs and they would jeer at my wife when she went running. We came to Boulder because of the running community. It&#39;s a great place for children. It may be a bubble, but it&#39;s a good bubble. I don&#39;t run anymore but I coach triathletes. It&#39;s what I know how to do.</p>
<p>Mandela was amazing. He was very forgiving. I don&#39;t know if it will always be forgiving. I completely understand the resentment.&quot;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I finally got around to watching <em>In America, </em>a film which won all sorts of awards in 2002 and which I ordered from Netflix after it appeared on someone&#39;s best films of the decade list. It&#39;s a fine movie, especially if you enjoy piping your eye from dawn to dusk. Always susceptible, I cried a full quart. Samantha Morton, familiar from her role as Hattie in <em>Sweet and Lowdown, </em>is endowed with the most expressive face in the history of cinema, and the director of <em>In America</em>, Jim Sheridan, is smart enough to take advantage of her features.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>The story is not unfamiliar -- immigrants in America, culture-clash and assimilation, poverty and a bit of triumph at the end.&#0160; he film skirts dangerously close to cliche and occasionally falls over the precipice -- I&#39;m sorry but I&#39;ve seen too many movies in which an emotionally-stunted hero waits until the final frame before he breaks into tears.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p><em>In America </em>is at heart a drama about replacing the dead child. Johnny and Sarah Sheridan lost a boy to a brain tumor and they&#39;ve been off balance ever since.&#0160; They&#39;re not going to be whole until they make another baby. Sarah&#39;s pregnancy is precarious and the parturition difficult, and in a contrived piece of hoakum, the baby doesn&#39;t begin to thrive until the suffering soul of a dying friend is mystically infused into her.</p>
<p>No thought is given (nor should it be) to the poor baby, whose whole life will be colored by her entrance into the world as savior and redeemer and who will be freighted with expectations that she will never be able to fulfill.&#0160;&#0160;</p>

				<p>The 6&#39; 8&quot; Russian oligarch and billionaire Mikhail Dmitrievitch Prokhorov, chairman of the conglomerate Polylus Gold and president of the Onexim Group has acquired the New Jersey Nets. The Nets (or as they are sometimes known, the Swamp Dragons), are moving to Atlantic Yards in Brooklyn year after next, and Prokhorov wants to change the team&#39;s name to something more germane. It&#39;s a monumental challenge to find the correct moniker. After all, what Brooklynite would be content with Brooklyn Nets, especially when the New Jersey team carries with a storied history of failure, mismanagement, and dysfunction. Who can forget the sale, for a few paltry bucks, of Dr. J himself?</p>
<p>Should the Nets be renamed the Brooklyn Dodgers?&#0160;Too presumptuous by half.&#0160;In honor of Prokhorov, how about the Brooklyn Billionaires?&#0160;&#0160;Not fan-friendly.&#0160;Brooklyn Gold?&#0160;Brooklyn Samovars?&#0160;Brooklyn Borsht?&#0160;</p>
<p>My good friend Otis Jefferson Brown proposes Brooklyn Eagles. I think it&#39;s a brilliant idea. It has history, especially for those who remember the Brooklyn Eagle (once edited by Walt Whitman -- 5 &#39;11&quot;, 200); it has patriotism, it has style, and it lends itself to headlines -- &quot;Eagles Soar Once Again&quot;;&#0160; &quot;Eagles Tear Apart Hawks.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>Unless someone comes up with a better name, I&#39;m going with Brooklyn Eagles.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>One of the awkwardnesses that we dysgeographicoids, or directional dyslexics (or whatever you want to call us) have to come to grips with is -- being asked for directions.&#0160;You might just be walking down a street, more or less aware of where you are, and a car pulls up next to you and a lady leans out of the window and asks, how do you get to, let&#39;s say, the football stadium.&#0160;I don&#39;t know about you, but I immediately break into a sweat.&#0160;Especially if it&#39;s a place that I&#39;ve been to a hundred times and ought to know like the back of my hand.&#0160;The best way to deal with the tension and anxiety generated by such questions is to pretend complete ignorance:&#0160;&quot;I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;d like to help you, but I&#39;m a visitor here.&quot;&#0160;Sure, it&#39;s an itsy-bitsy lie, but a useful one, because the lady in the automobile is going to get much better instructions from the next person she asks, who will probably be completely normal, direction-wise.&#0160;</p>
<p>I remember a particularly tragic instance of direction-giving-panic from my time in England.&#0160;I used to walk, once a week, from Charing Cross Station to the British Museum.&#0160;The streets were all a-tangle -- not a one of them parallel or perpendicular.&#0160;I carried a detailed map but nevertheless, week after week, I managed to lose myself in the maze. I would have thought that I appeared to be totally bewildered, but nevertheless, I was several times accosted by tourists and asked the way to some monument or tube station.&#0160;Of course I didn&#39;t have the least clue.&#0160;</p>
<p>Yesterday, walking to the library, a lady in an automobile asked me the directions to Whole Foods. I&#0160; tried not to panic but I could feel the clammy hand around my heart. &quot;Which Whole Foods,&quot; I asked, stalling. &quot;Nearest one.&quot; Well, I&#39;ve been there a hundred times, so I made an effort. Plus I knew it was only two right turns. &quot;A few blocks this way,&quot; I said, pointing, and then turn right until 30th Street. Big shopping center on the left.&quot;&#0160; So the car drove off and I spent the next ten minutes wondering whether I had given the right directions. Is it after or before 30th Street? Is there an easier way? Is the other Whole Foods closer than the one to which I sent her? What would a directionally-gifted person have said?&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>But at least I hadn&#39;t sent her in the absolute wrong direction.&#0160;I think.&#0160;&#0160;</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>At the coffee shop, reading Crackanthorpe and drinking my horrid decaf tea, a phrase from the conversation of the important-looking business guys at the next table wafted my way. &quot;We don&#39;t have to re-invent the wheel.&quot; Wow, I thought to myself, does anyone still perpetrate that old cliche -- and do so without a shred of irony or self-awareness?&#0160; I listened more closely to them and in less than five minutes plucked the following flowers of wilted rhetoric:</p>
<p>&quot;From the get-go&quot; -- &quot;chicken-and-egg problem&quot; -- &quot;here&#39;s the pressure point&quot; -- &quot;low-hanging fruit&quot; -- &quot;where the rubber meets the road&quot; -- &quot;that&#39;s the genie coming out of the bottle&quot; -- &quot;it&#39;s fifty-fifty&quot;&#0160; -- &quot;here&#39;s my quick pitch.&quot;</p>
<p>All useful phrases, I suppose. Shorthand. But, nevertheless, kind of embarrassingly banal.</p>
<p>If these guys sensed my disapproval, why, they&#39;d probably laugh all the way to the bank.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>My advice to them, and to others similarly situated: when you use cliches, try to think outside the box and turn it into a win-win situation. You don&#39;t have to knock the ball out of the park, language-wise, but you don&#39;t need to throw anyone under the bus either. It&#39;s all water under the bridge that we&#39;ll cross when we get there. Can we agree to disagree?&#0160; When you look at this problem from the 30,000 foot level, then, and only then, can you eat the elephant one bite at a time. So, let&#39;s give it 110%. And, you know, if you fail to plan, you plan to fail. Are we all on the same page?&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>The Crackanthorpe name is not as well known as it should be. The short stories in <em>Wreckage </em>(1893) are a good sharp antidote to the pieties and sentimentalities of Victorian fiction.</p>
<p>There must be hundreds of novels which feature a virtuous, long-suffering heroine, who, however mistreated, turns cheek after cheek until her patience is rewarded with a beau and an unexpected inheritance. Think Jane Eyre.</p>
<p>Here is Hubert Crackanthorpe&#39;s version of this archetype:</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000bf;">&quot;A blind desire to silence [Aunt Lisbet], to stamp the life out of her, swept over Lilly. Seizing the parasol, which lay on the kitchen table, with all her strength she Aunt Lisbet across the side of her head.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000bf;">And over the thought of that blow she lingered, recalling it again and again, repeating it in her mind with a strange, exquisite pleasure. </span><span style="color: #0000bf;">For into it she had put the hatred of years.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000bf;">Aunt Lisbet uttered a low, plaintive moan -- the curious moan of sudden pain -- and fell, dragging with her on to the floor a pile of plates.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000bf;">The crash sent every nerve in Lilly&#39;s body tingling, but when, a moment later, Aunt Lisbet moved to get up, the blind, murderous desire returned. Another brutal blow of the parasol, and she knocked her back again.&quot;</span></p>
<p>Hubert Crackanthorpe drowned (perhaps accidentally, perhaps taking his own life) at age 26. His fiction is sometimes compared to that of de Maupassant, but I prefer to think of him as the Dostoevsky that England never produced.&#0160;</p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2010/05/mrs-peixada-by-sidney-luska-1886.html">Mrs. Peixada by "Sidney Luska" (1886)</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I&#39;ve just read, and much enjoyed, a novel called <em>Mrs. Peixada, </em>by one Sidney Luska. The novel was published in 1886 by Cassell &amp; Company, Limited, at 739 Broadway, in New York City. I had it recalled it from the library&#39;s archives, where, from all the evidence, it hadn&#39;t been touched for a hundred or so years. Why did I read this book? Because a) I&#39;m reading stuff from the last two decades of the nineteenth century, and b) because the novel is listed in the bibliography of the wonderful anthology <em>Victorian Love Stories </em>(1996) edited and illuminated by Kate Flint -- an anthology which persuaded me that although I think of myself as moderately well read in Victorian fiction, there are untold riches out there of which I am embarrassed to be unaware.&#0160;</p>
<p><em>Mrs. Peixada </em>isn&#39;t exactly a shower of gold, but it&#39;s a revelation. The author &quot;Sidney Luska&quot; turns out to be a pseudonym for Henry Harland, who is better known for his second career as an editor of the <em>Yellow Book.</em>&#0160;I guess that <em>Mrs. Peixada </em>falls into the broad category, novel of sensation, but it&#39;s also a mystery story laced with occasional touches of social comedy and progressive social thought.&#0160;</p>
<p>The plot could be next year&#39;s blockbuster movie. Arthur Ripley woos and falls in love with the mysterious young widow, Ruth Lehmyl, who has recently moved into an apartment in his Beekman Place neighborhood. We&#39;re treated to the details their sophisticated and modern courtship&#0160; -- music, museums, poetry. At the same time, Ripley, a lawyer, has been engaged to track down a murderess named Mrs. Peixada, who fled New York after being acquitted on grounds of insanity of murdering her husband. Ripley tracks her from Vienna to Rome and to London, but then loses her trail. He marries Mrs. Lehmyl --&#0160; only to discover that she and Mrs. Peixada are one and the same person.&#0160;</p>
<p>Although there are holes in the plot through which a daumont or shandrydan could be driven with room to spare, the novel is engaging and intriguing. But then I&#39;m an easy mark.</p>
<p>Perhaps our screen writers aught to do some looking at the lower tier of Victorian novels&#0160; -- especially if (as it seems) they&#39;re interested in making lower-tier movies.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>But for me -- it&#39;s time to learn more about Henry Harland.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>The downtown mall is home to a motley assemblage of street buskers. Some are excellent and welcome performers: the occasional string quartet, the accomplished visiting bluegrass band, a witty gaggle of a cappella singers. Others are less excellent but still tolerable; the contortionist, the magician with the rings that divide and rejoin, the sword-swallower, the zip-code man, the fire-eater, the too-young violin student supervised by his mommy, the juggler whose act hasn&#39;t changed since the days when he was known as a joculator. And then a step lower still: that inaudible French girl who struggles with her ukelele. Less welcome are the drummers: bang, bang, bang with no discernible rhythm, just noise great enough to set off sympathetic vibrations in your own personal pancreas. But the worst of the worst is the didgeridoo-master. After decades of practice, all that the didge player can produce is an ugly drone. One note. It goes on and on, relentlessly, and it&#39;s dull, grating and loud. If you haven&#39;t heard it, imagine a big old bagpipe, playing one note at the bottom of its range, for ever, and ever, and ever. Worse still are didgeridoo assemblies: didgetets or didgeridoo chamber orchestras.&#0160;</p>
<p>The didgeridoo comes to us from northern Australia, where it was invented more that 1500 years ago. Perhaps it hasn&#39;t evolved because it&#39;s thought to be sacred. While the rest of the world developed wind instruments that played a variety of colorful notes, the non-innovative didge people embraced an unchanging and exceedingly boring drone. They are patient people. One by one, native Australians said no to the bassoon, the clarinet, the horn, the sax, the flute, the piccolo, the trumpet, the tuba, the oboe bright and cheerful, and decided that a branch of a eucalyptus tree, naturally hollowed by termites, was all that they needed in the way of wind-instruments. In another fit of imagination, they invented the bull-roarer, an instrument that hasn&#39;t yet taken a bow on the mall, but trust me, it won&#39;t be long.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Let&#39;s face it;&#0160; the didgeridoo is an instrument that hasn&#39;t produced a pleasant sound in many thousands of years. It has no plans to do so. Didgeridooists are barking up the wrong tree -- it&#39;s never going to be music. It&#39;s always going to be noise.</p>
<p>Which brings me to my point, which is that would-be mall performers should not be permitted to busk until they have passed a performance test and have been granted a license. The Board of Acceptability would consist of some of the more traditionalist faculty of both the Music School and the Department of Theater and Drama. The chairman would be an open-minded but engaged citizen, such as Me.&#0160; Approval must be unanimous. We (the Board) would strictly enforce standards of artistic excellence. Life would improve.</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Novacaine was discovered sometime around the turn of the last century, but it hadn&#39;t reached the backward interior of Brooklyn during my childhood. As a result, I endured hours of drilling and filling without anaesthetics. It was horrible.</p>
<p>The local dentist was named Dr. Caress. It would have been more appropriate if he had been called Dr. Butcher.&#0160;</p>
<p>There were no high-speed drills. Dr. Caress used a mechanical drill -- a motor attached to a system of small pulleys, if I remember correctly, at the business end of which was some sort of bur. It was slow and awkward and It took forever to drill out a cavity. There was lots of starting and stopping and moaning and readjusting and rinsing and spitting. I can still remember the pain. It was not a &quot;discomfort&quot; kind of pain. It was a torture kind of pain.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>In a previous <a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2007/05/boustrophedonia.html.html">post,</a> I expressed fascination that writing could go in any possible direction. I began with Swift, who satirized both &quot;women&quot; and the English when he described the fanciful Lilliputian script: <span style="color: #111111;">&quot;their manner of Writing is very peculiar, being neither from the Left to the Right, like the Europeans; nor from the Right to the Left, like the Arabians; nor from up to down, like the Chinese; nor from down to up, like the Cascagians; but aslant from one Corner of the Paper to the other, like Ladies in England.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #111111;">To Swift&#39;s curious catalog (the Cascagians are of course his own invention), I added boustrophedon, a system that Swift did not know but one that would surely have delighted him.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #111111;">In boustrophedon (a lovely Greekish word that signifies &quot;turn like an ox plowing&quot;), alternate lines move in opposite directions. Lines one, three, five and seven and so on proceed from left to right; lines two, four, six, and eight from right to left. Ancient languages such as Safaitic were written in boustrophedon; some Etruscan inscriptions, still undeciphered, seem to follow the same pattern.</span></p>
<p>Boustrophedon is not unreasonable, but it&#39;s certainly awkward for those of us who have made a fetish of left to right. Here&#39;s how Shakespeare transforms boustrophedonically. The passage takes a bit of effort to read but it&#39;s certainly intelligible. &#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>It is the cause, it is the cause, my soul,—</p>
<p>!srats etsahc uoy, uoy ot ti eman ton em teL</p>
<p>It is the cause. Yet I&#39;ll not shed her blood;</p>
<p>,wons naht sreh fo niks retihw taht racs roN</p>
<p>And smooth as <span class="keyword1">monumental</span> alabaster.</p>
<p>.nem erom yarteb ll&#39;ehs esle, eid tsum ehs teY.&#0160;</p>
<p>Right, left, up, down, aslant, and back and forth might seem to have exhausted the possible formats. But such is not the case. Rongorongo, the language of Easter Island, is written in still another style, that of &quot;reverse boustrophedon.&quot; In <em>Lost Languages </em>(2002), Andrew Robinson describes how this most peculiar system works.&#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;To read a Rongorongo tablet, one started at the bottom left-hand corner and read along line 1 to the right-hand corner. Then one turned the tablet through 180 degrees and began reading line 2 from left to right again,&#0160; At the end of line 2, one repeated the 180-degree turn so that the tablet was in the same orientation as at the beginning, and read line 3 from left to right and so on....&#0160; Every even-number line is written back-to-front and upside-down in relation to an ordinary English text.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>I don&#39;t believe that even Jonathan Swift could have invented a manner of composition so counter-intuitive, so odd.&#0160; But then, those Easter Islanders (or, more properly, Rapanui) danced to a drummer who is uniquely their own. I don&#39;t believe that there&#39;s a second reverse boustrophedonesque culture anywhere on the planet.&#0160;</p>
<p>Is that all? Are there no other possibilities? Yes indeed, there&#39;s also the phaistos <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Crete_-_Phaistos_disk_-_side_A.JPG">disc</a>, which (according to Andrew Robinson once again), &quot;was discovered in 1908 by Luigi Pernier in the ruins of a palace at Phaistos in southern Crete. The archeological context suggests that the date of the disc is 1850-1600 BC. The disc is 6.5 inches in diameter and .75 inches thick and is made of fine clay. On both sides is an inscription which consists of characters impressed on the wet clay with a punch or stamp before it was fired. <em>They are arranged in a spiral around the center of each side.&quot;&#0160;</em></p>
<p>The writing begins at the outermost circle and works its roundabout way towards the center, which means either that the scribe knew exactly how many letters (or ideographs, or syllables) he intended to use, or that he started at the center and wrote backwards until he reached the circumference of the disc. Neither method is particularly convenient or flexible, so it&#39;s not surprising that spiral writing never caught on. It certainly wouldn&#39;t do for people like me who revise heavily.</p>
<p>The phaistos disc cannot be translated.&#0160;</p>
