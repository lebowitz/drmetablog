		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>While I admire the highly skilled, I am also much attracted to the guys who do a lot with less. It&#39;s good to throw 100 mph, but my hat goes off to the pitchers who succeed with little more than desire and guile.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t mean just baseball. I&#39;ve been watching the NBA playoffs and I&#39;m now prepared to name my All NBA Overachievers, guys, who, metaphorically, can throw 65 on a good day.</p>
<p>Center: Joakim Noah. The most awkward center in the league and one of the most effective. It&#39;s terrifying to watch him try to dribble the ball downcourt. His outside shot is, to say the least, unorthodox. But he works hard on every play and when he&#39;s knocked down, as is frequently the case, he bounces up like some mythological figure who draws strength from the earth. Plus there&#39;s not another center in the league who&#39;s fluent in French and Swedish.&#0160;</p>
<p>Forward. Paul Pierce. Can&#39;t run, can&#39;t jump, but is a perennial all-star and the go-to guy at the end of a close game. I&#39;ve seen him play hundreds of games (since he was at Kansas, in fact), and I&#39;ve never seen him &quot;fill the lane.&quot; He can&#39;t get there in time. Great shooter, though, even if you can&#39;t figure out how he does it, year after year.</p>
<p>Forward.&#0160; Shawn Marion. He must have the ugliest shot in NBA history. He seems to hold it out in front of him and push it off with a stiff arm. And yet it goes in. He couldn&#39;t have gone to basketball camp as a youngster. He does everything &quot;wrong&quot; and yet he&#39;s tremendously effective. And he&#39;s an outstanding defensive player.</p>
<p>Guard:&#0160; Andre Miller. He&#39;s slow, he can&#39;t jump, he has no muscles in his arms, and he can&#39;t shoot 3-pointers. But he&#39;s intelligent, makes the right decisions, and throws the best alley-oop pass in the league. He&#39;s a marvelous player, way undervalued.</p>
<p>Guard.&#0160; Omigosh, I can&#39;t think of another active all-overachiever guard, so I&#39;m going to go with Mark Jackson, now retired, who&#39;s the archetype. Not particularly athletic, not big, not quick, not a leaper by any means, and yet third on the all-time assist list. Smart though -- a Brooklyn boy. &#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>We all remember, and we&#39;re all still shocked and amazed that the late, unlamentable Jerry Falwell proclaimed that the 9/11 attacks on the US were caused by &quot;the pagans, and the abortionists, and the feminists, and the gays, and the lesbians.&quot; How to understand either the logic or the brain of such a thinker? We moderns tend to reason in terms of cause and effect, and cause and effect just doesn&#39;t cut it with Falwell. Was he thinking something like, feminists cause sin (a debatable proposition) and Al-Qaeda wants to cleanse us, so they run the airplanes into the towers. That would be unbelievable nonsense, even for Falwell. Here&#39;s another attempt to divine his mind: feminists are dangerous and evil and therefore the good old US of A has become Sodom/Gomorrah/Ephesus and the Big Guy in the Sky is offended and therefore he engaged Al-Qaeda to punish the US for its sins by enabling or permitting those young Saudi jerks to fly planes into the towers in order to persuade us to repudiate the feminists. Does that make sense? Very little.&#0160;</p>
<p>Similarly, Pat Robertson deduced that Hurricane Katrina was all about abortion. In this case, the Ancient of Days didn&#39;t even bother to enlist human agents. Noticing that there were abortions being performed in the US, he let loose the winds from the caves in which he had confined them and instructed them to bust up the New Orleans dikes and drown a lot of people. &#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Jerry and Pat are a pair of idiots, not only because they lack intelligence, but also because their view of the world is five hundred or a thousand years behind the times. They&#39;d be mainstream in dark/medieval Europe when Attila the Hun and Timur (or Tamburlaine) the Great competed for the title of Scourge of God -- the <em>flagellum dei. </em>They pillaged and burned and raped over vast areas of the world not because they were&#0160; imperialists and conquerors but because they were instruments of god. They wreaked vengeance on our sins. It was orthodoxy. Cause and effect? Sorry, not part of the picture.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>The fallacy <em>post hoc ergo propter hoc&#0160; -- &quot;</em>after this therefore because of this&quot;&#0160; -- means that just because B comes after A doesn&#39;t mean that A causes B. Just because an abortion is followed by a hurricane doesn&#39;t mean that the abortion caused the hurricane. Just because someone prays to one or another god and recovers from illness doesn&#39;t mean that the prayer caused the cure. The volcano isn&#39;t quiescent because we sacrificed the maiden. No religion, not a single one, can bear the light of <em>post hoc. </em>Fully honored, it puts them all out of business. Along with all the other varieties of magical thinking.&#0160;</p>
<p>All this hardly bears mentioning except that a couple of days ago, a &#39;senior Iranian cleric&quot; Hojatoleslam Kazem Sedighi, pronounced that very soon a massive earthquake will devastate the city of Teheran and that the earthquake will be caused by &quot;women who do not dress modestly. [Such women] lead young men astray, corrupt their chastity and spread adultery in society, which increases earthquakes.&quot; There&#39;s a chain of logic for you. A guy catches a glimpse of a lock of hair, or, god forbid, a bit of bosom, and boom -- earthquake.&#0160; But it&#39;s not his fault -- it&#39;s that his natural chastity has been compromised by them there female blandishments. Delilah all over again. Forget the movement of tectonic plates. The energy released in earthquakes isn&#39;t caused by subduction. It&#39;s ankles.The senior Iranian cleric has not correctly grasped the meaning of the demotic phrase, &quot;the earth moved.&quot;</p>
<p>Sedighi is a boob and is even more presumptuous and illogical than Pat and Jerry. The earthquake hasn&#39;t even occurred and he&#39;s already blaming it on the outfits. He&#39;s launched a pre-emptive strike on <em>post hoc.</em> His is a fallacy so monumentally illogical that hasn&#39;t yet earned a name.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>It&#39;s instructive that Shakespeare, writing before the age of reason and before the scientific revolution, offered a full debate on the subject. In <em>King Lear, </em>Gloucester takes the traditional view. Eclipses, like hurricanes, are filled with meaning. Gloucester does not hold with reason or with the logic that he calls &quot;the wisdom of nature.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no good to us: though the wisdom of nature can reason it thus and thus, yet nature finds itself scourged by the sequent effects: love cools, friendship falls off, brothers divide. In cities, mutinies; in countries, discord; in palaces, treason, and the bond cracked &#39;twixt son and father... We have seen the best of our time:&#0160; machinations, hollowness, treachery and all ruinous disorders, follow us disquietly to our graves.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>Gloucester&#39;s bastard son Edmund dismisses tradition and argues scientifically and rationally.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;This is the excellent foppery of the world, that, when we are sick in fortune -- often the surfeit of our own behavior -- we make guilty of our disasters the sun, the moon, and the stars: as if we were villains by necessity, fools by heavenly compulsion; knaves, thieves, and treachers, by spherical predominance, drunkards, liars, and adulterers, by an enforced obedience of planetary influence, and all that we are evil in, by a divine thrusting on. An admirable evasion of whoremaster man, to lay his goatish disposition to the charge of a star. My father compounded with my mother under the dragon&#39;s tail, and my nativity was under Ursa Major; so that it follows, I am rough and lecherous. Tut, I should have been that I am, had the maidenliest star in the firmament twinkled on my bastardizing.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>Gloucester is, in our terms, superstitious and simple, but he&#39;s also orthodox and reverent. Edmund is realistic and rational, but he is also as loathsome a villain as Shakespeare ever created. Shakespeare is a late medieval writer, which is why he should not necessarily be looked to for moral advice but rather for great poetry, great stories, and aesthetic bliss.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the &quot;excellent foppery of the world&quot; has become the province of fundamentalists of all stripes.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Except for its title, which misses the mark, Edith Wharton&#39;s &quot;Roman Fever&quot; is an exquisite and near-perfect short story. I&#39;m not sure if I would love it quite so much if I hadn&#39;t recently indulged myself with an Edithathon of 25 or 30 long novels, of which &quot;Roman Fever&quot; is a quintessence or distillation. Packed into a few pages is all you would ever need to know about formal, repressed, rule-bound upper-class New York society in which no-holds-barred competitiveness is masked by lifted-pinky manners. The story is so cleverly designed that the last satisfying sentence more than fulfills a reader&#39;s wickedest expectations.&#0160;</p>
<p>Mrs. &#0160;Ansley and Mrs. Slade, both well-tended New York widows who&#39;ve pretended to like each other for a lifetime, chat on a Roman balcony. Each is expert at at one-upmanship. Their apparent friendship masks hatreds and sexual jealousies as obvious (once the curtain is lifted) and as brutal as those of lions living in the less habitable portions of the Kalahari desert.</p>
<p>I know of no work of fiction that is at once so polite and so ferocious. And so chilling.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>So it was 1946 and I was in first grade in P. S. 217 and I must have been throwing my massive seven-year-old weight around because one of the &quot;class mothers&quot; took me aside and accused me of quote picking on unquote her dear son Michael who was at least six inches taller than poor poor pitiful skinny me. I remember that I was astonished and taken aback but that I was still in my own head poised enough to think, what a jerk Michael must be to tell on me to his mother -- although frankly I don&#39;t know now and didn&#39;t know then what I could have done to earn her enmity or deserve the reproach. I was innocent! What I remember most clearly is that I was rendered quite speechless when Michael&#39;s mommy asked an explanation or apology from me and especially that she two or several times demanded of me, scornfully, &quot;what&#39;s the matter, cat&#39;s got your tongue? Cat&#39;s got your tongue?&quot; I had never heard that expression before and didn&#39;t know what it meant, but it sure added a deal of mystery to the confrontation. My tongue was still in my mouth and not in the possession of some feline and I was neither clever enough nor bold enough to stick it out at her.&#0160;</p>
<p>What does it mean, &quot;Cat&#39;s got your tongue.&quot; It&#39;s still a mystery to me even today. Interestingly enough, the expression isn&#39;t of ancient origin and apparently dropped to earth only in the late nineteenth century. It&#39;s a puzzle, though. Why a cat?&#0160; But then, why &quot;cat&#39;s pajamas?&quot; Why &quot;cat o&#39; nine tails?&quot; Why &quot;cat&#39;s meow?&quot;</p>
<p>In any case, I was nonplussed that Michael&#39;s mommy spoke to me so obscurely and I was indignant to be accused of misbehavior. In fact, sixty plus years later I&#39;m still indignant.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Is it possible that the cat-and-tongue episode stimulated my interest in language?&#0160;</p>
<p>I really don&#39;t know why this antique event swam out of the dark backward and abysm of the past. Just yesterday, when I mentioned it to Mrs Dr. Metablog, she recalled that one day, also in 1946, when she was in elementary school and she was not sitting as still as we were then expected to sit, she was accused of having &quot;ants in her pants.&quot;&#0160; She&#39;s indignant.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Plutarch makes much of Antonius&#39; &quot;hardness in adversity notwithstanding his fine bringing up.&quot; Shakespeare knew these words very well; in fact, his copy of Plutarch was open to this exact sentence when he mended his quill and began to compose the famous speech in <em>Anthony and Cleopatra </em>that begins &quot;Anthony, leave thy lascivious wassails.&quot;</p>
<p>Here are Plutarch&#39;s words (exactly as they came to Shakespeare through&#0160;Sir Thomas North&#39;s translation). The passage that particularly stimulated the playwright appears (thanks to the magic of word processing), in a font of vivid blue.&#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;Hirtius and Pansa, then consuls [were sent by Octavius Caesar] to drive Antonius out of Italy. These two consuls... besieged the city of Modena, and there overthrew him in battle, but both the consuls were slain there. Antonius, flying upon this overthrow, fell into great misery all at once, but the chiefest want of all other, and that pinched him most, was famine. Howbeit, he was of such a strong nature that by patience he would overcome any adversity, and the heavier fortune lay upon him, the more constant showed he himself.... And therefore it was a wonderful example to the soldiers, to see <span style="color: #0000ff;">Antonius, that was brought up in all fineness and superfluity, so easily to drink puddle water, and eat wild fruits and roots; and moreover it is reported that even as they passed the Alps, they did eat the bark of trees, and such beasts as man never tasted of their flesh before.&#0160; <br /></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #111111;">Shakespeare kept the sense of the passage but put Plutarch&#39;s words into the mouth of Octavius Caesar, who despises, envies, but also fears Anthony, his&#0160;absent rival.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; <br /></span></p>
<p>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160;&#0160; <span style="color: #111111;">Anthony,</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #111111;">Leave thy lascivious wassails.&#0160; When thou once</span>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Was beaten from Modena, where thou slew&#39;st</p>
<p>Hirtius and Pansa, consuls, at thy heel</p>
<p>Did famine follow, who thou fought&#39;st against,</p>
<p>(Though daintily brought up) with patience more</p>
<p>Than savages could suffer.&#0160; Thou did&#39;st drink</p>
<p>The stale of horses, and the gilded puddle</p>
<p>Which beasts would cough at.&#0160; Thy palate then did deign</p>
<p>The roughest berry on the rudest hedge.</p>
<p>Yea, like the stag, when snow the pasture sheets,</p>
<p>The barks of trees thou browsed.&#0160; On the Alps,</p>
<p>It is reported thou did&#39;st eat strange flesh,</p>
<p>Which some did die to look on.&#0160; And all this</p>
<p>(It wounds thine honor that I speak it now)</p>
<p>Was born so like a soldier, that thy cheek</p>
<p>So much as lanked not.&#0160;</p>
<p>Plutarch is shocked that high-born Antonius could bring himself to eat &quot;wild fruits,&quot; but Shakespeare, ever willing to push an idea to the limit, makes Anthony&#39;s diet even more crude. &quot;Thy palate then did deign [i.e. find worthy]/ The roughest berry on the rudest hedge&quot; -- that is to say, Anthony eats not just &quot;wild fruit,&quot; but the less palatable &quot;roughest berry.&quot; In an even harsher transformation, Plutarch&#39;s &quot;puddle water&quot; becomes &quot;the stale (i.e. urine) of horses, and the gilded puddle/ Which beasts would cough at.&quot;&#0160; It may be stoic to drink &quot;puddle water,&quot; but it is a far greater challenge to a dainty constitution to survive on horse piss. As the passage continues, Anthony&#39;s diet becomes progressively more exotic. Plutarch says that Antonius consumed &quot;beasts as man never tasted of their flesh before,&quot; and seems to imagine Antonius as an adventurer at the utmost boundary of culinary experience. But when Shakespeare suggests that Anthony ate &quot;strange flesh/ Which some did die to look upon,&quot; Anthony becomes not just a soldier/explorer coping with natural adversity but a demi-god or some other kind of supernatural figure able to triumph over enchantment or magic -- one who can incorporate fleshly food that would kill at a glance men with natures less powerful than his own.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Shakespeare characteristically intensifies, exaggerates, or hyperbolizes Plutarch&#39;s already extravagant tale. He raises the rhetorical ante. Whatever Plutarch proffers, Shakespeare doubles and redoubles.&#0160;</p>
<p>The animal theme that runs through this series of transformations begins with the evolution of Plutarch&#39;s phrase &quot;by patience he would overcome any adversity&quot; into Shakespeare&#39;s &quot;patience more than savages could suffer.&quot; More patience than savages?&#0160; What would that be? Shakespeare provides an answer to an implicit, unspoken question, which is, What is a more, or worse, or a lower being than a savage? The answer seems to be &quot;an animal&quot; -- and consequently Shakespeare employs images of bestiality throughout this speech: the horses whose stale must be guzzled, the beasts who cough at the gilded puddle, the stag who browses the bark of trees under sheets of snow, and, climatically, the strange magical flesh that some -- but not Anthony -- die to look upon. In a characteristically Shakespearean paradox, as the passage proceeds Anthony becomes both more animal and more heroic -- at the same time both baser and yet more transcendent.&#0160;</p>
<p>And what is that strange and magic Alpine flesh?&#0160; It&#39;s impossible to say, and Shakespeare offers no clue. Perhaps it&#39;s mere hyperbole -- an author carried away by his own rhetorical power. Does Anthony violate the ultimate food taboo and become a cannibal?&#0160;&#0160;Some readers have thought so, but the evidence is lacking.&#0160;</p>
<p>There is, however, a hint that Octavius himself thinks that the strange flesh episode is nothing more than a tall tale. &quot;On the&#0160; Alps,<em> it is reported.... &quot;&#0160; <br /></em></p>

				<p>It&#39;s a patache, and George Sand (in <em>The Miller of Angibault</em> [1852]) offers a detailed account. The patache, it would appear, was a blast from the past even in the early nineteenth century.&#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;Madame de Blanchemont left in a simple patache, that respectable relic of our forefathers&#39; plain tastes, becoming rarer with each passing day. The one which it was Marcelle&#39;s unhappy fate to encounter was of the purest native construction and an antiquarian would have contemplated it with respect. It was as long and low as a coffin; no springs of any sort diminished its charms. The wheels were as tall as the cowl. The cowl itself was made of a sort of wattle and daub, so that every little bump rained clods of clay down on the travelers&#39; heads. A thin but ardent little stallion drew this rural carriage quite nimbly, and the patachon, the driver, seated himself on the car-shaft with his legs dangling down.&quot;</p>
<p>The patache, which seems to be a&#0160;country cousin of the &quot;springless kibitka&quot; combined with elements of the basket-carriage, may now be added to the long <a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2009/11/-a-further-note-on-nineteenthcentury-horsedrawn-vehicles.html">list</a> of obsolete horsedrawn carriages.&#0160;</p>

				<p>The most famous, I think, must be Itzhak Perlman, who is the earth&#39;s most versatile and distinguished violinist -- and is also father of five next-generation members of the musical tribe. Almost as widely known but perhaps not so spectacularly talented, is Rhea Perlman, better known as Carla Tortelli, mother to many. The most brilliant of the clan, and certainly the most eccentric, is Grigori Yakovlevich (&quot;Grisha&quot;) Perelman, the mathematician who solved Poincare&#39;s conjecture and then refused both the Fields Medal (the Nobel Prize of mathematics) and the $1 million Clay Millennium Prize. Grisha demonstrated what most of us simply take for granted: that any closed three-dimensional manifold where any loop can be contracted to a point is really just a three-dimensional sphere. There&#39;s also Ron Perelman, a consummate and ruthless corporate raider, once the richest man in America, now, alas,&#0160; fallen to 18th -- nor any longer contracted to nonce-wife #4, Ellen Barkin. The most amusing of all Pearlmans is surely Brooklynite S. J. Perelman, screenwriter of two great Marx Brothers vehicles -- <em>Horse Feathers </em>and <em>Monkey Business.&#0160;</em>The most reprehensible of the cousinhood is certainly Lou Pearlman, accomplished Ponzi-artist and the mogul behind the bubble-gummy Backstreet Boys, whom he used and possibly sexually abused to the tune of $300 million -- and who is now serving a 25-year term in federal prison.&#0160;Infinitely more respectable is the composer and conductor Martin Pearlman, who learned his trade at Cornell and who is a harpsichordist as well as&#0160;the founder of the <em>Boston Baroque. </em>Nor should any Pearlman census overlook Ron Perlman, aka Amoukar the Ulam, who many years ago quested for fire. Nor sportwriter Jeff Pearlman, pitcher Jon Perlman, writer Edith Pearlman, film critic Cindy Pearlman; nor the great rhetorician of a prior generation, Chaim Pearlman.</p>
<p>And also: standing at the top of the heap in the world of fiction is&#0160;<em>The Wire&#39;s&#0160;</em>incorruptible Maryland Assistant State Attorney, Rhonda Pearlman.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>In <em>Anthony and Cleopatra, </em>Caesar, who is disciplined and ascetic,&#0160;both envies and scorns Anthony.&#0160;In one of the play&#39;s greatest moments, Caesar apostrophizes his hedonistic, indulgent rival. &quot;Anthony,&quot; he begins,&#0160;&quot;Leave thy lascivious wassails.&quot;&#0160;&quot;Lascivious wassails&quot; is&#0160;a most marvelous phrase -- not only because of its&#0160;serpentine hissing, but because it is so colorful.&#0160;In another context, the&#0160;word &quot;wassails&quot; might signify conviviality, but in this case it is so contaminated by the wickedness of &quot;lascivious&quot; that it can only be taken to signify&#0160;bouts of drunken excess.&#0160;&quot;Lascivious wassails&quot; is glancingly oxymoronic and consequently embodies Caesar&#39;s&#0160;confused and contradictory&#0160;feelings toward&#0160;Anthony.</p>
<p>It&#39;s an especially pertinent phrase because the speech that follows celebrates those qualities of Anthony which Caesar most admires (and which he simultaneously finds most threatening) -- his&#0160;Spartan,&#0160;soldierly ability to put aside luxurious food and drink and&#0160;to subsist on &quot;the bark of trees,&quot; and, if necessary, to drink from &quot;the gilded puddle that beasts would cough at.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;Lascivious wassails&quot; is brilliant in its freestanding self and without doubt entirely appropriate to its context. It&#39;s one of Shakespeare&#39;s all-time-great encapsulations -- a condensed and beautiful phrase.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Except that it&#39;s not Shakespeare&#39;s. Or, more precisely, it is probably not Shakespeare.</p>
<p>The Folio text of <em>Anthony and Cleopatra</em> seems to have been set from a transcript of Shakespeare&#39;s manuscript. It&#39;s the only early printing (there are no Quartos). In the Folio, the line appears this way: &quot;<em>Anthony,/ </em>Leaue thy lasciuious Vassailes.&quot; &quot;Vassailes&quot; was, for the first hundred years of its existence, understood to mean &quot;vassals.&quot; Caesar, it appears, wants Anthony to take leave of not his cups but his followers. In the fourth Folio of 1683, the irregular spelling &quot;vassailes&quot; was regularized to &quot;vassals.&quot; &quot;Wassails&quot; did not arrive on the scene until 1724 and was the ingenious, inspired invention of Alexander Pope. Every single editor since Pope, no doubt taken with the beauty of the phrase, has printed &quot;wassails.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>It&#39;s not as though &quot;vassals&quot; doesn&#39;t make sense. It&#39;s perfectly fine. It&#39;s just the &quot;wassails&quot; is better. In this instance, let&#39;s face it, Pope outdid Shakespeare. If not for Pope, it is highly likely that it would have been &quot;lascivious vassals&quot; until the end of time. Who beside a great poet would have thought of &quot;wassails?&quot; Certainly not I.</p>
<p>Editors aim for authenticity -- to print what they believe Shakespeare wrote. Shakespeare probably wrote &quot;vassals&quot; -- but &quot;wassails&quot; is so clever that editors cannot help but succumb. They follow the illogic that if it&#39;s brilliant, it must be Shakespeare. And so authenticity gladly yields to beauty.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I have just read, for the first time ever, <em>Agnes Grey </em>(1847) by Anne Bronte, and what an infinitely sad book it is! Poor Agnes, an impoverished clergyman&#39;s daughter, goes as a governess and is daily humiliated by monstrously spoiled children and their grotesquely insensitive parents. Her sufferings are poignantly particularized. The novel is structured as if it were a comedy (after extended tribulations, Agnes marries a decent young curate) but it is nevertheless barren, desiccated, and joyless. Even the long-awaited marriage proposal receives the shortest of shrifts:</p>
<p>&quot;And so now I have overruled your objections. Have you any&#0160;others.&#0160;&quot;No -- none.&quot;&#0160; &quot;You love me then,&quot; he said, fervently pressing my hand.&#0160;&#0160;&quot;Yes.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>And that&#39;s all the romance that this poor downtrodden, passive, beaten-into-the-dust emotionally-stunted &quot;heroine&quot; is granted.&#0160;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, my own personal sadness while reading this novel&#0160;arose not from Agnes Grey&#39;s suffering, but from Anne Bronte&#39;s -- there being not a skin-of-the-teeth space between the bedraggled writer and the bedraggled protagonist.&#0160;Agnes&#39;s experiences as a governess exactly mirror&#0160;Anne&#39;s -- except there was no saving curate to snatch the&#0160;wedding chestnuts out of the fire.&#0160;Poor Anne returned home&#0160;defeated, virginal,&#0160;and alone, to die at age 28, of tuberculosis.&#0160;Nor is it simply the doormat heroine or the downtrodden&#0160;novelist that is so distressing -- it&#39;s the general oppression of women in the first part of the nineteenth century that must draw a tear from the stolidest of eyes.&#0160;Here&#39;s a society that offered no decent options for women, and even Anne Bronte, as talented as she was, hadn&#39;t the least&#0160;ability to think her way&#0160;through attitudes toward women&#0160;that proved to be paralyzing and ultimately fatal.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>I turned to&#0160;<em>Agnes Grey </em>because&#0160;I had recently read Anne&#39;s older sister Charlotte&#39;s <em>Villette, </em>a novel that perplexed me more than any book I&#39;ve read in years.&#0160;I couldn&#39;t make sense of it.&#0160;I&#39;ve read my share of nineteenth-century novels, and I would like to think that I have a general sense of how they&#39;re made, and, after I get a few chapters in, how they must conclude.&#0160;In&#0160;<em>Villete, </em>all the early markers point to the eventuality that young Lucy Snowe, after the customary and appropriate difficulties and misunderstandings will have been resolved, will marry the handsome young Dr. John. But somewhere in Book II, the game changed and the poor reader (me) became confused. Dr. John is allowed to make some bad choices -- sufficiently wrong that he becomes superfluous and gradually fades into the background. He metamorphoses from a major character in the first half of the book to a minor character in Book III. His place as Lucy Snowe&#39;s suitor is taken by a teacher, M. Paul Emanuel, who is nasty and unattractive when introduced but who becomes more and more acceptable as the novel proceeds. I couldn&#39;t comprehend the seismic shift until I read the truly excellent biography of CB by Lyndall Gordon <em>(Charlotte Bronte,&#0160;A Passionate Life </em>(1994).&#0160;It turns out the plot of the&#0160;novel parallels CB&#39;s&#0160;experience in Brussels.&#0160;Initially attracted to&#0160;a young man who lost interest in her, she fell&#0160;deeply in love with a teacher at her school. Alas, M. Heger was not available, either matrimonially or emotionally.</p>
<p>But at least Charlotte, unlike Anne, was willing to take a risk -- which is why, in Charlotte&#39;s greatest novel, witty, forthright, independent Jane Eyre, for all her weirdness, remains such a striking and refreshing alternative to the ordinary oppressed nineteenth-century heroine.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><em>Pretty Poison </em>was released in 1960 to excellent notices. I remember adding it to the must-see list. But I didn&#39;t get around to it at the time, probably because the film wasn&#39;t widely distributed. But <em>Pretty Poison&#0160;</em>stuck in my mind -- or rather it was the combination of&#0160;Anthony Perkins and Tuesday Weld that excited my interest.&#0160;During the VHS years I made another attempt to see the movie, but it was&#0160;apparently stuck in some sort of royalty-and-ownership dispute and&#0160;never made it onto tape.&#0160;And then another twenty years elapsed and I tried again, this time typing the name into my Netflix queue, and, <em>mirabile dictu, </em>there it was.&#0160; So at last, after fifty years,&#0160;a cd&#0160;of <em>Pretty Poison </em>appeared in the mailbox.&#0160;</p>
<p>It&#39;s a fine film, well worth the wait.&#0160;I don&#39;t know what I would&#0160;have thought&#0160;about it in 1960,&#0160;but in 2010 it seems&#0160;like&#0160;a late variant of 1950s&#0160;<em>film noir</em> and an important but unacknowledged way station on the road from <em>Double Indemnity </em>to<em>&#0160;Body Heat.</em>&#0160;It offers a&#0160;dangerous <em>jeune fille fatale</em> in the high school cheerleader Mary Ann Stepanek, some great plot twists, and a creepy young man who&#39;s not as clever as he thinks (very similar to his lineal descendant, the fatuous lawyer Ned Racine). The photography, all sunlit and cheerful, disguises the noirish themes and keeps the audience off balance. The screenwriter, Lorenzo Semple Jr., was, if I remember correctly, just emerging from the McCarthy blacklist, which may be why the film stresses cold-war themes -- spies and sabotage and the like. Can it be accidental that, in the last year of the Eisenhower administration, a well-meaning but ineffective government employee as given the name Azenauer?&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>At the very time Tuesday Weld, scion of an ancient Massachusetts family performed in this film, I was taking courses in Cambridge, in Weld Hall. How could anyone not be struck by her great name? Tuesday Weld is linked, in my mind, not only to the Saltonstalls, Peabodys, and Lodges but also to Billy Sunday, Rick Monday, Joe Friday, January Jones, Fredric March, May West, June Jones, August Busch, Susan Sontag, Domenico Scarlatti and Jeudi Garland.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Last night, the grandkids had a little fun with the old guy. Miss T. (b. 1999), concluded that Grandpa&#39;s electronic and computer skills were (her exact words) &quot;stone age.&quot;</p>
<p>Is she correct? Let us review the circumstances. I was here, in B--ld-r, trying to watch the Cornell-Kentucky sweet-sixteen on streaming video (CBS again gave the Big Red the back of its network-y hand) while simultaneously following the Kansas State-Xavier double-overtime epic on Tivo (slightly behind real time so as to sidestep the mini-dramas on the subjects of beer and deodorant). Miss T and Mr. O were snuggled in bed with their mom out there near the Pacific shore and we and they were sending messages back and forth on Facebook chat. Hey, not exactly a &quot;stone age&quot; situation.</p>
<p>The kiddies were testing my knowledge of IM acronyms, and I was failing badly. I didn&#39;t know ROTFL or JK or TMI or LMAO. Then Mr. O became dissatisfied at the pace of the conversation, so he started sending me messages (&quot;texting&quot; me is the jargon) on the cellphone, thereby giving me another device to manage. Which is when I ran out of hands, and in frustration, told what HF (according to SLC), also known as MT) calls a &quot;stretcher.&quot; I said (or wrote, rather) to Miss T. and Mr. O., something to the effect of &quot;what do you mean I don&#39;t know about electronic media. I used to IM all the time with my grandparents.&quot;</p>
<p>Frankly, they didn&#39;t buy it. I can&#39;t blame them; they know that my grandparents didn&#39;t have much English.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Ivy League fell further and further behind, mostly because Kentucky was quick enough to step&#0160;around the screens and stop Cornell&#39;s three-point game. In the other bracket, Kansas State lasted it out.&#0160;</p>
<p>I know that it&#39;s negligent not to enlighten&#0160;myself about&#0160;useful chat acronyms. Nevertheless, I suspect that the o-so-up-to-date grandkids at the other end of the IM line are also missing something. They probably think that a &quot;whopper&quot; is a hamburger. They probably don&#39;t know what a &quot;shellacking&quot; is. Or shellac, for that matter. Probably think that it&#39;s something that originated in the Stone Age.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>There&#39;s been some criticism -- justified, I must admit -- about the dexterity of my shaving.&#0160;It appears that my face has become more, what shall I say? <em>intricate</em> over the last years, and has developed some interesting crannies that resist the approach of the razor.&#0160;In order to improve my shaving technique, I bought one of those circular magnifying mirrors that allows you to view your face in such great detail that you can hunt down and harvest that last otherwise inaccessible follicle.&#0160;The mirror&#0160;seemed like a good idea, but, dear friends of a certain age, I do not recommend this purchase. Big mistake.&#0160;</p>
<p>It had been many years since I studied my face so intently.&#0160;Things have happened.&#0160;While I can still locate the remnants of the scar on my forehead, where, when I was a boy, I was pushed into a subway pillar, the mark used to reside just at the hairline.&#0160;Now, the hairline has migrated a good three inches to the north of the scar and -- thanks to the new mirror -- I can clearly detect that the first remaining&#0160;inch or so of brown-gray hair, which I&#0160;had thought&#0160;to be of a healthy bushiness, consists of no more than a few well-spaced strands.&#0160;And what&#39;s this cross-hatching on my forehead?&#0160;Not just the prominent horizontal furrows but new vertical ones as well -- when did they appear? And the deep gorges around my eyebrows!&#0160;And the eyebrows themselves -- when did they become parti-colored?&#0160;Randomly black and white?&#0160;And how many years ago did these long recurved eyebrow hairs begin to sprout?&#0160;Fie upon it --&#39;tis an unweeded garden that&#39;s gone to seed. Why are the eyebrows themselves so utterly asymmetrical?&#0160;and what should I make of the thicket of whiteheads -- or whatever the heck they are -- at all four corners of my bloodshot eyes?&#0160; Was it always the case that my eyes were set so deeply into those wrinkled dells?&#0160;And my nose-- thanks to the new mirror, I can plainly see the scars where the pre-cancerous lesions were frozen off.&#0160;What in the world has happened to the tip of my nose?&#0160; Was it always so preternaturally pointy?&#0160;I could use it as a letter-opener.&#0160;When I lift my head just slightly, I see that my nostrils, which I always took to be a matched pair, have set out on separate paths. The right one now sits&#0160;at a 45 degree angle to the left.&#0160;It&#39;s wandered off-center, like the eye of a flounder.&#0160;And those nasty black hairs jutting from my nostrils -- I must attend to them. And look, there are long hairs coming out of my ears as well.&#0160;And hanging, floppy earlobes marked with deep lines.&#0160;What&#0160;are these fleshy nobs at the sides of my mouth?&#0160;Were my lips always covered with white flakes?&#0160; How is it that the&#0160;left side of my underlip is so much thicker than the right?&#0160;And my pearly whites?&#0160;Cracked and chipped and not much of a row: sixty or so years of gnawing has given each tooth its own unique size, shape, color, and identity.&#0160;And what&#39;s this under my chin?&#0160;A single off-center hanging wattle?&#0160;No symmetry even in Wattlelandia?&#0160;Friends, this magnifying mirror is a disaster.&#0160;I should have stopped shaving entirely and grown a camouflaging beard.</p>
<p>But hold on, there&#39;s some good news.&#0160;It may not be a youthful or symmetrical face,&#0160;but It&#39;s not&#0160;unfriendly.&#0160;There&#39;s no sneer, or lip curl, or disdain, or anger. Puzzlement, certainly.&#0160;Wryness, perhaps. Curiosity, for sure.</p>
<p>Folks, at least we&#39;re not in a wicked-Dorian-Gray-kind-of-situation.</p>
<p>Wear and tear, yes; villainy, no.&#0160;Things could be worse.</p>

				<p>Last night, one of our dinner guests said that at least we no longer have to worry about &quot;pre-existing conditions.&quot; Persnickety about language as always, I pointed out that the phrase &quot;pre-existing condition&quot; was a ridiculous piece of jargon. What is meant is &quot;existing conditions?&quot; A condition can&#39;t exist before it exists.&#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;Aha,&quot; said another of my guests, a Lutheran minister,&quot;now you&#39;ve opened a theological questions.&quot; He was referring to the disputed doctrine that the existence of Jesus preceded his incarnation in the womb.&#0160;</p>
<p>But if &quot;pre-existence&quot; is only taken seriously by theologians and by insurance executives, then I&#39;m going to stand on my claim that the phrase is both obscurantist or bureaucratic and should be discarded from common use. &quot;Existing&quot; is sufficient.</p>
<p>Moreover,&#0160;the&#0160;notion&#0160;that insurance should be granted to the healthy but denied to the ill is a more dangerous travesty than the&#0160;mystification of&#0160;&quot;pre-existence.&quot;</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>When I was a mere tad, perhaps seven or eight years old but already an enthusiastic reader, I was given a subscription (by whom?) to a children&#39;s magazine, perhaps <em>Jack and Jill. </em>It arrived once a month and took perhaps ten minutes to read. It was certainly my older brother (who later owned a large house that had twice as many mirrors as books, who said, &quot;you still readin&#39; that thing for babies?&quot; Always susceptible to public criticism, I soon turned against the publication. Since then, I&#39;ve subscribed and unsubscribed to dozens of periodicals, many more than I can remember.&#0160; Here are a few: in my pathetic teens, <em>Mad Magazine, </em>of which I was a serious enthusiast (and had been so since <em>Mad</em>&#39;<em>s </em>Harvey Kurtzman comic book days). Closest I ever came to anarchy. Also, <em>Sport Magazine -- </em>a precursor of <em>SI.&#0160; </em>Pre-steriods, pre-scandal, the athletes profiled were virtuous, sober, and generous family men who had overcome venomous small town upbringings and acute physical handicaps to rise to the top of the mound or sit astride the Derby winner. Also, when I went though my adolescent fantasy phase, various pulp sci fi mags -- <em>Astounding Science Fiction </em>and <em>Galaxy Science Fiction </em>and probably others that came and went. I was much enamored of the stuff, which was monumentally escapist and therefore analogous to my sports obsessions. In the &#39;60s, I matured to political magazines: <em>The Reporter, The Nation, </em>and before it went totally and bizarrely wrong, <em>The New Republic. </em>A decade later, when I had set out to study literature through a social lens, I subscribed to <em>Local Population Studies, The Journal of Interdisciplinary History, The Psychohistorical Review, and The History of Childhood Quarterly. </em>When I became serious about Shakespeare I was an assiduous reader and collector of the <em>Shakespeare Quarterly </em>and <em>Shakespeare Survey </em>and the <em>Shakespeare Newsletter </em>and <em>Shakespeare Research and Opportunities </em>and the <em>Shakespeare on Film Newsletter. </em>Closely related: <em>English Literary Renaissance,&#0160;</em> to which I sent a number of my own contributions, and the <em>George Herbert Journal </em>(of which I at one time owned every issue). In the &#39;70s or &#39;80s, <em>Organic Gardening (</em>sample title -- &quot;How We Grew Papayas on our Vermont Hillside Using Organic Methods and Faith in God&quot;); later<em>, Fine Gardening</em> (sample title: &quot;How We Converted a Defunct Brick Brewery into an Extremely Expensive Bed-and-Breakfast Complete with a Replica of an 18th-century Capability Brown Landscape&quot;).&#0160; At then at various times: <em>Scientific American, Science News, Bluebirds Across Vermont, </em>the newsletter of the Southern Vermont Dairy Goat Association, <em>One Two Three Four </em>(a magazine briefly in existence that concerned itself with the early history of rock and roll), the <em>Atlantic, The Skeptical Inquirer. </em>Newspapers:&#0160; <em>The New York Times, Valley News, United Opinion (</em>since renamed&#0160; the <em>Journal-Opinion), Behind the Times, </em>the <em>B--ld-r Daily Camera. </em>Nowadays: <em>Harvard Magazine, New Yorker, New York Review of Books, Northern Forests</em>. A long list, but note: no movie star mags, no style, no self-improvement, no golf, no detectives, no alternative healing, no finance, no how-to-pyramid-your-money, no automotive, no weapons. It appears that I&#39;m a person of narrow but eclectic interests, magazine-wise. &#0160;</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Every once in a while, a mountain lion creeps into the fold and snares a lamb, a foal, or a German shepherd. At even more infrequent intervals, a mountain lion attacks a human being (usually a child). Whenever there&#39;s a human-lion interaction, there comes a deluge of letters to the local newspaper demanding that the authorities exercise “lethal control&quot; over the big cats. Killing catamounts is neither hard nor dangerous. They were hunted nearly to extinction in the nineteenth century. Dogs chase the animal up a tree. The brave hunter takes aim and shoots.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">But Is it a good idea to extinguish the mountain lion? In the United States, there’s an average of one death by mountain lion a year. Here in B--ld-r county, there’s been one such death in the last hundred years. One is a very low number, especially when, in the country as a whole, snakes cause a dozen deaths a year, lightning claims seventy-five, bee and wasp stings a hundred. Dogs, when they’re not out hunting mountain lions, account for between twelve to twenty deaths a year –- a couple of hundred a decade-- many of these, it&#39;s sad to say, infants in the crib. Given the numbers, It’s hard to believe that calls for the extermination of mountain lions aren’t motivated more by fear than by facts.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Domesticated dogs are responsible not only for a dozen to a score of deaths, but also for an estimated 4 to 7 million (that’s right, million!) cases of dog-bite a year, almost 800,000 of which require medical attention. Dog bites cause 368,000 emergency room visits, or (do the math!) one thousand such visits a day.&#0160; The social cost of dog bites is estimated variously, but the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta claims that the direct medical costs of dog bites per year is $165 million, with many more millions in ancillary expenses.&#0160;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Mountain lions, which are relatively harmless, inspire terror, but dogs, which are far more dangerous, are our sacred cows -- loved, in my opinion, beyond all propriety. It’s hard not to cringe when otherwise sensible people –- good decent people --tell me in all seriousness that Towser is a full member of their family, or that Fido is about to undergo an expensive hip replacement. The run-of the-mill doggie in America enjoys a better diet and better medical care than 90% of the human beings on the planet -- a situation which I consider to be a thoroughly indefensible skewing of resources. Dogs are not human beings, and it’s immoral sentimentality to treat them as such. It’s embarrassing.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The ancients, following Aristotle, divided their possessions into three categories: an object was an <em>instrumentum mutum</em>, an animal was an <em>instrumentum semivocale</em>, and a slave was an <em>instrumentum vocale</em>. By eliding the differences between humans and animals, the Greeks and the Romans made slavery both easy and natural.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I used to worry that people who treated animals as humans would be tempted to treat humans as animals. But it&#39;s not true; the people I know who are sentimental about animals and &quot;animal rights&quot; are extraordinarily sensitive to human rights -- but then, perhaps my sample is skewed. All of my friends are sensitive to human rights; if they weren’t, they wouldn’t be my friends.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I wonder whether the love of dangerous dogs and the fear of the cats who are by and large indifferent to us isn’t an instinct acquired over millions of years. Our ancestors, armed at best with flint-headed spears, spent countless millennia at the mercy of feline predators larger, more powerful and more terrifying than 100-pound mountain lions (the extinct European lion, <em>panthera leo fossilis, </em>was taller, stronger, and and a foot and a half longer that the modern African lion).&#0160; Some 50,000 years ago, an ancient Einstein conceived the idea of domesticating wolves and selecting their population for useful traits. Humans and proto-dogs started&#0160;to cohabit; dwellings and caves came to be littered with coprolites. Co-evolution began, and over the course of time, dogs and humans came to be sensitive to each other&#39;s traits. Those early dogs were our first allies on this lonely, hostile planet. They could raise a ruckus when a couple or three lionesses prowled about the cave door.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We&#39;re indebted to dogs and so we tolerate their bad habits.&#0160; By the same token, the over-hasty cry to kill the mountain lions is also an inheritance from our fearful ancestors.&#0160;</p>

				<p>Every week or so there&#39;s yet another breakthrough &#39;scientific&#39; survey to tell you which city is the healthiest, or the least obese, or the richest, or the most educated, or whatever.&#0160;&#0160;There&#39;s a new one out -- a poll by Gallup-Healthways that has determined that the &quot;happiest&quot; place in the entire U. S. of A. is my very own city&#0160; B---ld--r, C-l-r-do. I don&#39;t have the slightest idea how the pollsters chose to define happiness, but I do know that the conclusion drawn by the <em>B--ld-r Camera </em>(a dreadful gray newspaper that could not possibly add the least dollop of joy to the life of any subscriber of intelligence, imagination, or self-respect) makes no sense at all.&#0160; The&#0160;<em>Camera&#0160;</em>suggests that people who want to be happy should move right here to B--ld-er. Can&#39;t be right: if everyone came, the cheerful and morose alike, we&#39;d immediately and automatically fall right back to average. Actually, we&#39;d fall even below average, because of the misery caused by the spike in traffic.&#0160;</p>
<p>Perhaps we&#39;re all dancing on our toes because we&#39;ve legalized marijuana.</p>
<p>I suppose that the news that I&#39;m happy should make me feel better, but instead it just makes me anxious. Even though I&#39;m of a moderately equable temperament, I do have my gloomy spells.&#0160; When I&#39;m in a funk, or a brown study, or I&#39;m feeling the blues&#0160; -- tell me, am I failing in my civic duty?&#0160; If I&#39;m not pulling my own happy wagon, am I discomfiting some other poor soul.&#0160; Putting a burden on him to be inordinately cheerful in order to maintain our reputation.&#0160;</p>
<p>Gosh, living in a happy city is so guilt-provoking.&#0160;</p>
<p>On the whole, I was a lot more cheerful&#0160;before I learned&#0160;about the poll.</p>

				<p>A sorority girl fell off the roof of her house last week.&#0160; She was, of course, staggeringly drunk. She messed herself up pretty badly but she will live. Accidents of this kind happen regularly in our college town. Kids fall off roofs, kids drive drunk and kill someone or themselves, or kids just binge-drink themselves to death. It&#39;s regrettable that we&#39;ve become accustomed to such stories. I think it&#39;s the saddest thing: a family raises a child for twenty years, sends him or her off to college with great hopes -- and two weeks later the kid has crashed the car, fatally, or choked to death on her own vomit.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>As a result of this latest incident, the neighbors have been engaged in an internet war. One noisy faction insists that it&#39;s our policies that are at fault -- that kids drink themselves to oblivion because alcohol is legally prohibited until age twenty-one. If alcohol were legal, the argument goes, students would then do their drinking in a controlled environment, such as an adult-supervised party or a bar with rules on over-serving, and they wouldn&#39;t indulge in private. It&#39;s a paradoxical argument -- alcohol would be safer if it were not prohibited.</p>
<p>After a great deal of back-and-forth and uninformed argumentation, one of the neighbors, an epidemiologist who has actually studied the problem, presented some data. That when New Zealand lowered the drinking age from 21 to 18, binge drinking and accidental deaths increased. That binge drinking is higher in European countries, some of which allow alcohol at age 16, than in the U.S. That underage drinking declines, sometimes by as much as 40%, when rules are enforced. That when alcohol is less available, alcohol consumption decreases, and conversely, when it is made more available, consumption increases. That the unformed brains of teen-agers are particularly subject to being addled by alcohol.&#0160;</p>
<p>The advocates of lowering the drinking age were unmoved by the evidence. One resident, whom I will call BB, wrote in to say this: &quot;Surely, had this 20 year old woman been of legal drinking age, she would have been in the regulated environment of a drinking establishment and not at an underground party. The likelihood of her being overserved in that regulated environment and then ending up drunk on the roof of her sorority would be considerably diminished. Unlike Dr. F&#39;s and others&#39; studies, this is a real life study that happened right down the street. Let&#39;s open our eyes and start to learn from these events.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;BB&#39;s takes the position that we can ignore the data, forget the scientific studies, and replace them with his interpretation of this particular event. BB&#39;s is a good example of what is called &quot;anecdotal thinking.&quot; But anecdotes, standing alone, are not evidence nor can they replace the systematic gathering of evidence and statistics. Meanwhile, another neighbor of long standing, KW, answers the evidence with his own simple argument: we all drank when we were young, there were laws in place then but we ignored them, nothing will ever change, why make it hard for kids, let them drink at 18. KW is not much more logical than BB. He argues ahistorically, quite oblivious to the fact that alcohol is used differently in different cultures and in one culture a different times in history.&#0160;</p>
<p>BB says, it&#39;s cold today, there can be no such thing as global warming;&#0160; KW says, there&#39;s always been weather, and it&#39;s always been warm</p>
<p>When I was a teacher, I tried over and over again to explain to my freshmen that a) you can&#39;t build an argument on an anecdote, and b) that the experience of an individual is not necessarily universal -- that to gather data, to consider the context, and to apply logic were the hallmarks of the educated individual. Neither BB and KW, both of whom, I believe, graduated from college, ever took the first step in their freshman &quot;critical thinking&quot; class. They have their views, and they&#39;re not going to let facts get in their way.&#0160;</p>
<p>Is it relevant that both BB and KW are Republicans?&#0160; I believe it is.</p>
<p>But what should we do about alcohol abuse?&#0160; It&#39;s an intractable problem we&#39;re not going to solve it immediately, but we have an instructive analogy in the case of tobacco, where in the U. S, the consumption of tobacco has declined significantly. We decreased tobacco use by a) prohibiting advertisements that made smoking glamorous and alluring, b) increasing taxes, c) disseminating information on lung cancer and low birth weights, etc, and d) by making tobacco less available. We could try the same with alcohol, where billions are spent by distilleries and breweries to make make alcohol use seem sophisticated and ennobling. Instead, we could discuss incarceration rates, fetal alcohol syndrome, homelessness, domestic violence, puking in the streets and choking in the bed. We could limit the number of bars and alcohol outlets. We could make drinking more expensive by raising the taxes to cover the civic cost in police, judiciary, accidents, and prisons. We could tax wine less and hard liquor more. We could rigorously enforce existing drinking-age laws. We could also encourage the use of less dangerous drugs.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>In addition, we could try to improve our educational system, so that when the neighbors came to talk about alcohol abuse, they could conduct their discussion with respect for fact and logic.&#0160;</p>

				<p>The grand-daughter, age 10, visited here last December.&#0160; She showed me her new cellphone. She was &quot;texting&quot; with a friend.&#0160; I asked her how she does it, and she gave me a lesson, even though she was startled and horrified, I imagine, to realize that, although an adult, I didn&#39;t know that it&#39;s one click for a d, two for an e, and three for an f. Her thumbs flew, mine limped, but I got the idea -- and then forgot about it until, a couple of days ago, when&#0160; was waiting in the doctor&#39;s office without a book and wasn&#39;t in the mood for Golf Magazine. I started to play with my two-month-old entry-level cellphone and discovered that if you press Menu, and then Messaging and then Send Message and then Enter Number that you can &quot;text&quot; -- of which I had no idea, my cellphone skills being usually limited to &quot;what is that noise coming from my pocket I&#39;d better check.&quot;&#0160; So I laboriously scribed (or thumbed) my first message to the grand-daughter: &quot;Thank you for teaching me to send text messages.&quot;&#0160; And then, miracle of miracles, a few hours afterward (after fifth grade had been dismissed for the day, I suspect), I received an answer, which I now reproduce verbatim: &quot;when ur txting u dont have 2 use full sentences.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>Live and learn.&#0160;</p>

				<p>The hype and hoopla at sports arenas&#0160;are truly deplorable, especially to aged eyes and ears. At a Washington Wizards game in DC a couple of weeks ago, members of the starting team&#0160;were introduced not only with spotlights, screeching,&#0160;and &quot;music&quot; but&#0160;also with bursts&#0160;from a high-powered flame thrower. Even fifty yards away, I could feel the toasty heat.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Wild over-the-top absurdity and irrelevance, in my opinion. I go to a basketball game to see a&#0160;basketball game, not to be danced at, kiss-cammed at, or showered with gift certificates,&#0160;free pizza,&#0160;and t-shirts.</p>
<p>I&#39;m back home in Boulder again, and last night I heard performances of Prokofiev, Beethoven, and Brahms by the ever-so-formal Escher Quartet. Lord-a-mercy, did they ever make me long for a little sporty glitz. The Eschers (three men and a woman, all of whom appeared to be in their 20s) conducted themselves as if they just woken up from a long day of sleeping in their coffins. They were utterly joyless. They resolutely avoided looking at each other or at the audience or betraying the least emotion. The expressions on their faces did not say, &quot;magnificent music&quot;; they said, &quot;is that curdled milk, or what?&quot; They plucked and sawed at their instruments with as much enthusiasm as if they were cleaning out the septic system. Their playing was exact but uninspiring--but what can you expect from three mortgage brokers and a dental hygienist?&#0160; The Eschers acknowledged the generous applause of the audience as if they were feudal overlords hearing the petitions of dung beetles.&#0160;</p>
<p>Whenever I go to chamber music concerts, I feel young. Actually, I am young, because in the chamber-music crowd, anyone without a walker or&#0160;an oxygen bottle is a kid.</p>
<p>The Escher should&#0160;loosen up&#0160;a bit -- and perhaps attract a younger and livelier audience.&#0160;</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the fantasy. Cue spotlight. Cue big-voiced announcer. &quot;And now, on cello, from Thousand Oaks, California, in his fifth year, out of the Manhattan School of Music, Andy Janss.&quot; Janss runs on to the stage, carrying his cello overhead, his rhinestones glittering in the lights. He high-fives the other members of the group, shakes the confetti off his shoulder-length hair, tosses some talcum powder into the air....etc. etc.&#0160; Crowd roars. He plays with enthusiasm. So do his comrades.</p>
<p>But&#0160;let us not sacrifice the dignity of&#0160;classical-music. No flame throwers.&#0160;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>In <em>The Second Part of King Henry the Fourth, </em>the Hostess (also known as Nell or Mistress Quickly) regularly makes fritters of the English language. At one point in the play, she is beside herself -- apoplectic, in fact -- because she believes that she has been abused by Falstaff. Reaching for words to equal her anger, she tries for &quot;homicidal&quot; three consecutive times. First she calls Falstaff a &quot;honeysuckle villain,&quot; then a &quot;honeyseed rogue&quot; and finally she settles on &quot;hempseed.&quot; Although &quot;honeysuckle&quot; and &quot;honeyseed&quot; are amusing guesses, we feel --or perhaps I should speak only for myself-- I feel just a bit guilty that I&#39;ve let Shakespeare amuse me at the expense of an illiterate woman&#39;s linguistic lapses.</p>
<p>I have the same reservations about Charles Dickens&#39;s jokes on the unlettered; the word &quot;apoplexy,&quot; for example, appears as &quot;happyplexy.&quot;&#0160; It makes a second appearance in <em>Great Expectations, </em>when Jo Gargery, of whom much is made that he has never learned to read or write, explains that his father died of a &quot;purple leptic fit.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>I think that pillorying linguistic errors is more fun when the perpetrators are not illiterate but pretentious. Such is the case in Sheridan&#39;s <em>The Rivals </em>(1775), where Mrs. Malaprop, striving for &quot;pinnacle,&quot; refers to a character as &quot;the very pineapple of perfection.&quot; The most famous sentence in <em>The Rivals: &quot;</em>Sure, if I reprehend any thing in this world it is the use of my oracular tongue, and a nice derangement of epitaphs&quot; (apprehend, vernacular, arrangement, epithets).&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>In the last couple of years, there&#39;s been an attempt to distinguish a subset of such malapropisms as &quot;eggcorns.&quot; The neologism derives from the unlearned collapse of &quot;acorn&quot; into &quot;eggcorn&quot; (a substitution which is more intelligible when the word egg is pronounced as in rural &quot;aig&quot;). An eggcorn is supposed to be a special variety of malapropism in that &quot;the new phrase makes sense on some level (&#39;old-timer&#39;s disease&#39; for &#39;Alzheimer&#39;s disease&#39;). But what sort of sense?&#0160; Why is &quot;baited breath&quot; for &quot;bated breath&quot; anything more than a simple spelling error?&#0160; For that matter, &quot;honeysuckle villain&quot; and &quot;honeyseed rogue&quot; also make a kind of sense -- a Shakespearean and psychological sense. The Hostess unconsciously reveals that she&#39;s sweet on Falstaff.</p>
<p>In any case, there&#39;s now an eggcorn <a href="http://eggcorns.lascribe.net/">database</a> on the internet.&#0160; A goodly number of the eggcorns are errors that have appeared time without number on student essays. I can&#39;t guess how often I used to encounter &quot;peak (or peek) one&#39;s curiosity,&quot; &quot;leech&quot; for &quot;leach,&quot; &quot;peon&quot; for &quot;paean,&quot; or &quot;pier&quot; for &quot;peer&quot;;&#0160; or how many times students would &quot;pour&quot; over their work. I remember being stunned the first time that I encountered &quot;morays&quot; for &quot;mores,&quot; but I eventually acclimated to that formidable shock. What can it possibly mean to &quot;reek&quot; havoc?&#0160; Others common student errors: &quot;spade&quot; for &quot;spayed&quot; (sometimes pluperfectized to &quot;spaded&quot;; &quot;verses&quot; for &quot;versus&quot;; &quot;phase&quot; for &quot;faze&quot;; along with the exceedingly respectful &quot;sirname.&quot; I believe that the amount of space I enclosed by circling these common errors as they appeared on coffee-stained student submissions would roughly equal the surface area of Weld County.</p>
<p>The eggcorn database contains some &quot;learned&quot; malapropisms that are new to me. &quot;Hare&#39;s breath&quot; and its funhouse mirror twin &quot;hair-brained&quot;; &quot;beyond approach&quot;; &quot;Cadillac converter&quot;; &quot;garbage shoot&quot;; &quot;wet one&#39;s appetite.&quot; I can&#39;t picture &quot;well-quaffed hair,&quot; but I can certainly visualize a &quot;wind-powered turban.&quot; &quot;It finally donged on me&quot; makes some sense, but &quot;crutch of the matter&quot; is utterly nonsensical. How laid back is a &quot;mellow drama?&quot; To &quot;give up the goat&quot; may have meaning in pastoral societies. My absolute favorite: &quot;pus jewel,&quot; as in, &quot;his adolescent face was covered with pus jewels.&quot; The avian reference in &quot;one fowl swoop&quot; (for one fell -- i.e. fatal-- swoop) was well anticipated by Macduff:&#0160; &quot;What, all my pretty chickens and their dam/ In one fell swoop....&#0160; O hell-kite.&quot;</p>
<p>And speaking of chickens (and eggs), there&#39;s also chocolate &quot;eggclair&quot; and &quot;eggtopic&quot; pregnancy, both of which are weirdly inventive, but&#0160;neither worth (drumroll, maestro!), a pullet surprise.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Although youngsters sometimes try to piss off their parents by inserting into their nose a modest jewel or a gold circlet, we (as a nation or as a civilization) aren&#39;t terribly enthusiastic about decorating the old schnozzola. While the English language has words for many kinds of jewelry (ring, earring, brooch, bracelet, necklace, tiara, pectoral), it is vacant of vocabulary for objects that are affixed to or hang from the nose. Consequently, this magnificent piece of gold jewelry, crafted in Peru two thousand years ago, which certainly bore a name in proto-Quecha or whatever was spoken at the time, is now simply called a &quot;nose ornament.&quot;</p>
<p><img border="0" class="mainObjImage showEnlargeArea " jquery1265854892578="43" rel="1979.206.1172" src="http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/images/h2/h2_1979.206.1172.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 289px;" /></p>
<p>It&#39;s spectacular, isn&#39;t it? The four jolly, fat spiders in their intricate communal web of mesh are truly lovely. We moderns can&#39;t compete.&#0160; We have nothing to offer.&#0160;</p>
<p>Here&#39;s another beauty, this one from the area that is now Columbia.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/images/h2/h2_66.196.23.jpg" /></p>
<p>This nose ornament is five inches long from top to bottom, which means that it would cover the mouth and hang well below the chin. The small gold discs and the long flattened cylinders are loosely attached, so the ornament was designed both to catch and reflect the light and to jingle. This one, like the spider ornament, is glittery, ostentatious, and unapologetic.</p>
<p>I imagine that like most such jewelry, these nose ornaments were designed to say, &quot;I&#39;&#39;m rich, I&#39;m powerful, and I&#39;m sexy. Come mate with me.&quot; To me, they also say, very loudly, &quot;I can endure massive rhinal discomfort.&quot; It appears that these nose ornaments were inserted between the nostrils and attached to the septum. To wear such an ornament would be painful even if the wearer never sneezed or blew his nose, but to insert and remove it would be sheer nasal agony. Those sharp points would dig into the tender flesh. And the object must have been frequently removed,&#0160; because with the ornament in place, drinking or eating would be impossibly messy. While the nose ornament might get a guy a date, it would certainly inhibit chat or flirtation, and would also become a major impediment if he got lucky.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not impressed by the pitifully small nose ornaments worn by modern teenagers, but I would definitely respect the child who was willing to brandish something equivalent to these wonders. Especially the&#0160;one with the spiders.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>When, In a Canterbury bar many years ago, I ordered a cider, the East Kent cockney bartender responded with a question that I interpreted as &quot;strong Boer what knees?&quot; Why would he ask me about the joints of a South African farmer? I was absolutely befuddled even when he repeated the question several times. Finally, in frustration, he held up two bottles of cider: the first was labeled &quot;Strongbow&quot; and the second &quot;Watney&#39;s.&quot; He was simply asking me if I preferred Strongbow or Watney&#39;s -- but how was I to know?&#0160; Some years afterward I mentioned this incident to an English friend who countered with a story of her own. On her first visit to New York City, she said, she ordered a sandwich and the counterman asked her &quot;fur rear oughta go?&quot;</p>
<p>I recalled these events while musing on two moments of childhood linguistic extremity. The first was when I asked one of my P. S. 217 friends what they did during Religious Instruction (in the 1950s, Roman Catholic kids were released from class for two hours a week to study at the local parish church, which in my neighborhood was St. Rose of Lima -- popularly known as &quot;Roe Salima.&quot;&#0160; Our teachers took the opportunity to catch up on the local newspapers while students twiddled the collective thumb). My friend&#39;s answer, &quot;Cat kiss &#39;em.&quot; It was many years before I understood that the word I had no hope of understanding was &quot;catechism.&quot; I was even more puzzled when a Jewish student, who could not know that I came from a family that regularly celebrated Yom Kippur with a roast pork dinner, asked me, &quot;do you put on to fill in?&quot; I construed the question to be some sort of insult, but after a decade or so I realized that I had been asked something rather serious: &quot;Do you put on <em>tefillin? -- </em>tefillin being small leather boxes containing biblical verses donned by observant Jews during morning prayers.</p>
<p>In my neighborhood, it was common for people to shout &quot;doozie pots&quot; at each other.&#0160; I had no idea what that expression meant, except for a strong feeling that it wasn&#39;t praise. It was not until I studied a little Italian that I understood that what I heard as &quot;doozie pots&quot; was a Sicilian variant of<em>&#0160;tu sei pazzo</em>, &quot;you&#39;re crazy.&quot;</p>
<p>None of these misunderstandings, strictly speaking, meet the mondegreen threshold;&#0160; let&#39;s call them near-mondegreens. (The best-known mondegreen is &quot;I led the pigeons to the flag&quot; -- a mishearing of &quot;I pledge allegiance to the flag.&quot; The word mondegreen derives from one of the Child ballads: &quot;They hae slain the Earl of Murray/ And laid him on the green,&quot; the second of these lines misheard as &quot;And Lady Mondegreen&quot;). In my long list of personal mondegreens, the two that are most vivid in my memory are connected to my incomprehension of religion.&#0160; They are a) the luscious &quot;round young virgin&quot; of <em>Silent Night</em>, and b) the theologically implausible &quot;The Lord is ice, the Lord is made of ice&quot; in one of the choruses of <em>The Messiah</em> (&quot;even so in Christ, shall we be made alive&quot;). Here&#39;s another mondegreen from my childhood:&#0160; &quot;Who knows what evil lurks in the hot cement?&quot; <em>March 12:&#0160; </em>Last night at dinner, I remarked&#0160; that one of my favorite innovations of the second half of the twentieth century was &quot;fitted sheets.&quot;&#0160; A guest said, &quot;You&#39;re right;&#0160; we didn&#39;t used to have feta cheese.&quot;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>In the course of their long evolution our insect friends solved the problem of adolescence.While we humans grow ever so awkwardly from childhood to sexual maturity, your efficient, clever insect larva merely sequesters himself for a few weeks or months and then emerges as a completely fledged adult. No whining, no rebellion, no pimples, no door-slamming -- one day a child, and then, presto, a full member of society. There&#39;s not a beetle on what Antigonus called &quot;the whole dungy earth&quot; who ever had to &quot;find himself.&quot;</p>
<p>I wish that my own pupa-hood had been so quick and painless, but in fact, it was a commonplace mix of anxious folly and meaningless alienation. My most successful strategy for coping with the mess was to escape into the imagination. Not my own imagination, of course, for I had little or none, but into other people&#39;s. In my pupal stage, I was an indiscriminate reader of the genre known as fantasy and science fiction. Inhabiting, as I did, the wrong body, and having been birthed in the wrong time and place, I preferred fantastic alternative universes to so-called &quot;real life.&quot; I subscribed to a bunch of pulp mags and I also gobbled the extensive collections of sci-fi in the local public library. Not everyone will recognize the writers who were then my literary heroes, but for me they were names as familiar as Koufax and Drysdale or, for that matter, Truman and Eisenhower. Does anyone out there remember these folks: Robert Heinlein, James Blish, L. Sprague de Camp, Richard Matheson, Isaac Asimov, Robert Sheckley, Arthur C. Clarke, William Tenn, Poul Anderson, Fredric Brown, Fritz Leiber, Theodore Sturgeon, Clifford D. Simak, Fletcher Pratt, Ray Bradbury?&#0160; Names to conjure with, so to speak.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a paradox. While I vividly recall the names of these authors, I can remember almost nothing of what they wrote. I was fully immersed in the genre and yet it&#39;s evaporated from my memory -- leaving less of a mark than does the grub that becomes a butterfly. I seem to recall a novel or story about a planet in which the trees were murderous -- they would send their roots through ventilating ducts and strangle people in their beds. I have a hazy recollection of a story about a society in which overconsumption was the norm and in which to take a sofa and a set of chairs off the hands of newlyweds was an act of love. I recall some precocious evil children endowed with supernatural powers. Do I remember, or do I just imagine that I much admired a story about human beings shrunk to infinitesimal size who had to go mano-a-flagellum with paramecia. I&#39;m certain that I encountered a superfluity of post-apocalyptic stories: after the A-bomb, after the plague, after the invasion from another planet -- all such fictions obvious symptoms of cold-war paranoia. Why in the world should an adolescent earthling have consoled himself with stories of extragalactic invaders spaceshipping&#0160;to our green earth to exploit, or colonize, or enslave, or, occasionally, to butcher and stew us? In the 1950s, aliens were always hostile. None of my authors, as far as I can remember, could envision them greeting us with the outstretched tentacle of peace.</p>
<p>Although I think that some of the stories were imaginative, most of them were no more than starwarslike space operas-- Westerns but with death rays instead of six-shooters.</p>
<p>It&#39;s been many a year since I could abide fantasy. The genre is now repugnant to me.&#0160; I can&#39;t read Tolkien or Harry Potter, I can&#39;t watch movies about ghosts, or satanic possession, or space travel, or time travel, or about people stuck in other peoples&#39; bodies. All such nonsense bores the living heck out of me. Nor is it merely the lowbrow stuff. I can no longer read Spenser or Ariosto and&#0160;my least favorite character in Shakespeare is the magician Prospero. Is it a failure of imagination on my part?&#0160; Perhaps. But I don&#39;t feel it as a loss. There&#39;s more than enough of the non-fantastic to keep me joyfully occupied. I&#39;m grateful that sci-fi served my pupal needs, but it&#39;s gone forever.</p>
<p>Nowadays I tend to think back to my adolescent reading only when I&#39;m at the drugstore filling a prescription. The names of the new concoctions devised by Big Pharma all sound extraterrestrial to me. For example: Cyclessa is the queen of the distant planet Pulmicort which circles around the star Ativan in the galaxy called Levaquin. Cyclessa’s evil brother Coumadin, along with his henchmen the evil twins Zantac and Zocor, have attacked the queen, using their secret weapons Restoril and Ritalin. They&#39;re accompanied by the enchantress Ambien, aka Zolpidem, who causes her enemies to fall into profound sleep. But deep in the forest, young Prozac awakens from a spell, mounts the great horse Oxycontin, and with the aid of his sidekick, the amusing but randy Cialis, who has escaped from the clutches of the evil witch Prevacid....&#0160; Etc., etc.</p>

				<p>&quot;It was irresponsible for me to have bought this house,&quot; he thought. &quot;And yet it is so glamorous, so desirable.&#0160; I should have inspected it more closely.&#0160; There are many parts of the building that I&#39;ve never even looked into. Take this room, for example.&#0160; It&#39;s far too long and narrow to be useful&#0160; I must have been attracted to the bookshelf and to the books. But now that I look closely, I see that the books are tattered and&#0160; worthless. I thought that they were valuable, but they&#39;re just thrift store discards. And the kitchen -- I don&#39;t think it&#39;s functional. These hand-carved boards, which I thought were so beautiful -- they obstruct the sink and the stove. I&#39;ll have to remove them. And in this room -- what is it, a bedroom? -- the murals are nothing more than the scrawls of children. What could I have been thinking? I have purchased a house that is a shambles. It&#39;s going to cost me a fortune just to make it habitable. Look, in the living room the wallpaper is pulled off and the lath is exposed. And here, in the grand ballroom, there&#39;s been leakage around the window frames. This huge fireplace is falling in. This passageway, which ought to go to the nursery --it&#39;s been blocked off. And this sitting room has no outside wall. No protection from the weather at all. The wind could blow right through. It was self-destructive of me to buy this house. It&#39;s financial suicide. What could have attracted me to it? Let&#39;s walk around the outside. There are entrances that I didn&#39;t know existed. Anyone could come in. It&#39;s not secured; there are no locks, no doors. And a garage -- but the garage floor isn&#39;t concrete or paved -- it&#39;s just sand and rocks. And this outside wall, which I took for marble or granite -- it&#39;s just old loose, cracked, unpainted stucco. The yard is a complete wreck -- all concrete and razor-wire, nothing alive. Who&#39;s that strange man prowling around?&#0160; Why was I attracted to this place?&#0160; Why do I still find it alluring, despite everything that I know about it?&quot;</p>
<p>Later, we all went for a drive in the mountains. It was cold and the roads were completely covered with snow and almost impassable. We arrived too late for the party. &quot;Let&#39;s all meet at the Unitarian church,&quot; one of the other guests said. &quot;I&#39;m going to kill me a chicken,&quot; said another.&#0160;</p>

				<p>Here is a sentence drawn from a contract for new condominium construction. &quot;The laundry room flooring is a composition tile called Stonewalk; it is a warm light color that <em>compliments</em> all of the wood floor options.&quot; And here&#39;s a second sentence from the same contract: &quot;bedroom carpets are a warm light color that <em>compliments </em>all of the wood floor options.&quot;&#0160; <em>Compliments?&#0160; </em>As every schoolchild is taught, &quot;to compliment&quot; means &quot;to praise.&quot;&#0160; The wording of the contract therefore asserts that Stonewalk, a composition tile, speaks highly of the wooden floor. The bedroom carpets join in the chorus of adulation. No doubt that it&#39;s a praiseworthy floor, but are the warm light carpets and the warm light tiles fully qualified to make so positive a determination?</p>
<p>Surely the highly-skilled and well-compensated lawyers who drew up the contract meant to write (if they subscribe to conventional canons of usage) that &quot;the color of Stonewalk <em>complements </em>the color of the floors.&quot; That is to say, the one color &quot;completes&quot; or &quot;makes perfect&quot; the other.</p>
<p>For example:&#0160; you may compliment the sommelier, but the sauvignon rouge complements the rosbif or the biftek. Them&#39;s the official rules.&#0160;</p>
<p>But should they be?&#0160; Is the distinction between compliment and complement meaningful? Or is it pedantic and arbitrary?</p>
<p>What can history tell us about these twins?</p>
<p>In Shakespeare&#39;s <em>Love&#39;s Labor&#39;s Lost, </em>Don Adriano de Armado is &quot;a refined traveler of Spain..., /That hath a mint of phrases in his brain;/ One whom the music of his own vain tongue/ Doth ravish like enchanting harmony;/ [He is] a man of complements.&quot;&#0160; But is a &quot;man of complements&quot; a courteous man who offers gratuitous compliments, or is he rather a fulfilled or a complete man.&#0160; Clearly, Shakespeare&#39;s word conflates the two meanings. A second example, this one from <em>King Lear</em>:&#0160; &quot;There is further complement of leave-taking between Burgundy and [Lear].&quot;&#0160; Does &quot;complement&quot; mean, &quot;politeness&quot; or &quot;formal civility,&quot; which would be &quot;compliment&quot;;&#0160; or does it mean that Burgundy and Lear have finished or completed or brought to perfection their parting sentences?&#0160; Once again, both meanings are possible. Examples of such blurring can be multiplied. Falstaff (in <em>The Merry Wives of Windsor) </em>says this: &quot;I see you are obsequious in your love and I profess requital to a hair&#39;s breadth; not only, Mistress Ford, in the simple office of love, but in all the accoutrement, compl<span style="color: #3333ff;"><em>x</em></span>ment, and ceremony of it.&quot;&#0160; Complement, compliment; take your pick.&#0160; Either is possible;&#0160; both make perfectly good sense.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>It&#39;s obvious that the doctrinaire distinction between the spellings has been imposed since the time of Shakespeare. In fact, the dictionaries tell us that the introduction of a second, separate word is an example of learned Frenchification. OED:&#0160; &quot;Compliment (Fr) is a doublet of complement (the form directly from Latin). The latter was in use before the introduction of the French form, which slowly took its place between 1635 and 1715.&quot; The twins have been, and still are, closer in meaning than traditionalists allow (which is why the condo contract writers got it, so to speak, &quot;wrong&quot;).</p>
<p>What to do?&#0160; My suggestion: let&#39;s overleap the conservatives and embrace the truly reactionary. Let&#39;s declare that from now on, &quot;compliment&quot; and &quot;complement&quot; are, just as they used to be, one and the same word.&#0160; No more racking the brains over &quot;i&quot; and &quot;e,&quot; no more anxiety, no more guilt.&#0160;</p>
<p>Let the word go forth that from this moment on, tiles and carpets are free to complement or to compliment floors -- just as they prefer.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>J. D. Salinger&#39;s <em>The Catcher in the Rye </em>is an anti-<em>bildungsroman -- </em>a &quot;novel of education&quot; without the least shred of moral, intellectual, or spiritual growth. Holden Caulfield, the novel&#39;s naive yet jaded narrator, learns absolutely nothing either about himself or about life. Unable to profit from his various encounters, he dismisses almost everyone he meets as &quot;phony.&quot; That one adjective, repeated incessantly and <em>ad nauseam,</em> might lead a reader to hope that Holden will find authenticity somewhere in his horizon, but <em>The Catcher in the Rye </em>is not a novel that rewards optimism.&#0160; It concludes with a vision of Holden&#39;s pre-pubescent sister Phoebe going &quot;round and round&quot; on a symbolic carousel-- going nowhere, it would seem -- and in a brief coda Holden himself has been institutionalized and placed under the care of an unsympathetic psychoanalyst. Nor does the whiff of Humbertism in the relation between Holden and young Phoebe contribute any last-second learning or cheer.</p>
<p>Even in the 1950s, <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em> enjoyed a cadre of fiercely loyal partisans who powerfully identified with Holden Caulfield. I didn&#39;t believe then, and certainly don&#39;t believe now, that Holden mirrored the anguish of my own particular soul. I was not a true believer, and I was not entranced by Holden. For me, the novel was nothing more than a better-than-average coming-of-age story -- although a dispiriting one because Holden Caulfield does not mature but instead remains stranded in perpetual, painful adolescence.</p>
<p>A novel without hope, <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em> has become an inspiration for the hopeless. In Los Angeles, in 1989, twenty-one-year-old Robert Bando shot and killed a young actress whom he had been pestering with trinkets and messages. In a nearby alley, police found a .357-caliber handgun, a bloody shirt, and a copy of <em>The Catcher in the Rye. </em>Two years later, John Hinckley shot and crippled James Brady and almost succeeded in assassinating Ronald Reagan. Hinckley had fantasized that killing the president would impress the actress Jodie Foster, whom he imagined that he was wooing. In his pocket he carried a well-read, tattered paperback of -- you guessed it --<em>The Catcher in the Rye. </em>In 1980, on Manhattan&#39;s West Side, Mark David Chapman, concealing his pistol under a copy of <em>The Catcher in the Rye,</em> shot John Lennon five times at point blank. He had inscribed his copy of the novel with the words &quot;To Holden Caulfield from Holden Caulfield&quot; -- Chapman had tried to legally change his name to that of Salinger&#39;s troubled narrator. From jail, the proud murderer issued an endorsement: &quot;My wish is for all of you to someday read <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em>.&quot;&#0160; At his trial Chapman asserted that he had killed Lennon because the singer had become &quot;phony,&quot; and at his sentencing he read to the judge the section of the book in which Holden tells his sister Phoebe that he imagined himself in a field of rye with &quot;thousands of little kids&quot; whom he must prevent from falling off &quot;the edge of some crazy cliff.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p><em>The Catcher in the Rye</em> still sells well (15,000,000 copies in print by 1996) and has become a fixture in the high school and college classroom, where successive generations of adolescents can calibrate their degree of <em>angst</em> against Holden&#39;s. But increasingly, and paradoxically, attention has turned from the novel to Salinger himself, who has not published anything since 1965 and, secluded in his Cornish, New Hampshire retreat, has become the world&#39;s most notorious hermit since St. Simeon Stylites mounted his pillar in sixth-century Antioch. Although he is a hermit, Salinger is anything but a saint. In 1987, in a bizarre echo of Holden<em>-</em>obsessed stalkers, Salinger, then sixty-eight years old, flew to California and barged onto the set of the TV show <em>Dynasty</em> in search of one of the series&#39;s starlets, Catherine Oxenberg, with whom he had apparently fallen into long-distance electronic infatuation. He was &quot;escorted&quot; off the set. Did Catherine Oxenberg have a precursor?&#0160; She did, indeed she did. Several, in fact, including Joyce Maynard, described as &quot;the Lolita of all Lolitas,&quot; who was eighteen and a freshman at Yale in 1972 when Salinger, at the age of fifty-three, initiated a romance by sending her a fan letter. These and other even less savory details about Caulfield-Salinger&#39;s life can be found in Paul Alexander&#39;s thin, amateurish biography <em>Salinger </em>(Los Angeles: Renaissance Books, 1999), which does not propose, although it might, that J. D. has learned as little about life as his most famous character.</p>
