		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I read <em>Imagining Robert, My Brother, Madness, and Survival</em> by Jay Neugeboren for neighborhood and neighborly reasons. Its author is a 1955 graduate of fabled Erasmus Hall High School (I was class of 1956). Much of the story takes place in the area of Brooklyn now called Lefferts Gardens. Walkable, or at least bicyclable, from East 9 Street.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a sad tale. Younger brother Robert went seriously off the psychological rails in his late teen years. Older brother Jay relentlessly chronicles his brother&#39;s lifetime of struggles. It becomes clear that modern medicine does not offer any remedy or hope to people with Robert&#39;s illnesses. The system relies on&#0160; ineffective drugs and ineffective therapies and what amounts to involuntary imprisonment. It&#39;s a painful, discouraging history.</p>
<p>And it&#39;s also a good and moving book. Very sincere and very emotional. I confess to dropping an occasional tear.</p>
<p>And yet I don&#39;t know whether it&#39;s right to expose a loved one to such public scrutiny. I myself wouldn&#39;t have made that choice. But I empathize with Neugeboren&#39;s tale, inasmuch as I know from personal experience that therapies for some forms of mental decay are no better now than they were during the Darkest Ages.</p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2022/04/henry-james-portrait-of-a-lady-1963-2022.html">Henry James, Portrait of a Lady (1963-2022)</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I read James&#39; <em>Portrait of a Lady</em> in 1963 but never again until last week, so there has been a hiatus of almost three score years. During the interim, glaciers have melted, continents have subducted and conventional notions about what constitutes a &quot;lady&quot; have shifted quite marvelously.&#0160;</p>
<p>After such an interval, it&#39;s not disgraceful for me to confess that I remembered very little of the novel and that even major plot points came as a shock and surprise. Moreover, I re-read the novel with a bit of prejudice, because I had recently learned that Theodore Roosevelt once met James and dismissed him as &quot;a miserable little snob.&quot; Even if I hadn&#39;t been alerted by Roosevelt&#39;s back-of-the-hand slap, I would have recognized that <em>Portrait of a Lady </em>generates enough snobbery to power a nineteenth-century locomotive from Rome to Florence even while hauling the book&#39;s entire cast of frequent travelers. It&#39;s a class-ridden novel in which lesser sophisticates are out-snobbed by superior sophisticates. Despite this unfortunate failing, <em>Portrait of a Lady</em> is a rather wonderful piece of writing.</p>
<p>Let me further confess that I brought a second and more deeply-rooted prejudice to my re-reading. In the early 1960s, when I was a graduate student of &quot;English and American Language and Literature&quot; at a New England university, Henry James was at the apex of his critical reputation. He was &quot;the Master.&quot; In fact, an appreciation (or devotion) to James became a sort of ticket of admission to the coterie of the literary elite. A touchstone. If you (that is, me) were able to appreciate and adore James&#39;s extraordinarily subtle judgements and discriminations and his sustained and intricate analyses of the velleities of social interactions, why then, you were one of the elect. But if you were baffled by his niceties and sometimes could not divine what the heck he was going on and on about, why then you weren&#39;t what James calls in <em>Portrait</em> &quot;a person of sensibility.&quot; And if you weren&#39;t a person of sensibility, why in tarnation were you studying literary history at a university that had been home to establishment sophisticates since 1636?</p>
<p>Not a James devotee, I managed to slip through the system without the disgraceful lacunae in my preparation coming to anyone&#39;s attention. And until this past week, I managed to keep my distance from Mr. Henry James.&#0160;</p>
<p>But I may have made a mistake to have done so. I&#39;d still say that<em> Portrait of a Lady</em> isn&#39;t up there in the stratosphere with <em>Bleak House</em> and <em>Middlemarch</em>, but it&#39;s still a darn good novel. It&#39;s not conventionally exciting; in fact, it&#39;s talky and static in the extreme. Nothing much happens. Isabel Archer talks with Henrietta and HJ analyses the conversation. Then someone goes to Gardencourt and has a long conversation with Lord Warburton. Then Lord W meets Countess C in Rome and they talk. Then Madame Merle, who, we are told, was born in Brooklyn and therefore ought to have known better, has a long conversation with Isabel Archer. Then someone meets someone else in a museum or a train station or a restaurant and they have a long conversation -- once again dissected by HJ. Then they ride the rails to Florence and talk. Meanwhile Ralph Touchett is slowly dying and will continue die (and talk) for another five hundred pages. These various conversations are often oblique, with the most important points omitted or merely implied (to be grasped only by persons of subtlety and sensibility). It&#39;s all so slow that I sometimes felt myself yearning for a good solid knife fight or at least a lengthy car chase. When Isabel finally tells enigmatic villainess Madame Merle that she doesn&#39;t want to see her ever again, I longed for her to spit it out with a a good round &quot;fuck off&quot; -- but no such luck.</p>
<p>And yet as mysteries are revealed in the last third of the novel, <em>Portrait</em> becomes undeniably exciting. Much is familiar; it seems as though James recapitulates the marriage of Dorothea Brooke and Eddie Casaubon in the misalliance of Isabel Archer and the &quot;sterile dilettante&quot; Gilbert Osmond. And also borrows the Pansy plot from the story of Honoria Dedlock. But I came to these insights, if they are insights, only in retrospect; while reading the novel, I was surprised and intrigued.</p>
<p>I strongly object to the ending of the novel, which seemed to violate the trajectory of the plot. Surely Isabel has earned her freedom. To me, her continued bondage to propriety seems cruel to both the character and also to hopeful (but deceived) readers. Wicked, in fact, to the point of sadism. No doubt the conclusion tests a reader&#39;s sophistication, and no doubt if I read the voluminous commentary that the novel has engendered, the apparent cruelty of the conclusion would be be explained and justified. But I won&#39;t read the commentary. I&#39;m obviously not a &quot;person of sensibility&quot; and I prefer to remain unimproved, unenlightened, and pissed.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Young &#39;uns, I don&#39;t know that you entirely grasp the glamor and mystery of maturity (which in some jaded circles is called &quot;old age.&quot;)&#0160; Let me tell you, the <br />golden years are just chockablock full of sensual romance of a kind that you might not now appreciate.&#0160;</p>
<p>Just the other day, for example, we were both instructed to make another visit to the phlebotomist (it seems hardly a month goes by that some specialist or other doesn&#39;t need to inspect a sample of our personal sanguineous fluids).&#0160;</p>
<p>Being economical people, we scheduled our appointments for the same time, same place.</p>
<p>Her blood draw was in anticipation of a knee replacement; mine for routine monitoring of my half-a-dozen annoying senior conditions.</p>
<p>So there we were, side by side, in adjacent cubicles, stripping our sleeves for the venipuncture.</p>
<p>I ask you, is there anything on earth more romantic than a senior couple experiencing simultaneous blood draws. Rapture, rapture! Joy and jollity!</p>
<p>In a merrier world, the instant of venipuncture would have been accompanied with an orchestra of swelling music, perhaps Brahms. And there would have been candles; next time this happens, we&#39;ll surround ourselves with a whole Liberace of candelabras. Dozens of long stem red roses. Beakers of Veuve Cliquot &#39;42.&#0160; An applauding audience of family and friends.&#0160;</p>
<p>It would have been even more thrilling if my technician hadn&#39;t taken three tries to hit the mark. &quot;Your vein rolled,&quot; she said accusingly, compromising ever so slightly the transcendent moment.</p>

Neugeboren was newborn in 1938, just a year before me, and he attended fabled Erasmus Hall High School, most likely graduating with the class of 1955 (I was &#39;56). It&#39;s a mark of my ignorance of modern American letters that I had no idea that my near-classmate was the author of 24 books, most of them novels. <em>Big Man</em> was Neugeboren&#39;s first novel.&#0160;</p>
<p>Close to home? Here are couple of sentences that will shiver the nostalgia timbers of wistful ex-Erasmians.&#0160;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I walk down Church Avenue, past the Kenmore Theater. Across the street the old church, used to cut classes and sit in the graveyard....&#0160; In front of Garfields&#39;s Cafeteria all the guys hanging out with their broads and their puffed hair.... Guys with Erasmus jackets on. I keep walking. Past the firehouse and the Holy Cross schoolyard.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wow, it&#39;s a guided tour of the old neighborhood as it was in the 1950s. Who from Erasmus hasn&#39;t sprawled on the steps of the Dutch Reformed Church?</p>
<p>The novel revolves around the 1951 basketball scandals, which were world-shaking news at the time. A number of New York City college players (CCNY, St. Johns, Fordham, LIU) fell into the clutches of shady gamblers and were paid to shave points.&#0160; A few were indicted and convicted. I wrote a few melancholy and disillusioned paragraphs about the scandals some years ago -- <a href="   https://www.drmetablog.com/2008/05/ccny-basketball.html">here.</a></p>
<p>In <em>Big Man,&#0160;</em>Neugeboren tells the story through the eyes and mouth of a character named Mack Davis, who had been an upcoming star but is now, because he missed a couple of baskets, stuck in a dead-end job at an automated carwash. It&#39;s an ambitious conceit and a promising plot. <em>Big Man, </em>I regret to say, is not a very artistic piece of work, but what the heck! Neugeboren was only 25 or 26 when he wrote it and had had only a few years to recover from uninspiring Erasmus Hall English classes.&#0160;</p>
<p>I confess that I was uncomfortable that Neugeboren wrote the novel in a black voice. I don&#39;t object in theory, because there&#39;s no earthly reason why a white novelist can&#39;t impersonate a black person, any more than male novelist can&#39;t speak as a female (or vice versa), or a young writer speak in the voice of an old. So wny was I troubled? I think it was because the voice that the novelist invented didn&#39;t seem genuine. It seemed &quot;literary&quot; -- as though the Davis character had been heisted out of a&#0160; blaxploitation film. Occasional inadvertent lapses in the dialect were particularly painful to my ever-sensitive ears.</p>
<p><em>Big Man</em> reminds me how central basketball was to my adolescent life. I think if I had spent as much time and effort on my schoolwork as I did practicing my foul shots I might have been somebody. But I think I learned as much about life from basketball and its scandals as I did from any other 1950s phenomenon (such as the antics of &quot;Tailgunner Joe&quot; McCarthy). I&#39;m grateful to Jay Neugeboren for preserving an important piece of my history and especially for bringing the old neighborhood right to the forefront.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>It should be remembered and recorded that in October of 1960, Eleanor Roosevelt herself visited the home of my parents --my childhood home (539 East 9 Street in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn).</p>
<p>I myself missed the occasion, alas. I was then living in Massachusetts, undergoing the first disorienting days of graduate school. But I know the story.&#0160;</p>
<p>During the 1960 presidential campaign (John F. Kennedy versus &quot;Tricky Dick&quot; Nixon), JFK&#39;s Catholicism emerged as a divisive issue. It&#39;s hard to believe what a fuss was made about his religion, especially nowadays, when no one bothers themselves that Joseph Biden is not only a Roman Catholic, but a serious one at that (JFK&#39;s personal commitment to his religion was, let&#39;s say, nominal).</p>
<p>Among Jewish voters, some of whom had grown up in Brownsville or Williamsburg or the Lower East side where Jewish-Irish conflict was a fact of life, there was a great deal of resistance to voting for JFK. And other Jewish voters, harking back to the old country, remembered Catholics as their antagonists and were hard put to vote for a candidate of that persuasion.</p>
<p>It fell to the task of Mrs. Roosevelt to persuade these reluctant voters that they could and should cast a ballot for Kennedy. At the time, there was no one in America who had more credibility with Jewish populations than she. It was well known that Mrs. Roosevelt had lobbied her hesitant husband for more lenient policies toward &quot;displaced&quot; Jews</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know how it came about that our living room was chosen as a site for Mrs. Roosevelt to meet with voters. I suspect that it was through my mother&#39;s extensive contacts with members of the League of Women Voters, an organization of which she was a stalwart volunteer. I know that my mother assembled 50 or so voters, almost all Jewish women, and seated or stood them in our very crowded second floor living room. Mrs. Roosevelt arrived, and as my father said to me later, she &quot;dragged her ass&quot; up two flights of stairs, spoke for 20 minutes, presumably in that upper-class nasal twang for which she was famous, answered a couple of respectful questions, and then limped back down to her car. And went on to the next venue. And the next. (She was 76 at the time, and not in great health.) Apparently she followed this same arduous routine for months.</p>
<p>That&#39;s how elections are won.</p>
<p>Eleanor Roosevelt died two years later, in 1962.&#0160;</p>

<div class="bRMDJf islir" role="button" tabindex="0">I&#39;m proud that our home hosted Mrs. Roosevelt. It&#39;s too bad that 539 East 9 was demolished in 1988. It deserved a better fate, especially since there was a day when it was graced by one of the previous century&#39;s finest human beings.</div>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef02788070440a200d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Screen Shot 2022-03-10 at 7.59.57 PM" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef02788070440a200d image-full img-responsive" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef02788070440a200d-800wi" title="Screen Shot 2022-03-10 at 7.59.57 PM" /></a><br />Of course everyone knew that Sid Luckman was from Brooklyn and that he had attended Erasmus Hall High School and Columbia University before becoming one of the first superstars of the National Football League. To football fans, he was as renowned a home-town boy as Sandy Koufax was to followers of baseball. But until I read R.D. Rosen&#39;s new biography of Sid, called <em>Tough Luck,&#0160;</em>I didn&#39;t know that football&#39;s first T-formation quarterback was a neighborhood guy, and that his modest childhood home was just four blocks off the route that Stephen Lewin and I took every morning for four years to EHHS. And that his house was just around the corner from the Sears department store where <a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2007/07/summers-at-sear.html">I spent the summer</a> of 1957 pulling down $1.25 large an hour.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>The above is a modern picture, drawn from googlemaps. I suspect that the house is not much changed from the way it appeared in the 1930s but that the bars on the windows and front door are later additions. According to Zillow, the House of Sid is 1664 sq. ft. and is now priced at c. $750,000. I&#39;d bet $2500 was the number in the 1930s, when the Luckman family was in residence.</p>
<p>Shouldn&#39;t there be a bronze plaque on the property?</p>
<p>It&#39;s a measure of the chanciness of the old neighborhood that Sid&#39;s father was convicted and imprisoned for a gangland murder and that he died in Sing Sing.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><em>Girl in Translation</em> is the story of a young, impoverished immigrant from Hong Kong. I may be wrong, but it reads as if it were less a novel than a barely fictionalized autobiography (Jean Kwok, the author, made her way from an unheated tenement to Harvard; Kimberley Chang, the central figure, escaped to Yale.) <em>Mutatis mutandis</em>, and all that. It&#39;s a familiar kind of work: a <em>bildungsroman</em>, of course, but also an immigrant novel, a coming-of-age adventure, and thanks to an inartistic tacked-on ending, an H. Alger rags-to-riches saga. Sometimes I felt that I was reading a century-later re-imagining of <em>A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, </em>things Irish replaced with things Chinese -- except that there is not a single tree in this novel&#39;s bleak landscape, not even a symbolic one. Plus ca change, plus de meme chose.</p>
<p>While it&#39;s not original or innovative, nor written with any particular flair, <em>Girl in Translation is </em>nevertheless valuable for the world it opens up to us. Plus it&#39;s on the whole uplifting, even if there are some unfortunate moments in which &quot;triumphant&quot; shades over into &quot;triumphalist.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>There&#39;s not much to admire about the Brooklyn of this novel; it&#39;s an unpleasant place. Manhattan&#39;s Chinatown, where much of the action takes place, is no better.</p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2022/03/boulder-mall-dogs-music.html">On the Mall</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>On our prosperous Boulder Mall, where all the men are handsome, all the women are good-looking, and all the mendicants take Venmo, there are 44 separate and distinct signs that declare, <strong>No Pets</strong>. Such clear instructions do not inhibit our infatuated dog owners, who can&#39;t bring themselves to believe that the injunction applies to their particular o-so-lovable canine. They cannot fathom that not every recreational mall-walker is in love with Bowser. As a result, the No Pets law is widely and defiantly flouted.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a second mall rule: no amplified music. Acoustic guitars, string quartets, bluegrass bands, accordionists, and singers are all allowed and encouraged. But every once in a while, some itinerant assembles an appallingly large apparatus on our otherwise peaceful Mall and produces sounds that can be heard for half a mile. Rude, ear-shattering noises.</p>
<p>Canines and amplifiers are everyday commonplace violations. But yesterday, walking on the mall, we observed a remarkable and unprecedented novelty. Along comes a nondescript scruffy guy walking an oversized nondescript dog, and lo and behold, onto the beast is strapped a boombox. Honest to Pete, I&#39;m not making this up! The attached mechanism is a powerful one and it generates an extremely loud noise. Unidentifiable sounds, possibly though not certainly some sort of music.</p>
<p>A woofer with a woofer, so to speak.</p>
<p>The man and his faithful friend proceed shamelessly along the mall, bass notes vibrating the shop windows and oscillating my pancreas.</p>
<p>I was floored, frankly. One dog, one amplifier; two concurrent violations.&#0160;</p>
<p>And then I watched in amazement as the big ol&#39; dog dropped a big ol&#39; deuce. A double deuce, actually. Two long brown glistening, smoking turds. Lurking right there on the bricks, preparing to ambush the pretty white shoes of the next three-year-old princess-in-a-pink-tutu to come tripping by.</p>
<p>In our town, it&#39;s the inviolable custom that every dog owner carries a plastic bag and politely disposes of his pet&#39;s droppings. Not this guy. He just kept on walking, pretending that he didn&#39;t know what was going on at the end of his leash -- which was, as a I have said, 1) a pooch, 2) an attached amplifier, and 3) pooch poop. A jackpot -- a perfect trifecta.</p>
<p>Do I have a theory to account for such contemptible misbehavior?&#0160; Well, I&#39;ve been thinking and mulling and contemplating, and I&#39;m aware of the talk of the breakdown of civil society, but all I can come up with is this: some people are royal jerks.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I liked Paul Auster&#39;s <em>The Brooklyn Follies</em> (2006) so much that I read it twice. It was even better the second time. Even though it begins scary (&quot;I was looking for a quiet place to die. Someone recommended Brooklyn...&quot;), it&#39;s a cheerful and warm-hearted novel. Auster&#39;s gift is to make barely credible events seem commonplace and normal. So<em> Follies </em>packs in a mute nine-year-old girl who journeys many miles to find her uncle, and then a forger of paintings, a noir-y blackmail scheme, a wacky pseudo-Christian religious cult, a Jamaican transvestite who mouths &quot;Can&#39;t Help Loving that Man&quot; at a sad funeral, and so on.</p>
<p><em>The Brooklyn Follies</em> is a comedy not because it labors at one-liners but because everyone who should get married or at least find a mate, manages to do so by the last page. Plus it&#39;s rich in Park Slope locations and lore.</p>
<p>I also enjoyed Colm Toibin&#39;s <em>Brooklyn (</em>2009<em>), </em>which is another version of the immigration novel. It&#39;s set back in the 1950s but the 50s might as well be the &#39;20s as far as oppressive social customs are concerned. Although the central figure, Eilis, travels to Brooklyn, she never quite frees herself from provincial Ireland or the interventions of transatlantic priest Father Flood. Young, inexperienced, she falls hard for a boy of Italian extraction -- and her doing so turns out to be more of a problem that it needs to be. Eilis must make some important, life-determining decisions, but whether she makes the right choices is left to the reader to decide (I myself think she loses her bearings). It&#39;s a lovely, understated, carefully wrought and admirable novel.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>This curiously named novel, <em>The Love Affairs of Nathaniel P.</em> (no relation, thank goodness), concerns a 30-year-old Baltimorean become Brooklynite who drifts from bed to bed but is incapable of achieving lasting love.</p>
<p>Adelle Waldman takes a scalpel to Nathaniel P[iven] and also to his various lady friends. Her analyses are sharp, incisive and sometimes painfully close to the bone. She is not above devoting paragraphs, even pages, to dissecting a minor event or brief conversation. Sometimes the intricacy of her observations resembles those of Henry James, though I can&#39;t remember The Master ever discussing either the scrotum or the anus of any of his characters. Waldman put me in mind of a sentence with which Horatio admonishes Hamlet: &#39;&quot;&#39;twere to consider too curiously to consider so.&quot;</p>
<p>Reading this novel, I was relieved that I am not a 30-year-old on the hunt -- and that I never was. There&#39;s lots of sex, some of it precipitous, but not much discussion or examples of genuine intimacy. Waldman&#39;s landscape is unfamiliar to me -- a foreign culture or, rather, an alien civilization.&#0160;</p>
<p>Set in Brooklyn, almost all the action takes place in Williamsburg or environs, certainly within sight of the Manhattan skyline -- although I remember that once or twice characters may have ventured into the Brooklyn hinterland for a pizza.</p>
<p>The author is amusingly aware of the way the new Brooklyn has superseded the old:&#0160;</p>

<p>the two groups (i.e. older residents and newcomers) might have existed on different layers of the earth&#39;s atmosphere that only from a distance appear to be on the same plane. A store called National Wines &amp; Liquors, Inc, where both liquor and cashier were enclosed behind bulletproof glass, was not actually a competitor to the much newer Tangled Vine, which specialized in organic and local wines and exhibited the work of area artists at its Thursday-evening tastings.</p>

<p>Which reminds me that I started to read but failed to comprehend a novel called <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Class</em></span> (2014) by Francesco Pacifico in which Williamsburg was regularly referred to as &quot;Willy.&quot; Again, I ask, what would Daniel Fuchs think?</p>
<p>The more of these novels I read, the more Brooklyn seems like a multiply layered palimpsest -- one culture imposed upon another, generation after generation.&#0160; My own Flatbush neighborhood, now upgraded to &quot;Kensington,&quot; was farmland right through to the end of the 19th century, then a suburb for prosperous old Protestant families, next a haven for Irish, Italian and Jewish immigrants and now an ethnic stew of Hasids, Turks, Arabs, Russians, and South and Central Americans of all kinds but also with an strong admixture of Tangled Vine dinks, yuppies and midWestern computer geeks. It&#39;s a complex piece of urban Americana -- one facet of which is well-illustrated by the story of unhappy Nathaniel P.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Through the continuing miracle of TCM, we watched <em>Divorcee,&#0160;</em>a 1930 &quot;pre-Code&quot; drama of marriage and adultery. It&#39;s a film that was shocking in its own time and still carries a bit of an edge. Jerry Martin (Norma Shearer) and Ted Martin (Chester Morris) attempt to create a marriage of perfect equals, but Ted strays. There&#39;s a great understated scene in which Jerry, the betrayed wife, cold-bloodedly tells her unfaithful husband, that &quot;I&#39;ve balanced our accounts.&quot; Ted, though he has proclaimed a commitment to equality, does not, let us say, handle the revelation of his wife&#39;s adultery with grace. The marriage comes to a disastrous end. But alas after an hour or so of travail and weeping, Jerry loses her nerve, succumbs to propriety, pursues her erring husband to Paris, and promises to be true. The assertion of equity has turned out to be just so much blather. The double standard has been tested but has held firm. The film flirts with radicalism but reverts to a Hollywood ending in which love conquers all and an adventurous woman accepts her subordinate place.</p>
<p>I was sufficiently intrigued by the film to investigate its background. The source is a novel called&#0160;<em>Ex-Wife</em> (1928) by Ursula Parrott, which sold 100,000 copies and was a sensation in its day. I confess that although I&#39;m supposed to know something about literature, I had never heard of this scandalous piece of fiction. <em>Ex-Wife</em> sunk like a stone and has been out of print for many years, but our interlibrary loan department managed to locate a 80s reprint in Fort Lewis, Colorado. (Thanks, Interlibrary Loan!).</p>
<p><em>Ex-Wife&#0160;</em>is an inartistic piece of writing -- hectic, repetitive, padded, but one that obviously struck a nerve. In this novel, a young divorced woman does not just pine for her wandering husband. Instead, she enjoys her independence, and &quot;sleeps with more men than [I] can count.&quot; She then she falls deeply in love with the wrong man, and finally opportunistically marries a third fellow whom she doesn&#39;t love but to whom she promises to be faithful (we are skeptical). The novel is marinated in speakeasy bootleg liquor and easy morality. Much wilder than the rather tame film version, it is also more challenging and revolutionary.</p>
<p>In the course of the novel, our heroine has a baby (who conveniently dies) and also an abortion. The babies are important to the larger backstory. In 1922, the then Katherine Ursula Towle, a recent Radcliffe graduate, married Lindesay Marc Parrott, a young reporter for <em>The New York Times.&#0160;</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>They had a son named Lindesay Marc Parrott Jr. two years later. However, his existence was kept a secret from Ursula&#39;s husband, as he never wanted to have a son. So, Ursula left the child in the custody of her father and sister and returned to Lindesay, still not speaking a word about the son. It was not until 1926 that Lindesay found out that he was a father. As a result, he immediately divorced Ursula, rejected the existence of his son, and never once went to see him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s an astonishing revelation that certainly does not speak well for Lindesay Parrott, but adds some autobiographical interest to the plot of Ursula Parrott&#39;s <em>Ex-Wife</em>. Suddenly, the deceased child and the abortion make a certain kind of sense.</p>
<p>I should add that Lindesay Parrott was a name well known to me in the days of my youth. I was then a diligent reader of <em>The New York Times</em> and Lindesay Parrott covered the Korean War, so I encountered his name every single day from 1949 to 1955. And then in the 70s, I learned that Lindesay Parrott had retired from the <em>Time</em>s and had purchased a small farm on Kidder Road in Bradford, Vermont, a bit more than a mile, as the crow flies, from where we lived on Hackett Hill Road. I gave thought to knocking on his door, but I heard through the local gossip chain that Parrott was a recluse and a terrible alcoholic. Whether true or not I don&#39;t know. Of course I had no idea that Lindesay Parrott had once been married to a notorious novelist.</p>
<p>As for Ursula, after her divorce from Lindesay Parrott, she married three more times, and was also rumored to have had affairs with F. Scott Fitzgerald and Sinclair Lewis. She died in 1957 &quot;in the charity ward of a New York City hospital.&quot;</p>

<div class="bRMDJf islir" role="button" tabindex="0">[September 24, 2023]&#0160; I&#39;ve just read a remarkable biography of Ursula Parrott, called <em>Becoming the Ex-Wife</em>, by Marsha Gordon, a professor of film studies.&#0160; It&#39;s a deeply researched piece of writing, and a revelation. Ursula Parrott&#39;s life was both more tied to convention and more lurid than it was represented in the Wik article from which I drew my information. The story about Lindesay Parrott not knowing about his son&#39;s birth nowhere appears on the biography. It&#39;s a myth, though it is true that Parrott was not much interested in his offspring (but in a indifferent-father rather than an ignorant-father way). Can&#39;t always trust Wikipedia.</div>

<div class="bRMDJf islir" role="button" tabindex="0">How Ursula Parrott managed to burn through the huge sums that she garnered from her writing is mysterious to me, but it is unquestionable that she was a tragic homeless pauper at the end. Although Professor Gordon seems to have read everything Parrott wrote (and she composed acres of novels and stories), she did not entice me to read further in Parrott&#39;s work -- even if I could locate these long-out-of-print performances.</div>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Just when I was beginning to think that the Hollywood memory-loss well had run dry, along comes <em>Whirlpool</em> and another variant of the world&#39;s most flexible mental affliction. This time: loss of memory by hypnosis.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>It could have been a good film: Ben Hecht, Otto Preminger, Gene Tierney, Jose Ferrer. But it&#39;s gimmicky and the psychology is vulgar pseudo-Freudianism.&#0160;</p>
<p>Malignant David Korvo (Ferrer) hypnotizes poor Ann Sutton (Tierney) into imagining that she&#39;s committed a murder. Will she recover her memory in time for the true murderer (Korvo himself) to be discovered? Yes, she will. The film turns into something like a police procedural but might better be called a psychoanalytical procedural. Richard Conte plays the Tierney&#39;s husband, and he&#39;s the psychoanalyst, but frankly he&#39;s so surprisingly dense that he&#39;s an embarrassment to his entire profession. The audience is led through a series of melodramatic twists and turns, many requiring wholesale suspension of disbelief, before all turns out well, or pretty well, because poor Ann Sutton (Tierney) is reunited to her doltish husband.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a picture of Iago-like hypnotist Jose Ferrer staring into the deer-in-the-headlights eyes of luminous Gene Tierney.</p>

				<p>At lunch yesterday, a friend of long standing mentioned that the conglomerate that now publishes his American politics textbook has hired a new employee, a vice-president for diversity and inclusion. It&#39;s a well-intended decision, I am sure, but it carries a potential downside. The new v-p has instructed my friend to make some changes to his prose. For example, he will no longer be allowed to report that Lyndon Johnson got his way by &quot;arm-twisting&quot; recalcitrant legislators. The metaphor, though commonly used back in the LBJ era, and still picturesque, is disrespectful to people who suffer from broken or withered arms and is especially discourteous to those who are missing one or both upper limbs. No more arm-twisting, therefore. My friend was also told that it is no longer permissible to say that in the U. S., &quot;the poor tend to vote at lower levels of participation than the general population.&quot; The new v-p insists that the phrase, &quot;the poor&quot; denigrates various people by reducing them to a mere category. &quot;The poor&quot; should therefore be updated and altered to &quot;&#39;people experiencing poverty.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>In our peaceful and prosperous midWestern town, we&#39;ve had a continuing and difficult debate about homelessness. Some while ago, our extremely correct local newspaper ceased to denominate those without regular domiciliary appointments as &quot;the homeless&quot; and began to call them &quot;people experiencing homelessness.&quot;</p>
<p>Such a circumlocution, I believe, though well-intended, misses the mark. The word &quot;homeless&quot; has a poignancy and immediacy that the bloodless bureaucratic euphemism &quot;people experiencing homelessness&quot; lacks. Rather than making homelessness more palatable; it makes it more painful.</p>
<p>Let us thank all the gods in the pantheon that Emma Lazarus did not write, &quot;Give me your people experiencing lassitude, give me your people experiencing poverty.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>I wonder what the v-p for inclusion would say about Jesus, who famously advised that &quot;when thou makest a dinner or a supper, invite not thy friends, nor thy brethren, neither thy kinsmen, nor thy rich neighbors; lest they also bid thee again, and a recompence be made thee. But when thou makest a feast, invite the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind.&quot; Such a forceful series of evocative nouns! But would &quot;the maimed,&quot; &quot;the lame,&quot; &quot;the blind,&quot; overleap the diversity and inclusion barrier and enter a 21st century textbook? I think not.</p>
<p>Although Jesus may have had some good ideas, he was definitely not &quot;woke.&quot;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Another long troubled night, another astonishing dream. This time, I found myself lurking in a primitive cabin inhabited, it seemed, by a big happy family. There were a bunch of kids and a cheerful be-aproned matriarch cooking on an old wood stove what looked to me like a cauldron of soup. Immediately, the scene shifted to a hall or a church basement. There were eight or ten long tables at which a couple of dozen unfamiliar but clearly delineated folks were seated, waiting for their dinner. But first, some singing. An unidentifiable patriotic song, and then, a hymn. I recognized it as a hymn because it included the line, &quot;He died in vain.&quot; Still in the midst of the dream, I said to myself, I have to remember this verse, so I took out pen and paper, and wrote down these words: &quot;he died in vain.&quot; As I did so, a large, bearded, slightly threatening man accused me of &quot;making fun&quot; of the proceedings. He demanded to inspect what I had written. I showed him my writing and explained to him that I thought &quot;he died in vain&quot; was theologically wrong, because according to the usual Christian interpretation, Jesus did not die &quot;in vain.&quot;</p>
<p>End of dream.</p>
<p>In the morning, awake, I did some research to see if &quot;he died in vain&quot; appears in any familiar or remote hymn. Just as I anticipate, no soap. However, I discovered that the most frequently cited use of the phrase comes not from a hymn or from the Bible but from the Gettysburg Address: that &quot;we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain.&quot; Why should my dreamatorium think to quote Abraham Lincoln? But why not, especially since there&#39;s been a lot of Lincoln talk in our household this last while what with Lynn reading a biography and also <em>Team of Rivals</em>. Then I wondered, could the cabin in the first part of the dream be a reference to Kentucky log cabin in which Lincoln was reputedly born. A long shot, but not impossible. Anyway, it&#39;s my dream; I can interpret it as I want.</p>
<p>These mysterious dreams inspire in me an idea for a stunning new technology. I think it would be very helpful if someone would devise a recording device for dreams -- so that they could be saved and then played back on the TV screen. It would be fascinating, I think, to see not only the fragments that one remembers but the whole multi-hour experience laid out there in full color and stereophonic sound. What a boon to mankind! What a convenience for psychoanalysts!</p>
<p>I imagine something like an applewatch with an app for recording a month or so of all-nighters. I know I&#39;d buy one.&#0160;</p>
<p>Impossible, you say?&#0160; Well, did they not laugh at the Wright brothers?</p>
<p>I think I need to present this idea to Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos. Bill Gates. Someone with imagination and a history of achievement. Someone who would know how to monetize so brilliant a conception. I myself am willing to invest my entire income tax refund, however large it turns out to be.</p>

He is rescued and wakes up without a glimmer of memory but is otherwise entirely functional. In his new, raccoon-skin-hat personality he falls in love with shopkeeper Rosalie Eventural (played by 18-year-old Loretta Young). Eventually it comes to light that he has left a wife behind. His memory returns in flash and in a flashback, and things go from bad to worse. Bigamy and all that.</p>
<p><em>The Right of Way</em> has not aged well. It&#39;s a silent film with words. Conrad Nagel, acting in a superseded tradition, is all exaggerated gestures, eye rolls, and heavy lipstick. Loretta Young is so young that she hasn&#39;t even started to look like Loretta Young.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><em>Friendship</em> is definitely an urban novel, but there&#39;s little in it that is particular to Brooklyn. Certainly not to my Brooklyn. It&#39;s a modern, contemporary coming-of-age novel, but, unlike prior-century works, adolescence is delayed or postponed, because the two thirtyish women about whom it revolves would have solved their problems when they were a decade younger if they weren&#39;t so rich and spoiled. It&#39;s healthy that they try to maintain a profound friendship in a world of meaningless temp jobs, bad boyfriends, inchoate ambitions, voluntary poverty, and impulsive and irresponsible sex.&#0160;</p>
<p>It&#39;s an amusing novel, well-plotted but written without much in the way of flair or style. Not weighty. Perhaps I was a little put off by the indulgences of first world difficulties.&#0160;</p>
<p>For one of the characters, Williamsburg was a &quot;hotbed of youth and culture.&quot; For another, it was a &quot;hotbed of European tourists and restaurants with thirty-five dollar entrees.&quot; Wow, Williamsburg is two distinct hotbeds. It&#39;s hard to imagine how Daniel Fuchs would have reacted. Is there another part of the U. S. so fundamentally altered in a couple of generations?</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Some years ago, I wrote about meetings of the E &amp; L Chafetz Family Circle, a biennial gathering of my immigrant grandmother&#39;s family and also of her many cousins, spouses and descendants. I recalled that Youthful Me objected to being dragooned into attending these sessions. I also confessed that I hadn&#39;t a glimmer of understanding of what those meetings meant. Here&#39;s what I wrote:&#0160;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What I didn&#39;t know, and is so obvious to me now, was that I was much more important to them than they were to me. That I was &quot;doing well in school&quot; were words that they dearly wanted to hear. It was for my generation and for me that they had braved the Cossacks, sold the farm, deserted from the Russian army, left backward White Russia&#0160; or the Ukraine behind, endured the miseries of steerage, slept four to a bed for years and half-acclimated themselves to a new and utterly foreign world. For me. They had sacrificed themselves to invest in me. So that I could &quot;do well in school,&quot; get an education, live a better life. I was their emissary to America, to the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is still painful to admit how little I had appreciated these diminutive and ancient but very brave people.</p>
<p>As it happens, I was not the only person to come to the same conclusion.</p>
<p>In <em>A Walker in the City</em> (the city is the Brownsville section of Brooklyn), the distinguished man of letters Alfred Kazin had long ago (1951)made the identical point:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My [immigrant] father and mother worked in a rage to put us above their level; they had married to make us possible. We were the only conceivable end to all their striving; we were their America.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Kazin proceeded to analyze his parents&#39; marriage (he&#39;s a generation older than I so his words are relevant not to my parents, but to my grandparents and those of their Chafetz generation). &quot;Love&quot; became his subject. As I type his words, I think of Joseph and Sonia, Isaiah and Etta:&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our parents, whatever affection might offhandedly be expressed between them, always had the look of being committed to something deeper than mere love. Their marriages were neither happy nor unhappy.; they were arrangements.&#0160;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Powerful words, I think. Their marriages were &quot;arrangements&quot; -- certainly not the touches of sweet harmony.</p>
<p>Not &quot;love.&quot; Love was not for such as his parents (or, to continue the argument, my grandparents).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am perfectly sure that in my parents&#39; mind, love was something exotic and not wholly legitimate, reserved for &quot;educated&quot; people like their children, who were the sole end of their existence. So far as I knew, love was not an element admissible in my parents&#39; experience. Any open talk of it between themselves would have seemed ridiculous. It would have suggested a wicked self-indulgence, a preposterous attention to one&#39;s own feelings.... They looked on themselves only as instruments toward the ideal &quot;American&quot; future that would be lived by their children.&#0160;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have the same sense about my forebears. I never heard any of them use the word &quot;love&quot; and I don&#39;t think it would have been a comprehensible value for them. To fall in love, to be in love, was not their expectation. Their aim was more elemental: simply, to survive.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Moreover, not only did they not recognize romantic love, they also, as far as I can remember, attached little importance to &quot;happiness.&quot;</p>
<p>What an oddity!&#0160; They had left the dark backward of eastern Europe, lands of dearth and pogroms and cholera, and traveled to a country in which the &quot;pursuit of happiness&quot; was inscribed in its founding documents. But their aim, I am absolutely sure, was not to achieve ephemeral happiness; their aim was to put a roof over their heads and put food on the family table.</p>
<p>Life and liberty, yes; the pursuit of happiness -- an utterly alien concept.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been six years since Dr. Metablog (aka Vivian de St. Vrain, aka The Modern Nostradamus) issued a set of predictions. His last collection, from 2016, earned a score of 100% correct, when every single one of his dazzling glimpses into futurity proved to be exactly accurate. An astonishing performance!!&#0160; Which is why The Modern Nostradamus once again won the Lifetime Platinum Award from the International Prophecy Society. Now, after a brief but pregnant retirement, Dr M returns to the prophecy lists and offers the following. Read and be dazzled, fit audience though few. Here&#39;s what&#39;s going to happen!</p>
<p>1)&#0160;&#0160; there will be unusual weather patterns in North America;</p>
<p>2)&#0160; &#0160;there will be a forest fire in one or more western American states;&#0160;</p>
<p>3)&#0160; &#0160;a famous Hollywood actress will sue for divorce; moreover, another (or possibly the same) star will become pregnant; another (or possibly the same) actress will gain or lose a great deal of weight;&#0160;</p>
<p>4)&#0160; &#0160;a politician will be accused of dishonesty;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>5)&#0160; &#0160;there will be either a monsoon, an airplane crash, or a capsized ferry in Asia;</p>
<p>6)&#0160; &#0160;there will be fluctuations in the stock market;</p>
<p>7)&#0160; there will be turmoil in the Middle East;</p>
<p>8)&#0160; a religious leader will be involved in either a financial or a sex scandal.&#0160; Or perhaps both;</p>
<p>9)&#0160; Mitch McConnell will continue to be a colossal asshole.&#0160;</p>
<p>You read it here first. Loyal readers: check back at the end of the year.&#0160; Let&#39;s see whether a senior but world-class professional augur still has enough on the oracle ball to foretell the future one more time.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I grow all weak-in-the-knees sentimental when novelists write about such icons of my childhood as spaldeens and stoopball.</p>
<p>Such delights abound in the first half of Jonathan Lethem&#39;s novel <em>Fortress of</em> <em>Solitude</em>. The novel&#39;s Boerem Hill (newly upscaled from Gowanus) in the 1970s was as rich in such street games as my Flatbush in the 1940s and 50s. Nevertheless, it&#39; can&#39;t be said that these elements of nostalgia redeem Lethem&#39;s huge undisciplined sprawling novel. <em>Fortress of Solitude</em> is crazily inventive, profuse, uncontrolled. I have rarely read a novel by a respectable author so in need of a dictatorial editor. Surely, there&#39;s enough material here for four or five fine novels, each of which would deliver more bounce and impact than this door-stopper. If <em>Fortress of Solitude</em> were a building, it would be called overdecorated; if it were a piece of music or a film, it would be overproduced.&#0160;</p>
<p>Some of my Flatbush cohort like to think that 1950s Brooklyn was a paradise for children. I am not of that opinion. To me, Brooklyn was frequently menacing when it wasn&#39;t just plain boring. The so-called &quot;melting pot&quot; was a cauldron a racial animosities. But it wasn&#39;t all bad -- there were the Dodgers and the camaraderie of the schoolyard. The public schools were crowded and disorderly, but there were great teachers and enthusiastic students. Not so in dystopian <em>Fortress,&#0160;</em>a lord-of-the-flies world of vicious adolescents, incompetent adults, and dysfunctional government. Far worse than I remember; and worse, I think, than the reality.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>The author of <em>Motherless Brooklyn,&#0160;</em>a much finer novel, presents us this time with two motherless youngsters, one white and one black, who through thick and thin maintain a deep abiding friendship. But alas the novel veers into territory that some might call magic realism, but to me was neither realistic nor magical nor even remotely credible no matter how much disbelief I tried to suspend. To read the last embarrassing third of the novel was a sad chore.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think that I have ever read a substantial and ambitious novel that paid so little attention to female characters. Where are the ladies of Boerum Hill?&#0160; Not only are the mothers missing, but the occasional inadvertent woman who wanders unto the page remains an unrealized cipher, a nothing.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>My bedmate informed that last night, in the wee hours, I uttered the strange words, &quot;fear of clowns.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Thanks to her I then remembered doing so (I had forgotten). But why those words? I had no context. Was I in the throes of some sort of clownish nightmare?</p>
<p>Or was it merely a vocabulary exercise?&#0160; Perhaps, in my dream, I searched for the English word for &quot;fear of clowns.&quot; I know there is such a word, and in the morning, I tried to recall it, but without success. I then tried to re-invent a word, but the best I could do was &quot;bozophobia,&quot; which is clearly an undignified and inadequate invention. The existing and correct word, I soon discovered, is <em>coulrophobia,&#0160;</em>a curious modern coinage, dating only to the 1990s. Coulrophobia is, for some mysterious reason, derived from the Greek word for &quot;stilt-walker.&quot; (There&#39;s a modern Greek word for clown, <em>κλόουν</em>, transliterated as klóoun, which I suspect to be a recent borrowing from American English.)&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Coulrophobia can be a serious affliction. According to the Cleveland Clinic, coulrophobia can lead to hyperhidrosis. I myself am neither coulrophobic nor hyperhidrosic.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>The nighttime mystery remains. Why in the world would a semi-normal guy blurt out the words &quot;fear of clowns&quot; at 2 am in the morning. In the long history of human sleeping and dreaming, has such a thing ever happened before? Or will it again?</p>
<p>Truly, I am a fascinating individual. Especially during the night. During the waking hours, not so much.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I was steered to A J Rich&#39;s <em>The Hand that Feeds You</em> by a pair of websites that listed books set in Brooklyn, but I&#39;m sad to say that there&#39;s almost nothing of Brooklyn in the novel -- a considerable disappointment to expectant me. It&#39;s a murder mystery in which various places in and around Brooklyn are mentioned, but in fact the novel takes place in a cliched fictional city in which murders are committed, red herrings are liberally strewn, police are not very bright, and the actual perp is lo and behold revealed in the last chapter.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not a great reader of crime fiction, but I found this one &quot;suspenseful&quot; and &quot;gripping.&quot; Against my better judgment, I swallowed it in one gulp.</p>
<p>I would have liked it even more if I had any affection or even interest in dogs, because in <em>The Hand that Feeds You, </em>the mystery is whether it was Morgan Prager&#39;s or Billie Badgirl-Richbitch&#39;s dogs who ripped out scamming boyfriend Bennett&#39;s throat. The novel might also have been more up my alley if protagonist-narrator Prager had been able to form warmer bonds with humans than with canines. The novel concludes with Prager receiving a chaste peck from her human crush and a sensual roll in the grass with her devoted doggy. Borderline perverse, in my opinion. But what can be expected of a novel in which dangerous &quot;pitbulls&quot; are re-branded as &quot;pitties.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#39;s odd and something of a curiosity that scenes in the novel are located in Rangeley and Oquossoc, the only towns in rural Maine with which I&#39;m even remotely familiar.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I had never heard of L. J. Davis until I searched out his black-comic novel,<em> A Meaningful Life</em>.&#0160; It&#39;s about a young man named Lowell Lake from Boise, Idaho who moves to Brooklyn (as did the author himself) and buys a decrepit mansion in a newly gentrifying section of Bedford-Stuyvesant that was eventually to be dignified and upgraded into Boerum Hill. In his endeavor to repair the building, everything that could go wrong, goes wrong -- and does so in inventive, unpredictable ways.</p>
<p>If it&#39;s a satire, as it&#39;s sometimes called, <em>A Meaningful Life&#0160;</em>is not gentle, Menippean or Horatian, but, rather, far beyond the outer limits of Juvenelian. It&#39;s nasty, and sometimes falls into just plain ugly.&#0160; It reads less like a novel than as an extended turn by a stand-up monologist or comedian. Plot and character are regularly sacrificed to jokes. It has the saddest ending of any novel I can recall reading</p>
<p>Lowell Lake is afraid of &quot;Negroes&quot; and doesn&#39;t much like Puerto Ricans or Jews or gays (whom he calls &quot;fruits,&quot; and &quot;fags&quot;) or old people, and he, and the author, indulge themselves in brutal stereotyping.&#0160;</p>
<p>It&#39;s one of the bleakest books I&#39;ve ever read, and, if you hold your nose, one of the funniest.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Of the ten or so novels that I&#39;ve read since I began this project, <em>Homage to Blenholt</em> is certainly the most regional and the most &quot;Jewish.&quot; It is positively marinated in local color. Even in the first few paragraphs, we encounter the &quot;dirty cobbled streets&quot; of Williamsburg, a milkman&#39;s plodding horse, the subway and the trolley, &quot;gutters,&quot; &quot;seltzer,&quot; and a &quot;stoop.&quot;&#0160; Kids play Johnnie-on-the-pony, punchball, and ringolevio. There&#39;s a pickle man and a hot corn man and a peddler selling imitation pearls. Even when characters are not kvetching outright, they speak in a thick dialect that ladles English words onto Yiddish structures and inflections.&#0160;</p>
<p>The thin but adequate plot concerns young Max Balkan, who yearns for a more glamorous, more powerful life. -- but every reader soon realizes that despite his ambitions he&#39;s doomed to a life of slicing pastrami behind the counter of someone else&#39;s delicatessen. Max admires Blenholt, a corrupt politician whose graft has earned him a shiny suit and an extravagant funeral, -- but in his more romantic moments he dreams of being an Alexander, a Caesar, or, his favorite role model, Christopher Marlowe&#39;s Tamburlaine the Great, the Scythian shepherd who rose from poverty to become the scourge of God and conqueror of Persia.</p>
<p>In the novel&#39;s finest phrase, poor Max&#39;s unromantic mother dismisses her son&#39;s fantasies: &quot;Tamburlaine, Schmamburlaine.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>The bell of nostalgia rang most powerfully with the appearance of a word, well known to me but no doubt unfamiliar to most readers. The word is &quot;Forverts.&quot; It was my task, on Sunday mornings, to buy and deliver a copy of the Jewish Daily Forward to my Yiddish-speaking grandparents, who lived around the corner on Coney Island Avenue. So with 50 cents in hand, I purchased the <em>Times</em> and the <em>Eagle</em> for my parents and for my grandparents, the &quot;Forverts.&quot; Until <em>Homage to Blenholt</em>, I had not seen or heard that strange foreign word in 65 or 70 years. My thanks to Daniel Fuchs.</p>
<p>I should add that, like Balkan, youthful me was dazzled by Tamburlaine. Marlowe -- a young man&#39;s poet -- was my first serious literary love. He offered me romantic escapism of a high order. But I was far too unimaginative to see myself as the conqueror of the known world. For me, it was quite enough to appreciate Marlowe&#39;s exotic landscape and still unsurpassed poetry.&#0160;</p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2022/01/jonathan-lethem.html">Still Another Brooklyn Novel:  Motherless Brooklyn (1999)</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Jonathan Lethem nominally sets <em>Motherless Brooklyn</em> in downtown Brooklyn, but it&#39;s more accurate to say that it takes place in the world of Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler and Elmore Leonard. Or, to be even more precise, in the Land of Noir. It&#39;s a textbook example of superior detective fiction, with all the trappings: a clever gumshoe (who, of course, gets himself bopped on the head), a bad girl, two (count &#39;em two) car chases; a mysterious international crime cartel (on loan from Ian Fleming), a scary assassin, seedy all-night joints, endless stakeouts, even a police detective who&#39;s always just a step behind our guy. It&#39;s so self-consciously, unapologetically derivative -- less plagiary than homage. One character even quotes Sam Spade: &quot;When a man&#39;s partner is killed, he&#39;s supposed to do something about it.&quot; The novel is suspenseful, clever, and occasionally witty.&#0160; It kept me engaged and guessing, so I have no complaints. Of course I couldn&#39;t follow the intricacies of the betrayals and counter-betrayals, but then, I never can.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a Brooklyn novel in the sense that it recognizes the astonishing provinciality of the borough. Lionel Essrog, our detective, thinks of New Jersey and Connecticut as exotic territories. Most of the action is specifically located in downtown Brooklyn, which happens to be a neighborhood that I know rather well. The investigators have their office on Court Street, where I often visited my father&#39;s law offices, first at 125 Court and later on the 13th floor of a tall building at 66 Court (the floor was listed, believe it or not, as 12A, so as not to alarm the triskaidekaphobic). Also mentioned is Joralemon Street, where Dr Irving Pollack, my smooth-faced orthodontist, painfully tightened the metal braces on my teeth every other week for the entire duration of my childhood and youth.</p>
<p><em>Motherless Brooklyn&#0160;</em>seems to be designed for the big screen. In 2017 a version appeared that was written and directed by the rather brilliant actor Edward Norton, who also plays Lionel Essrog. On a whim, we rented and watched the film last night. It&#39;s an engaging film, very handsomely rendered. I watched it, I&#39;m afraid, with a chip on my shoulder, because I came to it with the novel fresh in my mind and resented the liberties the film takes with the novel. In fact, after just a few introductory scenes, Norton left the novel behind. Instead, he crossed it with the Towne-Polanski <em>Chinatown</em>. It&#39;s a mistake, but not a bad one, because if your intention is to imitate a film, you might as well imitate an excellent one. Into the film, Norton imports a series of elements that are utterly foreign to the novel. There&#39;s a dictatorial character who is modeled on Noah Cross, a child of mysterious origin similar to the daughter of Evelyn Mulwray (&quot;she&#39;s my sister and my daughter&quot;) and a contrived plot device that brings us deep into impenetrable Harlem. I&#39;m sorry to say that <em>Motherless Brooklyn,</em> the film, doesn&#39;t escape the gravitational pull of <em>Chinatown</em>.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I read the first fifty pages of Hubert Selby&#39;s <em>Last Exit to Brooklyn&#0160;</em>and then decided, No More. It&#39;s an ugly, brutal book, not one that&#39;s going to offer me either instruction or pleasure. I read two chapters -- the first about the murderous gang wars and the second the transsexual who dies of an overdose of benzedrine. Then I looked up the wiki article and realized that I was about to come face to face with &quot;the novel&#39;s most notorious scene, in which a young prostitute is brutally gang-raped after a night of heavy drinking and is left for dead in a vacant lot.&quot; Sorry, not for me.</p>
<p>Not much about Brooklyn either in this grim novel; no local color, though the story is reputed to be set in Sunset Park or Red Hook.&#0160;</p>
<p>Selby crosses William Burroughs (whom I also can&#39;t read) with Jack Kerouac. Plus innovative grammar, confusing punctuation, and inventive orthography.&#0160;</p>
<p>Not my cup of tea. Sorry, life is too short,</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Daniel Fuchs was known to me only as the writer of the screenplay of <em>Criss-Cross,&#0160;</em>a noir that epitomizes &quot;gritty.&quot;&#0160; Or perhaps grimy. I was not aware that Fuchs&#0160; began his writing career with three Brooklyn novels, the first of which is <em>Summer in Williamsburg.&#0160;</em>It&#39;s a novel that hits home, because Fuchs was born in 1909 and grew up in exactly the same part of Brooklyn, and in the same circumstances, as did my father, who was born there in 1904.&#0160;</p>
<p>The novel comprises a single summer of tenement life and it&#39;s not optimistic or cheerful: &quot;people in tenements lived in a circle without significance, one day the duplicate of the next until the end, which occurred without meaning but accidentally.&quot; Fuchs&#39; Williamsburg is filled to the brim with anomie, petty criminals, violent teen gangs, multiple suicides, harridan wives and unfaithful husbands, ungratified sexual longings, business failures and consequent poverty. Even a fatal fire. In some Brooklyn novels, it is through books and reading that a character stumbles upon a clue to another and better world; not in this one. Fuchs&#39; tenement world is claustrophobic and imprisoning. And yet, Fuchs occasionally offers a touch of poetic language -- sometimes even breaking the novel&#39;s &quot;fourth wall&quot; and intruding a bit of inventive authorial charm into the narrative. Redeeming moments, for the most part, but few and far between.</p>
<p>Other elements that might offer hope to a hopeless world: athletics, either participatory or spectator; religion, not a shred, even though almost all of the characters are Jewish; music; any sort of aesthetic concern. No beauty in Fuchs&#39; Williamsburg.</p>
<p>I wonder how my father managed to survive his many Williamsburg summers without bitterness and with such a cheerful, optimistic demeanor.&#0160; Why was he not soured and jaded by his grim environment?&#0160; Or perhaps Williamsburg had its particular glories while Fuchs had an eye only for nastiness.</p>
<p>Yesterday, while reading this book, my browser took me, by chance, to a travel site that advertised a stay at a 4-star hotel in Williamsburg, &quot;New York&#39;s coolest neighborhood.&quot; Fuchs (and my father) would have been flabbergasted.&#0160; &quot;Coolest neighborhood.&quot;</p>
<p>And so, it appears, the whirligig of time continues its whimsical way.&#0160;</p>

				<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef0282e13db600200b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="IMG_0945" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef0282e13db600200b image-full img-responsive" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef0282e13db600200b-800wi" title="IMG_0945" /></a></p>
<p>Here&#39;s a photograph of a &quot;work of art&quot; that has adorned the lobby of the condominium in which I&#39;ve lived since 2009. It is unsigned -- the creator hasn&#39;t been courageous enough to inscribe his/her name. I think it&#39;s a ridiculously ugly smear, and In the privacy of my aggrieved mind, I attribute it to a painter-of-my-imagination whom I call Fango Nero (Italian for &quot;black mud&quot;). I conceive Fango Nero to be an innovator in the sense that he employs not brush or palette knife but rather a standard Home Depot 6&quot; paint roller. I don&#39;t find fault with Signore Nero for leaving his painting unnamed and unsigned. It&#39;s a wise choice on his part. After all, the set of smudges is a patently disgraceful, reprehensible piece of trash that has no business masquerading as art or being affixed to anyone&#39;s walls, let alone mine. I don&#39;t know what prompted the architects or the contractors of this building to purchase this thing and hang it in my lobby. Perhaps it was bequeathed to them, or possibly they were supporting a needy uncle.</p>
<p>So many accomplished artists in this world and I must be afflicted with these splotches! What a waste of space!</p>
<p>That&#39;s what used to think, these last twelve years --&#0160; until I had a sudden epiphany.&#0160;</p>
<p>This painting is not the work of my imaginary painter Fango Nero, or any human being. No, not at all. It&#39;s got to be the production of a talented elephant.</p>
<p>Some of my readers will have seen videos of elephants painting. If the professor of art or the mahout offers an artistically-inclined elephant paint and brush, by golly, he or she will grasp the brush handle with the ever-useful trunk and create you something in the abstract impressionist line.</p>
<p>Here is a genuine pachydermal production.&#0160; (I&#39;m not aware of the name of the particular artisit.)</p>

<p>It&#39;s quite a bit more interesting than my black and white paint roller job, is it not? I like the cheerful interplay of the two well-chosen colors and the way that the long pink lines, almost imprisoned by the green, suggest both freedom and delight. A superior production! It would be a greater pleasure by far to encounter this canvas several times a day than the muddy black one that ambushes me every time I pass through the lobby.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>The bottom line: Fango bad, Dumbo good.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Paula Fox&#39;s <em>Desperate Characters </em>feels to me less like a novel than a short story, or perhaps a set of short stories sutured together. It&#39;s comprised of a series of incidents that concern a married couple and like many fictions in the short story genre, resists closure or resolution. Though it&#39;s a miniature of a novel, it&#39;s still a gem.</p>
<p>The principal characters, Otto and Sophie, come to the end of the story just about where they started -- not miserable but not happy either. They are immigrants to an incompletely gentrified, downtown Brooklyn neighborhood. Their house -- all pocket doors, cedar floors, highly polished Victorian furniture even a Meissen cat dish -- as well as the houses of their neighbors are vulnerable to violation. Otto and Sophie, and their friends, are attacked by the sort of intrusions that are familiar from horror films -- the bite of a stray cat, a threatening phone call, a stone thrown through a window, unwanted visitors, vicious inexplicable vandalism, mysterious goings-on in the house next door. These attacks on the home are intermittent but unending; in fact, the last image in the book is of a self-inflicted wound -- an interior wall splotched and stained by the black ink of a thrown inkwell. Stasis, not progress.</p>
<p>Should I have been surprised that the Brooklyn novels that I have now read are so concerned with the acquisition, improvement, integrity, and preservation of the homestead?</p>
<p>To tell truth, I have been a bit startled -- but I should not have been. Brooklyn has always been the most mutable and fluid of cities. Outsiders -- Irish, Italians and Jews in my part of Flatbush, as well as southern Blacks searching for the warmth of other suns, West Indians, Russians, Hispanics from central and south Americas, Asians of all varieties, and nowadays midWesterners -- arrive and alter the neighborhood. For the worse, according to the prior inhabitants, and for the better, according to the new arrivals. It&#39;s a repeated and perpetual dance -- and certainly one that was a feature of my own family history.</p>
<p>My immigrant grandparents never had the resources even to imagine the purchase of a home. They were renters of a cold-water sixth-floor walkup in Williamsburg. Nor had they owned property in the old country, where they were even poorer. I imagine that when my parents purchased the house in which I was raised (in 1936, for $4500) they were the first in my ancestry dating back to the spear and atalatl eons ever to own a piece of real estate.&#0160;</p>
<p>Re-reading these Brooklyn books has reminded me how important that home on East 9 Street in heart of&#0160; Flatbush was to my parents. And why my father, in his last years, solitary, crippled by arthritis, but intransigent refused to leave it though it would have been much more sensible and convenient to live elsewhere. He was determined to die in his own precious home, and he did so.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a picture of 539 East 9 Street, a big old undistinguished Victorian, taken sometime around the 1939, the year of my birth. The second and third stories were rented; we lived on the ground floor. The house, long since demolished, lives on in my memory.&#0160;</p>
<p>Especially in my nightmares, where at least once a month, I defend myself against the savage bows and arrows, the cavalry rifles, and wild dogs that attack the property.&#0160; And wake up in a sweaty terror.</p>
