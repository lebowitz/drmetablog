		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Well, one might ask, how goes the reading-Brooklyn-novels project?&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been taken by surprise. Solely by the luck of the draw, just because the books were available at the public library, and without planning or intention on my part, my first three novels all had the same focus: coming-of-age-as-a-girl-in-Brooklyn. First,<em> A Tree Grows in Brooklyn</em> (TGB) about a Irish-German girl in the period around WWI, then <em>Another Brooklyn&#0160;</em>(AB) about a Black or African-American girl in 1970s Bushwick, and yesterday, <em>Brown Girl, Brownstones</em> (BG,B) by Paule Marshall, written in 1959 but neglected and then rediscovered during the 1970s. BG,B focuses on young Selina Boyce, daughter of immigrants from Barbados, who was raised in a West Indian neighborhood somewhere between Fulton Avenue and Crown Heights.</p>
<p>The three novels, and their three heroines, share common concerns. In all three, an intelligent young girl, a reader, tries to achieve selfhood in a challenging environment. The young girls come from families that are led by strong mothers and are compromised by weak, failing fathers. Religions (Catholicism in TGB, Nation of Islam in AB, and a dictatorial new religion led by &quot;Father Peace,&quot; whom I take to be Father Divine, in BG,B) are unhelpful and damaging.</p>
<p>Today&#39;s novel,&#0160;<em>Brown Girl, Brownstones </em>is the most detailed, informative, and moving of the trio. It&#39;s a substantial, rich, highly-detailed, and I would say old-fashioned novel about self-discovery. It used to be said that &quot;every modern writer&#39;s first novel should be titled &quot;my horrible adolescence.&#39;&quot; But BG,B is more complicated than the stereotype. It&#39;s an &quot;immigration novel&quot; about the conflicts between the foreign-born parents and the Brooklyn-born daughter. It&#39;s also a story of regional interest, very strong in depicting the peculiarities of Brooklyn culture.</p>
<p>Barbadian-Americans are depicted as an entrepreneurial class, upwardly mobile, anxious to get ahead. The first step is to acquire a brownstone and become a landlord rather than a tenant. And yet young Selina rejects her aspiring mother, whom she sees as hopelessly materialistic. She fears the success of a move to the boring suburbs -- a familiar 1950s theme.</p>
<p>BG,B is a novel about race, and, in my opinion, hits its stride in the last few chapters when Paule Marshall analyzes bigotry. There are a few pages that either anticipate or follow the powerful critiques of James Baldwin and Frantz Fanon. And Richard Wright. I suspect that it&#39;s such pages that helped bring deserved attention to <em>Brown Girl, Brownstones</em>.&#0160;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I read, first with irritation but eventually with appreciation, <em>Another Brooklyn</em>, by Jacqueline Woodson. If I had purchased the book, rather than borrowing it from the Boulder Public, I&#39;d be peeved, because it&#39;s more of a novella or long short story than a fully-grown novel. Only 165 pages of minibook size(8&quot; x 5&quot;), with spacious margins, large font, and double or triple spacing between frequent one-sentence &quot;paragraphs.&quot; The whole could be compressed into 30 normal book size pages. I felt cheated because I want my words worth. But quality should not be measured by quantity, or Mrs. Trollope would be twenty times as good a writer as Jane Austen. Jacqueline Woodson is apparently a very famous novelist, but you wouldn&#39;t know it by me, for I had never heard of her, so out-of-date I am. It&#39;s a poetic, I think, novel, about &quot;growing up girl in Brooklyn&quot; (white flight Bushwick to be precise) in the 1970s. It&#39;s not dense with detail, so each incident has to do a lot of work. It concerns four young girls, each frustrated by the surroundings. The narrator says, &quot;Brooklyn felt like a stone in my throat,&quot; but I don&#39;t think the novel makes good on that stuck-in-the-craw assertion. It&#39;s not, in my opinion, a regional novel; it&#39;s a coming of age story with a perennial theme: how do we get out of this constricting space: &quot;Everywhere we looked, we saw people trying to dream themselves out. As though there was something other than this place. As though there was another Brooklyn.&quot;</p>
<p>A paragraph that resonated with me, for as an adolescent I myself know only one thing: &quot;I need to get out of here.&quot;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>My new reading project: novels set in Brooklyn. There are, I&#39;ve already discovered, tons of them. I wonder how long I will last at this endeavor. Will it be a sterile or a fruitful exercise?</p>
<p>How is it that I never read, until this very week, <em>A Tree Grows in Brookly</em>n?&#0160; It&#39;s certainly the best known novel with the noun &quot;Brooklyn&quot; in its title. I&#39;ve known about it all my life and just never got around to looking at a single page. Did my parents, always tentative about sex, warn me off because the novel has a few frank passages. Or was it anti-Brooklyn snobbery?&#0160; As a young person, I wanted to read about far off places -- Pitcairn Island, nomadic central Asia, and the Africa of Rider Haggard, -- certainly not familiar grimy Brooklyn. At the McDonald Avenue branch of the public library, there were many well-worn copies of of <em>A Tree Grows in Brooklyn </em>sitting on the shelf -- which I ignored and, if I remember correctly, disdained.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>What did I miss?&#0160; <em>Tree</em> is not much in the way of a fiction. There&#39;s nothing like a plot, only a series of loosely-related episodes, and except for the central figure, not much character development. It&#39;s a barely-disguised autobiography. Francie Nolan, tracked from birth through her escape to, believe it or not, Michigan!!, comes from a grindingly poor family (&quot;food insecure&quot; before the term was invented). Much of the first few hundred pages is the barebones account of the struggle for sustenance (and lodging). There is so much emphasis on overcoming lack that <em>Tree</em> almost seems to fetishize or celebrate poverty.&#0160;</p>
<p>So much scrabbling for the next meal is hard to bear, painful to read. It&#39;s especially painful for me, because Betty Smith, born in 1896 in Williamsburg, preceded my father, also a native of Williamsburg (born in 1904) by only a few years. He came from an immigrant family as poor as poor can be, and some of the stories that he told me about the impoverishment of his youth echo and sometimes exceed Smith&#39;s. The essence, therefore, of this &quot;novel,&quot; is familiar to me, perhaps entirely too familiar.</p>
<p>One blot upon the novel is its casual bigotry. Irish characters sometimes go to &quot;Jewtown&quot; for clothes or food. Jewish characters are gross stereotypes. But what can be expected from a popular novel of the 1940s, when the radio offered us, day after day,&#0160; large doses of <em>Amos and Andy, Life with Luigi, The Goldbergs.&#0160;</em>How we guffawed at ethnic &quot;humor&quot; in those unenlightened days!&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Nor was I happy about the novel&#39;s Brooklyn chauvinism. For example:&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">&quot;&quot;There&#39;s no other place like it,&quot; Francie said.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">&quot;Like what?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">&quot;Brooklyn. It&#39;s a magic city.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">&quot;It&#39;s just like any other place.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">&quot;It isn&#39;t. It&#39;s mysterious here in Brooklyn. It&#39;s like -- yes -- a dream. The houses and streets don&#39;t seem real. Neither do the people.&quot;</span></p>
<p>I wish the novel offered some corroboration for the claim of Brooklyn&#39;s magic and mystery. If it was there, I didn&#39;t find it in this grim novel, nor at the corner of Newkirk and Coney Island Avenues where I first came to awareness.</p>
<p>The &quot;tree that grows in Brooklyn&quot; is the so-called &#39;tree of heaven,&quot; <em>ailanthus altissima. </em>Smith has chosen it as a symbol of resilience, for the tree of heaven can thrive under the most inauspicious circumstances. I, for one, can remember playing on the roof of one of those six story apartment houses so common in our neighborhood, and noticing an ailanthus growing right out of the asphalt. I was astonished. But I wish that Betty Smith had chosen a different tree to invest with meaning, because the ailanthus is, frankly, a &quot;trash tree.&quot;&#0160; It&#39;s generally considered a noxious weed, an invasive species. It grows rapidly but is short-lived. Its wood is soft and useless. It suckers vigorously and eternally, pours forth strong alleopathic chemicals upon its neighbors, invades subterranean sewers and pipes, is extremely fecund, and stinks. It is known to gardeners and foresters not as the &quot;tree of heaven&quot; but as the &quot;tree of hell.&quot; It&#39;s not a tree that often finds itself celebrated in fiction. Nor in pastoral. Brooklyn, my Brooklyn, was a city of magnificent oaks, maples, sycamores and elms. My people, my fellow Brooklynites, deserve a more distinguished avatar than the tree of of so-called heaven.</p>
<p>Some will remember that T. S. Eliot once referred to the tree that grows in Brooklyn as the &quot;rank ailanthus.&quot;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I decided to keep a record of the books that I read this past 2021. It&#39;s in roughly chronological order, starting just about a year ago. It&#39;s an eclectic bunch; after years of being forced to be a specialist I&#39;ve reverted to my natural dilettantism. I&#39;ve probably forgotten some books, both my record-keeping and my memory not so good as before.</p>

				<p><img alt="Thomas Massie’s Christmas family photo. ‘The guy’s abominable but that’s what’s happening to the Republican party,’ said one critic." class="dcr-1989ovb" height="84" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10a72ec57e052d517d561ba5e545e7708ec17794/0_117_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=465&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=ec8e499616f425deef1d1f3eb0e3d3bd" width="140" /></p>
<p>Here&#39;s a Christmas-themed picture posted by United States Representative Thomas Massie of Kentucky. Note the cheerfully decorated tree behind them. Note also that each member of the shit-eating-grin faced members of the Massie family is sporting a military weapon. Massie himself, as befits the father of such a family, carries the piece of artillery that is by far the most threatening. He&#39;s so proud.</p>
<p>I must be out of the military-Kentucky loop, because when my friends send me Christmas cards, they will characteristically include a message such as &quot;peace on Earth, good will toward men, or perhaps something about &quot;joy&quot; or &quot;blessings.&quot; Massie&#39;s card says, &quot;Please Santa, send ammo,&quot; which is not, I believe, a traditional holiday greeting.</p>
<p>Massie&#39;s card is deliberately provocative. It&#39;s designed to piss off the libs. In your face, pinkos! But it&#39;s so blasphemous and misjudged that it might also offend mainline Christians. Goodness gracious, I hope so. Though frankly, I haven&#39;t heard much of an outcry from the pulpits.</p>
<p>But now it has come to pass that it&#39;s not just blue-staters that are offended. Massie has gone and pissed off the Lord himself -- who has retaliated with a series of tornadoes which have swept through Massie&#39;s home state. Can there be any doubt, any possible probable shadow of doubt, that the Ancient of Days has responded to the Massie family Christmas card with lightning and thunder? Vengeance is mine, I shall repay, saith the Lord. It&#39;s obvious -- although I am shocked to observe that I have not yet heard any megachurch preacher draw the undeniable conclusion. I&#39;m waiting.&#0160;</p>
<p>When I first set astonished eyes on the card, I guessed that Massie, though an important office holder, must be what I have heard called in Vermont a &quot;local yokel.&quot; Trash. A rube. An exterminator or mortician or gun-toting bar owner who lucked into Congress because no more respectable person chose to run. Because what person of intelligence, sensitivity, experience, or a modicum of education honors the spirit of Christmas with a display of assault weaponry?&#0160; Imagine my surprise when I looked up Massie and discovered that he has a raft of degrees and extraordinary prizes from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He&#39;s clearly brilliant (in a MIT kind of way). But even if he were a pure pocket-calculator I-don&#39;t-give-a-shit-about-anyone-but-myself libertarian nerds, shouldn&#39;t he have been exposed, in New England, to enough human beings of all sorts to recognize that his Christmas greeting is monumentally offensive not only to his fellows and (as we have seen) to the Lord of Hosts Himself?&#0160;</p>
<p>Or perhaps he knows that our tearful country is so riven that an irreligious display of such a sort will amuse and motivate his allies and torment his opposition. And will strike gold with political donors.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I was in the midst of the usual noir &quot;can&#39;t-find-my-way&quot; dream when all at once, without warning, the scene and the genre changed. Suddenly I was in technicolor John Ford territory, holding on for dear life to the cow-catcher of an 1880s railroad engine. Three central-casting bad guys -- all whiskers and black hats --were shooting at me with their pistols. Familiar with what&#39;s expected such films, I responded by drawing my own Colt 45-- and plugged two of them. But the third kept coming, zombie-style, even though I nailed him several times. I was scared.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Apparently I was rattling around, because just as I decided that I&#39;d better shoot him between the eyes and be done with it, my faithful bedmate woke me up.&#0160; End of dream; what a relief.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>I must be watching too many Westerns.</p>
<p>It&#39;s fascinating that the material of this dream is not drawn from the events of my &quot;real life,&quot; but rather from fiction (in this case, the movies). Have I incorporated such fictions into the deepest layers of my unconscious, from which dreams are supposedly drawn?&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>On the other hand, my watching and absorbing a film is a &quot;real life&quot; event.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>I can&#39;t remember any film in which a character clings to the cow-catcher. Did I invent such an event?&#0160; Or just extrapolate it from various western films?</p>
<p>I should mention that I experienced the dream not in ordinary colors but in the brilliant artificial color of old-fashioned garish Technicolor.</p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2021/12/spatchcock.html">Words of my Life: Spatchcock</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I first heard the word &quot;spatchcock&quot; at a Thanksgiving celebration some four or five years ago. The turkey, I was told, had been &quot;spatchcocked.&quot; To be absolutely honest, I thought someone was pulling my leg. To my pure and undefiled ears, the word &quot;spatchcock&quot; sounded more than a little obscene. Certainly not something that a civilized person would do to a turkey. Or even to a fellow human being. I admit that I was puzzled: what sort of perverse activity is implied by &quot;spatchcock.&quot; And just who would be the spatchcocker and who the spatchcockee?</p>
<p>But further investigation revealed that &quot;spatchcock&quot; is not a dirty joke nor even a slangy neologism. The word has an eighteenth-century origin and it&#39;s not sexual but culinary: &quot;to cut poultry along the spine and spread the halves apart for more even cooking when grilled.&quot; Moreover, the word &quot;spatchcock,&quot; believe it or not, has a sibling of its own: &quot;spitchcock&quot;: &quot;to split an eel along the back and then broil it.&quot; So spatchcock and spitchcock, yet as far as I know, no &quot;spotchcock&quot; or &quot;sputchcock&quot;-- but why not?&#0160; Lots of other land and sea beasts out there to de-spine and roast over an open fire. Spatchcocking, the process, probably dates back to the neolithic, after the taming of fire and long before anyone thought to call it by such a silly name.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>Etymology?&#0160; Though there are theories, I&#39;m going to stick with &quot;origin unknown.&quot; The common answer is that the word is <span class="ILfuVd"><span class="hgKElc">&quot;shorthand&#0160; for &#39;dispatching the cock.&#39;&quot; An undocumented, out-of-left-field guess, in my opinion. If I were to propose a theory, I would </span></span><span class="ILfuVd"><span class="hgKElc">say that the &quot;cock&quot; must be a version of&#0160; &quot;cook.&quot; I&#39;m not prepared to venture a guess about the spatch. A mystery, unrecoverable. Perhaps a humorous coinage?</span></span></p>
<p><span class="ILfuVd"><span class="hgKElc">I&#39;d hypothesize that &quot;cock&quot; might be related to the second part of common surnames such as Hancock, Adcock, Babcock, Hitchcock or Wilcox. Some say that the cock in these names is a hypocoristic suffix &quot;applied to a young lad who strutted proudly like a cock.&quot; I&#39;m skeptical. More credible, once again, is &quot;cook.&quot; Hancock is Johan the cook, Adcock is Adam the cook, Hitchcock is Richard (Rich, Hich) the cook, and so on.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="ILfuVd"><span class="hgKElc">The ever-unpredictable Urban Dictionary provides another meaning for &quot;spatchcock&quot;: &quot;w</span></span>hen you intentionally rub your backpack on a nearby stranger&#39;s genitals in an effort to sexually arouse them.&quot; What can I say?&#0160; Only that I&#39;ve lived a long life and have never given a single thought to the erotic potential of the backpack. Nor have I ever been spatchcocked either in the traditional culinary nor the speculative contemporary sexual sense of the word (thanks be to all the gods in the pantheon!)</p>

<p>We watched the 1969 western, <em>Rio Bravo</em>, and were crushed with disappointment. How could a film with such famous actors, directed by Howard Hawks (<em>Red River</em> 1948), amount to such piffle?&#0160; We could not restrain ourselves from jeering at its flagrant, grotesque failings. A thin, cliched plot, pieced out with obvious meaningless padding. Incoherent, contradictory notions and &quot;themes.&quot; An unconscionable reveling in mass slaughter -- the bodies of Nathan Burdette&#39;s gang falling as thickly as the leaves in Vallombrosa. We adjudicated what seemed like a contest: who is a worse actor, Dean Martin or Ricky Nelson?&#0160; (Martin plays a drunken former gunfighter (named Dude!!) whose shaky hands can only be stilled when the Mexican band plays his favorite tune!!! Honest to goodness!!) Nelson is a ridiculously young hotshot gunslinger who would have been better off staying home drinking his afternoon milk and cookies under the supervision of Ozzie and Harriet.&#0160;</p>
<p>We hooted, I&#39;m sorry to say, when impassive reluctant John Wayne kissed Angie Dickinson with all the passion of a man sucking on moldy lemons. We were offended by the racist caricatures of the Mexican innkeepers. And we guffawed when the film allowed both Dean Martin and Ricky Nelson to burst into song -- utterly violating their screen characters but perhaps throwing a sorry bone to the ticket-buying audience. (Allow me to confess that we fast-forwarded through the musical interlude.) The irrelevant crooning lost the film any remaining pretense or shred of integrity.</p>
<p>In short, here was a film that had no reason for being, or so we thought. A travesty, a mere catchpenny.</p>
<p>Baffled, we turned to the internet for the story. Because there had to be a story.&#0160;</p>
<p>And now comes the surprise. <em>Rio Bravo</em> was the second highest ranking western in the 2012 <em>Sight and Sound</em> critics&#39; poll. Robin Wood, a generally trustworthy critic and the man who wrote the book on Howard Hawks, rated it as his <em>top film of all time.</em> What&#39;s going on here? We though the film was ludicrous and embarrassing; others think very differently. Are we completely out of touch? Are we nuts, intolerant. Has our taste been vitiated by age and mental decay? Are there beauties hidden the film that are sufficiently subtle that our grosser intellects could not detect them?&#0160; Or does this would-be emperor of a film lack clothes and the critics and journals and the tomatoes are all blinded and deceived.</p>
<p>And now comes some more internet info, which may or may not explain the opposing views of us and them.&#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;The film was made as a response to <em>High Noon,&quot;&#0160;</em>says Wikipedia. Why? Because <em>High Noon</em> was thought to be a leftist movie, an allegory for Hollywood blacklisting, as well as a critique of McCarthyism. John Wayne called <em>High Noon</em> &quot;un-American.&quot; (I&#39;ve always thought of it as quintessentially American;&#0160; what could possibly be more American than a Quaker&#39;s turn to violence, as when Amy Kane picks us a rifle and shoots one of Frank MIller&#39;s kin. And especially when that turn to violence is portrayed as a step toward a higher morality.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-michael_munn_13-0"></sup></p>
<p>I&#39;m wondering whether the folks who praise <em>Rio Bravo&#0160;</em>like it not for aesthetic but for political reasons. I&#39;m suspicious.</p>
<p>Next step: get my hands on Robin Wood&#39;s book on Howard Hawks. Stay tuned, Metablogians.</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Max had a long love affair with New Orleans, and he loved to initiate his friends into the city&#39;s splendors and secrets. We were beneficiaries of his generosity. It was because of &quot;mad Max&quot; that we enjoyed a series of winter visits to the crescent city. He was a splendid enthusiastic guide as well as a great character, with a touch of Falstaff about him: charm, flaws, girth.</p>
<p>For me, it was a late-onset friendship, but Lynn had known Max from the 60s, from her Baltimore days, when Max was a doctoral student in biology at Hopkins. The two of them reconnected five years ago when Max invited Lynn (and me) to stay for a month in an apartment in his rental house in the Garden District. How could we decline such an offer? His house, alas, turned out to be virtually uninhabitable, with holes in the walls and floors that let in the light, the wind and rain, and the critters. There was a pungent smell of decay and a tilted bathroom that seemed about to plunge deep into the earth. Lynn was not fazed: &quot;I lived in Africa.&quot;&#0160; Max was only mildly apologetic. We made do.</p>
<p>In subsequent trips to New Orleans we took the precaution of renting a BNB.</p>
<p>But we often visited Max at his place in an apartment house on St. Charles. Max owned two adjacent apartments. He connected them by busting through the wallboard with a sledge hammer. Two kitchens, therefore, both, shall we say, far from immaculate.</p>
<p>A serious and knowledgeable cinephile, Max sponsored a monthly film series in his home. His screen had to be angled sharply to find a place amidst the clutter, distributed among which was an exquisite collection of contemporary American pottery. (Max was a widower; his sometime ladyfriend was a very accomplished potter).&#0160;</p>
<p>Max squired us about town, introducing us to both famous and out-of-the-way restaurants. He was quite a sight, squeezing his 5&#39; 4&quot; and 300 pound frame into a small sports car. He loved Adolfo&#39;s, right across the street from Snug, because the food was excellent and the portions were enormous.</p>
<p>As much as he loved his dinner, he also loved the south Louisiana vegetation; a walk with Max was a learned lecture on the local plant life.</p>
<p>Would we have discovered either Angelo Brocato&#39;s or the Creole Creamery without his guidance?&#0160;</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know what eventually killed him last August.&#0160; It could have been any one of his many ailments; he was not healthy and was often in pain. We&#39;ll miss him.</p>
<p>Max and I shared a birthday; he was exactly one year older than I. So his death is another <em>memento mori. </em>As if I needed another reminder.</p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2021/10/hands-evolution.html">In Praise of Hands</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>A few weeks ago, I found myself absentmindedly working in the perennial garden. I had wandered nearby and noted some weeds that needed emergency extirpation. I had therefore arrived without my usual trine of implements -- the dandelion puller, the hand shovel, and the Felco #2. Too lazy to fetch them, I began to tend to the plants toollessly and at the same time to muse upon effectiveness of hands alone. (Weeding often leads to musing, as every weeder knows.)&#0160; Is it not the case that the best tool of all is the human hand?&#0160; Because my garden soil is so friable, I was able to dig into the earth with my unaided index finger, grasp the roots of weeds and pull them. I wondered how the hand had come to so sensitive to small changes in soil temperature or soil moisture. Sensitive also, to the texture of things, so that I could identify the roots of witch grass, and remove them, while leaving untouched the very similar but different roots of the day lilies. For no good reason, my wayward mind wandered to the Houyhnhnms whom Gulliver outrageously claimed could grasp a needle between fetlock and pastern in order to sew garments. Amusing but impossible. The hooves of horses are wonderfully evolved for galloping but not for tatting or crocheting. Besides, why would a horse want to darn a sock?&#0160;</p>
<p>Our hands are superior implements&#0160; There&#39;s not another animal on the planet that can tie its own shoelaces.&#0160;</p>
<p>I&#39;ve just read a fascinating book by paleontologist Madelaine Bohme called<em> Ancient Bones</em>. Bohme is concerned to argue that the &quot;out of Africa&quot; hypothesis needs modification. I am not knowledgeable enough to accept or deny her thesis, but I much appreciate her effort to bring me up to date about the evolution of our species, which is much more complicated -- infinitely more complicated -- than the story we were told just a generation ago.</p>
<p>Bohme includes a couple of speculative pages about the evolution of the hand. First came bipedalism, freeing the hands for a variety of new tasks. Bohme thinks that the development of stone tools and the development of hands went, so to speak, hand in hand. The need to hold the tool meant that the hand evolved to hold it properly -- with an opposable thumb of course. More sensitive fingers conferred an evolutionary advantage. More information from the fingers caused the somatosensory cortex, which controls the hands, to enlarge and process more sensations.</p>
<p>So now we can play the piano, thread a needle, throw a ball, type a letter, weed a garden, and perform a thousand other tasks that even chimpanzees, who apparently do not have great sensory input from their fingers, cannot do.</p>
<p>Bohme does not discuss the role of hands in human communication, either everyday or erotic.&#0160; A topic for another book, perhaps.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Among my circle of friends, it is a shameful thing to be called &quot;house proud.&quot; It&#39;s a term to be avoided, even shunned. It&#39;s competitive and flaunts the wrong values. Conspicuous consumption. Vanity. &quot;I own a bigger house than you, and therefore I&#39;m a better person than you.&quot;&#0160; &quot;House pride&quot; is a very badddd feeling of the human heart. So therefore I was astonished when I opened a new edition of <em>Luxury Home Magazine</em> (which should be called <em>Conspicuous Consumption Quarterly</em>) to discover that in this publication shameless vanity is now not implied, hinted at, or disguised, but flaunted. The magazine&#39;s reiterated theme: &quot;Make your friends envy your trophy home.&quot; It says so in so many words!&#0160; Gasp!</p>
<p>And indeed, from the pictures and descriptions of these homes, it&#39;s clear that the advertised trophies are not designed o live in, but rather to let their owners wow their friends and demonstrate how wealthy (and wasteful) they can be.</p>
<p>Does anyone actually require a 15,000 square feet house with three kitchens, even if one of them is outdoors. &quot;Main kitchen boasts two islands, multiple refrigerators, freezers and sinks.&quot; And a wine cooler (in addition to the wine cellar). &quot;Five beds, eight baths, seven fireplaces?&quot; &quot;Massive vaulted ceilings with a towering three sided stone chimney?&quot; Also, a &quot;luxurious soaking tub, double-headed shower, and makeup vanity?&quot; Two &quot;indoor-outdoor pools?&quot; An elevator from the basement to the widow&#39;s walk?&#0160; &quot;Large tiered media room.&quot; Game room. Basketball court. A putting green. Five oversized garages with 20 foot windows?&#0160;</p>
<p>Also, &quot;breathability,&quot; whatever that is.</p>
<p>I&#39;m embarrassed that I&#39;m on the Luxury Homes&#39; mailing list and I&#39;m embarrassed, once again, to be a member of the species<em> homo sapiens</em>.</p>
<p>My advice to readers whose mouths water when they yearn for a trophy home: &quot;enough is as good as a feast.&quot;</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Disease, dying and death, I&#39;m afraid. During the last month or so, the cohort of friends with whom I&#39;ve gone through life has been suffering major losses. BD, a friend of more than forty years standing, has just breathed his last. AM, whom I know from the PS 217 schoolyard, is suffering from cancer of the esophagus, now described as terminal. M has ALS and can no longer move or speak. LW suffered a bad stroke some while ago and is now in &quot;assisted living.&quot; JP has gone from robust to frail in a few months and has been moved to a &quot;memory care&quot; unit. And others.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve taken to reading the obits. Every week the name of a former colleague or a friend of a friend shows up. Inevitable, you say. But distressing nevertheless.</p>
<p>I&#39;m healthy, but I&#39;m old, long past my expiration date. I know that one of these days it will be my turn with the doctors and the hospitals. Too bad, because after some difficult years, I&#39;m enjoying life to the full once again.</p>
<p>My grandmother, then in her upper 80s, said to youthful me, &quot;I don&#39;t like being old. But what are my choices?&quot;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<div class="entry-content">
<div class="entry-body">
<p>I grew up in a baseball-saturated world. The radio voices of Red Barber and Connie Desmond were the water in which I and my family and my neighbors swum. It was therefore natural that I early absorbed the vocabulary of baseball and that many words carried baseball meaning to me long before I recognized their alternative and larger existence.</p>
<p>For example, as a boy, I encountered the word &quot;mound.&quot; It signified, and signified only, a pitcher&#39;s mound -- the ten inches of sand and clay from which a pitcher throws a ball. I had no idea that mounds could exist in nature or indeed, could exist anywhere outside of a stadium, there being no mounds on Coney Island Avenue, or, at least, none that I recognized as such.</p>
<p>And then there was the word &quot;pitcher.&quot; If someone had said to me, in the 1940s, that &quot;little pitchers had big ears,&quot; I might have thought of Preacher Roe, but I would have had no idea that there was such an object as a pitcher for water or other liquid. A pitcher was not jug, ewer, or crock -- it was a man standing on a rubber fooling a batter with a slow curve.</p>
<p>Standing on a &quot;rubber?&quot; Yet another word that had a specific baseball meaning, years before it became an eraser or a galosh or a condom.</p>
<p>Similarly, a &quot;streak&quot; was not a gash of color until many years after it was a winning streak or a losing streak or batting streak. A &quot;dugout&quot; was not a canoe, not in my corner of the universe.&#0160; Nor was a &quot;rally&quot; a political meeting or protest. A rally would never have led to a &quot;strike&quot; -- a word which I knew only as one of the allotted three. &quot;Battery?&quot; A team of pitcher and catcher, not something of military or electrical storage interest.</p>
<p>And then there were the plethora, the fountain of lovely words peculiar to baseball, like &quot;shortstop&quot; and &quot;blooper.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>Inning was exclusively a baseballism. Not so &quot;outing&quot; which was in my childhood a pitcher&#39;s stint on the mound, and which only later became a picnic (or, even later, an involuntary revelation of someone&#39;s sexual inclinations).&#0160;</p>
<p>October 24:&#0160; How could I fail to include &quot;pennant.&quot; When did I learn that a pennant was a kind of triangular flag?&#0160; Not in the 1940s (or even 50s).</p>

				<p>I read a story in an &quot;art of gardening&quot; book many years ago that I will repeat here. A famous Japanese gardener, a &quot;national treasure,&quot; was asked, &quot;What&#39;s the secret of making a garden as beautiful as yours?&quot; He didn&#39;t answer in words but lifted his arms and made a shearing or lopping motion.&#0160;</p>
<p>Many years ago, I asked Roy Huse, who had a most wonderful vegetable garden at the foot of South Road how he did it.&#0160; He said, and I quote verbatim, &quot;you really got to put the shit to it.&quot;</p>
<p>And from my father: &quot;it&#39;s all about preparing the bed before you plant.&quot;</p>
<p>So, don&#39;t skimp on getting the bed ready, add plenty of manure, and be ruthless about cutting things out.</p>
<p>And o yes, you&#39;ll need sun and water.</p>

				<p>I learned what was wrong and bad in the P S 217 schoolyard. At our corner of the world, where Coney Island Avenue crossed Newkirk, the guy at the bottom of the moral barrel was the &quot;sore loser.&quot; He was the guy who, when he missed an easy layup, always claimed, against the evidence, that he had been fouled. And when he lost a game, he picked up his basketball and took it home -- in order to prevent the rest of us from continuing to play. He was always whining, always complaining, always wronged. An unpleasant member of the community, disliked by most, hated by some, loathed by a few. A disruptive presence, only tolerated because he was rich enough to own the basketball or the baseball bat.&#0160;</p>
<p>No question but that the greatest sore loser in the history of the planet is our former president. What a pathetic whiner! He lost fair and square but he can&#39;t admit it, so instead he claims a nonexistent foul, or a series of fouls. He&#39;s out to change the rules to give himself the advantage. And he&#39;s willing to mess up the entire game if he doesn&#39;t get his way.&#0160;</p>
<p>He wouldn&#39;t have gotten the least smidgeon of respect in 217 schoolyard.&#0160;</p>
<p>What&#39;s wrong with the people who still support him? What are they thinking? How come they can&#39;t recognize him for what he is?&#0160;</p>
<p>Sore Loser.</p>

				<p>We watched a Netflix series called <em>Feel Good</em>. I suppose that the series title must be taken ironically, because throughout the first two seasons, not one character seemed to feel even slightly positive or healthy. Just about everyone was miserable -- their unhappiness usually linked to romantic or more specifically sexual dissatisfaction. The program introduced many more eccentric varieties of coupling and frustration than I, a vanilla heterosexual, would have imagined. The main character, Mae Martin, played by Mae Martin, is a boyish lesbian; her on-again, off-again affair with a womanly young lady is the focus of the story. Lots of obstacles both personal and social stand between the two women and the achievement of genuine happiness. Let&#39;s hope that they can figure it all out and find love at long last -- or at least by the end of Season 3.&#0160;</p>
<p>There was one scene that I found to be particularly curious and troublesome. A group of teachers assemble for a meeting, but before taking up business, every one of the participants reveals or defines his or her own sexuality. One young woman, surely the least glamorous of the set, refers to herself as &quot;cishet.&quot; I didn&#39;t catch the word as spoken but fortunately we had the subtitles engaged and I was able to read the word, although in reading I pronounced it to myself as if the sh were a digraph for the lingual palatal fricative as in shut or shun. But I investigated the new word &quot;cishet&quot; -- and sure enough it exists and has become a feature of our contemporary culture. It&#39;s &quot;cis&quot; as opposed to &quot;trans&quot; which means not &quot;across&quot; but &quot;this side&quot; -- as the Romans referred to Gaul as either cisalpine and transalpine. In this coinage, &quot;cis&quot; refer to a person who accepts the gender designation assigned at birth by the appearance of one&#39;s genitals. &quot;Het&quot; is simply a truncation of heterosexual.&quot; &quot;Cishet&quot; therefore means someone who is unambiguously either male or female and is attracted to persons of the opposite sex.</p>
<p>Wow, that&#39;s me. After all these years of just thinking I was an ordinary guy, I now discover that I have a designation. I have a community, a tribe, perhaps even an interest group. Hey, I belong,</p>
<p>But I think that it&#39;s mighty odd and even oppressive that members of a school community, or any community, would feel that it is necessary or advisable to announce their gender classification before getting down to the business of the day. Shouldn&#39;t such information be allowed to remain private. If I want to be cishet, it&#39;s nobody&#39;s business but my own. But perhaps such formal revelations don&#39;t happen in real life -- only in satirical TV series. I sure hope so.&#0160;</p>
<p>Not so for Mae Martin, the first paragraph of whose biography reads &quot;Mae Martin is a Canadian-born comedian, actor, and writer based in England. They wrote and starred in the Netflix comedy series <em>Feel Good</em>.&quot; So it appears that &quot;she&quot; is a &quot;they&quot; which in current modish jargon doesn&#39;t mean that she&#39;s plural but signifies that she feels inadequately represented by the simple and specific feminine pronoun. I can understand her motive, but frankly &quot;they&quot; confuses me and sticks in my ear. I appreciate its value as a statement of resistance to the &quot;hetoro-normative&quot; -- but by golly &quot;they&quot; sure throws a spanner into the grammatico-normative works. It would be good if English had a set of singular pronouns that are as gender indistinct as &quot;they,&quot; but it doesn&#39;t, and to hijack the plural &quot;they&quot; and turn it into a singular is an awkward and I hope ephemeral innovation.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Sometimes I receive communications from people who are much more up to date than dear old dad -- letters that are signed in the traditional way but to which is subjoined, &quot;My pronouns -- &quot;he his,&quot; or &quot;she her hers&quot; (or &quot;they them their&quot;). This habit, I suppose, clears the air and perhaps forestalls some embarrassing or awkward moments, but again, seems unnecessarily revelatory. It&#39;s limiting and partial. It seems to me to declare that such guys and gals were acting in the parochial interest of their own tribe or constituency -- much as if everyone appended to his or her name his own religion or nationality. I&#39;m not happy with this innovation. Although it might seem progressive, it is in my opinion ultimately dangerously reactionary.</p>
<p>Therefore I am not so current that I would include my pronouns on any letters that I write. But I would like to append my adjectives,</p>
<p>Yours very sincerely,</p>
<p>Vivian de St. Vrain</p>
<p>(My adjectives:&#0160; &quot;wise, upstanding, formerly debonair.&quot;)</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I entered a gloomy, dark, building, perhaps a derelict church. An older woman was sitting there, not exactly in a pew but in a large wooden chair. She said to me, &quot;We help dying people.&quot;&#0160; Was she a nurse or a nun&#0160; of some sort?&#0160; I said, &quot;Like hospice.&quot; She was adamant. &quot;No, not at all like hospice.&quot; I said, &quot;Can you help me?&quot; When I said those words I realized that I had frightened her. &quot;Do you plan to murder me,&quot; she askewd.&#0160; I assured her that I was not a murderer. To make her more comfortable, I said, &quot;Why don&#39;t we go outside where you will feel safer.&quot; But just as we opened the heavy wooden door, a very large, threatening man appeared. I strangled him without a weapon, with my bare hands. So I was a murderer after all. The woman whom I was trying to protect, said, &quot;Now I know you&#39;re planning to murder me.&quot; I objected: &quot;I&#39;ll prove to you I&#39;m not a habitual murderer. Go directly to your car and get in it and drive away. She did so (it was a blue Ford Focus). That&#39;s when the dream ended.</p>
<p>In real life, I&#39;m a peaceful person. In my dream world, I&#39;m occasionally (not often, but often enough) a killer. Why?&#0160; Is it some deeply suppressed inner anger that works its way to the surface during the night?&#0160; Or I am simply a member of a species (<em>homo sapiens</em>) that has a million year habit of violence?</p>
<p>Or perhaps the dreams are meaningless? Just the flotsam of badly-wired synapses? If so, I wish they&#39;d give it a rest.</p>

				<p>When we arrived here 54 years ago, the land was heavily forested but with a limited pallet of northern conifers and deciduous trees. In the first category were pines both red and white, three kinds of spruce, balsam fir, larch and hemlock. Among the hardwoods were sugar maples and red maples, ash, beech, red oak, black cherry, white, yellow and gray birch, quaking and big tooth aspen, and alas butternut and elms, which have both now succumbed to plagues. Common in the area but absent from our particular property were red cedar, cottonwood, basswood, walnut, and black locust. In the 70s of the last millennium, I planted cedars and cottonwoods; they are now mature and replicating themselves. The walnut that I planted fifteen years ago is now 25 feet tall and very handsome. I have only one basswood, which I found as a seedling and transplanted to to a prominent place;&#0160; I&#39;ve been waiting all these years for its descendants. The black locusts that I grew from seeds harvested in Colorado are now starting to make an impression on the landscape. I&#39;ve also added some trees that might be able to survive our warmer winters: a hickory (growing very nicely), a swamp white oak, a bur oak (and its lone offspring) and a sycamore (which has survived two winters).&#0160; I&#39;ve also experimented and failed with some trees that grow just a bit south of us: catalpa, horse chestnut, &quot;Crimson King&quot; maple, little-leaved linden, and ginkgo. Perhaps I&#39;ll try again now that the weather has warmed. One of my neighbors has successfully reared a metasequoia; it&#39;s tempting to try but I think on the whole I&#39;d rather stay with north American trees. On the other hand, we&#39;ll need some new trees to take the place of the ash, which are soon to be decimated.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Our stand of magnificent trees is composed of red pines, <em>pinus resinosa</em>.</p>
<p>Each tree is between 60 and 65 feet tall and they are all exactly 51 years old. How can I be so sure about height and age?&#0160;</p>
<p>Height is easy to determine with the Calloway 300 Pro Laser Range Finder. Age?&#0160; Here&#39;s the history. In 1970, some friend or acquaintance, I can&#39;t remember exactly who, acquired a hundred red pine seedlings for a forestry project. He couldn&#39;t make use of all of them and so he gave us ten -- each one perhaps 4-6 inches long and the sum of their stems no thicker than a #2 pencil. I didn&#39;t know exactly what to do with these treasures, so i planted them in a row in the vegetable garden. Which is where they sat until 1972, when I decided to plant them on the dike of the newly constructed pond, where they remain.</p>
<p>In doing so i acted in defiance of the local wisdom, which is, never plant a tree on the dike. Why? Because the tree will eventually die, and the &quot;water will follow the roots&quot; and weaken the dam. I judged this reasoning to be faulty. In the first place, red pines, like all conifers, are shallow-rooted. The surface of the dike is fifteen feet above the level of the water in the pond, so when the pine eventually dies, its rootball will still be above water level. Moreover, red pines are reported to live for centuries (some say three hundred years), and I just can&#39;t bring myself to worry about what&#39;s going to happen to a dike in the far distant future when, no doubt, the pond will long since have reverted to the thick swamp that it was before we dug it out.</p>
<p>But why red pines rather than the white (<em>pinus strobus</em>) which is generally considered to be the much superior species? Because a), I owned these red pine seedlings and b) because at that time many of the white pines in our neighborhood were suffering from a insect-borne disease that killed the leader shoot and therefore deformed the tree (leader shoot disease seems to be a thing of the past and now our young white pines are again growing up tall and straight).&#0160; And red pines as consistently healthy.</p>
<p>For their first decade, the red pines made scarcely any impression on the landscape. Now they dominate. When I sit in their shade, I am pleased to recall their entire history, which allows me to tell them, proudly, &quot;I knew you when you were just a sprout!&quot; <a class="asset-img-link" href="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef02788034f5cc200d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Screen Shot 2021-06-22 at 5.47.32 PM" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef02788034f5cc200d image-full img-responsive" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef02788034f5cc200d-800wi" title="Screen Shot 2021-06-22 at 5.47.32 PM" /></a></p>

				<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef02788034f62d200d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Screen Shot 2021-06-19 at 5.37.12 AM" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef02788034f62d200d image-full img-responsive" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef02788034f62d200d-800wi" title="Screen Shot 2021-06-19 at 5.37.12 AM" /></a></p>
<p>It may not be immediately obvious or dramatic, but the large tree in the middle of the picture is a white birch. It towers over the red maple and the beeches that are to its left. White birches do not often attain such size, nor are they long-lived, at least in our part of the world. This particular white birch is old and imposing and thriving and healthy.&#0160;</p>
<p>Yet a few years ago this birch appeared to be at death&#39;s door. It sported only a handful of yellow leaves on its thin senescent crown.&#0160;</p>
<p>Inasmuch as it was an old tree (as measured in white-birch years) we all assumed that it had come to the end of its natural days. There was a vigorous family debate on whether it should be submitted to the chain saw before it fell over -- perhaps dangerously -- of its own accord. The consensus was to give it another year. It was a good decision -- as can be plainly seen.</p>
<p>I have no idea why the birch sprang from its hospital bed. Was it a victim of some nameless illness that it had overcome? Had it been merely listless and depressed? Had its local environment altered?&#0160; Perhaps some noxious insect pest had arrived, gone for a kill, failed,&#0160; and then decamped. I have no theory -- it&#39;s a total mystery, as is so much in life. Nevertheless, I&#39;m happy to welcome the birch back into our community. May it have many more happy years.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, just steps away, was a young vigorous yellow birch. Yellow birches are not as striking or famous as their white-barked cousins, but to my mind they are by far the better tree. They are, at least in our neck of the woods, larger, better shaped, longer-lived, and their wood is superior for either furniture or flooring or fuel. Their bark is a splendid glistening yellow gold. A tree to prize.</p>
<p>But, alas, not this particular yellow birch. Last summer it was a burgeoning adolescent, adding more than 18 inches of growth a season. This year, I&#39;m sorry to report, dead as a doornail.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef0282e10a2d56200b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Screen Shot 2021-06-21 at 9.14.47 AM" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef0282e10a2d56200b img-responsive" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef0282e10a2d56200b-800wi" title="Screen Shot 2021-06-21 at 9.14.47 AM" /></a></p>
<p>Not a single leaf. Not the slightest sign of life. This is an ex tree.</p>
<p>The yellow birch was in a perfect position and was one that I had counted on to live for at least a hundred years, perhaps two hundred.&#0160; A tree that should have lasted centuries and been an ornament to the property and a delight to grandchildren and great-grandchildren -- under whose spreading boughs picnics and&#0160; other rural pleasures would have been enacted far into the future.</p>
<p>But that&#39;s the inconstancy of life on earth. One tree, supposedly a short-lived one, springs to life while another, with a grand future, suddenly and inexplicably succumbs to the fate that awaits us all.</p>
<p>Mutability, they used to call it. Precarious, I&#39;d say. &quot;All is flux.&quot;</p>
<p>We are grateful that we had the yellow birch for as long as it lasted, and grateful also that the white birch has decided to stick around -- perhaps for another couple of decades.</p>

				<p>For many years, we&#39;ve had to make do with this inferior fly-swatter:</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef026bded52529200c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Screen Shot 2021-05-30 at 4.20.44 PM" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef026bded52529200c image-full img-responsive" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef026bded52529200c-800wi" title="Screen Shot 2021-05-30 at 4.20.44 PM" /></a></p>
<p>It&#39;s made of molded plastic and extruded metal wire. It&#39;s not handsome -- a ghastly inappropriate pink-purple color for the flapper and a small gauge white-coated wire for the handle. Is there a name for this&#0160; styleless style, other than dime-store cheap. Mid-century modern in its least attractive manifestation. Not only unbeautiful, it leaves much to be desired in function. The flapper is inflexible and rigid, which makes it difficult to kill the fly without splattering it. Moreover, the wire handle lacks integrity and offers an uncomfortable grip.</p>
<p>Now feast your eyes on this newly-acquired fly-swatter. It&#39;s a thing of beauty.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef0278802d1ac9200d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Screen Shot 2021-05-30 at 5.37.20 PM" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef0278802d1ac9200d image-full img-responsive" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef0278802d1ac9200d-800wi" title="Screen Shot 2021-05-30 at 5.37.20 PM" /></a></p>
<p>Notice the turned hardwood handle (maple, I believe, or possibly birch), perfectly suited to the human hand. The heavy gauge shaft leading to a genuine metal screen flapper. It&#39;s a fly-swatter to savor;&#0160; a classic. Many a graceful swat in it.</p>
<p>An anniversary or a birthday in the offing? Nothing says &quot;I love you&quot; more than a fly-swatter of distinction. It&#39;s also unsurpassed as a wedding present. If you&#39;re in a generous mood, &quot;his&quot; and &quot;hers&quot; fly swatters will get that marriage off to a great start.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>We visited Beardstown, in southwestern Illinois, because it was the birthplace, in 1845, of one of Lynn&#39;s maternal great-grandmothers, Mary St. John DeHaven. Even though it is Lincoln country, we had no idea what to expect, the AAA entry being so scant, but we soon discovered that Beardstown is a place that had its moment of glory sometime in the nineteenth century, but which has allowed history to pass it by. While it&#39;s not entirely derelict, it&#39;s not even slightly prosperous -- nor has it achieved quaintness. The industry of note nowadays is the JBS meat-packing plant out on the Arenzville Road; most of its employees come from south of the border, which is why the only indication that Beardstown might someday be rejuvenated is the dozen or so new downtown taquerias and iglesias.</p>
<p>Our first stop in Beardstown was a decaying, rather pathetic 200-foot long peeling boardwalk along the sandy Illinois River, a waterway which in the years before the Civil War had been a thriving commercial thoroughfare. There we watched a solitary tug struggle to free a barge that had somehow run itself aground. Perhaps the boardwalk had once welcomed visitors and tourists, but during our stay the only spectator beside ourselves was a very frayed out-of-work fellow who arrived on a beaten-up bicycle, and who seemed entirely out of his depth when we asked if there was a place in Beardstown to purchase a cup of coffee. To me, he seemed addled; I suspected meth or opioids.</p>
<p>After gazing at the sluggish river for half an hour (remembering Abraham Lincoln&#39;s enthusiasm for river transport), we toured the few blocks of the old downtown, in which fewer storefronts were occupied than were vacant. We looked in at an antique store -- actually less &quot;antique&quot; than &quot;junque&quot; (unless a flashy bejewelled Elvis Presley doll was a revered artifact of a prior civilization). Lynn purchased an owl-decorated piece of blue porcelain for $5.00. We inquired of the proprietor, Mrs. White, if there were a coffee shop in Beardstown. Patricia White, we soon learned, was a recently retired public school music teacher and a lively lady knowledgeable about all things Beardstownian. I asked her about the intriguing storefront adjacent to hers, which proclaimed itself to be a Grand Opera House. I was skeptical that any sort of grandeur could be found in such dreary town, but I was wrong. Mrs. White generously offered us a tour of the old theater. She warned us that it was in deep disrepair but she said that she and others, led by the local chiropractor, were working diligently towards its restoration. So up a flight of dark stairs we went, and there, lo and behold, was revealed to us the picturesque ruins of what had once been a remarkable structure. Here&#39;s a photograph of the remains of its ornate frescoed ceiling and 20-foot-high windows:</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef0282e103974f200b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Screen Shot 2021-05-22 at 1.24.00 PM" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef0282e103974f200b image-full img-responsive" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef0282e103974f200b-800wi" title="Screen Shot 2021-05-22 at 1.24.00 PM" /></a></p>
<p>The theatre had a well-proportioned stage and had once (before the balcony was pulled down) been able to seat several hundred people. In the littered backstage were the remnants of nineteenth-century traveling shows, including a large painted backdrop of Venetian gondolas, left behind by a company from St. Louis. But the building, though its bones were good, was a wreck: leaks in the roof had caused the ceiling to deteriorate. The auditorium itself had served as a storage area for the overflow merchandise of decades of store owners. It would take a dozen roll-offs and weeks of work just to remove the trash and find the floor. Nevertheless, the Grand Opera House offered us an insight into what Beardstown had been when it was a thriving community. I was so impressed by the theater that I decided to donate my bit to its reconstruction. I had determined on $100 until I noticed that Mrs. White had donned a red white and blue Trump 2020 face mask. And so arose a moral dilemma: I want to support the arts, and I would love to help return the Grand Opera House to its former glory. Opera and music should be beyond politics -- but yet I was deeply repelled by Mrs. White&#39;s Trumpism. So I split the difference and donated $60 to the cause. A sensible compromise to a vexing problem?? I don&#39;t know. But it&#39;s what I did. I wanted to ask Mrs. White what Donald Trump&#39;s ignorance, bigotry, authoritarian predilections and corrupt, vacant life had to offer to a cheerful retired teacher in a decaying midwestern town, but I saw no reason to provoke a controversy.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Afterward, we found some lunch up the street at Sally&#39;s Bistro. The bistro did not live up to &quot;bistro&quot; expectations, and could more honestly be called Sally&#39;s Diner, but it did make a good BLT and almost-decent coffee. We did not try the &quot;alligator bits&quot; for which it is famous, even though Sally assured us that the bits were much better than the usual alligator tail. (Beardstown has an alligator farm but we didn&#39;t tour it.)</p>
<p>Mrs. White had also told us about the &quot;old cemetery&quot; so on a lark we went off to investigate. We wandered about, not expecting much, until we stumbled upon a gravestone which revealed that the late Henry Foster married the late Mary McKeever DeHaven. Lynn doesn&#39;t know precisely who these people are, but there are so many of her family names on the marker -- that of her grandfather, George Foster Massey, her uncle, McKeever Massey, her second cousin, Katherine DeHaven Milligan -- that they must&#0160; be long-departed members of her extended ancestry. Certainly cousins of some degree. <a class="asset-img-link" href="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef026bded33419200c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Screen Shot 2021-05-22 at 6.08.21 AM" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef026bded33419200c image-full img-responsive" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef026bded33419200c-800wi" title="Screen Shot 2021-05-22 at 6.08.21 AM" /></a></p>
<p>We googled Henry T. (for True) Foster and found that he was a pillar of the frontier community of Beardstown. He had immigrated from Maine; Mary from Philadelphia. We were gratified by this unexpected find.&#0160;</p>
<p>On the return trip from Beardstown to Jacksonville, we stopped at Griggsville, which, we were astonished to discover, is the &quot;purple martin capitol of the nation&quot; and the location of the world&#39;s largest purple martin skyscraper. Skeptical?&#0160; Here&#39;s the proof:</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef026bded3959f200c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Screen Shot 2021-05-24 at 5.01.59 AM" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef026bded3959f200c image-full img-responsive" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef026bded3959f200c-800wi" title="Screen Shot 2021-05-24 at 5.01.59 AM" /></a><br />So altogether a most rewarding day.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>When I was a boy, I was regularly reprimanded with these words (or some variation of them): &quot;Don&#39;t slouch.&quot; &quot;You&#39;re slouching! &quot;You&#39;re slouching again!&quot; &quot;Why are you slouching?&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>Apparently I was a natural sloucher.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>It was a difficult criticism to absorb or to counter. I wasn&#39;t entirely sure what the word &quot;slouch&quot; meant but I sure knew that it wasn&#39;t anything good. In my mother&#39;s eyes, I believe, &quot;slouching&quot; was not only a physical but a moral lapse. But to be accused of something of which my body, not me in my own person as I knew myself, was guilty -- well, that was surely puzzling.</p>
<p>To slouch is to &quot;sit or stand in a casual, lazy, drooping, or improper posture.&quot; &quot;Lazy?&quot; -- I was definitely lazy. &quot;Improper? -- I&#39;m not so sure. Nor do I know why being repeatedly accused of &quot;slouching&quot; was going to turn me into an upright proper person.</p>
<p>The most famous sloucher in literature is the villainous Orlick in <em>Great Expectations,&#0160;</em>who was &quot;always slouching. He never even seemed to come to his work on purpose, but would slouch in as if by mere accident...&#0160; and when he went ...away at night, he would slouch out.... He lodged at a sluice-keeper&#39;s out on the marshes, and on working-days would come slouching from his hermitage.&quot; Slouching is unquestionably a marker of evil for Dickens. Was it so for my mom?</p>
<p>Then there&#39;s Yeats&#39; &quot;rough beast... slouching toward Bethlehem to be born.&quot; A second coming of sorts, and not at all a good one.</p>
<p>So there you have three slouchers: the &quot;rough beast,&quot; Orlick, and me.</p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2021/05/jimperry.html">About James Perry Jr.</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>From our part of Vermont comes some ghastly news. In a paranoid fit, James Perry Jr. shot and killed Karina, his 38-year-old daughter.</p>
<p>According to the <em>Vermont Digger</em>, our internet newspaper, Perry had been holing up in his home, convinced that &quot;bad guys with guns&quot; were after him. Here&#39;s part of the newspaper account: &quot;Perry said he shot his daughter... as she stood on a landing outside his residence. He told police he was concerned that unknown people were playing &#39;gun games&#39; with him and he asked his daughter not to come to his residence.... He was concerned Karina was being used as a “ploy” by unknown individuals.... For the past couple weeks he has been unable to sleep.... He was sitting on his couch when he saw his daughter at the door. He picked up his 12-gauge shotgun, and could see Karina holding cookies, waving, and trying to open the locked door. ‘I’m just so nervous… and I didn’t want her to come in, and I didn’t want the cookies. I ordered her to stop, and I just, I guess I, pulled the trigger. And then I pulled it more, and then I cut her neck.&#39;&quot; Perry said he believed he used a pocket knife to stab her.</p>
<p>Could there be a more horrific tragedy? A man goes crazy and kills his own daughter.</p>
<p>But yet there&#39;s worse -- in the details that don&#39;t appear in the newspaper. Karina, Jim&#39;s older daughter by his second wife, Phyllis, is divorced and is the mother of four children, who are now left motherless. And Phyllis, Karina&#39;s mother, is ill with a very bad cancer -- so she had to learn, in this last phase of her life, that her ex-husband shot and killed one of their children.&#0160;</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a picture of James Perry Jr. as it appeared in the <em>Digger</em>. He looks like a guy who&#39;s just been cast as a maniac in a chainsaw massacre movie.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef0263e9a2c43b200b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Screen Shot 2021-05-06 at 9.21.42 AM" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef0263e9a2c43b200b img-responsive" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef0263e9a2c43b200b-800wi" title="Screen Shot 2021-05-06 at 9.21.42 AM" /></a></p>
<p>He certainly does not look at all like the Jimmy Perry whom I&#39;ve known for 45 years. Except for the bright blue eyes, he&#39;s unrecognizable.</p>
<p>I remember Jim when he was in his twenties -- a normal guy. Actually he was quite handsome, strong, energetic, well-liked, already skilled with wood and bricks and stones. He built the chimney in our new house and he was a more-than-competent carpenter.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>How could the Jimmy Perry that I knew and admired in the 1970s turn into a man who shoots and kills his own daughter?</p>
<p>Even back then, he drank too much. And used too much marijuana. Sometime in the 1980s, he worked in Wyoming as a roustabout on oil rigs. One day he fell into a vat of what he called &quot;mud&quot; but was a container for the strong chemicals used in the oil drilling process. He was burned neck to ankle and spent close to a year, if I remember correctly, in a hospital -- in severe pain for much of the time. I don&#39;t think he ever fully recovered. His body was a mass of scars. I&#39;m sure that the beer and the drugs and the pain, and possibly the isolation caused by the pandemic, contributed to his derangement. But nothing explains what is fundamentally inexplicable.</p>
<p>I didn&#39;t see much of Jim in the last few years. I&#39;d run into him in Hannaford&#39;s occasionally. He appeared to be many years older than his true age. He was emaciated, sickly-looking. Clearly someone who&#39;d had a hard life. He told me that he didn&#39;t know how long he could continue &quot;crawling on roofs.&quot; The last time I caught sight of him, I confess, I avoided him. I could see even from a distance that he was &quot;off&quot; and I didn&#39;t want to engage with him.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>I don&#39;t mean to excuse Jim. What he did was the worst. I wish that he hadn&#39;t had a shotgun in the house. If he had to be armed, I would have preferred that he shot himself. That would have been bad enough. I hope that he doesn&#39;t regain his sanity, because if he does so, he&#39;ll have to reckon with what he&#39;s done. The guilt will kill him twenty times over.</p>
<p>Jim was an ordinary man, not an evil one. The picture above doesn&#39;t tell the whole story. He was unlucky, and crazed, and something went horribly wrong in his brain. Those of us who are lucky and sane should thank our good fortune, because all of us are vulnerable.</p>
<p>Jim did a lot of work for me in 1978. In the summer of 1979, he came to visit and said that he had gone over his books and discovered that I had overpaid him for about a week of work. News to me -- I had no idea. He said that he couldn&#39;t reimburse the money he owed me, but he would take a few days and build me a nice stone wall -- even then, he was famous for his classy stonework. So together and with the help of my kids we poached a dozen truckloads of stone from some of our many crumbling walls. We picked out a site and he built us about fifty feet of handsome drystone. It&#39;s still there, an ornament to the property. The maker of that wall is the Jimmy Perry, an honest craftsman and a reliable friend, that I prefer to remember, even while I mourn the death of his daughter and regret the abysmal woe that he caused his family.&#0160;&#0160;</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef026bdecf6da3200c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Screen Shot 2021-05-03 at 10.07.17 AM" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef026bdecf6da3200c image-full img-responsive" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef026bdecf6da3200c-800wi" title="Screen Shot 2021-05-03 at 10.07.17 AM" /></a></p>
<p>I especially prize this particular coverlet because of its history. It was woven for Charity Maria Laws in 1835, as is plainly evident from the inscription on its &quot;summer&quot; side. I wish the weaver had identified himself as well as his client, but he hasn&#39;t.&#0160;</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef0263e9a21fc1200b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Screen Shot 2021-05-03 at 10.16.38 AM" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef0263e9a21fc1200b image-full img-responsive" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef0263e9a21fc1200b-800wi" title="Screen Shot 2021-05-03 at 10.16.38 AM" /></a></p>
<p>Who is Charity Maria Laws?&#0160; She was a native of a part of Long Island (New York) with which I&#39;m very familiar and where I spent the best three summers of my childhood. She was born in 1822 in Ridge and died in Northport in 1894. Makamah Beach, home to as much fair seed-time for the soul as I experienced, is located within the Northport precincts. Charity Maria was presented with this coverlet when she was thirteen years old -- to keep her warm a&#39; nights, no doubt, but also, as was the custom, to serve as the centerpiece of her trousseau. The coverlet worked its magic because in 1848 Charity Maria was wooed and won by John Gardiner Lewis of neighboring Crab Meadow and bore five children, all of them born in Northport or adjacent Huntington. I have no idea where the coverlet hid out between Maria&#39;s death until it made its re-appearance on ebay last year, but I&#39;m happy to say that it was treated&#0160; very well during that time -- it&#39;s in splendid shape for a textile that&#39;s pushing two hundred.&#0160;</p>
<p>Imagine my surprise, when, a few days ago, a Jacquard coverlet in an identical style appeared on ebay. When I glanced at the pictures, I said, out loud but to no one in particular, I bet that one also hails from my part of Suffolk. It didn&#39;t take an S. Holmes to confirm my speculation.The evidence is as plain as the nose on your face: the exact same lettering, but this time, it&#39;s Harriet Sophia Overton.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef02788026345f200d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Screen Shot 2021-04-27 at 3.33.57 PM" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef02788026345f200d image-full img-responsive" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef02788026345f200d-800wi" title="Screen Shot 2021-04-27 at 3.33.57 PM" /></a></p>
<p>This coverlet is not only inscribed -- It&#39;s dated, too. December 1, 1845. Harriet Sophia Overton herself is not easy to identify. There was a Harriet Sophia in the village or hamlet of Coram, in Suffolk, just a few miles from Northport, but she was born in 1815 and died in 1821 and therefore can&#39;t possibly be the recipient of a coverlet woven in 1845. There must be a second Harriet Sophia. And truly, so there is. The first Harriet Sophia had an older brother, Sheldon Roe Overton, who fathered a girl named after the departed six-year-old. Harriet Sophia Overton II was born in 1850 and died, unmarried, in 1868. Another dead end, alas, because HSO the second was born five years after the coverlet was woven.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>I am forced to speculate that there was still a third Harriet Sophia Overton who was born on December 1, 1845 and didn&#39;t live long enough to get a mention in the story or even earn a gravestone. Harriet Sophia Overton was an unlucky name. Hardly compensated for by the long-lived coverlet.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Despite my love of Northport and environs -- of course I mean the Northport of my memory, the Northport of the 1940s -- I didn&#39;t bid on the Overton coverlet. But I would love to know its story, which I suspect to be one of great sadness.&#0160;</p>

<p>Pictured is a variety of daylily called the Charles Johnston. Looks good, doesn&#39;t it?&#0160; First introduced by Gates in 1981, it won an award of merit 1988 from the American daylily society. I ordered a couple from a nursery in Tennessee because they are VE (very early), tetraploid, fragrant, and reputed to be accomplished re-bloomers (although daylillies that rebloom in the upper south don&#39;t always do so in Vermont). It&#39;s the VE part that interests me because I don&#39;t have any early reds. &quot;Rich burgundy blooms.&quot;&#0160; Sounds delicious. I think I&#39;ll put them in the vegetable garden temporarily, where the soil is, as LERM says, &quot;like chocolate cake&quot; and plant them out in the perfect place, yet to be determined. Somewhere where the large VE blooms can make a statement.</p>
<p>I wonder how my gardens survived my Covid 2020 absence. We&#39;ll find out in three weeks.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Interviewing ten candidate a day for a couple of days can make a guy a little crazy. On the one hand, you owe each candidate your thoughtful attention, because careers are at stake. But conducting interviews is a tedious process and everyone who has ever done it knows that faces and voices and attitudes tend to blur into an indistinguishable lumpy mass. So much earnestness! So much contrived presentation of self!&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>I remember one such endless day in a featureless room in a high floor of a pretentious modern hotel in Chicago, or Atlanta, or perhaps Houston. We were making an appointment to our budding &quot;Writing Program&quot; -- an academic innovation that I now believe to have been a total disaster. Writing Programs hired &quot;writing specialists&quot; -- experimentalist social scientists who believe in &quot;theory&quot; and who generally can&#39;t themselves write a lick. Or half a lick.</p>
<p>I remember one candidate with whom I had this remarkable exchange:&#0160;</p>
<p>Me:&#0160; &quot;Could you remind me about the subject of your dissertation.&quot;</p>
<p>He:&#0160; &quot;I worked with the Brown Corpus.&quot;</p>
<p>Me (astonished): &quot;What the heck is the Brown Corpus.&quot;</p>
<p>He:&#0160; &quot;It&#39;s a computer file of one million edited words drawn from magazines and newspapers. It was compiled at Brown University. The idea is to study the English language as it actually written.&quot;</p>
<p>(I interrupt this conversation to say that &quot;Brown Corpus&quot; may be the most injudiciously-named academic enterprise in history. To me, &quot;brown corpus&quot; might have something to do with decayed corpuscles, or a fecal mass, or someone or something a-mouldering in its grave. Not a phrase with much poetry to it. But let us proceed.)</p>
<p>Me: &quot;That seems interesting. What exactly did you study in this corpus.&quot;</p>
<p>He: &quot;I studied the use of the comma.&quot;</p>
<p>Me: &quot;The comma. You studied the comma.&quot; (More astonishment). &quot;What in the world did you learn about the comma?</p>
<p>He:&#0160; &quot;I learned that the comma is used to link a sequence of nouns, or phrases, in a series.&quot;</p>
<p>I was already giddy and aghast when I heard this news and I had a sudden revelation, a flash. I saw myself picking up the candidate and throwing him through the plate glass window and watching as he plummeted painfully to the street below. But I controlled myself and thanked the candidate and, I believe, ended the interview politely. I didn&#39;t even indulge myself with something snarky, like, &quot;do you intend to do any follow-up work on a more challenging mark of punctuation, as for example the exclamation point?&quot;</p>
