			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I can remember five near misses -- five times when through inattentive or incompetent driving I put my own and others&#39; lives at risk. I give thanks that I avoided killing or mangling myself or the innocent victims of my failings. What wondrous life is this I lead -- how fortunate I have been!</p>
<p>The first: it was 1963. I was an inexperienced, overconfident driver, traveling westward, somewhere in southern Illinois. My first cross-country trip. A two-lane highway, a downpour, very wet pavement. I saw, or thought i saw, an oncoming car in my lane. There would have been plenty of time for him to pass and dive back, but I panicked and braked hard. My vehicle, an old Rambler, not a great handler in the best of times, swerved into the oncoming lane, then spun out of control and landed backward in a ditch on the right side of the road. We sat there, stunned, relieved, because I had been in the left oncoming lane long enough to have killed ourselves self and others. (Within a minute, a man pulled up in a truck, attached a chain to our car and winched us out. I&#39;m perpetually grateful to this Samaritan.)</p>
<p>A second instance: an icy winter day in Boulder, early 1970s. Driving the old yellow Saab with my sister Phyllis (legally, sister-in-law) in the &quot;death seat&quot; east on Arapahoe, I hit a slick of black ice and made a bad situation worse by applying the brakes. The car spun out of control and eventually halted facing backwards in the oncoming lane. Once again, no one injured or even inconvenienced.</p>
<p>Another: driving across the USA alone in the clunky blue Camry, doing 80 in a 55 zone, I didn&#39;t quite fall asleep at the wheel but certainly lost focus, and didn&#39;t see a car stopped in the parking lane until I was just adjacent to it. If I had been a bit to the right or if there had been someone fixing a tire, I would have crippled myself and murdered an innocent. Here&#39;s another one, probably the most idiotic. Driving alone through Chicago in heavy traffic, on one of those horrible highways where there are eight lanes east and another eight west, I found myself in the third lane from the right and needed to exit right. Instead of playing it safe, and continuing on, I impulsively dove across two lanes and made it to the exit. Angry horns to the right of me, horns to the left of me. Why did I take such a risk? I don&#39;t know but I thank the drivers around me for being alert. What arrogance, what stupidity! The most recent event, and most inexcusable, happened just a few years ago. I was returning home from a very disturbing visit to the &quot;memory care&quot; facility. Somehow, in my grief, I ignored a prominent red light and sailed right through a busy intersection -- a gross violation of sense and law. But there was no crash and no police and I proceeded blithely on my way -- only, after a few moments, realizing with shock and horror that I had put my own life and that of others at completely unnecessary danger.</p>
<p>When people two hundred years from now look back on our &quot;civilization&quot; -- assuming that there will be people on this planet two hundred years from now, which is not a certainty -- they will wonder how was it possible that those people in our century were able to survive. Dashing 70 or 80 miles an hour in a tin can just six feet from a line of onrushing tin cans? Weaving among giant tandem trucks and buses and cement mixers -- and expecting to survive. What sort of brave or foolhardy individuals were these strange, death-defying people?</p>
<p>For myself, I&#39;m astonished at the dumb luck that&#39;s allowed me to preserve my life and mobility to this advanced age. So far, that is. It&#39;s not over until it&#39;s over.&#0160;&#0160;</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I&#39;ve been reading about the origin of spinning and weaving -- specifically E. J. W. Barber&#39;s <em>Prehistoric Textiles</em> (Princeton, 1991), a comprehensive and exhausting survey of everything that was known about the subject thirty years ago. I&#39;m dazzled -- in part by the author, who turns the story into an adventure, but even more so by our brilliant neolithic ancestors. Some among our forbears, starting perhaps 30,000 years ago, looked at this plant, common flax,&#0160;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linenme.com/us"><img alt="flax plant - linen fabric" class="aligncenter wp-image-242" height="360" src="https://www.linenbeauty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/flax-plants-linen-fabric.jpeg" title="linen plant - linen fabric" width="540" /></a></p>
<p>and figured out how to turn it into linen -- a complicated, many step process. How did they even begin to imagine such a transformation? Did they examine the plant and say, hey that looks like it will make a nice shirt or a pair of pants? To arrive at such a concept seems like an act of almost preternatural intelligence. After all, there was no template or model. It&#39;s not as though there were other fabrics made from other plants fibers. Flax into linen was a first. There were predecessors. Clothes, I imagine, in the form of animal skins or furs, must have been in use. I&#39;ve read that reeds and other plant materials had been plaited into baskets and nets. But flax into linen was not at all obvious. We can be proud of our ancestors.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a picture of the oldest recovered linen garment: the so-called Tarkhan Dress, which was found in a cemetery near Cairo in 1913 and radiocarbon-dated to between 3482 and 3102 BCE, or 5 and a half millennia ago. It&#39;s quite stylish and isn&#39;t in much worse shape than some of the favored garments in my own personal wardrobe.</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Although both my parents were dependent on their morning coffee <a class="asset-img-link" href="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef026bdec8f66a200c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Screen Shot 2021-04-04 at 11.35.39 AM" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef026bdec8f66a200c image-full img-responsive" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef026bdec8f66a200c-800wi" title="Screen Shot 2021-04-04 at 11.35.39 AM" /></a></p>
<p>percolated out of a can like this one, I myself never touched the stuff until my first year at college. In the 1950s, coffee was 10 cents a cup and I drank gallons of it, morning, noon and night. It became essential to my well-being. Black, no sugar or milk, but in truth, not black but barely brown, weak by present standards. In the early 60s my hipper than I -- not much of a leap --&#0160; friend SDS introduced me to the coffee shop. Figaro in Greenwich Village, mighty sophisticated for a boy from Flatbush. I became addicted to coffee shops as well as coffee itself for many a year. I couldn&#39;t handle any routine paperwork, or indeed grade a tedious set of papers without infusions of caffeine. With the Starbuck&#39;s revolution, coffee became tastier and more luxurious. But, conservative as I was, I never succumbed to fancy drinks but kept to what had come to be known simply and condescendingly as &quot;Americano.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>During these thirty-five or so years of pleasant coffee dependence, atrial fibrillation became an annoying feature of my life. Frequent bouts, longer and longer. Debilitating, possibly dangerous -- there&#39;s a strong association of fibrillation with strokes. Finally, a doctor suggested that I might consider giving up caffeine. So I stopped on a dime. It took six weeks to get the caffeine out of my blood and put an end to the longing for coffee -- but the atrial fibrillation came to a total halt. Ceased. Not a single episode these last two and a half decades. Astonishing. I had been poisoning myself -- or at least, compromising my well being.</p>
<p>Do I miss coffee? Yes, I&#39;m afraid so, every morning. I still love the odor (which was always better than the taste). More than that, I miss the society of coffee cup and conversation. In those days, I loved to sit with a book in a nook, warming my palm with a bottomless cup. Once, only once, about two years ago, I did venture to order a medium Americano -- but I couldn&#39;t stomach more than a couple of sips. Coffee&#39;s an acquired taste, and one that I had I de-acquired.&#0160;</p>
<p>Tea? I haven&#39;t found one that is more than barely tolerable. Hot chocolate? Feels juvenile. Acceptable for breakfast but not for Peet&#39;s or Ozo or Starbuck&#39;s or the Trident.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>On the other hand, a heart that keeps to a regular rhythm and doesn&#39;t go creatively syncopated several times a week is also a pleasure.</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Regular readers of this metablague know that Dr. M. has resumed his study of Italian. Foolish say some, but heroic say others, because to try to master a language when one is an octogenarian is truly daunting. However, native speakers of English, even older ones, can, if patient, slowly acquire Italian. Its sounds are similar and sometimes identical to those of English; the conjugations, only three of them, are on the whole regular; and many of its words have English or Latin cognates. For me, pronouns present a problem, because they&#39;re sometimes required when I wouldn&#39;t think to use them, and sometimes dropped when I&#39;d prefer them to be there -- and, moreover, they come in slightly varied direct, indirect, and reflexive forms. And then there are the <em>pronomi combinati</em> or double pronouns which are confusing in themselves and which are sometimes but not always attached to infinitives, gerunds and imperatives as enclitics. It&#39;s probably too late in the game for me to become a fluent speaker, but I have hopes of becoming a competent reader. I can now read at about the 6th or 7th grade level; I have the grammar under control so it&#39;s mostly a problem of vocabulary and idiom.</p>
<p>For a greater challenge, I&#39;ve begun to study a little Beffa. Beffa is a Kartvelian language with admixtures of Cascagian and Ghetti. Fortunately for me, there&#39;s a small Beffan community here in our town. I work with an introductory textbook -- <em>Pathways to Modern Beffa</em> (2012) by Divino Divano -- and with a native speaker named Ismail Kartakov. We meet three times a week when he&#39;s available. Sometimes I enjoy a Beffa-speaking dinner with Ismail and his wife Soraya and their three young children. I&#39;ve also been to some Beffan parties and exuberant dances. I sometimes feel odd-man-out but it&#39;s been fun. The Beffan community, reputedly hostile to outsiders, has been very welcoming. And the goat, mountain oyster, and black radish stew is superb.</p>
<p>Beffa is a bit more complicated than English. For example, while English has 26 consonants, Beffa has 56, including a two kinds of glottal stops that sound almost like clicks as well as a voiced glottal fricative that resembles a cat&#39;s purr. It also has both a voiced and unvoiced bilabial trill that sound a lot like an English &quot;raspberry,&quot; and an unusual, possibly unique lingual-dental stop in which the tongue is pushed firmly against not the upper but the lower teeth. One peculiarity of Beffa is its consonant clusters -- a word may begin with as many as six consonants yoked together before the first vowel appears. Some words have an initial six consonants followed by a vowel and then a cluster of five or six more consonants. This can be strange to English speakers and sometimes I notice Ismail&#39;s younger children giggling at my feeble attempts to replicate their plosives. (Voiceless plosives are usually aspirated and one must take care not to insert a schwa between aspirants.) Beffa also has a varied repertoire of vowels, including a number of diphthongs and a couple of triphthongs. There aren&#39;t any tones, thank goodness. There&#39;s one triphthong the use of which can be perilous, for if you get it wrong the observation &quot;your blue parrot is pining for the fjords&quot; apparently sounds almost exactly like &quot;my knife is longer and sharper than yours.&quot;</p>
<p>Nouns have both natural and grammatical gender. Nouns can be masculine, feminine, neuter, ambiguous, common, animate or inanimate. They can be singular, dual, plural, or paucative (i.e. a few). Neuter nouns rarely have duals. Beffa has six fully formed declensions, distinguished primarily by the fact that plurals in declensions 1 and 3 are formed with a prefix, in 2 and 4 by a suffix, and in 5 and 6 by an infix. There are also some fifteen cases, all useful but some slightly unusual. There are the familiar nominative, possessive, accusative and dative (or indirect object). There are also a series of cases that describe motion: the locative (&quot;the ball that is lying on the ground&quot;), the ablative ((&quot;the ball that is coming in your direction&quot;); the separative (&quot;the ball that is moving away from you&quot;); the commitative (&quot;the ball that is touching your hand&quot;); the partitive (&quot;the ball that has left your hand&quot;); the terminative (&quot;the ball that has stopped moving&quot;); the superessive (&quot;the ball that is on top of another ball&quot;); the penetrative (&quot;the ball that is inside another ball&quot;); the perditive (&quot;the ball that is lost&quot;); the oscillative (&quot;the ball that is going back and forth&quot;); the thumpative (&quot;the ball that is bouncing&quot;); the plungitive &quot;the ball that has fallen into the water&quot;); the remunerative (&quot;the ball that has been bought or sold&quot;); the joculatorative (&quot;the ball that does not fall to the ground&quot;); the alfactorative (&quot;the ball that stinks like a corpse&quot;); the perplexive (&quot;the ball that has disappeared&quot;); and the insouciative (&quot;the ball that has disappeared and no one cares&quot;). Nouns can be either proximate or obviative; nouns that are central to the discourse (proximate) are declined very differently than nouns that are of marginal importance (obviative). There is also an unusual suffix (at least, unusual to me, for I had never encountered it before) that indicates whether the object specified touches the earth or is removed from the earth. And an infix which indicates whether the object is horizontal, vertical, diagonal, spiral, or invisible.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Verbs can be singular dual, plural, paucative, or undetermined: active, passive or middle. There are five fully-formed conjugations and apparently remnants of three others that are retained from the past when the language was more fully synthetic. The most commonly used tenses are present indicative, imperfect indicative, past imperfect indicative, future indicative, future imperfect indicative, future perfect indicative, pluperfect indicative, past pluperfect indicative, future pluperfect indicative, future stative, pluperfect resultative, present optative, future optative, past imperfect optative, present subjunctive, future subjunctive, past pluperfect subjunctive, future pluperfect subjunctive, future pluperfect conditional subjunctive, and future pluperfect optative conditional subjunctive aorist. Curiously, there is no future imperfect subjunctive. Moreover, there are two kinds of vocatives: one when a woman addresses a man; a second when a man addresses a woman or an animal. There is also votive, a tense that was formerly used for addressing the deities in prayer, but is now reserved for tribal chiefs, heads of state or royalty. The votive is very similar to the conditional and the erroneous substitution of a conditional for a votive was formerly grounds for mutilation but nowadays leads only to acute embarrassment, or, in the case of a particularly egregious grammatical lapse, to exile.&#0160;&#0160;</p>

<p>Some verbs are ergative so that the subject of either a transitive or intransitive verb can be in an absolutive case. Some common ergative verbs are &quot;to become,&quot; &quot;to eat,&quot;, and &quot;to gouge&quot; (as in, &quot;to gouge out the eyes of an enemy&quot;).</p>
<p>Beffan script is known as &quot;dabbenaggine.&quot; This passage comments on the familiar Beffan proverb, &quot;If you steal my horse, I will steal your wife.&quot;</p>

<p>Beffa used to be written&#0160;<a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2007/05/boustrophedonia.html">boustrophedonically,</a>&#0160;but since the reforms of 1912 has been written right to left. For some reason which I cannot possibly imagine, dabbenaggine leaves no spaces between words but runs them all together without breaks, which makes it just slightly harder to master. &#0160;&#0160;<a class="image" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mkhedruli.svg"></a>&#0160;</p>
<p>Pronouns and determiners are difficult and complicated and perhaps I&#39;ll describe them sometime in the future when I&#39;m more familiar with their multiple and various forms.</p>

				<p>I&#39;ve just learned a new word that and I&#39;m trying to figure out how to work it into the conversation. Some sample usages:</p>
<p>&quot;Have you pandiculated today? How often?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m not pleased when you pandiculate at the dinner table.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There were a bunch of kids at the museum today, and half of them were pandiculating.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I thought that the way he pandiculated was ostentatious and rude.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Pandiculation can be very pleasurable, especially early in the morning.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I wasn&#39;t aware that many kinds of mammals pandiculate. You&#39;d never see a reptile or a bird do it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not only did he pandiculate during the concert, but he did it noisily.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think that people should at least cover their mouths when they pandiculate.&quot;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Sometime during the hippie period, say the early 1970s, I&#0160; was driving the big green Dodge station wagon solo from who knows where to somewhere else, and as was my custom in those turbulent days, I picked up a hitchhiker -- a mighty scrawny young guy. He seemed to be in bad shape -- underfed and dirty. I suspected &quot;speed.&quot; Compassionately, I offered him a piece of my sandwich. He turned me down, saying, &quot;I don&#39;t <em>use w</em>hite bread.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>What an effective sentence! In a mere five words,&#0160; he managed to claim complete moral superiority over me. I was now dismissed as a &quot;user&quot; of white bread. and therefore clearly an unenlightened conformist bourgeois -- probably a rabid supporter of the carpet bombing of Cambodia. He, on the other hand, was a butterfly, free and liberated and a dissenter from the Loathed Establishment.</p>
<p>But I don&#39;t think I would remember this incident if it weren&#39;t for his deployment of the word &quot;use.&quot; &quot;Use&quot; asserts an equivalence between two habits -- between whatever cocktail of drugs that he might be injecting or snorting or dropping, and the white bread that I was consuming. It was also implied that my addiction was the worser one. My emaciated pal was, in his own mind, doing me a favor, enlightening me about the depravity of my bread habit.&#0160;</p>
<p>But let me say a word in defense of the bread -- I don&#39;t &quot;use&quot; white bread in the sense of Silvercup or Wonder Bread -- at least not since I left Flatbush neighborhood of origin. The slices of bread in question might not have been made of steelcut handmilled wheat berries enhanced with millet and quinoa and baked in a hickory-fired furnace, but it would have been a perfectly respectable bread and one that should not have been denigrated by a skinny tie-dyed trust fund baby soon to shave his scraggly beard and rejoin his father&#39;s insurance business.</p>
<p>But I sure do admire his use of the verb &quot;use.&quot;</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a more recent incident. On the semi-famous Boulder Mall, not long ago, a panhandler carrying a sign that said, &quot;Anything Helps&quot; held out his hand.&#0160; Compassionately, I gave him a quarter.&#0160; He returned it to me, announcing, &quot;I don&#39;t <em>take </em>coins.&quot;</p>
<p>Well, everybody has to have standards.&#0160;</p>
<p>Once again, I&#39;ve been put in my place by a verb. &quot;I don&#39;t&#0160;<em>take&#0160;</em>coins.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>A third instance: I was in Boston and I wandered into a ragged antique store that sold old and truly ancient Chinese art. The place is a mess but I notice that the goods are museum-quality -- sculptures, mostly, but paintings and even a few bronze pieces -- Neolithic for all I know.&#0160; Way out of the range of my wallet or checkbook. Trying to appear knowledgeable, I ask the proprietor if he has any Green Fitzhugh. Peering over lunettes, he says, with aggrieved condescension, &quot;I don&#39;t <em>do&#0160;</em>export.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Floored again. Put in my place by Mr. Hippie, Mr. Panhandler, and Mr. Antique Dealer -- all of them master practitioners who know how to make a simple monosyllabic verb do a heck of a lot of snobbish work.&#0160;</p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2021/02/my-brain.html">My Brain -- for my Grandchildren, etc.</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>(This entry is written for my grandchildren and any subsequent descendants, should there by any, who might like to know how and where their brain anomalies originated. Whether they will revere or curse me for what I&#39;ve bequeathed them, I&#39;ll never know. Just as well. The further they are removed from me, the less they have to worry, for I&#39;m only a one-fourth donor to my grandchildren, only an eighth to the greats. With progressive diminishment they have less and less reason to be concerned. But they&#39;ll never arrive at zero --there&#39;s no escape from me or from a genetic Zeno&#39;s Paradox.]</p>
<p>I&#39;ve lived with this brain for 80-plus years now and have a pretty good idea of its strengths and weaknesses and peculiarities. I&#39;ll try be candid about the poor pink mass.</p>
<p>I have a very good memory but little capacity for synthesis or organization. I imagine that the contents of my brain look like the last scene of <em>Citizen Kan</em>e. A warehouse of stuff strewn in heaps, nothing organized, everything disorderly and random. A great twisted miscellany of jumbled information. Nothing where it should be, everything a mess. I &quot;know&quot; lots of facts and data, but I&#39;ve never had the capacity to make sense of them. When I read, for example, a well-organized book of history, I&#39;m regularly dazzled by authors who are able to discover and explain patterns of change or to compare one century or one civilization with another. My brain can&#39;t do such things -- or anything remotely similar, even at a much lower order of achievement .&#0160;</p>
<p>I have almost no imagination or creativity. Over the year I&#39;ve tried to write stories and poetry, but the stuff that emerges from my brain is piss poor. I&#39;m only comfortable dealing with facts and evidence. When I&#39;m asked to invent stuff, to make things up, I falter badly. I&#39;m reminded that when I was a youth in college, many of my friends enrolled for courses in &quot;Creative Writing.&quot; I couldn&#39;t take such a risk -- creative writing terrified me. I was conscious, even then, of my total want of invention or artistry. On the other hand, I&#39;m quite a good detective. I can follow clues. I&#39;m a good researcher. Strange to say, though I&#39;m without imagination in real life, I experience spectacularly fanciful dreams. There&#39;s hardly a night goes by that I&#39;m not transported to some vividly brilliant alternative world. Why can&#39;t I access my nighttime imagination during the waking hours?&#0160; I could have been a pillar of neo-surrealism.&#0160;</p>
<p>I&#39;m good at arithmetic but a total bust at mathematics. I can do mental arithmetic much better than most -- add, subtract, multiply, or divide quickly and accurately without pen or paper. But once things become even the slightest bit abstract, I go blank. When there is something to count, I&#39;m your man; when there&#39;s something to extrapolate or imagine, no go.&#0160;</p>
<p>I have a strong aesthetic sense, especially about visual beauty. Museums or gardens can move me almost to a swoon. I&#39;ve even experienced Stendhal syndrome a few times. Majestic mountains and spacious landscapes move me less than a well-designed garden. Yet my delight in human artistic achievement does not cross over into anything that might be called spirituality (as it does for many people). I entirely lack what Charlotte Bronte called the &quot;organ of veneration.&quot;</p>
<p>I have a woeful disabling case of directional dyslexia -- worse than anyone I&#39;ve ever known except my younger brother. I can&#39;t follow directions and I get lost even in familiar territory. I believe that my inability with left right east west (I&#39;m brilliant with up and down!) has contributed to my general lack of daring. Inasmuch as I&#39;ve always been afraid to go a step too far in space, I became too cautious to strike out intellectually. Perhaps my inability with directions is also tied up with my sometimes disabling shyness -- but that&#39;s a guess. I do know that it&#39;s the reason that I am regularly bested a jigsaw puzzles by five-year-olds -- I can&#39;t deduce the relationship between pieces.&#0160;</p>
<p>I&#39;m not prone to guilt but I&#39;m devastated by shame. I suppose I would feel guilt if I killed or harmed someone, but I&#39;ve never done much in the pure villainy line. Though largely guilt-free, I suffer dreadfully from embarrassment. I think that I&#39;ve retained in my memory every foolish fatuous pretentious thing I&#39;ve ever said or done. I live with a highly punishing shame superego -- which is good, because it limits the number of times in which I might make an egregious fool of myself, but it&#39;s bad because it&#39;s kept me from taking risks that might have been productive or liberating or just simply pleasurable.</p>
<p>I have a good sense of humor. I can occasionally be witty. I also appreciate the wit of others. I&#39;ve learned, over the years, not to be witty at others&#39; expense. I&#39;m articulate and occasionally, but rarely, eloquent.</p>
<p>I&#39;m observant. When I walk in the woods, or walk down the street, I see and interpret more clearly than most people. Sherlock said, &quot;You see but you do not observe.&quot; I&#39;m no Holmes, but I do observe. Perhaps it&#39;s false pride but I think that I &quot;read&quot; people pretty well. And I read relationships well. I&#39;m curious about people and about things, which is why I am happier reading non-fiction rather than fiction. I&#39;m more interested in the facts than in &quot;make-believe.&quot;&#0160; An odd admission for a person who spent a lifetime teaching and studying literature.</p>
<p>I&#39;m a good listener.</p>
<p>I love music but I have as inadequate a sense of rhythm as anyone on earth. My dancing is pathetic and ludicrous. My sense of rhythm is so bad that as a youth I could never learn to pump a swing -- even though in bat and ball games I was a passable schoolyard athlete.&#0160;</p>
<p>I&#39;m impatient, easily bored. If I don&#39;t get it quickly, I&#39;m liable to give up. But there have been times in my life when I worked with admirable perseverance and diligence. Not often enough.</p>
<p>I&#39;m fascinated by language and know more than most people about the way languages are structured and how they work. I read foreign languages pretty well. At the same time, I have no ear for sound. My hearing is now very bad, except when I turn the apparatus up to 11, but even in my youth I didn&#39;t easily distinguish &quot;t&quot; from &quot;d&quot; or &quot;v&quot; from &quot;b.&quot; I seem to have to see the word in my head before I can understand or translate it. I was good at the ancient languages because they made no demand on ear or tongue. French was a trial because the sounds were so distant from their spelling. In English, I&#39;m an excellent speller.</p>
<p>At this point in my life I&#39;m more conscious of the deficiencies of my brain than of its strengths. I feel fortunate that I had a strong memory, a feel for language, and a decent prose style, and that those few traits were enough to let me live a respectable life and make a decent living. But I also know that many people perform a multitude of tasks without strain that are a torment and a struggle for me. Which has kept me appropriately modest.&#0160;</p>

<p>A coverlet is not a small cover. The &quot;let&quot; is not a diminutive -- it&#39;s let as in copire lectum (L) or &quot;cuivre lit&quot; (Fr).&#0160; A bedcover. Neither a blanket nor a bedspread, but both -- a decorative but warm item of bedclothes.</p>
<p>&quot;Jacquard&quot; refers to the Jacquard attachment, which was a series of punchcards (the ancestor of the IBM cards) that controlled the weaving and allowed a skilled workman to produce complicated patterns relatively inexpensively. Jacquard coverlets were produced in large quantities (about 700 craftsmen are known) in villages and small towns in the US between about 1820 and the coming of the Civil War. Weavers were mostly immigrants from the old country whose skills had already been rendered obsolete by factory-based manufacture. Weaving was a cottage industry -- many weavers wove in the winter, farmed in the summer.</p>
<p>This coverlet was woven by Benjamin Hausman of Allentown, Pennsylvania, in 1842 -- it says so in the &quot;corner block.&quot; It&#39;s in amazingly good shape for a weaving that&#39;s 180 years old. The colors, especially the madder red and indigo blue wool, are still vivid. The coverlet is impressive and beautiful and keeps us mighty toasty at night.&#0160;</p>

<p>From August 1976 to summer 1977, we lived at this odd, modernistic house at 1 Leycroft Close in Canterbury, Kent. The small tree, something in the prunus line, wasn&#39;t there at the time so the house was more visible. The house wasn&#39;t suitable for a family of five, but we made it work, barely. Two blocks away was St. Stephen Protomartyr School, which the kids attended for a year. The boys learned to play soccer and the daughter learned how to speak with an English accent, which she forsook after two weeks back in the USA. The abandoned railroad embankment behind the house, loaded with blackberries and wild plums, afforded the kids much amusement.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Until this last week, when I read Patrik Svensson&#39;s<em> Book of Eels</em> (2019), I had never encountered either of these lovely and mysterious adjectives. I&#39;m delighted to add &quot;anadromous&quot; and <br />&quot;catadromous,&quot; along with their cousin &quot;diadromous&quot; to my vocabulary, though when I&#39;ll be able to drop any of these words into my quotidian or even hebdomadal discourse is not immediately obvious, especially inasmuch as I&#39;m not all that confident about their accentuation. Moreover, I rarely get into heart-to-hearts about icthyic migration.&#0160;</p>
<p>Anadromous fishes hatch and spend their first months in freshwater streams and rivers but then they migrate to the vasty deep, where they grow and mature. When they feel ready, they return to the streams in which they were spawned to deposit and fertilize their eggs. Salmons are famously anadromous (as well as romantic and celebrated), but equally so are less-heralded smelt, herring, and shad. Eels, on the other hand, are catadromous. They are hatched deep in the ocean and then drift and wander to freshwater streams and rivers. European eels may spend, according to Svensson, as many as fifteen years in the shallows until they get the urge for going. No one knows what calls to them, but they plain have to go. Then they set out for the dangerous Sargasso Sea in the mid-Atlantic. Eel reproduction has entirely evaded the eyes of human investigators.&#0160; Nor has a single eel egg ever been identified. Eels are modest, private, discreet. No one&#0160; knows if or how eels select their mates. Do they enact elaborate courtship rituals, or do the females simply lay their putative eggs amidst a cloud of eelish milt?</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef027880153e06200d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Screen Shot 2021-02-14 at 9.13.13 AM" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef027880153e06200d image-full img-responsive" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef027880153e06200d-800wi" title="Screen Shot 2021-02-14 at 9.13.13 AM" /></a></p>
<p>Eels are not kosher, but not because they are catadromous. The rules, as set out in <em>Leviticus,</em> are very clear: &quot;<em>Everything in the waters that has fins and scales, whether in the seas or in the rivers, you may eat. But anything in the seas or the rivers that has not fins and scales is detestable to you.&quot;&#0160;</em> Why the Lord of Hosts set His face against shrimp and clams is unknowable -- but it worked, in the sense that the religion survived and, some say, prospered for lo these three thousand years. Food taboos are a common feature of religions -- they help to separate<em> us</em> from <em>them. </em>But shouldn&#39;t taboos be minimally consistent?&#0160; If the author or authors of <em>Leviticus&#0160;</em>had said, don&#39;t eat eels, they&#39;re slimy, ugly and tasteless to boot -- well that would be a religious prohibition I could honor. But the scales thing, I don&#39;t know, because it&#39;s now clear that eels do have scales (as well as fins). Eel scales are very small. They are embedded in the skin, and they are smothered with eel slime. They are difficult to find, but they&#39;re definitely, unquestionably present. Yet the authorities continue to deride eels as <em>treyf </em>and have added the distinctly unBiblical gloss that the fish&#39;s scales must be visible and detachable without harming the skin. Unjust to eels, I say. I think they deserve a retrospective pass and a full rabbinical apology.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>My reasons for not eating eels are plain and sincere: eels are hideous beasts. Even Svensson, who loves eels and eel-fishing, admits that they are loathsome to any sensible palate.&#0160;</p>
<p>Query: my daughter was born and lived here in her home town until she was eighteen years old. Then she left for California, where she birthed and raised her two fine children. Now she&#39;s returned home to her native streams at last. So is she catadromous or anadromous?</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>In September of 2014 I wrote about a horrible tragedy that is commemorated in our cemetery -- the old West Bradford cemetery on Hackett Hill Road. Inasmuch as I&#39;ve lived adjacent to it these last 52 years, I feel a strange proprietary connection to the people it houses. I&#39;ve wandered in it, tended it, studied it, and cleaned up the trash left behind by visitors. I know that old burial ground very well.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s what I wrote seven years ago:&#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;The old West Bradford cemetery, which is carved out of our land, is peopled by the Worthleys, Hacketts, Kidders, and Sleepers who first settled this part of Vermont. Some of them were long lived, some wandered through this thoroughfare of woe only briefly. There are o-so-many of those sad stone lozenges at the foot of a grave that represent infants who died too young to be christened.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Our most disturbing gravestone, in my opinion, is the the one for Stanley Franklin Dwinell, M.D., born in 1920 and who died along with James Scott Dwinell (age 7), Peter Dewey Dwinell (age 6), and Jonathan Dwinell (age 2) all on the same day, December 11, 1952.&#0160;&#0160;What a horror, I thought -- a man and his three young sons all gone at once. A tragedy. But what sort?&#0160; A plane crash?&#0160; A boating accident? House fire?&#0160; Perhaps even an infectious disease.&#0160;</p>
<p>An internet search came up empty-handed, so I enquired of our longer-tenured neighbors. Here&#39;s the local legend as it was reported to me. &quot;Oh yes, the vet,&quot; I was told (although the tombstone distinctly says M. D., rather than D. V. M). &#0160;&quot;He was driving along Route 5 in Fairlee one winter morning and it was an icy road and foggy and he went out of control and all four of them died instantly. His wife was at home drinking a cup of coffee when she got the phone call. She left the coffee half-finished on the kitchen table, left the house without a word, and was never seen again. Didn&#39;t even take her clothes. Just disappeared.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>It&#39;s a dramatic, heartbreaking story that sounds like the plot of a short story by Alice Munro -- but I don&#39;t believe it, not a word of it. The same gravestone that records the four simultaneous deaths also asserts that Constance S. Dwinell, wife of Doctor Stanley Franklin Dwinell, died January 25, 1985, at age 65.&#0160;</p>
<p>I&#39;m trying to imagine the remainder of poor Constance&#39;s&#0160;life. It&#39;s hard to construct a scenario that isn&#39;t completely dreadful.&#0160;Most likely, Constance returned, shattered, to the small town in New Hampshire, let us say, where she must have been born.&#0160;She moved back into her parents&#39; house and took a job as a town librarian, her life blighted by the&#0160;tragedy.&#0160;She never remarried.</p>
<p>But I prefer to imagine that after a period of intense mourning, she moved to Paris (she had majored in French at Wellesley, I&#39;m guessing,) and never told a soul about her first family. There she was wooed and won by Baron Guy de Condorcet de Noialles but could never conceive a child. It was a long happy marriage. After Guy died, crashing his motorcycle on a winding Riviera road, she returned to the States a rich woman, and lived out her life in a Park Avenue apartment in New York. Friends and neighbors who had no idea of her first life were shocked when they read the will which specified that she be buried, along side Stanley and the children, right here in West Bradford.&#0160;</p>
<p>That&#39;s my story and I&#39;m sticking with it though I would very much like to know the truth.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Then a year later, I was contacted by Larry Coffin, president of the Bradford Historical Society. My local informant, it turns out, was all wrong about the circumstances of the accident. Mr Coffin wrote this: &quot;I would like to correct your information on Dr. Stanley Dwinell. He and his three sons were killed in a collision with a train on a crossing in Newbury, VT as he was going to treat a patient at Woodsville (NH) Cottage Hospital. His father Dr. Franklin Dwinell was in a car following.&quot;&#0160; Mr. Coffin did not comment on the half-finished coffee cup.</p>
<p>[February 11, 2021.&#0160; I&#39;ve now received the following communication from a correspondent who calls him/herself &quot;R&quot;. He or she is a &quot;descendant of Stanley&#39;s brother&quot; and has sent me the link to this article In the <em>Rutland Daily Herald.&#0160;&#0160;</em>How could I have missed it?</p>

<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>So that&#39;s a slightly different version of the horrible story. The details are different, but it&#39;s the same story in essence.</p>
<p>&quot;R&quot; also refers me to a letter in the <em>Bradford Opinion</em> by attorney Bud Otterman of Otterman and Allen. It offers other details from the prior accounts but it&#39;s no less tragic. &quot;Franklin Dwinell was a a longtime doctor in Bradford when I opened my law office in 1951. His son, Dr. Stanley Dwinell, had come home from World War II and joined his father&#39;s practice.Their patients went to the old Cottage Hospital near the railroad tracks in Woodsville. One of the doctors would visit their patients each morning. When Stanley went, he would often take his three pre-school sons with him. They would play in the waiting room while their dad made his rounds. The morning of December 11, 1952 was overcast with cold rain and snow in the air. About 11:30 am Dr Franklin Dwinell was called to an accident at the grade crossing south of Newbury Village. When he arrived, he found his son and his three grandson dead as a result of a collision with a southbound train. There were no warning lights at the crossing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;R&quot; also says that Constance (Stanley&#39;s wife and the mother of Dwinell children) &quot;wasn&#39;t alone after Stanley and the boys passed. They had an older daughter who was 7 and in school at the time of the accident. She&#39;s moved away from the area and is reportedly somewhere out west now.&quot;</p>
<p>The older daughter, Hannah Dwinell, would therefore be 76 years old, as I write this, if she is still alive. I feel for her. She had to overcome the loss of her father and three younger brothers. Such an event would leave an irremediable scar. I hope Hannah has had a good life. I wonder if she has ever returned to West Bradford. It would be most painful for her to do so.&#0160;</p>
<p>[I&#39;ve also written about &quot;my&quot; cemetery <a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2009/09/plastic-flowers.html">here</a>.]</p>

				<p>What an excellent invention! Imagine life without the blanket. At night, we&#39;d still be keeping warm with hay and leaves. Yeesh, defective insulation. Hay and hayseeds in our noses and mouths. Leaves, leaflets, thick main ribs and petioles poking and imprinting our skin. Constant renewal problems: &quot;Have remembered to fetch the hay for tonight yet?&quot; Cleanliness problems -- small insects in the hay and leaves, however carefully processed. And then frequent trips to &quot;Hay and Leaves&quot; -- the chain of stores that dominates the market. &quot;Do you know what they&#39;re asking this year for a half bale of leaves?&quot;</p>
<p>When we pull that luxurious blanket over our shoulders, do we remember to thank the inventor or inventors of the cotton or woolen blanket?&#0160; Are we sufficiently appreciative of the luxury in which we live?</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I was on a rubber raft in the middle of an ocean.&#0160; Three or four swordfish surrounded me. They were about to spear my raft and drown me -- because they wanted my pension.</p>
<p>I wondered how I was to transfer my wealth to them -- could they take it out in small, edible fish?</p>
<p>And so my dreamatorium continues to exceed expectations.</p>
<p>[February 13.&#0160; Still another &quot;I am lost&quot; dream, but this one with an unusual feature. I am at a subway kiosk, trying to get a token or change for a $20 bill so I can board the train, and the attendant says to me, &quot;do you want your change in money or in spaghetti?&quot; Honest to Pete, that&#39;s what she said. I say, of course, &quot;I&#39;ll have it in money, please,&quot; but nevertheless she hands me a pound of dry spaghetti, wrapped in cellophane or plastic, but already falling apart. I walk away with the pound of spaghetti and try to get rid of it by placing it on a window ledge, but a passer-by retrieves it and hands it back to me. &quot;You forgot your spaghetti,&quot; he says. Soon after I find a garbage can and stow the spaghetti, and the dream continues in predictable channels.<br /><br /></p>
<p>I think the question, &quot;Do you want your change in money or in spaghetti?&quot; is one of the best sentences my dreamatorium has ever generated.]</p>

				<div>The Tampa Bay Devil Rays now claim that they won the 2020 World Series against the Dodgers -- even though most of us saw the Dodgers win by a margin of 4 games to 2.&#0160; The Rays claim that in Game 5, two runs scored by Tampa Bay were nefariously credited to the Dodgers.

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2021/01/tails.html">Tails</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Most animals, mammals included, sport tails. As well they should. Tails are truly excellent appendages -- essential equipment for survival in many cases. Most primates have tails, but alas, the apes, our most immediate cousins, lack these useful &quot;limbs.&quot; Some random mutation, way back when, and zap, no more tails. As a result, we humans live in a tragically diminished universe. And deep down, we feel the loss -- it&#39;s a fact that humans have been desperately trying to grow tails for countless millennia. Embryo after embryo puts his or her whole heart into the effort. Tails are there, prominently, between day 31 to 37 of the gestational process, but then they disappear -- leaving the poor embryo dispirited and regretful. In mourning! How much happier a species we would be if we could only wag.&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Tails have many uses. For locomotion, obviously. We&#39;d be much better tree and monkey-bar climbers if we had good prehensile tails. We wouldn&#39;t be nearly so earthbound. There would be fewer dangerous falls if we had tails -- they&#39;re essential for balance. Just watch a cat or a squirrel. Plus a human with a tail could grab on to something to keep himself upright. A tail can also be used for defense. Grab the bad guy&#39;s arm with a good strong grasping tail. Think about how much more interesting the martial arts or wrestling would be if were were betailed. Imagine how useful a prehensile tail would be at a cocktail party; both your hands are occupied spreading the green stuff on the cracker, so you hold your wine glass with your tail.&#0160;</span></p>
<p>Tails are also good communicators; they&#39;re expressive. Observe <em>canis domesticus:&#0160;</em>submission, aggression, defiance, excitement, puzzlement. Tails would be important for parent child interactions. &quot;Don&#39;&#39;t you dare swish your tail at me, young lady.&quot; If dogs can do it, why couldn&#39;t we do it better?&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">And also sexual activity. Imagine the possibilities.&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Style: &quot;how are you wearing your tail this year?&quot; Billion dollar industries revolve around haircare. Tailcare offers even greater possibilities. I&#39;m sure that the expense of tail grooming, tail coloring, tail enhancing, and tail bejeweling could lift us out of most recessions. Tailcare would be one of the major drivers of the economy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Human life would have been infinitely richer.</span></p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>The coronavirus has been sorely inhibiting. It&#39;s no fun for me to keep a distance from members of my family with whom I&#39;m not podded up. But there&#39;s a benefit, because for a year now I haven&#39;t had a single anxiety attack over what a European acquaintance calls &quot;the dreaded American hug.&quot;&#0160; My needs for acknowledging friends and acquaintances have been well satisfied by an occasional and discreet elbow bump.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>I&#39;m not a hugger either by nature or by training -- my family of origin was, well, whatever is the diametrical opposite of &quot;touchy?&quot;</p>
<p>When did the hug creep into our lives? I suspect it had its origins in late 60s early 70s counter-culture. At least in my social circles -- that is. For all I know, the Brewsters might have regularly hugged the Bradfords back there in Mayflower days. Although not without massive attacks of disabling guilt.</p>
<p>When males want to hug me, I tend to shrink backwards. I don&#39;t want to give offense, so I offer as much hug as my hug-averse nature can tolerate. With women it&#39;s much more difficult -- because of the bosom problem. Too quick an embrace and you&#39;re unsociable, but one that lasts a second too long and you&#39;re a pervert. The best solution, I&#39;ve found, is the sideways hug -- just throw an arm around the lady&#39;s shoulder and briefly touch your right ribcase to her left. And then beat a retreat.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s bring back the straight-on traditional handshake. It&#39;s sensible and proven. And for goodness sake, no kissing each other&#39;s cheeks &quot;like them foreigners do.&quot;</p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2021/01/a-scots-quair.html">A Scots Quair</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I&#39;ve given over the last week or ten days to Lewis Grassic Gibbon&#39;s <em>A Scots Quair </em>and I&#39;m very pleased to have done so. And I&#39;m embarrassed that I&#39;ve only now read this strange brooding wondrous series of novels. How could I not have known? For those equally as ignorant as I, the<em> Quai</em>r is a trilogy -- <em>Sunset Song</em> (1932), <em>Cloud Howe</em> (1933) and <em>Grey Granite</em> (1934). Together they tell the story of Christine Guthrie from childhood -- about the turn of the century -- through the years of the Great Depression. I can&#39;t remember reading a piece of fiction that has so thoroughly engaged me, or encountering&#0160; a fictional character so fully realized as Chris Guthrie Tavendale Colquhoun Ogilvie.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a picture of Gibbon (birth name: James Leslie Mitchell) who died at age 34 from a botched surgery.</p>
<p><a class="image" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Leslie-mitchell.jpg"><img alt="" class="thumbimage" data-file-height="403" data-file-width="272" decoding="async" height="326" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Leslie-mitchell.jpg/220px-Leslie-mitchell.jpg" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/Leslie-mitchell.jpg 1.5x" width="220" /></a></p>
<p>The novels do for the northeast corner of Scotland what Thomas Hardy did for the southwest of England. Gibbon&#39;s corner of Scotland is traditional agrarian society beset by doctrinaire religion, industrialization, war, and the Great Depression. The novels range from extremely brutal to marvelously lyrical. They are not without defect: sometimes too long, often too preachy. Occasionally, I felt that I was being treated to a Scottish version of &quot;orientalism&quot;: Scotism, perhaps. The books want condensation, editing; sometimes I felt that I was reading a first draft -- but Gibbon wrote fifteen books in seven years, so signs of haste are inevitable. Gibbon might be called a local colorist or a social realist, but he&#39;s much more. His feel for the landscape and for history is unparalleled.</p>
<p>In subject matter and tone, <em>A Scots Quair</em> reminds me most of Halldor Laxness&#39;s great Icelandic novel, I<em>ndependent People.&#0160;</em>It&#39;s also like one of Hardy&#39;s Wessex novels, but funnier, more playful, and yes, more sensual. There are stream-of-consciousness speeches that recall Faulkner and passages that might have been written by James Joyce (not the Joyce of<em> Ulysses</em> but the Joyce of <em>Portrait)</em>.&#0160; A much neglected masterpiece.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>It&#39;s been a rough year what with the madman president and the covid pandemic. And also deaths and diseases among my close friends. I have at least ten male friends who&#39;ve lost their wives after long marriages. Some have bounced back, some will never get over the grief. At the beginning of 2020, I made a joke:&#0160; &quot;it&#39;s going to be the year of the ophthalmologist.&quot; It turned out to be the year of the thanatologist.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I can honestly say that my dominant mood is one of gratitude.</p>
<p>Grateful that I&#39;ve lived a long life, mostly healthily, and that my children and grandchildren are thriving. I&#39;m not rich, but I&#39;ve never missed a meal for want of cash.&#0160;</p>
<p>When my father was my age, he was crippled with arthritis and he was widowed, living a sad solitary life. I take long walks in the mountains and have a new love in my life.</p>
<p>As of today, 1.1 million Americans have been vaccinated against the virus. There will be errors and disruptions and scandals, but in a few months we&#39;ll be mostly back to normal. And I believe and hope that our wonderful country will survive this accidental lunatic presidency.</p>

<div class="fxgdke">Although she&#39;s surrounded by a bunch of official looking executives, she runs the show. Miss Drake owns and manages factory that manufactures automobiles. She&#39;s in a male preserve -- it&#39;s not a cosmetic factory or something more traditionally feminine. And she loves the work and the power.</div>
<div class="fxgdke">&#0160;</div>
<div class="fxgdke">The film might have been called <em>Alison Drake </em>but no, it&#39;s <em>Female -- </em>and therefore claims to describe not just one individual woman but an entire gender. Does it? At best, the film is mighty confused -- and at worst, reactionary in the extreme.</div>
<div class="fxgdke">&#0160;</div>
<div class="fxgdke">In the first half of the film, Alison Drake is not only an extremely competent executive, but she&#39;s also sexually liberated. It&#39;s her habit to bring home attractive men, seduce them, and, if they get the least bit soppy, transfer them to the Montreal office. She&#39;s one happy --although heartless -- &quot;cougar.&quot; Then she meets her match in the person of young handsome (before he grew that silly little mustache) George Brent, who responds to her advances by saying, &quot;I was hired as an engineer, not as a gigolo.&quot;&#0160; All of a sudden, Miss Drake goes all weak in the knees, falls in love, and decides to marry the man. She puts him in charge of the factory and plans to stay home in order to achieve the apotheosis of femininity by having &quot;nine children.&quot;</div>
<div class="fxgdke">&#0160;</div>
<div class="fxgdke">The disappointing ending seems to be pasted on rather than organic. Many a film in the Code era set out to challenge the &quot;tune of the time&quot; but threw in the conventional towel because of the Hays Office. <em>Female&#0160;</em>is disappointing because it voluntarily chooses to go all squishy when it wasn&#39;t necessary.</div>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>&quot;Kith and kin&quot; is an excellent example of a &quot;pairing&quot; -- sometimes called a &quot;coordinate pair.&quot; A pairing is a linguistic event in which two words join to produce a single meaning.</p>
<p>&quot;Kith&quot; has no independent existence nowadays and only exists as an element of the pair. &quot;Kith and kin&quot; means &quot;family.&quot; Originally, back then, &quot;kith&quot; meant &quot;known&quot; and therefore signified &quot;friends.&quot; &quot;Kith and kin&quot; was &quot;friends and relatives.&quot; No longer; now it means &quot;family and family.&quot; &quot;Time and tide&quot; is another fine pairing; &quot;tide&quot; meant &quot;time&quot; centuries before it came to refer to the moony fluctuation of the seas, although its older meaning survives in &quot;eventide,&quot; &quot;Yuletide,&quot; and similar words. Now &quot;time and tide&quot; seems to evoke the inevitability of both clock and waves -- both of them joined to wait for no man. &quot;Kit and kaboodle&quot; is also a lovely pairing, because &quot;kaboodle&quot; lacks independent existence. It may derive from &quot;boodle&#39; -- a thief&#39;s bundle -- with the &quot;ka&quot; added just for the fun of it. &quot;Dribs and drabs&quot; is more obscure in origin and may not be a true pairing. &quot;Dribs&quot; is probably a variant of &quot;drip&quot; but &quot;drab&quot; was in times past not a small amount of something or other, but an untidy or unchaste woman. It&#39;s possible that &quot;dribs and drabs,&quot; now a rather neat pairing, is better thought of as a reduplicative like mumbo-jumbo or hoity-toity. &quot;Nook and cranny&quot; is a pairing in which both elements survive independently; &quot;nook&quot; originally a corner of a room, and &quot;cranny&quot; a narrow space in which a brown recluse might hide. When someone or something grows by leaps and bounds, it&#39;s hard to tell which is the leap and which the bound. The same with &quot;hot and bothered&quot; -- the two words simply reinforce each other. Similarly, a person might want to &quot;pick and choose&quot; between alternatives, but to do so requires only one action. &quot;Flotsam and jetsam&quot; is an amusing pairing of uncertain origin. It is often thought that flotsam lies on the surface of the water and jetsam is thrown into it, but such a definition might be merely a folk etymology derived from the words &quot;float&quot; and &quot;jettison.&quot; A &quot;hoot and a holler&quot; both refer to shouting, but now they mean &quot;shouting distance.&quot; &quot;Stuff and nonsense&quot; is obvious, but what sort of &quot;stuff&quot; is nonsensical? Perhaps it&#39;s the very vagueness of &quot;stuff&quot; that it allows it to pair up and reinforce &quot;nonsense.&quot; &quot;Alack and alas&quot; is a weary but euphonious pair. &quot;Wrack and ruin&quot; becomes more transparent when it&#39;s remembered that wrack is a variant&#0160; form of wreck -- as &quot;beck and call&quot; becomes clearer when it is recalled that &quot;beck&quot; is a foreshortened version of &quot;beckon.&quot; The cry in &quot;hue and cry&quot; is obvious; the hue is thought to derive from the OF verb <em>huer (</em>shout).&#0160;</p>
<p>Null and void, bag and baggage, prim and proper, vim and vigor, are self-explanatory.</p>
<p>Bits and pieces are sometimes called odds and ends. That&#39;s the long and the short of it.&#0160;Jot and tittle have been thoroughly researched and explicated <a href=" https://www.drmetablog.com/2019/10/jot-and-tittle.html">here.</a></p>
<p>Is &quot;footloose and fancy-free&quot; a pairing. Yes, I think so. An energetic and imaginative pairing.&#0160;</p>

				<p>Once again, I was lost, this time in a strange city -- apparently, I was trying to drive from somewhere down south all the way to Vermont.&#0160; We park the car and my companion (a guy totally unknown to me, by the way) asks a traffic cop the name of the city at which we&#39;ve arrived. The policeman says to my friend, &quot;ay, ya&quot; and my friend says to me, and I quote this lunatic absurdity absolutely <em>verbatim</em>, no embroidery whatsoever, &#39;He says we&#39;re in&#0160; ay-ya, which is West Indian for New Brunswick, New Jersey.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;West Indian for New Brunswick, New Jersey?&quot;&#0160; Goodness gracious, is that creative, or what? Another brilliant achievement of my dreamatorium.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<div>Along with everyone of my generation, I&#39;ve been worrying about my deteriorating memory. There are these horrible moments. I stand in front of the open refrigerator, wondering what I&#39;m doing there and for what I&#39;m searching. Or I go the market and then forget to bring the groceries in from the car -- that sort of thing. Is it normal deterioration or is it pathological?</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>So I&#39;m happy to bring some good news -- no, remarkable news from the memory front.</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>A couple of nights ago, Miss Reynolds and I watched the worst movie we&#39;ve seen in many a year. It&#39;s called <em>Johnny Guitar,</em> a it&#39;s a &quot;western&quot; perpetrated in 1954. It&#39;s an unholy mess of pretentious but incoherent plot, absurd characters, goofy dialogue and atrocious acting. We watched it right to the end because it was so bad bad bad that it became amusing. The film is so beyond crappy that it has been praised as authentically American by both Godard and Truffaut.</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>About three-quarters of the way through, I said to Miss Reynolds that the actor who played the villainous &quot;Dancin&#39; Kid&quot; -- his name, no joke, and he actually performs a few steps with Mercedes McCambridge, who if overacting were a crime, would have served a life sentence in a supermax facility -- that the actor, billed as &quot;Scott Brady&quot; looked a lot like Lawrence Tierney, a no-longer-remembered &quot;heavy&quot; who had starred in &quot;Born to Kill&quot; (1947), which we had watched a couple of months ago.</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>Let me burnish this feat. I proposed that so-called &quot;Scott Brady&quot; resembled Lawrence Tierney. What a remarkable and daring assertion!&#0160;</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>So after <em>Johnny Guitar&#0160;</em>came to its ludicrous conclusion, bullets flying everywhere, I looked up so-called &quot;Scott Brady,&quot; the &quot;Dancin&#39; Kid,&quot; on Wikipedia&#0160; and discovered that his birth name was Gerard Tierney and that he was indeed the younger brother of Lawrence Tierney.&#0160;</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>I got to say I spent a few minutes crowing. I mean, really, noticing the resemblance and recalling the name of an obscure actor whom we had hardly noticed months ago -- what a coup! What a feat! I could hear the hallelujahs ring throughout our valley.</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>I didn&#39;t think that Miss Reynolds was sufficiently effusive in praise of my achievement -- although she did her best -- so I went to the window, opened it and shouted into the street, very loud, these words: &quot;In <em>Johnny Guitar</em>, Scott Brady is Lawrence Tierney&#39;s younger brother Gerard.&quot; No doubt putting the Governor&#39;s security detail on Code Red alert.</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>After a few minutes, I wanted to do it again, but Miss R. talked me down.</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>The next day, I bragged to my children and their spouses about my achievement. One of my daughters-in-law, CKNC, wrote back that on reading my news, she went to her front door, opened it, and shouted, &quot;My father-in-law knew that in J<em>ohnny Guitar</em>, the actor Scott Brady is Lawrence Tierney&#39;s younger brother Gerard.&quot;&#0160; An entirely appropriate and measured response on her part, in my opinion.</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>My point is that a guy who can identify Lawrence Tierney&#39;s brother shouldn&#39;t worry about brain decay for at least a month or two.&#0160;</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>I don&#39;t know in what part of the brain information about Lawrence Tierney is stored. Certainly not the part that doesn&#39;t let you know why you&#39;re peering into the open refrigerator.&#0160;&#0160;</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>I should also point out that I&#39;ve recently received confirmation of the excellence of my amygdalae:&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;<a data-auth="Verified" href="https://eur06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.drmetablog.com%2F2020%2F11%2Fspider.html&amp;data=04%7C01%7C%7C23831fbd5f454461583208d8962998c6%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C637424452683952235%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;sdata=ytKrDlFAcpqG%2BIApTLB2EdxexCse%2FzjmakkW6NpiJy0%3D&amp;reserved=0" id="x_x_gmail-m_-7905439514175650523gmail-m_6139049933401859278m_220720323628700977LPlnk" originalsrc="https://www.drmetablog.com/2020/11/spider.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" shash="i4sbXs2NRhWiCwdbFfHoSRsS4gi1lk9OSj805BTHyfiLrEp6p4NKCMCLdkshaA4UUekW3+HGMd0/w7sD3+1XNNSIeNzDN5v955g4HCsnhhVtyhKw8g4Hlek9fBd261KrPvVSZUTpYdWfwVr246lWI4UIt7awqObX2exNZHoDj9o=" target="_blank" title="Protected by Outlook: https://www.drmetablog.com/2020/11/spider.html.

<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>So there&#39;s hope.</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>[December 18:&#0160; Last night we watched, on TCM of course, a movie called <em>Passion Flower&#0160;</em>(1930), an interesting tale of love and marriage and adultery and reconciliation and compromise. Definitely pre-Code. At one point, there&#39;s a party scene.&#0160; A very young man says his good-byes.&#0160; Both Ms. R and I immediately said, &quot;that&#39;s a familiar face. Who is he?&quot; And I said, &quot;his voice sounds a lot like Ray Milland&#39;s.&quot; Later that evening we look it up on Wiki. Here&#39;s the news: &quot;first screen appearance of Ray Milland, uncredited.&quot;&#0160;</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>Another astonishing feat -- this time of voice recognition. The old guy still has it, some of the time.]</div>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Last night, I was lying in bed comfortably reading Michael Kulikowski&#39;s excellent new book on the last years of the Roman Empire. I was concentrating very hard, because it&#39;s difficult for me to retain the decisions made at Nicaea in 325. I can read a paragraph about the Arian or some other &quot;heresy&quot; and five minutes later I can&#39;t remember who was on what side, or why it matters, except that those on the wrong side were liable to be burnt alive. What part of the brain is supposed to retain this stuff?&#0160; In any case, I was lost in the book, quite content, comfortable -- supportive mattress, soft pillow and all that -- while, unbeknownst to me, a spider was making its way up the backside of the book cover. Why? Where did it come from?&#0160; All I know is that it rounded the bend, so to speak, nonchalantly strolling into view at the very top of the verso page.</p>
<p>Immediately the most primitive part of my brain was activated, I elevated out of the bed like some sort of 1950s cartoon character, hovered for a second or two, and then found myself on the floor, frantically flapping the sheets and blankets, searching for the offending arachnid. Get him before he gets me!</p>
<p>If I understand what happened, the amygdala, the part of the brain that&#39;s in charge of fear, governed my actions. The amygdala has been producing fear and flight responses long before it came to be incorporated into <em>homo sapiens</em>.&#0160;</p>
<p>After a few minutes we (I had called in auxiliaries) located the offending guy, and he&#39;s now sitting on my desk in a tightly sealed Bonne Maman jam jar.</p>
<p><img alt="what does the brown recluse spider look like?" class="alignright size-full wp-image-3089" height="200" src="https://plunketts.net/uploads/blog/0492d312-f84a-439a-8595-179a442556e1/brown-recluse-look.jpg" width="300" /></p>
<p>I think it&#39;s a brown recluse. It sure looks like one. The color and shape are right out of the official catalog. According to the authorities, the only foolproof way to ascertain if it&#39;s a brown recluse is to count its eyes -- six rather than the usual spidery eight. But anyone who thinks that I&#39;m going to get close enough to this spider to count its eyes has another think coming. Brown recluses are rare in our part of the world, but they&#39;re not unknown. My book came via interlibrary loan from Laramie, Wyoming; perhaps the spider came along for the ride.</p>
<p>Why be frightened of a brown recluse the size of a quarter, legs extended?&#0160; &quot;Brown recluse bites can inflict significant or even life-threatening damage. Bites may cause severe pain, ulcers, fever, chills, nausea, joint pain, or even seizures.&quot;&#0160; Also, necrosis. Scars from necrotic flesh can last a lifetime. A friend of a friend lost a few months of his life and a hunk of gluteus maximus to a bite on the butt.&#0160;</p>
<p>The spider is quite active now in its new home -- the jam jar. It&#39;s a beautifully engineered little creature and very industrious, unceasing in its determination to find the way out. I admire it, behind glass, and I probably share a lot of DNA with it -- though it&#39;s hard to feel a close kinship.&#0160;</p>
<p>The &quot;take-away&quot;: even though some parts of my brain have deteriorated, my amygdalae are in splendid working order.</p>

				<p>What factors led a city boy, age 28, to purchase a rural property where he has now passed fifty glorious summers? Where he is as happy as a lark with a packet of seeds and a pruner, rake, and hoe.</p>
<p>It all began with my father&#39;s love for his backyard garden. &quot;Have you ever seen a more perfect flower than this?&quot; he would ask, pointing me to one of his splendid hybrid teas. During the growing season, he&#39;d come home from work at 6:00 p.m. on the dot, hurry through supper, change out of his lawyer suit into his old clothes, and get to work. I never saw him more contented. He cultivated his 30&#39; by 40&#39; plot with the assiduity of a Javanese terrace farmer. I watched him carefully and participated when he would let me. I studied, with the concentrated attention of childhood, the growth habits of snapdragons, sweet peas, and marigolds. Then one year I was allotted a square foot of space, right next to the dwarf peach, in which to plant seeds of my choice.&#0160; I chose a pumpkin, a vine that did not recognize boundaries, and produced two astonishingly large fruits. The die was cast.</p>
<p>There was also my maternal grandmother Sonia, originally a country girl, who never bought an orange or a grapefruit but that she planted its seeds on the window sill -- in one of those old wooden Philadelphia cream cheese boxes. Her tiny apartment had a pleasant hothouse-y odor. She loved her seedlings.</p>
<p>And then there were the three summers (&#39;47, &#39;48, &#39;49) which my family spent on Makamah Beach near Northport on the Long Island Sound. It was my original rural experience, and the earliest hint that there were places other than concrete and chain-link-fence Flatbush. It was the first time in my life that I felt at ease in the landscape.</p>
<p>I must not forget the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, where I spent many a happy hour. I remember in particular its famous Japanese garden. There was also a bank of colorful bottlebrush buckeyes that caught my youthful fancy. Many years later, I tried to reproduce that bloom in my Vermont garden. The curve and slope of the land were ideal, but the plant itself was not for our subarctic winters. The buckeye has survived, barely, for forty years now and has never produced a single flower, nor ever will.</p>
<p>It was at the BBG that I learned that gardening was not just about growing the biggest pumpkin -- it was about aesthetics and design. I started to read about the history of gardens and whenever I traveled I detoured to visit the great examples: the Huntington, Dunbarton Oaks, the Winterthur in Delaware. And scores more, all intimidating because they were created with the help of enormous fortunes, huge spaces, and unlimited supplies of labor. Good thing I had my father&#39;s example of &quot;much in little.&quot;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>In the mid 1980s, thirty-five years ago, I was &#39;in residence&#39; for a week at the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, D.C., researching an article on one of the lesser English Renaissance dramatists -- a pleasure as well as a condition of employment. The article that I completed turned out to be not a bad piece of academic prose, if I do say so myself, but not something for the ages either. It was a mere twenty years since I had completed my degree in &quot;English and American Language and Literature&quot; at a Large Eastern University, specifically Harvard. I was not drawn to the Folger for professional reasons only. It was a delight and a great privilege to hold in my very own hands and to read dozens and scores of four-hundred-year-old ephemeral books that -- more than the canonical literature -- helped me to understand the age of Shakespeare. Sermons by the wagonload, biblical commentaries, almanacs, political pamphlets, poems by minor and unknown versifiers, broadsides, medical textbooks, collections of jokes, how-to-write-a-letter-in-Latin trots, schoolbooks. The library possessed inexhaustible troves of such material. The Folger&#39;s plenty licensed my dilettante brain to follow its own naturally wayward inclinations.</p>
<p>While doing my duty and also having some fun, I fell in with a fellow Folgerite named Boyd Berry who was visiting from Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, Virginia. Over cups of coffee, Boyd and I discussed some of the less well-known writers of the period in whom we shared a mutual interest. I remember that we also talked about the teacher&#39;s perennial frustration at engaging the interest of our sometimes less-than-enthusiastic students. I do not remember what prompted me to ask Boyd this question: &quot;what was the worst course that you ever took either as an undergraduate or graduate student.&quot; He replied, without hesitation, &quot;Douglas Bush&#39;s lecture course on Milton at Harvard in 1961.&quot; I was flabbergasted, in part because I hadn&#39;t guessed that Boyd had been at Harvard during my years there, but more because I had enrolled in exactly the same course -- same time same station same year -- and because Douglas Bush&#39;s Milton course was also my own nominee for the worst course ever. Parallel lines had accidentally and miraculously met, so to speak. Although Boyd and I were the same age, he was one year behind me and had taken the course as a senior undergraduate while I had been a first-year graduate student. It seemed an astonishing coincidence, but then, the universe of students of English Renaissance literature is a small one. Nevertheless, the fact that we shared the same opinion about Professor Bush&#39;s course was comforting and, as they say, &quot;validating.&quot; Boyd said out loud words that I had only speculated upon <em>in petto</em>. Perhaps I wasn&#39;t the only outlier.</p>
<p>Why were we in such accord? The obvious answer is that Professor Bush, then in the tail end of his much-celebrated career (he had uttered his infant cries during Grover Cleveland&#39;s second presidency), was tired and bored by his teaching and put little heart into the work. In brief, he droned, unconscionably. Not only did he drone, but it seemed as though there was an invisible shield between his podium and our seats. He didn&#39;t speak to us -- he addressed the empyrean. His lectures consisted of a superficial running commentary on Milton&#39;s poems. &quot;There&#39;s a particularly lovely passage starting on line 695,&quot; -- as if a challenging idea would be beyond our collective capacity. If a student broke into the drone to hazard a question, Professor Bush&#39;s characteristic answer was, &quot;Well, that seems self-explanatory.&quot; But Bush&#39;s classroom style was not the only reason for my unhappiness; I had more substantive concerns.&#0160;</p>
<p>Let me interject a few words about Professor John Nash Douglas Bush. Although almost forgotten today, Bush was by all odds the most formidable and learned literary scholar of his generation. He knew everything there was to know about English, Romance, and classical literature and had written a dozen comprehensive critical and historical books. If the gossip can be trusted, he greeted the dawn of each new day by reading two hundred lines of Latin poetry and a hundred of Greek. I am sure that he knew more about John Milton than Milton knew about himself. He had edited the volume of Milton&#39;s complete poetry (English, Latin, Greek, and Italian) and, astonishingly, had memorized the entire twelve books of <em>Paradise Lost.</em> He was an exacting scholar and a stylish and witty writer. Moreover, he was a kindly, gentle man, cordial and generous to his students -- even to me. If he had flaws of character, I didn&#39;t know of them. To my mind, he was an unimpeachably excellent person and scholar -- and at the same time a teacher from whom I learned just about nothing.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>I was once invited -- along with a clutch of my ambitious graduate-school classmates -- to some sort of reception at Professor Bush&#39;s Cambridge residence. His home was exactly as it should have been -- that is to say, if one were making a movie about a distinguished Harvard professor, one&#39;s location scout would not rest until he discovered the Bush quarters. It was a spacious and civilized home presided over by gracious Mrs. Bush, who was also exactly as she should have been. I remember that the giant main room in the house -- which must once have been two or more large rooms that had been sutured together, was Professor Bush&#39;s enormous study. It was more like an institutional library than something to be found in a private home. Just as one would expect, the study was lined floor to ceiling with handsome wooden bookcases chock full of an enviable display of publications in many languages, some of which I could identify. I remember being served sherry, I think, and also something preternaturally green and fishy on an unfamiliar but I&#39;m sure very elite kind of cracker. This dream of an academic utopia filled me with envy. It also scared the living blazes out of me. Why? Because for all Professor Bush&#39;s elegance and his library, and his lovely deferential wife, his movie-set home struck me as soft, fey, self-satisfied, and bloodless. I was dazzled and intimidated by its splendors but at the same time wary and resistant. Only five years beyond crowded Erasmus Hall High School in darkest Brooklyn, I knew myself well enough to know that, however seductive, his style of life was not for me. I would have to find a more appropriate path.&#0160;</p>
<p>Now I want to step further back and report on two cases in which I was in conflict with Professor Douglas Bush. Actually, the conflicts were only on my side; Professor Bush, Olympian and serene, did not notice -- nor should he have, frankly. These incidents continue to haunt me to this day, sixty years after the fact. Both occurred not in the Milton course, but in an &quot;advanced&quot; seminar called &quot;Science and Humanism in the Seventeenth Century.&quot; I must explain that the word &quot;humanism&quot; did not carry the meaning that it does today, as in the phrase &quot;secular humanism&quot; -- an approach to the natural world that is allied with agnosticism and which sometimes resolves into pure atheism. Professor Bush&#39;s humanism was the altogether different &quot;Christian humanism.&quot; It was, in brief, the noble but ultimately unsuccessful Renaissance attempt to fuse the &quot;inspired&quot; and &quot;revealed&quot; truths of Christianity with the thoughtful, upstanding but unfortunately &quot;natural&quot; morality of the Greeks and Romans. If &quot;Christian Humanism&quot; could be distilled to a sentence, it would be Desiderius Erasmus&#39; daring speculation -- that he would like someday to be able to say, &quot;Sancte Socrates, ora pro nobis&quot;, or &quot;Saint Socrates, pray for us.&quot;</p>
<p>I was a humanist of the secular variety -- by birth, inclination, education and because in my brain there was no place, not even a lone neuron, where &quot;faith&quot; or &quot;prayer&#39; or &quot;worship&quot; might in more standard heads be lodged. Bush, on the other hand, was not just a scholar of Christian Humanism, he was an honest-to-god trapped-in-amber Christian Humanist -- and a devout one, deeply rooted and entirely comfortable in late medieval/early renaissance thinking. In his seminar on Science and Humanism, humanism was right and just, and science, its antagonist, was, if not altogether bad, at a minimum a very dangerous alternative. Did not both Bacon and Descartes assert that &quot;nature&quot; -- the real world -- could be studied directly, on its own terms, rather than as an entity infused with god&#39;s being and majesty. That we mortals might study nature not to reaffirm the goodness and omnipotence of god, but to accumulate objective knowledge and to reap practical material benefits. It&#39;s a fact that the separation of nature from the &quot;truth&quot; of religion has over the centuries unquestionably led to the marginalizing of Christian thinking and therefore, according to Bush&#39;s view of the world, to the steep decline of civilization. The world, no longer driven by revelation, has been going to hell in a heathen hand basket, as Professor Bush said or implied every Tuesday at 4:00 pm.</p>
<p>Regular readers of this blague as well as Dr. Metablog&#39;s family and friends will recognize that Youthful Me did not accept Bush&#39;s premises. In fact, in those days, I was probably even less open to religious ideas than I am now. And therefore, each Tuesday was a day of discomfort.</p>
<p>And then, one afternoon, Professor Bush began the allotted two hours by launching a surprise assault on the then-new and controversial Third Edition of the Merriam-Webster dictionary. The Third had shocked traditionalists. Until 1962, dictionaries had been &quot;prescriptive &quot;-- that is, they explained how language &quot;should&quot; be used and they stigmatized as <em>colloq</em>. or <em>subst. </em>[substandard] those words or expressions that fell beneath the bar. The Third forsook tradition and was not prescriptive but descriptive. It aimed to record the language as it was really used. The Third therefore included many words hitherto banned as slang or vulgar and it was loose and permissive with regard to &quot;shall&quot; and &quot;will&quot;, and &quot;imply&quot; and &quot;infer,&quot; etc. For Professor Bush, the Third was a plunge into darkness -- another example of the collapse of Western Civilization as we know it, or should know it. So he excoriated the new dictionary and its editors and its supporters. The tirade having been completed, he turned mildly to the class and asked if anyone present had a different opinion. Now I had learned a little about modern linguistics at Cornell, and I was a descriptivist both by education and democratic instinct, and I knew that Bush was completely out of step with contemporary thought. I was astonished to discover that I knew more about this particular field of knowledge than he. But, alas, I was totally intimidated and did not open my mouth. What abject cowardice on my part! Nary a word did I say, and so the class segued to a discussion of the Cambridge Platonists and their vain attempt to tame and assimilate Descartes and Spinoza. I still wonder if any of the other 2G&#39;s around the table were aware of my shame. Probably not -- did my peers, the late Arthur Oberg, the late Jake Mills, the late Brian Hepworth, the late Terry Logan, the late Bill Godshalk, and others whose names I have forgotten, notice my moral collapse? I suppose that it&#39;s too late to worry. Nevertheless, my failure to raise my hand and voice still humiliates me, still rankles.&#0160;</p>
<p>Another Tuesday, another surrender. In 1961, William Empson published his innovative study, <em>Milton&#39;s God</em>. While Empson was not as learned as Professor Bush (no one was) he was a much more imaginative and challenging reader. Some say that after Johnson and Hazlitt, Sir William has been English literature&#39;s most insightful critic. Empson was an intellectual and social dissenter (he had been banished from Magdalen College, Cambridge when a condom [horrors!] was discovered among his possessions). He had written two highly influential critical books that every serious mid-century student of literature studied -- the first on ambiguity, the second on pastoral. Empson read <em>Paradise Lost</em> through a very different lens than Bush. He was not a Christian; in fact, he confessed himself anti-Christian because he judged there to be a serious moral flaw at the heart of the religion -- that the sacrifice of Jesus was a highly elaborated form a scapegoating. About <em>Paradise Lost,&#0160;</em>he concluded that God (that is, the character God in the epic) was confused and contradictory, repeatedly tying himself into logical and rhetorical knots in order to justify the unjustifiable. He also argued that irrespective of Milton&#39;s intention, the character God became more complex and interesting when he became less ideological and more dramatic; more, so to speak, human. He revered <em>Paradise Lost</em>, but for his own, not Bush&#39;s, reasons. <em>Milton&#39;s God</em> was trashed by Professor Bush, who dismissed Empson as a simple &quot;village atheist.&quot; I was stunned. True enough that Empson was an atheist, but true also that he was a powerful thinker, not someone to be given the back of the hand with a flippant <em>ad hominem</em>. Bush&#39;s review came out in <em>The New York Times</em> on a Sunday; the following Tuesday, our teacher was lauded by my fellow seminarians. He basked in their admiration. Did my young colleagues genuinely agree with Bush, or were they egregious sycophantic toadies? I don&#39;t know and will never know. And then, after the celebration, Bush asked, as if he were open-minded, &quot;Does anyone here have a different opinion?&quot; If Empson had been summarily dispatched, what chance had I? So once again, I fled the field, remained mute -- and slunk deeper into my expensive leather chair.&#0160;</p>
<div class="text parbase text-56 section">So there they were, my two abject failures of nerve.</div>
<div class="text parbase text-56 section">&#0160;</div>
<div class="text parbase text-56 section">Have I flagellated myself sufficiently?&#0160;</div>
<div class="text parbase text-56 section">&#0160;</div>
<div class="text parbase text-56 section">But now I also remember a third Science and Humanism event -- the Tuesday that Professor Bush fell asleep.</div>
<div class="text parbase text-56 section">&#0160;</div>
<div class="text parbase text-56 section">The class routine was for members of the seminar to offer a ten-minute presentation on the topic of the day, after which Professor Bush would initiate discussion with the unfocussed inquiry, &quot;Any questions, or comments? &quot; At which point I would yearn for my Cloak of Invisibility. One fatal day, the student in question was John Knott, a fine and intelligent youth but not a ball of fire, oratorically speaking. When he brought his effort to a close, there at the head of the table sat Professor Bush, eyes closed, breathing rhythmically, his large round head bobbling on his small round body, lost in blissful slumber. A few seconds went by, then some more seconds, a minute, a minute and a half. Thanks be to all the gods in the pantheon that he did not snore! And yet there we all were, arrayed around that splendid dark mahogany table, frozen. No one moved or even twitched, no one spoke, no one made eye contact with a fellow sufferer. No one breathed. It was unbearable. At last, after another twenty or so ticks of the clock, I had endured all I could endure, and I raised my <em>Complete Poetry of John Milton</em> into the air and was just about to let it slam, when Professor Bush opened his eyes, and without the slightest acknowledgement that something unusual had occurred, intoned the familiar words: &quot;Any questions, or comments?&quot;&#0160;</div>
<div class="text parbase text-56 section">&#0160;</div>
<div class="text parbase text-56 section">I do not recall this event in order to nip at Professor Bush&#39;s revered heels. Every teacher is entitled, occasionally in a long career, to lose focus while a beginning graduate student discourses on a volume such as Henry More&#39;s <em>Explanation of the Grand Mystery of Godliness </em>(an important-in-its-own-day [1660] monograph eloquent in support of rational providentialism and the preexistence of the soul). For all I know, Professor Bush may have been exhausted because he had been up past the midnight hour Monday night, possibly contributing more to scholarship in an evening than I did in an entire career. In hindsight, it was not the sleep itself that distressed me -- it was the passivity and silence of my fellows -- and the fact that when I remained silent I&#0160; honored the charade, the falsehood, that Bush was not asleep. Faced with an emperor&#39;s-new-clothes opportunity, I punted.&#0160;</div>
<div class="text parbase text-56 section">&#0160;</div>
<div class="text parbase text-56 section">Just as I had failed to defend modern linguistics, had failed to defend the &quot;village atheist,&quot; so I failed to bang my book on the board -- an act which would have been forthright and honest and true to myself. The first two events were disgraces of an intellectual kind; the third was one of manners and, I think, of social class. The alliance of Bush and Harvard had overwhelmed me, taken from me my natural freedom of action. Let me confess that it was a secret guilty pleasure to have been accepted into Harvard&#39;s kind embrace. I feared banishment. Would I have still been welcome, would I have been worthy, would I have been a gentleman if I had noisily ended the nightmare. I felt, and I feel to this day, that all of us around the table were in an implicit, unacknowledged conspiracy not to notice the obvious so that we could protect the reverend professor and therefore defend the institutions that he exemplified. We contrived not to notice Bush&#39;s well-earned snooze because to do so would have punctured the balloon. It would been bad manners, barbaric manners, and to exhibit bad manners in a wood-paneled seminar room would mean that we were not genteel, not civilized, unworthy of Harvard and of the privileges it bestowed on us.&#0160;</div>
<div class="text parbase text-56 section">&#0160;</div>
<div class="text parbase text-56 section">On the other hand, I myself had only twenty-two years on my scrawny back, and was just five years out of rambunctious Erasmus Hall High School in Flatbush, where if a teacher were to fall asleep in class, he would within seconds have been met with derisive catcalls and a squadron of paper airplanes. And I admit that, although I conformed myself superficially to the ways of my &quot;betters,&quot; I had enough of a residual catcall-and-paper-airplane soul that I have regretted my inaction now these sixty years.&#0160;</div>
<div class="text parbase text-56 section">&#0160;</div>
<div class="text parbase text-56 section">Family, friends and stray internet pilgrims: perhaps you think that I&#39;m making too much of these trivial long-ago-and-far-away events. Far too fraught, too melodramatic. Are you not, readers, skeptical of the idea that he (that is, me) honestly believes that the essence of his being was threatened by a seminar in seventeenth-century European humanism? Possibly you also think that I exaggerate the gap between Harvardity and Brooklynity. So let us return to early 1960s and re-examine the historical context of these events.</div>
<div class="text parbase text-56 section">&#0160;</div>
<div class="text parbase text-56 section">I have reported on Douglas Bush&#39;s theological convictions; let us now turn to his retrograde views on education.</div>
<div class="text parbase text-56 section">&#0160;</div>
<div class="text parbase text-56 section">Bush was, without question, an unapologetic elitist. I don&#39;t mean &quot;elitist&quot; as the word is now popularly used -- as an all-purpose insult to those who are presumed to think that they are better than we because they are wealthy or have studied to a prestigious college. I mean elitist as in &quot;snob.&quot; Bush was an elitist because he felt that education was only for the elect. Once you admit ordinary, common folk, by golly, the end is near. He was blunt: &quot;education for all, however fine in theory, in practice ultimately leads to education for none.&quot; He deplored the ungenteel idea that &quot;students [would] come to college out of a desire for economic or social advantage.&quot; Let them stay in the places to which they were born! In a still shocking moment of undiluted social and racial snobbery, he pronounced that &quot;the rising flood of students is very much like the barbarian invasions of the early Middle Ages.&quot; &quot;Barbarian invasions&quot;? His metaphor is &quot;self-explanatory,&quot; is it not?&#0160; Bush presented himself as a guardian at the gate, protecting Christian Europe from the wild-eyed, uncivilized incursions of Lombards and Visigoths. And how was I to understand the analogy?&#0160; Did it not apply to me? Was I a civilized European or was I a violent Vandal? In theory, once I was admitted to Harvard&#39;s sacred precincts, I became an insider. But in reality, in my heart, I could identify only with the migratory hordes. Although I was camouflaged by my thrift-store jacket and tie, and I did not bring my seax to class, did not subsist on mare&#39;s milk, and felt no urge to sack Harvard, I knew myself to be, in essence, an interloper -- an abominable Avar, or brutal Bulgar, or horrible Hun. Or, in my particular case, a member of the tribe of anxious Ashkenazim.&#0160;</div>
<div class="text parbase text-56 section">&#0160;</div>
<div class="text parbase text-56 section">So now let us circle back to the beginning. Why was &quot;Douglas Bush&#39;s Milton course&quot; the worst class ever? For me, it was not just because Bush regularly lulled his classes to sleep. It was also because in his illiberal hands, John Milton, my John Milton, was diluted and distorted. I was, <em>ante</em> Bush, an admirer of Milton&#39;s courage and I was infatuated with his poetry. Milton is the only poet in the language, I believe, who ever equalled Shakespeare. <em>Lycidas (</em>written in 1636, the year of Harvard&#39;s founding) is in my opinion the world&#39;s single best poem. In tribute, I had memorized its 193 glorious lines. Moreover, Milton was a truly admirable human being. He was the furthest left, the most radical figure in the whole of English literature and perhaps in western literature. Did he not defend the execution of Charles I and the end of monarchy?&#0160; Did he not argue that marriage should be based not on dynastic alliances, but on love and sexual compatibility? Did he not authorize every individual to interpret the Bible in his own way, without the interference of a church or its priests and ministers -- the &quot;priesthood of all believers?&quot; And was it not true that he composed the Areopagitica, a seminal, essential contribution to freedom of thought?&#0160; But for Bush, I regret to say, Milton&#39;s impassioned advocacy of human dignity distracted from his poetry. He daydreamed in class about the poems Milton might have written if he hadn&#39;t allowed himself to be waylaid and distracted by politics. My Milton, on the other hand, was as much a public man as a poet. He had willingly given twenty years of his life and his precious eyesight to work for the radical transformation of society and for human freedom. Bush&#39;s judgment was in my opinion a major error, a disabling error, and it meant that the professor, however knowledgeable, was so blinkered by his conservative ideology that he missed the defining points of Milton&#39;s life. Just as I could not fully embrace Bush&#39;s Milton, he could not or would not ever fully grasp the greatness, the importance of my Milton. It therefore irked me to sit and listen every day, while Milton&#39;s contribution to world history was neglected, discounted, or dismissed. It hurt.&#0160;</div>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>The 2020 World Series is over, and I&#39;m in a royal snit.</p>
<p>It&#39;s Game 6, the Dodgers are ahead 3-2, and Tampa Bay has a chance to win and make the series go to seven, which is what I&#39;m rooting for (I don&#39;t have a dog in the hunt, because I disapprove of both teams: the Dodgers, are the despised simulacrum of the organization that abandoned Brooklyn 50+ years ago and Tampa Bay is from Florida, the Nowhere State -- plus it&#39;s an American League team, but that doesn&#39;t matter this year because for some phoney-baloney covid-related reason both leagues are using the DH. Tampa Bay is ahead 1-0 on a first-inning home run by Randy Arozarena, who has a great short powerful swing and is either the second coming of Henry Aaron and the centerpiece of the best trade in history (the worst for St. Louis) or the most spectacular flash-in-the-pan in major league history. It&#39;s the fifth inning, and Blake Snell has been pitching a masterpiece. Nine strikeouts and not a ball hit solidly. He&#39;s throwing 95 to the corners and his sinking curve is keeping the Dodger hitters completely off balance. He&#39;s looking almost like Koufax, for goodness sake. So what does Kevin Cash, Tampa Bay&#39;s manager do?&#0160; He takes out Snell and brings in Nick Anderson and two batters later, it&#39;s 2-1 Dodgers and the game is over and the Series is over. Removing Snell is the worst decision in baseball history, perhaps in sports history, perhaps the worst of any human decision since the emergence of <em>homo sapiens.</em></p>
<p>Why was Snell relieved? Because of some bullshit trumpery statistics about pitchers being less effective going through the lineup the third time. Not applicable in this case; Snell had lost nothing off his fastball, he was still hitting his spots, and he was still demoralizing the Dodgers, who looked like dejected losers. Until -- that is, they were invigorated by the prospect of not having to hit against Snell any longer.</p>
<p>Is there a word &quot;overmanaging?&quot;&#0160; There ought to be. Both teams were over-managed. Too many pitching changes, too many absurd fielding shifts -- even putting four men in the outfield--, too many pinch hitters. Baseball used to be a players&#39; game, and the job of the manager was to put his nine best players on the field and let them do their jobs, perhaps calling for a sacrifice or a steal or an intentional pass, or replacing a tired pitcher with some ex-starter or never-was from the bullpen. But now, baseball has turned into a manager&#39;s game, like (gasp) football. And when it backfires, as it did last night, what a disaster! What does Kevin Cash deserve, besides firing. If I were a Tampa Bay fan, I&#39;d be outraged. I&#39;d want revenge or his scalp, perhaps both.</p>
<p>I&#39;m a baseball fan, and I&#39;m outraged, livid, angry. I wanted to see what Blake Snell could do with the Dodger hitters, third time through. More reliance on his slider, more on the slow stuff? Could he keep getting them to swing and miss at his fastball at the top of the zone, or just above the zone?&#0160;</p>
<p>I&#39;m a fan;&#0160; baseball should try to please me and the 90% of the spectators in America who knew that Cash was making a major blunder to pull Snell. I didn&#39;t watch the end of the game. Left the room. Boycotted.</p>
<p>Baseball is not as exciting as it was in the days of my youth. The players themselves are bigger, faster, stronger, and better trained, so it&#39;s not their fault. But because the hitters are so powerful, there are too many home runs. Home runs are only exciting when a batter catches all of it and blasts one 440 feet into the upper deck or 40 rows back into the lower.&#0160; There&#39;s nothing more boring than a muscular guy swinging under it and popping one up 340 feet onto the short porch. A travesty home run. The fences should be moved back 20 feet and raised to a mandatory 10 or 12 feet. A triple is much more exciting to watch than a Texas League homer. When was the last inside-the-park homer with a relayed throw to the plate, just a hair too late?&#0160;</p>
<p>And let&#39;s put the statisticians in their place. Tampa Bay is the only team in the league with a professional statistician on the bench -- one who never advanced past T-ball. Is he responsible for the manager&#39;s monumental gaffe?&#0160; And for goodness sake, let&#39;s get rid of the DH. When the pitcher is in the batting order, there&#39;s strategy in the game. It becomes a test of intelligence, not just a home run hitting contest. I want to admire a well-executed sacrifice bunt.&#0160;</p>
<p>My father had been a catcher in his younger days and had the busted fingers to prove it.&#0160; When he was dying, I went to visit him in the hospital. He was watching the Dodgers on the TV.&#0160; The next day, when I returned, he wasn&#39;t watching. I said, &quot;Dad, there&#39;s a Yankee game on the TV; you could watch it.&quot;&#0160; He said, &quot;Yankees. American League. DH rule. Not baseball.&quot;&#0160; He died soon after.&#0160;</p>
<p>I&#39;m scared that baseball, greatest of all games, has become &quot;not baseball.&quot;</p>
