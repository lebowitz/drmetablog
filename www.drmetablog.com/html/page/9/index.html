<p>Althea bought this rug at an auction in Warren, New Hampshire in 1968 -- and it is the first rug we ever owned -- the first of many. I was startled when she bid on it because we were in the market for crockery and glasses and chairs, not for decorative objects, but she saw and appreciated its beauty. It&#39;s a rug for a wall because it&#39;s too old and fragile to be tread upon by the shod. Rug expert MP says that it&#39;s from the Caucasus -- specifically it&#39;s a Konaghend Kuba -- from the late nineteenth century. Of course we didn&#39;t have the faintest idea of its provenance but we knew that it was very appealing. In fact, I was so inattentive that I owned and admired the rug for forty years before I noticed that it was a prayer rug -- the mihrab is not much pronounced. Nor did I appreciate the abrash; the indigo blue ground disappears two thirds of the way down. It&#39;s probable that the woman who wove it ran out of wool from a particular dye lot, but it&#39;s also possible that the weaver was nomadic.&#0160;</p>
<p>When Althea lived in Washington for a year in the 1990s, she took this rug with her -- the only personal possession (aside from clothes, of course) that she brought. And then many years later when she entered the Alzheimer&#39;s institution, I hung it on the wall facing her bed. I thought it would be a comfort to her -- but alas she did not remember or recognize it. When she died I&#0160; brought it back home where it belongs.</p>

<p>This appealing pitcher and vase set were thrown by Ben Owen II, a potter who lived and worked in Seagrove, North Carolina. In September of 1966, we visited Tom and Margaret in Chapel Hill and they took us on an excursion to Seagrove, where we bought these fine works of art. Ben Owen was very much a traditionalist, sticking closely to tried-and-true shapes and glazes. He was &quot;old-fashioned,&quot; and I am equally so. Lots of weird things have been done with clay during the last sixty years, but these shapes are more pleasing to my eye than modernistic distortions and abstractions.</p>
<p>The glaze is called &quot;frogspit&quot; but &quot;frogskin&quot; would make more sense.</p>
<p>When I moved to a new home in 2009, the Ben Owen pots disappeared. I thought they had been lost in the move, but after a couple of years of searching, I located them. In fact, I had packed them so carefully and securely that they were virtually buried. But I persevered.</p>
<p>These splendid objects have now (except when they went AWOL) been on prominent display wherever I&#39;ve lived for more than half a century. It&#39;s curious, and a fact, that not one guest has ever asked a single question about them. They&#39;ve not been noticed. Are my friends unobservant?</p>
<p>I think that the pitcher and the vase are so discreetly beautiful that they don&#39;t demand attention, a fact which makes me love them all the more.&#0160;</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Despite its marvelously odd sound, there was no word more familiar to me as an infant than &quot;umpire.&quot; &quot;Umpire!!&quot;&#0160; Say it, savor it, roll it about in your mouth. It&#39;s a downright peculiar word. Am I exaggerating when I say that &quot;umpire&quot; came into my ken right along with the initial acquisition of language? And that it was accompanied by such other linguistic weirdnesses as &quot;inning,&quot;&quot;fungo,&quot; &quot;shortstop,&quot; &quot;blooper,&quot; &quot;rosin bag,&quot; &quot;balk&quot; (pronounced &quot;bawk,&quot;),&quot;dugout,&quot; &quot;fan&quot;,&quot;knuckleball,&quot; &quot;southpaw,&quot; &quot;mitt,&quot; &quot;bullpen,&quot; and &quot;slump&quot; (among many others). Common baseballese words, all of them -- but &quot;umpire&quot; is the strangest of them all, so foreign-sounding that some of the lesser lights in the PS 217 schoolyard pronounced it &quot;empire.&quot; The abbreviation &quot;ump&quot; (&quot;Kill the Ump&quot;) sounds less like a word than a stifled snort or eructation.</p>
<p>The word came to us by a devious roundabout route. The &quot;p&quot; and &quot;r&quot; in umpire descend from the Latin &quot;par&quot; (equal). Old French had <em>nonper&#0160;</em>which came into Middle English as <em>noumpere. &quot;</em>A noumpere&quot; became &quot;an umpire&quot;; it lost its &quot;n&quot; by the same process of rebracketing or resegmentation by which &quot;a nadder&quot; became &quot;an adder&quot; and &quot;a napron&quot; became &quot;an apron&quot; (and &quot;an ewt&quot; became &quot;a newt&quot;). &quot;Noumpere&quot; was not a sporting term; it signified a neutral arbiter of a dispute.&#0160;</p>
<p>So Don Adriano de Armado in <em>Love&#39;s Labor&#39;s Lost</em>,&#0160; a man of &quot;fire-new words,&quot; is an &quot;umpire&quot; of mutinies, where mutinies simply means disputes. And Juliet says that &quot;twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife/ Shall play the umpire&quot; -- a phrase which Samuel Johnson glossed as &quot;this knife shall decide the struggle between me and my distresses.&quot;</p>
<p>Umpire did not acquire a sporting turn until 1861, just in time for the arrival of the national pastime.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Most American sports feature a judge or a referee rather than an umpire, though American football, which is highly policed, offers a referee, a head linesman, a line judge, a back judge, a side judge and a field judge, in addition to an umpire, who does not call balls and strikes, but instead counts the number of players on each side, checks their uniforms, and watches out for an offensive lineman who might illegally wander downfield. Because umpires are positioned behind the defensive line they are subject to inadvertent concussions and dislocations -- still another justification for my personal boycott of football.&#0160;</p>
<p>In 1950, Beans Reardon and Jocko Conlan and Al Barlick were names as familiar as Hodges and Campanella. Nowadays I could not name a single major league umpire.</p>

<p>I bought these water glasses (sometimes called tumblers) about 35 years at a long defunct antique shop in Lafayette, Colorado. They fall into the large category known as Depression Glass in the trade and they were probably manufactured in the 1940&#39;s or 50&#39;s -- but that&#39;s just an unsupported speculation on my part. I don&#39;t know the name of the manufacturer so they are works of art without provenance. I love the clean lines -- straight at the base and then slightly flared at the top -- and also the way the glasses fit so elegantly into the human hand. The tumblers are entirely unadorned and if they have a style other than vernacular I suppose they might be called Art Deco. I once had a few more of these tumblers -- perhaps as many as eight, but because they are in constant use there have been losses. There&#39;s no saying how long these beauties will survive -- the rims are a bit fragile and vulnerable in the dishwasher. Although they have no monetary value, they are in my opinion both classy and classic.</p>

<div>
<div>Kathy Ferguson, played by reliable Barbara Stanwyck, starts out as a tough, no nonsense witty newspaper woman not scared to go toe-to-toe with her male superiors. She&#39;s a 1930s kind of liberated movie gal who wants a lot more out of life than a husband and kids and an avocado-colored refrigerator. She&#39;s on her way -- even managing to finagle an offer from an NYC newspaper. But then she falls in love with Lieutenant Bill Doyle, an LA cop (Sterling Hayden) and her admirable backbone goes all squishy. Now her only ambition is to stay at home, cook and clean, and make her man happy. What a betrayal! How implausible!</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>She lands in a dull 1950s suburb where her circle of female acquaintances talk about their outfits and their clubs. It&#39;s Eisenhower-era conformism, caricatured, and Kathy is bored silly.</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>Then the film changes direction once again, and Kathy, channeling, I suppose, her earlier ambition, transforms into a noir-y &quot;bad girl&quot; determined to advance her husband&#39;s career by whatever means necessary -- in this case, by means of adultery and murder.</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div><em>Crime of Passion&#0160;</em>covers a lot of ground both in genre and in human psychology. One critic says &quot;it&#39;s both dated and progressive at the same time&quot; -- which is correct and is a lot more polite than describing the film as &quot;confused&quot; or &quot;irresolute.&quot;&#0160;</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>I myself found Kathy&#39;s metamorphosis easier to swallow than her sexual attraction to Sterling Hayden&#39;s boss, played by hulking Raymond Burr.&#0160;</div>

				<p>The nation is in an uproar -- the Covid-19 pandemic, mass unemployment, racial reckoning, disorder in the streets, Russians sabotaging our elections, ignorant authoritarian leadership.</p>
<p>We ourselves are sheltering at home, and are healthy, thanks to the masks and the cooperation of friends and neighbors, but there&#39;s little hope of a getaway. We certainly can&#39;t travel. What to do for an escape? There&#39;s no frigate like a book, so it&#39;s time to read a long leisurely novel by Anthony Trollope.</p>
<p><em>The Small House at Allington </em>is the fifth of six in the Barsetshire series. Had I read it before? Certainly, but it doesn&#39;t matter. To read a Barset novel is to put on well-worn old clothes. Loose slippers. <em>The Small House</em> is comfort food. It&#39;s the mac and cheese of novels.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not 2020, it&#39;s 1863. Outside of Barsetshire, millions of working-class Englishmen are living in grinding, soul-destroying poverty. Cholera is rampant. India is being pillaged. Ireland is trying to recover from famine and mass emigration. There&#39;s a second Opium War in China. British ships are running the Union blockade of Confederate ports. But all is as ever in the perennial untouched Allington microcosm.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Should the Dales continue to stay in the dower house even though the squire is sometimes impolitic?&#0160; Should Adolphus Crosbie choose to marry Lily Dale (yes!) or Lady Alexandrina de Courcy (big mistake)? Will Plantagenet Palliser run off with Griselda Grantly -- don&#39;t do it, Planty Pall!&#0160; Should Lucy Dale accept a dinner invitation from the Earl de Guest? Why won&#39;t Isabella Dale agree to accept her cousin Bernard as a husband? -- everyone in the family thinks it&#39;s a good idea, except Bell herself, who prefers poor but faithful Dr. Crofts.</p>
<p>Political and economic problems do not intrude into the small world of the Small House. Finding a mate, keeping a mate, repairing a frayed relationship is its subject; equally important for men, is to locate a woman of means, so that one can support a comfortable style of life without stooping to real work.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Adolphus Crosbie, although far from our favorite, accurately describes the three things that he requires in a wife: that she be of a good family, that she have money, and that she be beautiful. Does Mr. Crosbie possess these qualities himself?&#0160; No. But he does have a handsome set of whiskers, which seems to be sufficient.</p>

				<p><em>Mogambo</em> (1953), directed by John Ford, is an eternal-triangle story in which earthy Ava Gardner and prim Grace Kelly compete for white hunter Clark Gable. Unfortunately, it&#39;s less engaging as a romance than as a travelogue -- it offers spectacular footage of African megafauna (hippos, giraffes, lions, gorillas, etc.).</p>
<p>Whenever I watch classic films set in &quot;the colonies,&quot; I&#39;m fearful that the native people will be exoticized and orientalized and trivialized, but I&#39;m happy to report that <em>Mogambo</em> is less offensively Tarzanish than most -- setting aside a couple of embarrassing &quot;fakelore&quot; episodes. I would have been even happier if the Africans weren&#39;t just animated wallpaper -- bearers or rowers or dancers or spear-throwers -- and that they weren&#39;t depicted as entirely subservient to their white overlords. <em>Mogambo</em> is based on Victor Fleming&#39;s pre-Code <em>Red Dus</em>t (1931) -- a much more sensual film than <em>Mogambo</em> and one which allowed Jean Harlow lots of room to wink and flirt. It&#39;s most odd that the glamorous sexy hunter in both <em>Red Dust&#0160;</em>and <em>Mogambo&#0160;</em>is played by Clark Gable - a rare example of filmic auto-reprising. He&#39;s hyper-masculine, at age 30, in <em>Red Dust</em> but in <em>Mogambo</em> it&#39;s too too obvious that his hair has been dyed a shiny black. When he pounces on Ava and Grace and mashes their mouths with unpersuasive 50s kisses, it is taken for granted that both ladies will immediately grow weak in the knees.&#0160;</p>
<p>I grew even less Gable-dazzled when I discovered a weird anecdote in Donald Sinden&#39;s recollection of the filming of <em>Mogambo</em>. (Sinden played the part of Grace Kelly&#39;s spineless, intellectual, oblivious husband). Sinden reports that (prepare yourself to be stunned and disillusioned):&#0160;</p>
<p><em>before leaving camp on the first morning [of shooting] I had been told to report to the hair-dressing department&#39;s tent, where I found the make-up men armed with electric clippers: &#39;I have to remove the hair from your chest.&#39; &#39;Whatever for?&#39; I asked, &#39;Orders.&#39; It transpired that Clark [Gable], whose chest was completely devoid of hair, had always insisted that no other actor should appear on film exposing a hirsute breast. This included any member of the crew not wearing a shirt as well. He considered it a slight on his masculinity.</em></p>
<p>Surely, this is one of the most bizarre anecdotes in movie history. The King of Hollywood, the legend whose mere presence famously set roomfuls of maidens all a-quiver, was so sexually insecure that he required mass depilation of cast and crew! Follicular fragility! Big-time nuttiness?&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>Question: was it in Clark&#39;s contract that he had the right to dictate the degree of chest shagginess of cast and crew -- or was he just throwing his weight around?&#0160; Suppose Sinden or some sweaty best boy had refused the electric clippers. Would the production have ground to a halt?&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>It&#39;s well known that since the time of Samson and probably before, male hair has been associated with strength, but even Delilah didn&#39;t set out to defoliate every man in Gaza.</p>
<p>But Clark Gable&#39;s chest hair insecurity is only Donald Sinden&#39;s second most curious anecdote. Even more astonishing, at least to me, is that Sinden suffered from &quot;negative buoyancy.&quot; Negative buoyancy is a condition in which a person is unable to float in water. In Sinden&#39;s case, negative buoyancy was discovered, he says, while filming a shipwreck scene in <em>The Cruel Sea (</em>1953<em>).</em>&#0160;Sinden started to sink and was rescued from drowning by his co-star Jack Hawkins.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-memoirs_49-1"></sup></p>
<p>Almost all human beings float. Bob like corks. I don&#39;t, and neither did my father nor my male descendants. As a family, we&#39;re sinkers. I don&#39;t know why, except that perhaps we have an eccentric specific gravity or because our swim bladders go on the fritz, like sick fish. We regularly and uniformly plunge to the bottom, like a stone or a heavy lump of lead.&#0160;</p>
<p>How wonderful to know that there is a dignified name for our peculiar family trait: &quot;negative buoyancy.&quot;</p>
<p>And now we can be consoled that we&#39;re not alone.&#0160;</p>
<p>There&#39;s got to be a support group for the negatively buoyant out there, somewhere.</p>

<div class="noprint"><em>Stranger on the Third Floor</em> is one of many works of art that are more historically important, more influential than they are good or pleasing. With a thin plot, obviously padded, it moves along as slow as molasses. The main character, the focus of much of the action, is played by John McGuire who is so unredeemably incompetent and amateurish that you can&#39;t keep your eyes off him. And yet, like it or not, <em>Stranger on the Third Floor </em>is seminal -- acclaimed by knowledgeable folks as the first true noir, the head and font of all those 40s and 50s black-and-white films featuring betrayals, gumshoes, bad girls, corrupt city officials, errant bullets, dream sequences, flashbacks, low angle shots, deep shadows and Elisha Cook Jr.</div>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I stand, like most in my cohort who have lived ordinary, conventional lives, at the midpoint of a continuum stretching from grandparents to grandchildren -- at an imaginary apex looking backward and forward, Janus-like. I remember my grandparents, though only at the end of their long lives, and I know my grandchildren, though only at the beginnings of theirs. Two generations back, two generations forward and with 81-year-old me at the fulcrum.</p>
<p>It&#39;s been a long eventful tramp from there to here. My grandfather Isaiah was born in 1863, a hundred and sixty seven long years ago, and my youngest grandchildren, the twins Caleb and Asher, joined us just five years ago, in 2015. Although it was only an instant in geological terms, nevertheless, the interval from my grandfather&#39;s birth to this moment has seen glaciers melt, rivers change their course, cities arise, plants and animals go extinct, governments and empires grow and decline, wars and epidemics rattle the planet. He lived in a world of serfs and rabbis and pogroms; the grandchildren live in a world of nuclear proliferation, global warming, threats to democracy.</p>
<p>There have also been tectonic shifts in the microcosm of my own family. My Ukrainian-born grandparents would not recognize my third-generation American-born grandchildren, and my grandchildren would have an even more impossible task to understand or appreciate the lives of the great-great-grandparents. It&#39;s a long leap from StaryConstantine, old Constantine, in the nineteenth century, where my family originated in backward village Ukraine to Washington DC or northern California or Boulder Colorado in the twenty-first. Rural to urban, agricultural to technical, provincial to worldly, religious to secular, inbred to genetically various. My grandparents were born into a world of carts and horses; my grandchildren play with computers in their cribs. Yet here we are.</p>
<p>We&#39;re the same, but different. According to family legend, my grandfather Isaiah left StaryConstantine and his family of origin because of a dispute about religion. They, his father and family, were devout but he was a non-believer. In this regard, Isaiah was a true patriarch, because he established an enduring family template. Over the generations, we remain hostile or sometimes only indifferent to religion -- and in its place we embrace the evidence of the senses and the primacy of reason. Looking backward and forward from my pinnacle, I cannot identify a single lapsed atheist or backslider in the family landscape. I know that my father never attended a house of worship except for a rare funeral or wedding. For him, the sabbath was sacred only to his roses and azaleas. I once asked him if his father, Isaiah, had ever visited a synagogue. He said, &quot;I can&#39;t swear about what happened in the Ukraine, but I know that once he got here he never did.&quot; For Isaiah, atheism would have been a revolutionary fracturing; for subsequent generations, not even slightly stressful. The <a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2019/01/the-precious-gift-of-atheism.html">precious gift of atheism</a> I once called it.</p>
<p>What has replaced religion? Our extended family remains a people of the book. Among my grandfather&#39;s forty-seven direct descendant, thirty-five of whom are alive, six have written books, another is a journalist, and five others have earned law degrees, where not unlike the older generations of Talmudists, they can engage in disputations over nice sharp quillets of the law. There are no rabbis, but I can count at least ten teachers of one secular subject or another. My grandfather had no official schooling, but every one of his great grandchildren is a college graduate and many of them have post-graduate degrees.</p>
<p>There are some families that can boast of painters or violinists or actors in their old world heritage; not ours. Nor have we become creative or imaginative in the new world. I count no poets, no musicians, no actors, and except for my outlier brother who once wrote a novel and now makes bricolage sculptures, no artists. If we make anything, it&#39;s useful. Furniture or pottery -- not paintings. But then, no criminals or alcoholics or wastrels either. We&#39;re substantial reliable citizens -- firmly nouveau bourgeois. We may be conventional and dull, but we are what my father used to call, without irony and with great pride, solid, tax-paying citizens.&#0160;</p>

				<p>The last time, a decade ago, that I needed a rug pad, I went hunting at various malls and shops that might stock such an item. After a few exhausting hours, I located an appropriate-size rug pad at one of those large import stores -- it may have been Pier 1 or WorldMarket. The quality wasn&#39;t quite right, and the pad was too large and too costly, but it was there --&#0160; and I do possess a utility knife with a very sharp blade. So I bought it, struggled with it, but -- it worked, and it&#39;s still there, doing its job, padding the Heriz.&#0160;</p>
<p>This time, covid-time, I&#39;m not allowed to search around town, and I don&#39;t want to, so instead I did some internet sleuthing for &quot;rug pad.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#39;s a revelation -- there are many, many vendors very anxious to satisfy my rug pad needs: RugPad <span style="color: #ff0000;">U<span style="color: #0000ff;">S<span style="color: #d0d0d0;">A</span></span></span>, Mr.RugPad, RugPads &#39;R Us, Rugpad-orama, eSaleRugPads, RugPadStock, RugPadHome, RugPadSolutions, Dr. Pad, RugPad World, Royal-T RugPads, Underfoot-Inc, and My Rug Pad, among others. Costco sells a &quot;Mohawk&quot; rug pad made of &quot;100% post industrial recycled synthetic fibers with all natural rubber with SBR latex backing,&quot; whatever that is, not cut to exact size, and you have to buy a shrink-wrapped package of four.</p>
<p>I choose RugPad<span style="color: #ff0000;">U<span style="color: #0000ff;">S<span style="color: #d0d0d0;">A </span></span></span>not only for patriotic reasons but because its site featured a lengthy explanatory essay on the potential disasters, hazards and glories of various species of rug pads. Are you not shocked to learn that that some inferior rug pad manufacturers pad out their fiber with clay?&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>RugPad <span style="color: #ff0000;">U<span style="color: #0000ff;">S<span style="color: #d0d0d0;">A </span></span></span>is a company that takes its rug pads very seriously. I am now up to snuff on Grip, Cushion, Longevity, Sustainability, Safety, and Made-in-America-ness. And also on materials: rubber, jute, felt, Pure Wool, hemp, and memory foam, in their various forms and combinations (and prices).</p>
<p>I went with an &quot;eco friendly Nature&#39;s Grip 100% natural rubber and plant jute.&quot; It arrived in four days, cut to exact measure. Perfect. This rug pad is so beautiful, let me tell you, that I&#39;m thinking of laying it on top and putting the old tribal Turkish Varamin tent rug underneath. Well, maybe I&#39;m getting too enthusiastic about my glorious new rug pad.</p>
<p>Advantages to internet shopping: it lets your fingers do the walking, there are an infinity of choices, and after a while the item appears miraculously outside your door. Disadvantages: you can&#39;t see or feel the product before making a decision; it&#39;s a pain to return mistakes; your cash goes to an absentee merchant (RugPad <span style="color: #ff0000;">U<span style="color: #0000ff;">S<span style="color: #d0d0d0;">A </span></span></span>is located in Connecticut); local shops suffer, and also, slightly delayed gratification. But the electronic mall is definitely the way we shop now.</p>

				<p>Why was I surprised that this was such a fine film? I should have done some research before viewing. It was written by Robert Riskin and Jo Swerling. Riskin had <em>It Happened One Night</em> to his credit and collaborated with Frank Capra on <em>Mr. Deeds Comes to Town.</em> Swerling wrote I<em>t&#39;s a Wonderful Life</em> and<em> Lifeboat</em>. <em>The Whole Town&#39;s Talking&#0160;</em>was directed by John Ford, venturing, for once, out of Monument Valley and into comedy.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>It&#39;s an amusing doppelganger movie, with Edward G. Robinson playing both Jekyll and Hyde. His Hyde is a monster gangster of the <em>Little Caesar</em> variety; his Jekyll is a meek apologetic clerk. Both of his manifestations are interested in Jean Arthur, the wise-cracking babe, but Jekyll doesn&#39;t get her until he assimilates some hydeishness and gets Hyde killed. That&#39;s America for you; until you&#39;re willing to resort to violence, you&#39;re not going to land the lady.&#0160;</p>

<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>It&#39;s Sir Richard Lovelace, born in 1617, perhaps in his late &#39;teens or early 20s (he survived only to the age of 40), but mature enough to have grown a splendid crop of rich black hair. Over his left shoulder is a motto that reads &quot;prodesse non praeesse&quot; which means something like &quot;to be useful rather than to rule (or lead).&quot; Of Lovelace, a contemporary said that he was &quot;the most amiable and beautiful person that ever eye beheld; a person also of innate modesty, virtue and courtly deportment, which made him... much admired and adored by the female sex.&quot;</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>Not only was he handsome and sexy, but Sir Richard was also a soldier in the English civil war, a playwright, and an accomplished poet. One of his superlative lyrics is the famous and oft-anthologized &quot;To Lucasta, Going to the Wars.&quot;&#0160; It&#39;s only twelve lines, but what superb lines they are! Quite a triumph, it is, to embody an entire aristocratic caste and a system of values in a single short poem!</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>Tell me not (Sweet) I am unkind,</div>
<div>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;That from the nunnery</div>
<div>Of thy chaste breast and quiet mind</div>
<div>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;To war and arms I fly.</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>True, a new mistress now I chase,</div>
<div>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;The first foe in the field;</div>
<div>And with a stronger faith embrace</div>
<div>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;A sword, a horse, a shield.</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>Yet this inconstancy is such</div>
<div>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;As you too shall adore;</div>
<div>I could not love thee (Dear) so much,</div>
<div>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;Lov’d I not Honour more.</div>
<p>The &quot;plot&quot; of the lyric is simple: the &quot;speaker&quot; leaves his beloved in order to &quot;fly&quot; to battle (he fought, naturally, on the royalist side). He loves &quot;honor&quot; more than he loves his mistress. In fact, and perhaps paradoxically, honor has a multiplier effect on his love. And yet, although honor enhances love, honor is always primary, love subordinate. It&#39;s a curious kind of love lyric in which a suitor says to his beloved, I like you, but only second best.</p>
<p>What is &quot;honor&quot; for Lovelace?&#0160; It&#39;s a word with a spectrum of meanings -- nobility of soul, magnanimity, scorn of meanness, reputation, privilege of rank or birth, even chastity or virginity. But none of these possibilities seem to specifically apply in this poem.&#0160; For Lovelace and his Lucasta, honor is military. It is something won on the battlefield. About this he is uncompromising: the &quot;new mistress&quot; he will now &quot;embrace&quot; is &quot;a sword, a horse, a shield&quot; -- &quot;war and arms.&quot; Not the &quot;arms&quot; of a lover, but weapons.&#0160;</p>
<p>A cynical being might therefore rewrite the last two lines of the lyric thusly: &quot;I could not love thee (Dear) so much,/ Lov&#39;d I not warfare more.&quot; Flat, imperfect poetry, but the parody is perhaps what the demystified poem actually asserts. Make war, not love.</p>
<p>What sort of war?</p>
<p>The primary weapons in the battles of the 1640s were mortar, cannon, musket, caliver, carbine, harquebus, and pistol. Sword, horse and shield had not entirely disappeared. Edge weapons were still in use, and the horse would remain the primary engine of war until it was supplanted in the twentieth century by internal combustion vehicles. But it would have been suicidal folly to go into 1640s battle with Lovelace&#39;s museum of weaponry. For &quot;honor&quot; and for the benefit of Lucasta, Lovelace evokes a romantic nostalgic world of tilt and tourney. Single combat, knight versus knight, hot horse against horse.</p>
<p>Lovelace imagines himself glorious in single combat, his mistress&#39;s favor (handkerchief or scarf) streaming from his helmet. It would not be so glorious to be mutilated by a cannon lugged into place by a base pioner.&#0160;</p>
<p>Lovelace easily conflates love, which is a private emotion, with military honor, which is clearly a public achievement. Very public, indeed, which is what led Baruch Spinoza, Lovelace&#39;s younger contemporary, to note that &quot;honor&quot; is not intrinsic, not an act of personal realization, but rather &quot;a slavish subordination to the opinion of others.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;I could not love the (Dear) so much,</p>
<p>&#0160; &#0160; Lov&#39;d I not a slavish subordination to the opinion of others more.&quot;</p>
<p>The rewrite has a different ring.</p>
<p>Spinoza:&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><em>In this Our Life</em>, the novel by Ellen Glasgow is richer, deeper, and less bound by convention than the film.&#0160; Film <em>Life</em> follows the inherited story for its first forty-five minutes but then sharply diverges.</p>
<p>In the film version, bad daughter Stanley is less conflicted and complicated a character and eventually devolves into a stereotypical noir &quot;bad girl.&quot; Novel Stanley doesn&#39;t drive Peter to suicide, nor does she she bring the film to convenient closure by driving her car down a cliff. Novel Craig is far less worthy and more passive than film Craig and doesn&#39;t redeem himself by transforming into a sleuth who exonerates Parry.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the novel offers no Hollywood ending; in strong contrast, novel Roy rejects Craig&#39;s offer of marriage because she knows that Craig is still carrying the torch for Stanley. Instead, she tries desperately to leave town and start life anew -- but it&#39;s not clear whether or not she will make a clean getaway. We hope that she will.</p>
<p>The most extensive revision is to the character of the sisters&#39; father, Asa Timberlake. In the film, he&#39;s a uxorious martyred browbeaten milquetoast who is the long-suffering caretaker of his hypochondriacal bedridden wife. In Ellen Glasgow&#39;s novel, much of which is seen through his eyes, Asa loathes his wife, knows that he&#39;s wasted his life, craves affection, and even admits to himself that he wants her dead so that he can be free. It&#39;s Asa, not Craig, who unravels the mystery of the automobile accident. Moreover, glory be to the proper gods, Asa has a secret lady friend, a widow/farmer a dozen years his junior, whom he visits on his occasional day off. And he nurtures an escapist fantasy that keeps him sane -- he wants to end his life as a simple farm laborer. He doesn&#39;t quite get there at the novel&#39;s end, but there&#39;s hope. Kaye, his very healthy, very appropriate mistress (we think sexual partner, though Glasgow hedges) assures him that she will always have an opening for a hired hand.&#0160;</p>

				<p>Talk about movie &quot;bad girls&quot;-- here&#39;s one of the most sordid. <em>In this Our Life</em> is a doppelganger story of two sisters, one good and one evil. Roy (sic) Timberlake, played by Olivia de Havilland, is too good to be true. Stanley (sic) Timberlake, embodied by Bette Davis in an eye-popping, raucous performance, is wicked at the Lady Macbeth or Goneril level. She steals her sister&#39;s husband just for the heck of it and then drives him to suicide. Quite the scandal anywhere, but especially in 1940s class-conscious suburban Virginia. Her very good sister Roy marries the decent man whom Stanley betrayed -- and then Stanley tries to seduce him back. It doesn&#39;t work, I&#39;m glad to say, and Stanley, failing and frustrated, runs her car into two pedestrians, killing one, and then frames a young &quot;colored boy&quot; (we might say &quot;black man&quot;) for the murder -- and almost gets away with it. There&#39;s more in this competent soap-opera romance melodrama: a touch of incest, some distasteful bigotry, crass materialism, morbid hypochondria. A couple or three weak, enervated men, upon whom we wait for ninety minutes to grow backbones.</p>
<p>The movie was directed by John Huston and Raoul Walsh and written by Howard Koch (<em>Casablanca),&#0160;</em>so it has classy bloodlines. It&#39;s so overcrowded with events and loose ends that I guessed that it must have been adapted from a novel. And sure enough, according to Wik <em>In This Our Life </em>was adapted from a famous-in-its-time Pulitzer prize book by Ellen Glasgow -- which I should have known but didn&#39;t.&#0160;</p>
<p><em>In This Our Life</em> piqued my curiosity enough to download the novel onto my Kindle. I&#39;m intimidated, though. Kindle says 745 pages.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I read Elizabeth Cleghorn Stevenson Gaskell&#39;s <em>North and South (</em>1854) on the Kindle. It&#39;s a long novel, but I don&#39;t know how long because when I don&#39;t have a book to heft, I don&#39;t know how many pages I&#39;ve read and how many more are left. I can only say that I became impatient after a couple of days and started to think that Mrs. G. was being paid by the word. But just when I thought the novel would never end, I stroked the Kindle one more time, and by gosh and by golly, Mr. Thornton finally proposed to Margaret and bam! it was all over in a flash. I was unprepared. If I had been reading an old-fashioned &quot;book,&quot; as we used to call them, I would have known that I was approaching the last page, and my reaction would have been much different. Instead of shock, closure.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p><em>North and South </em>was originally published in parts, twenty of them, and therefore was consumed over a period of months. Later it appeared in book form, so that enthusiastic readers might binge for a long day or two -- a very different experience than reading in discrete chapters, and one I prefer. Kindle-reading is a third way. It&#39;s less satisfying to me because I want the weight of the book in my hand and I want to track my progress by means of the physical act of turning the page. Electronic reading will no doubt become the norm; something gained, no doubt, but something also lost. I think I would have been more satisfied with the novel if I had a solid object in my hands rather than words on a screen. Strange to say, but I honestly feel that it would have been a better novel.</p>
<p><em>North and South</em> is self-consciously &quot;progressive.&quot; Those money-hungry northern industrialists turn out to be decent people after all. The strikers may be misguided and impatient, but they have a genuine grievance. Women might be able to live richer lives with a dollop of liberation.&#0160;</p>
<p>I confess that I am troubled when I read books that were progressive their own time but that seem reactionary now. I know, and I&#39;ve been taught, that I should be more historical, less time bound, less, as they say, &quot;presentist.&quot; Nevertheless, I was astonished, even offended, that Margaret Hale was to be branded a loose woman because she was seen with a guy at a railway station, unchaperoned. Good thing the man who was with her turned out to be not a potential lover, but her brother, otherwise her gross impropriety would have banished her, lifetime, from the list of the eligible-for-marriage.&#0160;</p>
<p>I know that Mrs. Gaskell wanted us to think well of the mill-workers, but why the heck did she make them speak in an impenetrable provincial lower-class dialect which makes them seem sloppy, and ignorant-- another species entirely, less than human?&#0160; Even though I tried to resist, the characterization of the masses left me alienated and angry.</p>
<p>And then there&#39;s a problem particular to me: every time one of her characters failed or suffered grievous injury or died (there are a number of spontaneous deaths in <em>North and South),</em> Mrs Gaskell felt obliged to invoke an all-purpose explanation -- &quot;God&#39;s will!&quot;&#0160; &quot;God&#39;s will&quot; whether thoughtful or just a tic, becomes, in this ostensibly progressive novel, a justification for political passivity and quietism.</p>
<p>I like this novel better when I read it the first time -- in 1963. Although it&#39;s unchanged (except for the kindling), I myself seem to have become much less empathetic and more cantankerous. Age?</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>When I was a boy in the 1940s and &#39;50s, I was -- yearly or semi-yearly -- hauled off to gatherings of the E &amp; L Chafetz Family Circle. &quot;Chafetz&quot; was the maiden name of my maternal grandmother, Sonia Green. &quot;E&quot; and &quot;L&quot; were Sonia&#39;s parents, but the names that the initials abbreviated are gone for good. At the Family Circle, twenty or thirty or sometimes even forty Chafetz siblings, cousins, and spouses would share snacks, schnapps, and gossip. No question but that, selfish and un-empathetic lad that I was, I very much resented being scrubbed and fancied up to attend these meetings -- especially on a summer Sunday afternoon when the Brooklyn Dodgers might be playing a double-header. Why would a young scamp want to miss out on Red Barber and Connie Desmond in order to hang from a subway strap for an hour and a half while the stifling IRT rattled to some obscure corner of the Bronx -- just to while away the afternoon with a bunch of old folks?</p>
<p>The Chafetz relatives were all immigrants from Belarus and thereabouts, born, like my grandparents, in the 1870s or 1880s. They were small people -- tiny really -- the men topping out at or 5&#39;3&quot; or&#0160; 5&#39;4&quot;, the women at 5&#39;0&quot; or somewhat less -- their stature a consequence of their impoverished &quot;old country&quot; childhoods. They spoke Yiddish or Russian to each other and very rudimentary English to me. They smelled peculiarly -- of chicken soup overlaid with moth balls, their &quot;good clothes&quot; having been retrieved from the storage closet for this annual adventure. They assembled, if I remember correctly, at the second-floor apartment over someone&#39;s store. (It seemed as though they were all keepers of small shops -- newspaper kiosks or vegetable markets or candy stores or perhaps a delicatessen or an &quot;appetizer.&quot; One enterprising Chafetz cousin was a glazier.) They seemed to be mostly childless -- or, at least I can&#39;t remember encountering any other youths at these events.</p>
<p>Who were these people? Why were they so asymmetrical? Bent and twisted, most of them, their faces marred by blackheads and lumps and swellings. Their mouths were dental nightmares. Must I admit that my ten-year-old self was repelled and disgusted, unconscious that their distorted bodies were a testament to their arduous troubled lives?</p>
<p>Who was Uncle Joe Pessin? How was he related to me? What was his livelihood? I remember only a small dark bald man with a grating voice. Did he have a family?&#0160; And who were indistinguishable Lifscha and Leah? Were they twins or sisters or sisters-in-law? Why did Uncle Usher smell so pungently? Was he in the pickle or sauerkraut business? I know only that he had a great expanse of face and outsized shoulders and that he longed to visit his brothers and sisters in Winnipeg.&#0160;</p>
<p>At these gatherings, I was put on display. My mother (my father refused to attend) would take me around the room and introduce me to the various cousins and uncles and aunts. It was a torment, frankly. &quot;This is your uncle Nahum.&quot; Uncle Nahum would shake my hand. I had nothing to say to him, but Uncle Nahum asked the question that was every uncle&#39;s question. &quot;How are you doing? You doing well in school?&quot;&#0160; &quot;Yes, I&#39;m doing well in school.&quot; And so this uncle would smile beneficently upon me. And then on to the next one.&#0160;</p>
<p>Because of what I perceived as their limited communication skills (though English might have been Uncle Nahum&#39;s fourth or fifth language), I definitely felt superior and condescending -- an acute embarrassment to me now. In my heart, I silently patronized these strange people.</p>
<p>What I didn&#39;t know, and is so obvious now, was that I was much more important to them than they were to me. That I was &quot;doing well in school&quot; were words that they dearly wanted to hear. It was for my generation and for me that they had braved the Cossacks, sold the farm, deserted from the Russian army, left backward Belarus or Ukraine behind, endured the miseries of steerage, slept four to a bed for years and half-acclimated themselves to a new world utterly foreign to them. For me. They had sacrificed themselves to invest in me. So that I could &quot;do well in school,&quot; go to college, live a better life. I was their emissary to America, to the future.</p>
<p>What could a ten-year-old have possibly known?&#0160; It&#39;s too late to regret that I didn&#39;t learn their language and learn their stories. That world of theirs, that universe represented by E and L Chafetz --- it&#39;s all gone now, vanished, present no where else but in my failing memory.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I&#39;m detecting oxymorons in everything I read. Perhaps I&#39;m even imagining them.<em> Love&#39;s Labour&#39;s Lost</em> is a &quot;great feast of languages&quot; and also a savory banquet of rhetorical figures. Here are some of the oxymorons (or &quot;cross-couplers,&quot; as Puttenham called them) that I came upon in my latest re-reading of the play. Some require explanation.</p>
<p>&quot;Civil war,&quot; not &#39;civil&quot; as in the American Civil War but civil as in &quot;civility&quot; or good manners (like the &quot;merry war&quot; between Beatrice and Benedick). &quot;Trencher-knight&quot; because a trencher was generally a wooden dish, not suitable for knights -- and therefore a trencher-knight would be a low-born knight. &quot;Living art,&quot; where the art is a portrait or a statue, and therefore not living and breathing. &quot;Loose grace,&#39; where &quot;loose&quot; means worldly rather than spiritual. &quot;Profound simplicity.&quot; &quot;Evil angel.&quot; &quot;Dainty Bacchus,&quot; because Bacchus was notably disorderly. &quot;Sweet misprision,&quot; because misprision is a dereliction of duty and therefore not sweet but sour or bitter. &quot;Rational hind,&quot; whether hind refers to an animal or to a person of exceedingly small intellectual gifts. In addition, two near-oxymora: &quot;merry days of desolation,&quot; &quot;as swift as lead.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>These figures of speech are not as obvious as those in <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>, but they allow us to observe Shakespeare at work, experimenting with the ingredients of language, just as he was hitting his stride.</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><em>Pitfall</em> is just shy of sensational. Error and evil intrude into a normal postwar American suburban family. Jay Dratler and Andre de Toth, writer and director, hit all the necessary film noir notes but without descending to cliche. The beautiful blonde, is, for once, neither a temptress nor a gold-digger, but a decent, troubled young lady; the private eye is not a lonely warrior for justice but a brutal stalker; the police are not jerks; the wronged housewife is not simple and materialistic but strong and resilient. Moreover, the plot is not predictable and its ending neither pollyanna-ish nor disastrous, but balanced, credible and inconclusive. There are no car chases.&#0160;</p>
<p>Lizabeth Scott, Jane Wyatt, and Raymond Burr are terrific; Dick Powell is, alas, Dick Powell.&#0160;</p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2020/06/oxymoron.html">Shakespeare at Work: the Oxymoron</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>The oxymoron, a figure of speech in which there is a sharp contradiction between modifier and noun, has become a boon to humorists: &quot;business ethics,&quot; &quot;military intelligence,&quot; &quot;pretty ugly,&quot; &quot;jumbo shrimp,&quot; &quot;Christian Science,&quot; &quot;Utah Jazz.&quot;&#0160; But it&#39;s a figure that has a serious side as well. The oxymoron expresses very well the contradictions inherent in literary and also human life.&#0160; Life is a mingled yarn, is it not?&#0160; Both fair and foul, sometimes in the same moment; sweet sorrow. Because Shakespeare tried to convey the complexity of things, he employed oxymorons&#0160; throughout his career -- in simple straightforward formulas at the early plays, but in his maturity in innovative and sometimes startlingly beautiful ways.</p>
<p>The oxymoron has a long pedigree. It may go as far back as to a classical trope called the <em>adynaton</em>, or collection of impossibilities. There is a treasure-trove of oxymora in Alain of Lisle&#39;s thirteenth-century poem (or, more exactly, <em>prosimetron</em>) <em>De Planctu Naturae</em> in which &quot;amor&quot; is described as &quot;<em>pax odio, fraudique fides, spes juncta timor... mistus cum ratione furor,/ Naufragium dulce, pondus leve</em> (peace in hatred, faith in fraud, hope joined to fear, madness mixed with reason, sweet shipwreck, light heaviness); there is a similar passage, from the same century, in Guillaime de Lorris extremely popular <em>Romaunt of the Rose</em> that begins &quot;Love is a hateful peace and loving hate.&quot;</p>
<p>The oxymoron was given new life and vitality by Petrarch, whose sufferings for young Laura famously caused him to freeze in summer and burn in winter. Many sonneteers, continental and English, were indebted to Petrarch, among them Thomas Watson, a poet who flourished in the years of Shakespeare&#39;s adolescence. One of Watson&#39;s poems, which contained the lines &quot;Love is a sour delight, a sugared grief/ A living death, and ever-dying life&quot; lay behind young Romeo&#39;s modish and easily parodied oxymoron-rich rhetoric: &quot;O brawling love, o loving hate,/ O heavy lightness, serious vanity,/ Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms,/ Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health.... &quot; Romeo was so besotted by his own rhetoric that Juliet couldn&#39;t resist a joke at his expense: &quot;You kiss by the book.&quot; Romeo in 1595 owes a lot to Will in 1580.</p>
<p>Shakespeare knew that Romeo indulged too much of a good thing. Half a decade later, in&#0160;<em>All&#39;s Well That Ends Well</em>, Helena imagined her perjured promiscuous lover Bertram at the French court dancing attendance on the ladies in a series of tired oxymora: &quot;his humble ambition, proud humility,/ His jarring concord, and his discord dulcet,/ His faith, his sweet disaster.&quot;&#0160; In these lines, Helana, and Shakespeare as well, repudiated fashionable oxymoronic couplings. On the other hand, it is not love but hatred and anger that give rise to Timon&#39;s oxymorons. For him, the loathed Athenians, those &quot;smiling smooth detested parasites, are &quot;courteous destroyers, affable wolves, meek bears.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>In <em>Hamlet</em>, Claudius&#39;s insincere but brilliantly accomplished oxymorons camouflage his sin. He has</p>
<p>&#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160;as &#39;twere with a defeated joy,<br />With an auspicious, and a dropping eye,<br />With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,<br />In equal scale weighing&#0160;<span class="keyword1">delight</span> and dole</p>
<p>taken Gertrude as his wife. The pairing of &quot;auspicious&quot; (the root meaning of which is looking to the heavens to prognosticate by the flight of birds) with &quot;dropping&quot; is especially wonderful.</p>
<p>Claudius&#39;s &quot;delight and dole&quot; were anticipated by Richard II&#39;s rhetorical theatricality upon his return to England:</p>
<p>As a long-parted mother with her child<br />Plays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting,<br />So, weeping,&#0160;<span class="keyword1">smiling</span>, greet I thee, my earth.</p>
<p>And there&#39;s the &quot;wholesome iniquity&quot; of the bawdy house in <em>Pericles --&#0160;</em>a play in which calm comes in the form of &quot;litigious peace.&quot;</p>
<p>In <em>King Lear,&#0160;</em>a play about, among other subjects&#0160; a &quot;precious unprized&quot; daughter, there is a submerged but stunning oxymoron when (in Edgar&#39;s words) Gloucester is at last released from his suffering: &quot;his flaw&#39;d heart.../ &#39;Twixt two extremes of passion, joy and grief,/ Burst smilingly.&quot; &quot;Burst smilingly&quot; is a phrase which the younger Shakespeare could not reach; nor could any other poet before or since.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>&quot;Bisson conspectuities&quot; is one of my all-time favorite Shakespearean oxymorons. Although it&#39;s not as transparent as, say, &quot;hot ice&quot; or &quot;living death,&quot; it&#39;s much more quirky and colorful. &quot;Bisson conspectuities&quot; appears in <em>Coriolanus </em>in one of the scenes in which Menenius banters with the Roman crowd. They attack and he parries by enumerating his own strengths and weaknesses. He concludes with an insult that flaunts his patrician education: &quot;What harm can your bisson conspectuities glean out of this character?&quot; (In this case, a &quot;character&quot; is a summary statement of a person&#39;s habits or nature, a &quot;characterization&quot;.)</p>
<p>The odd word &quot;conspectuities&quot; is an invention of Shakespeare&#39;s. He derived it from the participial form of the Latin verb &quot;<em>conspicio</em>&quot; -- to observe, gaze, or watch. It&#39;s a nonce word, a <em>hapax legomenon</em>; unlike some of Shakespeare&#39;s more inspired coinages, conspectuities never domesticated into English -- the OED lists only this sole appearance. &quot;Bisson,&quot; on the other hand, which means &quot;blind,&quot; was not new to the language but was in fact an ancient word of Germanic origin -- and already obsolescent in 1608, although the venerable proverb &quot;the bysom ledys the blynde&quot; might still have been current in the provinces. In <em>Hamlet,</em> the deliberately archaizing First Player uses the expression &quot;bisson rheum&quot; for &quot;blinding tears.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;Bisson conspectuities&quot; means &quot;blind sight&quot; or &quot;blear vision.&quot; It&#39;s an especially striking oxymoron because its component parts are drawn from opposite ends of the word hoard -- old and new, plain and polysyllabic, Germanic and Latin, rustic and citified.</p>
<p>But there&#39;s a complication. The word &quot;bisson&quot; doesn&#39;t actually appear in the Folio; there it is &quot;beesome.&quot; &quot;Beesome, usually spelled besom, meant and still means, &quot;broom.&quot; But in the context of <em>Coriolanu</em>s, broom is meaningless; and so, beginning&#0160; with Lewis Theobald in the 1720s, editors have uniformly substituted &quot;bisson&quot; -- an inspired conjecture but still a guess. It&#39;s possible that Shakespeare wrote &quot;bisson&quot; and a scrivener or printer incorrectly read &#39;beesome&quot; -- but perhaps not. An oxymoron of transcendent genius might be merely an illusion -- a creation not of Shakespeare but of editorial tradition.</p>
<p>&quot;Bisson conspectuities&quot; puts quite a burden on members of the Blackfriar&#39;s audience. It&#39;s hard to believe that Shakespeare thought his first hearers would grasp the phrase&#39;s meaning on the fly. It&#39;s easy for us to understand it now, four hundred years later, with a treasury of annotations at the foot of every page. Perhaps Shakespeare didn&#39;t care if the audience comprehended? Is it possible that he was writing just for his own delight, for his pleasure in words? For readers rather than playgoers? Or perhaps he had already divined that he was writing for enthusiasts and scholars of a latter age.</p>

				<p>I don&#39;t know much about economics and never did --it&#39;s an area of knowledge that has lived up to its reputation as a dismal, arcane science. It&#39;s not only economics -- I don&#39;t even understand money, which has become more ethereal and symbolic during the course of my lifetime.</p>
<p>In my first real job, at Sears, Roebuck during the now-historical 1950s, I was handed, come Friday at 4:00pm, an envelope containing a few bills and coins. Money as I understood it.</p>
<p>A guy had bills in his wallet and put some in the bank and blew some on CrackerJacks at Ebbets Field.&#0160;</p>
<p><img alt="vintage" class="hCL kVc L4E MIw" importance="auto" loading="auto" src="https://i.pinimg.com/236x/9e/99/c5/9e99c51b8fdfd5955047708ecdd70bb7.jpg" /> &#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>That was before credit cards and electronic transfers and bitcoins, whatever they are. Of course I understand that money is not just currency. It&#39;s a mysterious commodity -- much prized, but&#0160; also the root of all evil. It has no value until you spend it, and then, once you spend it, you don&#39;t have it. The monetary value of things is often inversely proportionate to their utility: diamonds, pearls, paintings. To have money in the bank gives you a sense of security. Then you die.&#0160;</p>
<p>Most people have way too little money, but some people have more money than is necessary and more than is good for their souls. I&#39;m enthusiastic about taxing wealth. Let&#39;s say a guy has $100,000,000. Suppose there&#39;s an annual 2% wealth tax and he has to contribute $2,000,000 a year to promote the general welfare. How is he harmed?&#0160; He now has $98,000,000. What can you do with $100M that you can&#39;t do with $98M? And moreover, how incompetent must you be if you can&#39;t make your $98M generate a few million and restore you to $100M. You can do good and still stay rich -- what a blessing!</p>
<p>In my opinion, many Americans think about wealth and money incorrectly. They&#39;re like the Johnny Roccos who always want &quot;more.&quot; I was fortunate to be taught by my father, who explained to me that &quot;no one owns anything. The most you can say is that you have a lifetime lease.&quot; He believed in this maxim even though he spent his life negotiating real estate deals. He wasn&#39;t much concerned with money and it didn&#39;t seem to harm him a bit. He had enough, and &quot;enough is as good as a feast.&quot;</p>
<p>To me, wealth means very little, but standard of living means a great deal. My standard of living is very high because my town has an excellent public library and a thriving public school system. And fine mountain trails and other recreational possibilities. These amenities aren&#39;t &quot;mine&quot; -- they&#39;re not money in my personal bank. But they contribute immensely to my standard of living.</p>
<p>What would improve my standard of living? That&#39;s an easy question. I would enjoy my life more if other people lived better. If there were no homeless people panhandling on the mall or sleeping under bridges. If unregarded old folks weren&#39;t thrown into corners. If refugees were welcomed. If medical help was available to all as a birthright. Etc., etc., etc.</p>
<p>I would gladly pay more in taxes if my tax money was spent wisely. I&#39;d be &quot;better off.&quot; There would be less money in my personal pocket but more joy in my life.</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Famous literary doppelgangers include Mr. Hyde, William Wilson, the picture in Dorian Grey&#39;s attic, Leggatt, and Golyadkin Jr. In film, there are the sisters, or twins, Kate and Patricia Bosworth, both played by Bette Davis and no doubt many more that I don&#39;t know or remember that professional movie historians could add. Doubles abound in the world of make-believe, but also occur in &quot;real life.&quot; I&#39;ve had two doppelgangers of my very own. They are not official or clinical doubles but they definitely manifest or &quot;outer&quot; fears that are embedded in the less accessible parts of my brain -- they&#39;re my own personal Sir Smiles. They have haunted me because they embodied the terror of what I might have been or what might have happened to me if I dropped my guard. I never spoke to either of these individuals -- only observed them at a fearful distance.</p>
<p>Many decades ago, when I was a graduate student, there was a rumor in circulation among my peers that 50% of the students who finished their classwork and comprehensive exams never completed their dissertations. Naturally, I was afraid that I that I might fall into that ABD black hole. In those days, I haunted Widener Library&#39;s vast reading room and there it was that I encountered my first dreaded doppelganger. He was a bespectacled gloomy fellow, not unlike me, but taller, ganglier, and, I think, homelier. The story was that he had been working on his dissertation for 17 years. After I would sit I down to work in a morning, he&#39;d wander in, choose a place, open his briefcase, spread out his books and papers on the table, sharpen his pencils and then, after a quarter of an hour, get up and walk out and come back a few minutes later with a copy of <em>The New York Times</em>. He&#39;d read the paper in a leisurely manner, then put it aside and turn to his dissertation. After a while, he would check his watch and then go out for a cup of coffee. Shortly afterward, it was lunchtime; then it was time for tea, and then came the hour to pack up and go home. Did he do an hour&#39;s work during the day; not much more, maybe less.</p>
<p>Of course I feared that I could turn into this fellow. I suspect that it was good for me to be presented with such a scary doppelganger. His negative example forced me to keep my nose to the grindstone. Without Sir Procrastination, who knows, I might be sitting at that library table to this day, pretending to write that damn dissertation.</p>
<p>My second doppelganger is equally frightening but more contemporary. He&#39;s a pathetic guy who lives right here in Boulder -- somewhere nearby, because he frequently passes my window on his way to the mall, where he hits people up for spare change. He looks alarmingly like me -- same size, same shape, roughly of my age, though grayer and balder and dirtier. I could have been him if a single one of my genes on a single chromosome had failed. There I would be, living alone in a small room stacked to the gills with newspapers and magazines, living off welfare and emerging only to shout leftist slogans at passers-by. Doppelganger #2 is a crazy defective version of myself; a secret sharer who embodies my deepest fears.&#0160;</p>
<p>I confess that I hate these two guys, not for themselves but because I know that I could have been them if I hadn&#39;t been lucky.</p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2020/05/sir-smile.html">Sir Smile</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<div>Sir Smile is a &quot;character,&quot; in a way of speaking, in Shakespeare&#39;s <em>The Winter&#39;s Tale. </em>He&#39;s one the play&#39;s most fully-realized figures, even though he says no words, doesn&#39;t appear on stage, and exists nowhere but in King Leontes&#39; diseased, paranoid fantasy life-- and then only for an evanescent second. Truth to tell, Sir Smile also appears to be an emanation from a dark corner of Shakespeare&#39;s own individual imagination.&#0160;</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>When does Sir Smile make his momentary appearance?&#0160; Leontes has gone off the deep end. Without the least shred of evidence, he generates the extremely destructive fantasy that his wife Hermione has been a-bed with his best friend and fellow king, Polixenes. He&#39;s in a rage, so much so that in the course of a stunning soliloquy, he busts right through the inviolable fourth wall and addresses himself directly to the men in the audience. He looks them right in the eye. &quot;There have been,&quot; he laments, &quot;cuckolds ere now&quot;</div>
<div><br />And many a man there is, even at this present,<br />Now while I speak this, holds his wife by the arm,<br />That little thinks she has been sluiced in&#39;s absence<br />And his pond fish&#39;d by his next neighbor, by<br />Sir Smile, his neighbor.</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>Leontes&#39; soliloquy is &quot;to the moment.&quot; &quot;This is not make-believe. Look to your left and right, guys -- while you&#39;re clutching your wife&#39;s elbow, enjoying the play, that sly impudent fellow standing there, Sir Smile, has been fishing in your pond, ploughing your field, sleeping in your bed. It happens to everyone. Men -- we&#39;re all victims, all of us. We&#39;re drowning in sea of betrayal. You can&#39;t trust your neighbor, you can&#39;t trust anyone. And worse -- the seducers, the enemy, don&#39;t just diddle your wife; they triumph, they grin, they fleer. They amuse themselves at your suffering. Every one of them, sitting or standing in this theatre, is now or will be a such a person.&quot;</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>Sir Smile embodies Leontes&#39; deepest fears. He distills humiliation and jealousy into a figure who is half nightmare and half allegory. In psychological terms, he&#39;s Leontes&#39; doppelganger or double.</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>But why does Shakespeare call him Sir Smile? Why not Lord Lewd or Viscount Vice?</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>The honorific, the &quot;Sir&quot; part, is easy. Shakespeare regularly employs the word almost as a nickname. Sometimes his &quot;sir&quot; can sometimes be affectionate -- Leontes himself calls his son Mamillius,&quot;sir page.&quot; Similarly, Lucius is &quot;sir boy&quot; to Titus. There&#39;s even a &quot;Sir King&quot; in <em>Cymbeline.</em> &quot;Sir&quot; can also be hostile: &quot;sir knave.&quot; And sometime it&#39;s neutral; timid Viola would rather &quot;go with sir priest than sir knight.&quot;&#0160; Sir-ness becomes more meaningful when its use is exemplary or abstract: &quot;Sir Valor&quot; in <em>Troilus and Cressida; &quot;</em>Sir Prudence&quot; in <em>The Tempest; &quot;</em>Sir Oracle&quot; in <em>The Merchant of Venice.</em> The Sir in Sir Smile has an instructive history.</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>But why is he a smiler?&#0160; Why does Shakespeare offer us a profligate or a roue who smiles as he goes about his amorous business?&#0160; To followers of Shakespeare, there&#39;s a ready answer. It&#39;s well known that false and hypocritical smiles transfix the Shakespearean imagination. The locus for this is <em>Hamlet, </em>where&#0160;Denmark&#39;s prince is beside himself, furious at what he has seen in the face of Claudius, who is a</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>&#0160; &#0160; villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!<br />My tables! Meet it is I set it down<br />That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain.</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>Smiling and villainy merge inextricably. Exactly as in the case of Leontes&#39; imaginary neighbor, there&#39;s evil lurking beneath Claudius&#39; smiley face. When Hamlet writes in his &quot;table&quot; -- we would say &quot;tablet&quot; --that &quot;one may smile and be a villain,&quot; his characterization has the force of revelation or of a proverb or gnomic utterance.</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>But it&#39;s not only Claudius. The smile in &quot;Sir Smile&quot; emerges from a Shakespearean underworld. There&#39;s Richard of Gloucester, an unequalled villain, who can not only &quot;cry &#39;Content&#39; to that which grieves my heart,/ And wet my cheeks with artificial tears,/ And frame my face to all occasions&quot; but who can also, most pertinently, &quot;smile, and murder whiles I smile.&quot; And then there are the &quot;smiling smooth, detested parasites&quot; of <em>Timon of Athens</em>; the &quot;villain with a smiling cheek&quot; and the &quot;smiling rogues&quot; of <em>The Merchant of Venice; &quot;</em>the smiling pick-thanks&quot; --sycophants or flatterers -- of <em>The Second Part of King Henry the Fourth</em> as well as the assassins whom Calpurnia dreams &quot;came smiling&quot; to bathe their hands in Caesar&#39;s blood. Shakespeare&#39;s smiles are often linked to danger: Iago of Cassio; &quot;Ay, smile upon her, do.&quot; Kent, in K<em>ing Le</em>ar is enraged by condescending smiling Oswald: &quot;A plague upon your epileptic visage! Smoile you my speeches, an I were a fool?&quot;</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>Hence loathsome &quot;Sir Smile.&quot;&#0160;</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>Fortunately, even for Shakespeare there are redeeming moments when when a smile is still a smile. Touchstone (in <em>As You Like It</em>) is in love. He remembers kissing his beloved&#39;s batler, &quot;and the cow&#39;s dugs that her pretty chapt hands had milk&#39;d; and remember[s}&#0160; the wooing of a peascod instead of her; from whom I took two cods, and giving her them again, said with weeping tears &#39;Wear these for my sake.&#39;&quot; The name of Touchstone&#39;s lovely rural mistress is &quot;Jane Smile.&quot; No &quot;sirs&quot; in this Smile family, no sirree!</div>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Everyone has their favorite 1940s &quot;bad girl.&quot; Some of mine: Ann Savage in <em>Detour </em>(1945), Jane Greer in <em>Out of the Past</em> (1947), Joan Bennett in <em>Scarlet Street</em> (1948), Yvonne de Carlo in <em>Criss Cross</em> (1949), Rita Hayworth in <em>The Lady from Shanghai</em> (1947, and Lana Turner in <em>The Postman Always Rings Twice</em> (1946) but for my money the baddest of them all, the baddest of the bad, is sultry homicidal Lizabeth Scott as Jane Palmer in <em>Too Late for Tears </em>(1948). It&#39;s not just that she murders her first husband, shoots her second, and poisons her accomplice. Or that she sleeps with blackmailer Danny Fuller (Dan Duryea) to enlist him to her cause. Or that she betrays friend, foe and family.Or that she&#39;s manipulative, vengeful, hedonistic (&quot;I want money&quot;) and depraved. It&#39;s that she&#39;s utterly soulless, conscienceless, and heartless. Not a tinge of fellow-feeling. She could out-Goneril Goneril, bad girl of the canonical classics.</p>
<p>The ending of the film is a disappointment. Instead of Jane Palmer sent to the electric chair or locked in the hoosegow for life, she&#39;s allowed to fall out of a window and die. Not fair -- I wanted retribution.</p>
<p>On second thought, if she had been arrested, she would have corrupted the police, compromised the judicial system, and caused the death of a handful of fellow prisoners and prison guards. Maybe it&#39;s just as well to kill her off and be done with it.&#0160;</p>
<p>Here&#39;s Lizabeth Scott holding a gun on her nemesis (Don DeFore). Is she bad or what?</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>It&#39;s an unlikely pairing -- what possible connection could there be between Petruchio, a creature of farce, and Othello, distinguished general and tragic victim of the green monster. Yet there is a surprising point of contact -- two similar (but very different) reminiscences. It&#39;s not usual for Shakespeare&#39;s characters to have a &quot;backstory,&quot; but both P and O attempt one.</p>
<p>Petruchio brags that a shrew can&#39;t scare him, because he&#39;s been there before. &quot;Think you a little din can daunt mine ears?&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>He riffs on the word &quot;din.&quot; He&#39;s inured to noise, he claims -- and how he came to be so adds a new and improbable dimension to his character.</p>
<p>Have I not in my time heard lions roar?<br />Have I not heard the sea puff&#39;d up with winds<br />Rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat?<br />Have I not heard great ordnance in the field,<br />And heaven&#39;s artillery thunder in the skies?<br />Have I not in a pitched battle heard<br />Loud &#39;larums, neighing steeds, and trumpets&#39; clang?</p>
<p>I, for one, don&#39;t believe a word that Petruchio utters and I doubt whether Shakespeare expects us to do so. It&#39;s all bluster, the words of an accomplished bullshitter. Petruchio is a youthful fortune-hunter, full of bravado and effrontery to be sure, but except in this passage, he lacks an adventurous past or a military history. When did he hear lions roar?&#0160; While on a Roads Scholar tour of Scythia or central Africa? And where was the sea like an &quot;angry boar?&quot; Where was the &quot;great ordnance&quot; and &quot;loud alarum?&quot; More likely at Saturday afternoon serials than in the tented field.&#0160;</p>
<p>Othello&#39;s story, on the other hand, though more extravagant and fantastic, is grandly persuasive. Here&#39;s a piece of it:&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160; &#0160; &#0160; I spake of most disastrous chances,<br />Of moving accidents by flood and field<br />Of hair-breadth scapes i&#39; the&#0160;<span class="keyword1">imminent</span>&#0160;deadly breach,<br />Of being taken by the insolent foe<br />And sold to slavery, of my redemption thence<br />And portance in my travels&#39; history:<br />Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle,<br />Rough quarries, rocks and hills whose heads touch heaven<br />It was my hint to speak,—such was the process;<br />And of the Cannibals that each other eat,<br />The Anthropophagi and men whose heads<br />Do grow beneath their shoulders.</p>
<p>Othello veers into the mythological yet his story comports with what we otherwise know of him.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Petruchio&#39;s tale is an instance of &quot;just-in-time&quot; characterization. Shakespeare needs to display Petruchio&#39;s bravery in the face of a scolding woman -- so he produces a soldiership story. It doesn&#39;t accord with Petruchio&#39;s history, but it doesn&#39;t need to, because it serves an immediate necessary dramatic function. Othello&#39;s speech is part and parcel; Petruchio&#39;s is a loose end.</p>
<p>And the language! The first passage, in early T<em>he Taming of the Shrew</em>, is perfunctory; the second, in the mature tragedy, is simply magnificent. Anyone looking for evidence of Shakespeare&#39;s progress of a poet could do worse than compare these two passages.</p>

				<p>I think it was Oscar Wilde who said that the most terrifying words in the English language were, &quot;I want to tell you about my dream.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I persist.</p>
<p>Last night, I came out of a train station in Berlin (a city I&#39;ve never visited in my daytime life) but instead of a valise or luggage I had only a banjo case, with a banjo inside and room for a couple of pair of socks at most. But I thought, I have cash and I can buy clothes. Then I looked in my wallet and found only a couple of one-dollar bills. I thought, now I&#39;m in trouble. Nevertheless, I persisted, and set out for my hotel. Then it started to rain, pour actually, and I realized that I wasn&#39;t wearing proper shoes, just flimsy slippers. Next I came to understand that I had no idea where to find my hotel.&#0160;</p>
<p>So there I am with a banjo on my knee but nowhere to go, no cash, no proper clothes, no hotel, in an unfamiliar strange city.</p>
<p>But now comes the &quot;agency&quot; part. I announce, to no one in particular, &quot;I don&#39;t want to be in this dream.&quot; And I woke up.</p>
<p>I&#39;m very proud of myself for taking charge. A good precedent for tomorrow&#39;s nightmare.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>The Israeli TV program<em> Shtisel</em>, about an ultra-orthodox, Haredi family, is soap opera, but with a hair fetish.&#0160; It&#39;s all about beards, peyot, and sheitals; one female character cries the whole night through because her wig slipped and an inch of her own natural hair was visible -- to men. Sometimes it&#39;s taxing to be empathetic to the Shtisel clan.</p>
<p>But even fanatics are people, and the business of the program is the same as the business of all soap operas -- getting married, staying married, and healing frayed marriages.</p>
<p><em>Shitse</em>l sustained our interest through 24 episodes because the characters are recognizable human beings and their problems were familiar and real. What is different and foreign about the Shtisels and their Haredi compatriots is their triumphalism -- they are correct and everyone else is wrong -- and the many ways in the silly rules of doctrinaire religion constrict the characters&#39; choices and inflict upon them unnecessary misery. Shulem, the family patriarch, enjoys funny radio shows, but he stops doing so because it&#39;s wrong. Zvi Arye is a splendid singer, but he can&#39;t join a musical group because joy in music might lead him in a secular direction. Uncle Nuchem loves classical music, especially Mahler, but he destroys his tape of the Tragic Symphony because it is worldly and therefore endangers his piety. The lead character, attractive young Akiva, is a gifted painter, but his father and his uncle and his fiancee pressure him to chuck his talents and become respectable, and pious, and a travel agent. Will he give up on his genius?&#0160; Perhaps Season 3, if it ever gets made, will tell us. I have nothing against travel agents, but Akiva&#39;s painting touches his soul. The writers of <em>Shtisel</em> are right to see art as a danger to orthodoxy. It&#39;s a solvent. Put religion up against art, and religion might dissolve. Which would be a very proper outcome, in my opinion.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s my favorite line from a week of watching:&#0160; &quot;When you see a Jew with a dog, either he&#39;s not a Jew or the dog is not a dog.&quot;</p>

<p>No question but that he&#39;s a serial liar: just think of the birther thing, the attendance at the inaugural, Sharpiegate, &quot;the best economy in the history of the world,&quot; that Hilary Clinton received 3 to 5 million illegal votes, &quot;total exoneration,&quot; the 16,000+ lies and misstatements since 2016 that the Washington Post has catalogued. Enough falsehoods to circle the earth several times, or more likely, stretch from here to Alpha Centauri.&#0160;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, all these falsehoods pale in comparison to the latest revelation.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>He repeatedly boasted that he was such a baseball star at the New York Military Academy that he could have gone to the majors. Someone finally investigated. Box scores from the 1950s show that he batted .138, with 3 rbi&#39;s and scored one run. Said one baseball guy, “You don’t hit .138 for some podunk, cold-weather high school playing the worst competition you could possibly imagine&quot; and go pro. “It’s absolutely laughable. He hit .138—he couldn’t fucking hit.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>OK, he lies about everything. But about baseball? Some things should be sacred. Off limits.</p>

				<p>I don&#39;t know what is signified by DBMs or EIDE. I am boggled by hard tokens. Defragments leaves me all a-quiver. Shortcuts generally take me the long way around. Does a firewall keep them out or me in? Kibibytes are things you would feed to a pooch. A logic gate is beyond my capacity of reasoning. My netiquette is primitive and when I have nodes I take them to the surgeon. Do I have a KVM switch?&#0160; Dunno. My firmware, frankly, is not what it used to be. My warmboot is frayed; my virtualization illusory.</p>
<p>I may not speak or understand the language of the present generation, but like most members of my age cohort I can identify the skate key, &quot;the cheese stands alone,&quot; the alligator pear, a mustard plaster, &quot;you owe your crowning glory to,/ your something something shampoo,&quot; &quot;L-A-V-A,&quot; &quot;and away-y-y we go,&quot; House Jameson, cod liver oil, Adrien Baillargeon the Canadian strongman, J.

<p>Alas for a youthful population who imagines that the Pontiac 13 was a group of anti-government demonstrators or that Apples Kudelka was a middle European dessert. And doesn&#39;t know the difference between Sparkle Plenty and Good &#39;n Plenty.</p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2020/05/sarcasm.html">Sarcasm in the News</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<div class="noprint" id="mw-head-base">It&#39;s not often that a figure of speech makes the headlines -- as happened this week with the rhetorical term &quot;sarcasm.&quot; At a press conference a couple of days ago, the present occupant of the White House, Donald J. Trump, whose use of language is occasionally infelicitous, let fly with a giant whopper. He announced that the horrid new coronavirus could be cured by (gasp!) an injection of bleach. When his foolish advice&#0160; attracted scorn, he backtracked by claiming that his words were merely &quot;sarcastic.&quot;</div>
<div class="noprint">&#0160;</div>
<div class="noprint">To put the blame on sarcasm is a transparent lie, of course, believed only by one person in the entire universe -- Trump himself -- although no doubt his brek-a-kek-keks of toadies will pretend that his analysis was pure genius.</div>
<div class="noprint">&#0160;</div>
<div class="noprint">But did he truly mean &quot;sarcasm&quot; -- a trope generally marked by a mocking tone of voice and &quot;a sharp, bitter, cutting or caustic expression, a contemptuous gibe or taunt in which hostility is disguised as humor.&quot; Trump seems to define sarcasm rather more loosely: to him in means &quot;I didn&#39;t say what I said yesterday and, besides, it&#39;s all the fault of the media.&quot; What a curious line of defense, and what a misuse of a rhetorical term!&#0160;</div>
<div class="noprint">&#0160;</div>
<div class="noprint">Besides, one should think twice before invoking sarcasm, because the term has a bad name among the psychologists, who consider it a &quot;maladaptive coping mechanism for those with unresolved anger or frustration.&quot; There&#39;s a class of people who employ sarcasm because they have &quot;certain forms of brain damage as a consequence of lesions in the right parahippocampal gyrus.&quot; I have no particular knowledge of Mr. Trump&#39;s parahippocampal gyrus, but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it&#39;s taken a bit of a beating these last few years.</div>
<div class="noprint">&#0160;</div>
<div class="noprint">Sarcasm has even been banned by Trump&#39;s great friend Kim Jong-Un. No sarcasm in North Korea -- a rare instance of a figure of speech being consigned to a firing squad.</div>
<div class="noprint">&#0160;</div>
<div class="noprint">Besides, Trump is already the master of a number of the tropes of traditional rhetoric. There&#39;s<em> enellage, </em>a sentence that ignores the usual grammatical rules and conventions; s<em>olecism</em> and <em>tautology,&#0160;</em>gross violations of syntax and logic; <em>hyperbole,</em> or exaggeration, and its less well-known cousin, <em>adynaton, </em>a collection or list of impossibilities; <em>aposiopesis, </em>the sudden end of a sentence before completion; and <em>paraprosdokian, </em>the unexpected truncation of a clause. But all would agree that the figure of speech that Trump deploys most regularly is<em> prevaricatio.</em></div>
