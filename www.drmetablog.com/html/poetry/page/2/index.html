		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>The most widely-known as well as the most notorious poem of the second half of the twentieth century is Philip Larkin&#39;s &quot;This Be the Verse.&quot; For those of you who don&#39;t know the poem by heart, here it is in its brief and startling entirety.</p>
<p>They fuck you up, your mum and dad.</p>
<p>&#0160; They may not mean to, but they do.</p>
<p>They fill you with the faults they had</p>
<p>&#0160; And add some extra, just for you.</p>
<p>But they were fucked up in the turn</p>
<p>&#0160; By fools in old style hats and coats,</p>
<p>Who half the time were soppy-stern,</p>
<p>&#0160; And half at one another&#39;s throats.</p>
<p>Man adds on misery to man.</p>
<p>&#0160; It deepens like a coastal shelf.</p>
<p>Get out as early as you can,</p>
<p>&#0160; And don&#39;t have any kids yourself.</p>
<p>Pessimistic? Jaded? Angry?&#0160; Yes, I think it&#39;s fair to call it so. And let&#39;s also add, unsubtle with a vengeance.</p>
<p>Larkin is hyperbolically illogical. It can&#39;t be that every generation is more deranged than the one that preceded it. When were the good times? A few generations ago?&#0160; In the medieval period?&#0160; In antiquity?&#0160; In Larkin&#39;s view, it&#39;s been all downhill, all the time. No doubt those early primates were already fucking up their kids when they came down from the trees and started to walk upright on the savannah. &quot;There&#39;s only one piece of roasted rhinoceros left. You take it. I don&#39;t mind being hungry.&quot;</p>
<p>Despite its dyspepsia and illogicality, &quot;This Be the Verse&quot; is a curiously lovable poem. Whenever I&#39;ve heard it read or recited, audiences react not with horror but with amusement. The poem&#39;s misanthropy is so absolute and its language so blunt that it can&#39;t help but provoke tittering.</p>
<p>The laughter arises because the poem doesn&#39;t earn its pessimism. It&#39;s too fluent and too easy. Unlike, say, <em>King Lear, </em>where the sublunary world is rank with incest, betrayal, and murder.&#0160; After three thousand lines and five full horrific acts, Shakespeare acquires the standing to conclude that life is miserable and that &quot;humanity must perforce/ Prey on itself, like monsters of the deep.&quot;</p>
<p>The events in <em>Oedipus </em>lend credibility to the difficult apercu that it&#39;s best not to be born at all, next best to die very young.</p>
<p>While Shakespeare and Sophocles are philosophically serious, Larkin is merely flip. There&#39;s a monumental disproportion between his gloom and the light-verse vessel in which his gloom is contained. And as a consequence, the off-kilter comedy. It&#39;s a whiny poem. &quot;Poor poor pitiful me. I had a difficult mommy.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>If &quot;This Be the Verse&quot; is in fact the most popular poem of the last fifty years, it supersedes Frost&#39;s &quot;Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening.&quot; What a remarkable devolution! While Frost endures, Larkin abhors.</p>
<p>I doubt whether Larkin had &quot;Stopping by Woods&quot; in mind, but he certainly glosses Robert Louis Stevenson&#39;s &quot;Requiem&quot; -- the poem from which he drew his title. Stevenson&#39;s performance is charming, gentle, self-effacing, and modest.&#0160;</p>
<p>Under the wide and starry sky,</p>
<p>Dig the grave and let me lie.</p>
<p>Glad did I live and gladly die.</p>
<p>And laid me down with a will.</p>
<p>This be the verse you grave for me:</p>
<p><em>Here he lies where he longed to be.</em></p>
<p><em>Home is the sailor, home from the sea,</em></p>
<p><em>And the hunter home from the hill. </em></p>
<p>Stevenson praises the adventurous life lived well and brought to completion. Death may end it all but it also closes the circle. No completion, no circles in Larkin, where natural processes are crudely truncated: &quot;don&#39;t have any kids yourself.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This Be the Verse&quot; is a hilarious and wonderful piece of joking, but it&#39;s victimology is unsettling. It&#39;s tempting to claim that it satirizes its own pessimism, but, sorry, it doesn&#39;t. Larkin loves his own gloom.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s another Victorian variation on the thema Larkiniana.</p>
<p>Is life a thorn?</p>
<p>Then count it not a whit.</p>
<p>Man is well done with it.</p>
<p>As soon as he&#39;s born,</p>
<p>He should all means assay</p>
<p>To put the plague away.</p>
<p>Pessimistic, yes.&#0160; But Colonel Fairfax, even-handed, also entertains the possibility that life might be a boon (which, as we all know, is true for at least part of the time).&#0160;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>The poem that might entrance you when you&#39;re young might not be the poem for your older years. In my &quot;mature&quot; phase, poems that I earlier ignored take on new significance. I&#39;m now quite taken with Tennyson&#39;s &quot;Ulysses,&#39;&quot; a dramatic monologue that meant nothing to me until a few years ago. &quot;Ulysses&quot; celebrates perseverance, a late-onset virtue.&#0160;</p>
<p>Another poem that I&#39;ve latterly come to love is Robert Burns&#39; jaunty &quot;John Anderson my jo, John.&quot; To me, in my present incarnation, it&#39;s the most romantic poem in the English language (or, to be precise, the Scottish language).&#0160; While most love poems celebrate desire and longing, &quot;John Anderson,&quot; takes as its subject continuity and longevity. As opposed to more conventional works that come to climax with a wedding, &quot;John Anderson&quot; situates itself near the end of life and glances happily backward over a life well lived. Its frankness about bodily changes is comforting (especially to readers who may no longer glow with first youth). John Anderson may be bald and gray and tottering, but he&#39;s still loved and loving.</p>
<p>The cheerful woman who speaks the poem has lived &quot;hand in hand&quot; with John A. for a lifetime.&#0160;</p>
<p>John Anderson, my jo, John&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160; dear</p>

<p>But now your brow is beld, John,&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160; bald</p>
<p>Your locks are like the snow;</p>
<p>But blessings on your frosty paw;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;head</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>We&#39;re still cleaning out and throwing away (as I reported a couple of days ago).&#0160;Today I discovered, in amongst a small cache of books that I inherited from my father, a volume of poems called <em>Earthbound. </em>I&#39;d never heard of the poet, Helene Mullins, but I traced her via a 2001 <em>The New York Times </em>obituary. &quot;Helene Mullins Johnson, a poet, died on Oct. 26 at her home in Manhattan. She was 92 years old. She died of congestive heart failure. Mrs. Johnson first had her poems published in <em>The Pagan</em>, a Greenwich Village magazine, in the 1920s. After Thornton Wilder introduced her to his publisher, Harper&#39;s published her first novel, <em>Convent Girl,</em> and her first volume of poems, <em>Earthbound,</em> in 1929. Her final collection of poems, <em>Mirrored Walls,</em> was published in 1970.&#0160;There are no survivors.&quot;&#0160;Google provided me with another couple of facts.&#0160;Helene Mullins was born in 1899 in New Rochelle, New York, and educated in &quot;convent boarding schools.&quot; In 1935, she was so severely injured in an automobile accident that she lay unconscious for three weeks.&#0160;</p>
<p>And also: the library nearest to me that owns a copy of <em>Earthbound </em>is the Dakota State University, in Madison, South Dakota, which is precisely 502 miles from where I sit.&#0160;</p>
<p>The poems are, in my view, brimming with pre-Raphaelite fervor. The precursoress whom Mullins most resembles is Christina Rossetti, though there&#39;s an occasional dash of Ernest Dowson, and every once in a while, a gesture borrowed from the early Yeats. The poems are as intense and agonized and spiritual as Rossetti&#39;s, and were, even in their own time, composed in an extremely old-fashioned style.&#0160;</p>
<p>What does the world offer a hard-working but not brilliant poet who was clearly ambitious and tense, and who poured all her strength and feeling into her writing? There she was, a young woman fleeing the convent and shocking her family by taking up residence in Greenwich Village, where she lived near Thornton Wilder and other 1920s gentlemen of literature and where she frequented the irreligious offices of <em>The Pagan</em>. I mourn for the struggle and yearning and effort that went into those long-forgotten poems.&#0160; And which, all said and done, earned her little beyond a&#0160; perfunctory obituary in the <em>Times</em>.</p>
<p>But what in the ever-living universe was this volume doing in my staid father&#39;s library?&#0160; It&#39;s implausible that he could have found anything empathetic in such poems as &quot;St. Theresa&quot; and &quot;The Boy Christ.&quot;&#0160; Especially since <em>Earthbound </em>was the only volume of &quot;contemporary&quot; poetry that he seems to have possessed. In 1929, when <em>Earthbound</em> hit the streets, my father would have been a buoyant, studious young fellow of twenty-five<em> -- </em>a diligent bachelor law clerk with still a year or so to go before he would find Lilly.&#0160;Helen Mullins herself was just thirty years old.&#0160;Is there a story here?&#0160;Am I missing something?</p>
<p>There are no clues; not even a single pencil mark. Nothing from one end of the book to the other. Something doesn&#39;t compute.</p>

		<a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2008/04/an-irish-airman.html">W. B. Yeats, "An Irish Airman Foresees his Death" (1919)</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I know that I shall meet my fate<br />Somewhere among the clouds above;<br />Those that I fight I do not hate,<br />Those that I guard I do not love;<br />My country is Kiltartan Cross,<br />My countrymen Kiltartan&#39;s poor,<br />No likely end could bring them loss<br />Or leave them happier than before.<br />Nor law, nor duty bade me fight,<br />Nor public men, nor cheering crowds,<br />A lonely impulse of delight<br />Drove to this tumult in the clouds;<br />I balanced all, brought all to mind,<br />The years to come seemed waste of breath,<br />A waste of breath the years behind<br />In balance with this life, this death.</p>
<p>Whether the Germans or the British win the war is a matter of utter indifference to Yeats&#39;s Irish airman. Even his own death is of no particular concern. The pilot&#39;s detachment is Olympian. Why then does he participate in the war? The motive, he says in the poem&#39;s most challenging phrase, is &quot;a lonely impulse of delight.&quot;</p>
<p>There is more than one historical resonance to the word &quot;lonely.&quot; Primarily, in this poem, it&#39;s the individual who feels himself to be separated from the mass of mankind, which in late Romantic thought transforms him into some sort of nascent artist. But &quot;lonely&quot; arises out of a second context: the solitude experienced by the self-sufficient warrior. In this second sense, &quot;lonely&quot; expresses a nostalgia for the days of chivalry or single combat that survived into the early twentieth century only in the skies when one skilled pilot faced another (on the ground, it was all inglorious machine guns, barbed wire, poison gas, trench warfare, and death by dysentery). &quot;Impulse&quot; is also a word with Romantic roots. Readers will recall Wordsworth&#39;s famous and extraordinarily irrational assertion that an &quot;impulse from a vernal wood&quot; could be a source of moral learning, where an &quot;impulse&quot; stands superior to clarity of thought or to consistency of logic. An &quot;impulse&quot; is a feeling or sentiment, not an argument, and so functions in this poem also, where the motives traditionally advanced for going to war (loyalty, patriotism, evidence that one&#39;s country is endangered, profit, law, duty, politics) are specifically disclaimed. For the Irish airman, a Wordsworthian &quot;impulse&quot; is sufficient -- especially if it&#39;s an impulse of &quot;delight.&quot; &quot;Delight&quot; signifies the thrill of the game as opposed to the dreariness of ordinary life, which is twice dismissed as merely &quot;a waste of breath.&quot; &quot;Delight&quot; is a word that harks back to the art-for-art&#39;s-sake movement of Yeats&#39;s youth, though even the most prescient would not have foreseen that it would come to describe the death-defying or, in this case, suicidal artistry of the fighter pilot. In &quot;An Irish Airman Foresees his Death,&quot; a &quot;lonely impulse of delight&quot; counterbalances other and more conventional experiences and patterns of thinking. Some will find the airman&#39;s reasoning immensely sad, others will judge it to be invigorating. Yeats himself does not tip his hand.&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;</p>

		<a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2008/02/john-milton-and.html">John Milton and Docosahexaenoic Acid </a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Your “mature” brain has mind of its own. It is intermittently balky and stubborn, reluctant to yield up its stored data.</p>
<p>Many years ago I memorized a few of John Milton’s sonnets.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span>These poems are not only noble and politically engaged, they are also reflective, immaculately crafted, challenging, and melodious<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span>-- as good as any short poems in the language.</p>
<p>One night, a week or so ago, insomniac as usual, I tried to recall one of the finest of the sequence -- the great sonnet in which Milton condemned the ethnic cleansing by Roman Catholic Savoyards of a colony of Swiss Protestants.&#0160;</p>
<p>There was a time when I knew this poem like the back of my hand, but try as I might, all that I could dredge out of my recalcitrant mind was the single phrase “triple tyrant.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span>(In Miltonese, the “triple tyrant” is the Pope, wearer of a three-tiered crown.) It&#39;s mighty frustrating to have so rusty a brain.</p>
<p>The next night, sleepless once again, I re-activated the tired old memory system and was able to scrape up a few more words. I retrieved “where still doth sway the triple tyrant.” (The word “sway” does not imply that the Pope has taken to dancing but rather that the holy father “holds sway” over his dominions.)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> In two days, I had </span>assembled only a single line of poetry and still needed thirteen more to complete the sonnet.&#0160; This sorry state of affairs cried out for radical new approach to memory-jogging.&#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>It is well known that Omega-3 fatty acids (i.e. fish oils) increase the rate of transmission of certain brain waves that are linked to memory. On the third day of my adventure in sonnet-recall, I swallowed a fish oil pill rich in docosahexaenoic acid (commonly known as DHA). When I woke up next morning, there it was on the tip of my tongue (or the top of my brain) -– another line and a half of the sonnet:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span>“Slain by the bloody Piedmontese that rolled/ Mother with infant down the rocks.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> Did I do it all by myself? Or could it possibly have been the </span>DHA? <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span></p>
<p>And in what part of the brain lay hidden this poignant line of poetry before I was able to summon it?&#0160; In what chemical form?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span>Clearly the words were in storage, so to speak, but why couldn’t I freely access them? Was I unconsciously running some sort of failed search program?&#0160; <em>Attention searchers:&#0160; examine poetry quadrant for missing sonnets by Milton, John [1608-1673]. </em>Did the DHA shift the words from a dusty neglected old storeroom to facility currently in us?</p>
<p>Does fish oil really lubricate memory?</p>
<p>The next day, I doubled my intake of the oily acid and, marvelous to say, came up with the poem’s last line:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span>“Early may fly the Babylonian woe”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> (&quot;Babylon&quot; is reformation code for &quot;Rome&quot;). </span>On the fourth day of this experiment, I took three fish oil pills and lo and behold was able to remember the entire first quatrain of the sonnet:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span>“Avenge, O Lord, thy slaughtered saints, whose bones/ Lie scattered on the Alpine mountains cold,/ Even them who kept thy truth so pure of old,/<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span>When all our fathers worshiped stocks and stones.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span>There it is: Milton’s agony and fury, his uncompromising conviction, his contempt for pre-Reformation idol-worship, plus the confidence, that, because he&#39;s something of a prophet himself, he can boss god around.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>I continued to take the pills but I was scared to increase the dosage for fear of provoking what Milton elsewhere calls the “fishy fumes.” After several days of medication and head-scratching, I had conjured up this much of the poem:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span></p>
<p>Avenge, O Lord, thy slaughtered saints, whose bones</p>
<p>Lie scattered on the Alpine mountains cold,</p>
<p>Even them who kept thy truth so pure of old,</p>
<p>When all our fathers worshiped stocks and stones;</p>
<p>Forget not:</p>
<p>&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160; in thy [blank], [blank] their [blank]</p>
<p>Who were thy [blank]</p>
<p>Slain by the bloody Piedmontese that rolled</p>
<p>Mother with infant down the rocks.</p>
<p>&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160; where still doth sway</p>
<p>The triple tyrant;</p>
<p>A hundred-fold</p>
<p>Early may fly the Babylonian woe.</p>
<p>And then, progress came to a halt. No matter how many glutinous pills I popped, no matter how I greased my memory, I could recover nary another syllable. Where was the rest of the poem concealed? Why couldn’t I fish it up?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> Had the molecules of which memory is constituted long ago disintegrated?&#0160; </span></p>
<p>I&#39;ve now declared the experiment officially over.&#0160; Although the results are inconclusive, I&#39;ve decided to continue with the fish oil regimen.&#0160; It&#39;s obvious that my brain needs all the phospholipids it can get.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span></p>
<p>And after a week of disciplined forbearance, I&#39;ve now peeked at the text of <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&quot;</span>On the Late Massacre at Piedmont.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; Every word was </span>familiar -- even the ones that I could not recall.&#0160; Perhaps I might ultimately have brought them to the surface;&#0160; I&#39;m convinced that they were lurking somewhere in the inner recesses of the brain.&#0160;</p>
<p>I’ll re-memorize and hope for the best.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span>Perhaps my newly fishified brain is ready for a renaissance.&#0160; After all, I’m a lot richer in phosphatidylethanolamine, ethanolamine plasmalogens, and phosphatidylserine than I was just a week ago. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span></p>
<p>Loyal readers:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> <a href="http://rpo.library.utoronto.ca/poem/1454.html">here</a> you may find John Milton&#39;s masterful sonnet </span>&quot;On the Late Massacre at Piedmont.&quot; Trust me, it&#39;s worth a look. In fact, it&#39;s worth committing to memory.&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>This pretty six-line poem is not nearly as naive as it first appears. But it&#39;s a poem to savor and one that has richly earned its place in the anthologies. It&#39;s often, mistakenly in my opinion, listed among the best &quot;love poems&quot; in the English language.</p>
<p>Whenas in silks my Julia goes,</p>
<p>Then, then, methinks, how sweetly flows</p>
<p>The liquefaction of her clothes.</p>
<p>Next, when I cast mine eyes and see</p>
<p>That brave vibration each way free</p>
<p>O how that glittering taketh me.</p>
<p>The story, the &quot;plot,&quot; is simplicity itself: a poet becomes infatuated with &quot;Julia&#39;s&quot; garments.</p>
<p>&quot;Upon Julia&#39;s Clothes&quot; may be a poem about &quot;love,&quot; but it seems severely truncated, because every reader anticipates that, even though the poet is attracted to his lady&#39;s adornments, he&#39;ll soon confess that he truly desires Julia herself -- her hair, her eyes, and if he takes the well-trodden path, her virtue, which he intends to overcome. But not this poet, not this poem. &quot;Upon Julia&#39;s Clothes&quot; is exactly what it announces itself to be; a sestet upon Julia&#39;s clothes. Readers learn nothing of Julia, and to tell truth, almost nothing of her costume. The poet lays claim to no interest or expertise in fashion. Instead, he offers a series of images of a silk dress in coruscating, shimmering motion: its flow, its &quot;liquefaction&quot;, its &quot;vibration,&quot; its &quot;glittering.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#39;s in this lovely, odd, and surprising sequence of nouns that the poem&#39;s intrigue lies. The word &quot;glittering&quot; is troublesome. A ardent wooer would be unlikely to claim that he was attracted to his beloved&#39;s &quot;glitter.&#39;&#39; To do so would be an admission of both his and her superficiality. Plus it&#39;s a matter of record that all that glisters is not gold. The word &quot;vibration&quot; is an equally curious choice. &quot;Vibration&quot; was brand-new to the language when this poem was written and the Latin word from which it had recently been annexed meant &quot;shaking&quot; -- as a spear or a sword is shaken in defiance of the enemy. &quot;Vibration&quot; was more aggressive than it was loverly. &quot;Liquefaction&quot; -- the most startling noun, was confined to an alchemical context. Taken together, the series of dispassionate nouns dilutes any expectation that the poem is an invitation to romance. The poet may have been &quot;taken&quot; --charmed -- by the &quot;glittering&quot; -- but he&#39;s not all that pleased to have been so.&#0160;</p>
<p>The contrary or anti-romantic tendency in the poem is realized in a subversive metaphor so ingenious and subtle that it registers only subliminally.&quot;Upon Julia&#39;s Clothes&quot; is, figuratively speaking, about the sport of fishing. The most overt hint is the employment of the phrase &quot;when I cast mine eyes&quot; which replaces the more ordinary &quot;when I look.&quot; Once a reader notices that piscatorial &quot;cast,&quot; the secondary meanings of other words become immediately clear -- especially when we recall that in those days, fishing line and fishing ties were made of silk. The watery metaphors in &quot;flows&quot; and &quot;liquefaction&quot; provide the stream, the &quot;brave (extravagant) vibration&quot; is an oscillating lure, and &quot;how that glittering taketh me&quot; refers to the deluded poet, who has snapped at a shiner and is now hooked. As soon as the metaphor bobs to the surface, &quot;how that glittering taketh me,&quot; which at first glance meant only &quot;how that dress enchants me,&quot; acquires a second meaning -- &quot;how that lure hooks me.&quot; Julia&#39;s clothes, of course, have been transformed into the dangerous lure.</p>
<p>The sestet is therefore not so much about love-longing as it is about confusion and ambivalence toward women, toward sex and toward sexuality. Julia&#39;s clothes captivate the poet, yes, but he&#39;s a poor fish, unwillingly enthralled.</p>
<p>And so the reader now understands why nothing much is made of Julia, the supposed inhabitant of these silken, seductive clothes. It&#39;s because there is no Julia -- that is, no specific warm-blooded woman worth the wedding, the wooing, or even the sport. In her place, there is only an archetypical Dangerous Female and a culturally-loaded intrapsychic battle between reluctant desire and the deeply puritanical fear of desire.</p>
<p>Would it be possible to guess, strictly on the basis of this poem, that the author of &quot;Upon Julia&#39;s Clothes&quot; (Robert Herrick [1591-1674]), was a clergyman and a lifelong bachelor?</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>At age seventeen, awash in hormones, I took a serious shine to the sensuous words with which, in Marlowe&#39;s play, Faustus addresses Helen of Troy.&#0160;</p>
<p>Oh, thou art fairer than the evening air<br />Clad in the beauty of a thousand stars;<br />Brighter art thou than flaming Jupiter<br />When he appeared to hapless Semele;<br />More lovely than the monarch of the sky<br />In wanton Arethusa&#39;s azured arms.</p>
<p>Just a bit more polished and glorious than what I myself could devise in the way of compliment, the outer limit of which was &quot;you&#39;re looking kinda nice.&quot;</p>
<p>No wonder I was impressed. Marlowe was, and still is, a young person&#39;s poet. Ageless because he was murdered at age 29, he was flamboyant, unsubtle, and hyperbolic beyond any ordinary hyperbole. And above all, musical. &quot;Wanton Arethusa&#39;s azured arms?&quot; &quot;Azured&quot; only because the unusual adjective jauntily reinforces the timbre of&#0160; &quot;Arethusa.&quot;&#0160; In actual fact, even the most alluring of female arms aren&#39;t blue --unless they are bruised, which Marlowe surely did not mean to imply). &quot;Wanton?&quot;&#0160; In the story, Arethusa was chaste and preserved herself from the approach not of the monarch of the skies, but of the minor river-god Alpheus. Marlowe could trample on visual accuracy and learned tradition. But who could grudge him when the outcome was sonic delight. Nor did it seem to matter that Helen was compared not to a female goddess (many were available) but to Jove himself. And so I toted Tucker Brooke&#39;s old-spelling edition of Marlowe&#39;s works to my 1950s summer job, hoping and pretending that the poet&#39;s escapist rhythms could put a little shine into the grim warehouse where I earned my pittance.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve just read a new biography of Christopher Marlowe. It&#39;s Park Honan&#39;s <em>Christopher Marlowe, Poet and Spy (</em>Oxford, 2005). It&#39;s a good but not great book. It&#39;s a revelation how much new information has come to light in the last fifty years&#0160; -- not so much about Marlowe himself as about his co-workers in the espionage business. Honan attends to Marlowe&#39;s plays, but he&#39;s clearly more interested in spying and in the Elizabethan political milieu. He repeatedly employs such formulas as &quot;Marlowe could not help think... or &quot;Marlowe must have felt...&quot; in order to lace public events to the poet&#39;s putative consciousness. It&#39;s a doubtful procedure, but I suppose justified by the paucity of direct biographical evidence. Honan is diligent in accumulating information but his writing is careless and his interpretation of the plays hardly more than slapdash.&#0160;</p>
<p>It&#39;s no secret that Christopher Marlowe, son of a mere shoemaker, wrote obsessively about men of lowly origin who achieve greatness. Faustus was (in Marlowe&#39;s version only) &quot;base of stock,&quot; Gaveston a commoner who attends a king, and most notably Tamburlaine a simple shepherd who sets his foot on a large slice of the Asian steppe. Honan thinks that Marlowe was ashamed of his father&#39;s trade, and adduces as evidence the fact that the playwright &quot;never uses words such as shoe, shoemaker, or sole but distances himself from his father&#39;s concerns. At the various times when he refers to leather, or boots, the allusions are oddly repulsive: &#39;Covetousness: begotten of an old churl in a leather bag,&#39; &#39;a worm eaten leathern targets,&#39; &#39;As if he had meant to clean my boots with his lips,&#39; &#39;our boots which lie foul upon our hands.&#39;&quot;&#0160; Such lines, according to Honan, &quot;suggest hatred&quot; of the cobbler&#39;s work.</p>
<p>Perhaps, but not the whole story. In <em>Tamburlaine,</em> when the Scythian shepherd woos Zenocrate, his seduction technique is to pile gifts at her feet. &quot;A hundred Tartars shall attend on thee/ Mounted on steeds, swifter than Pegasus./&#0160; Thy garments shall be made of Medean silk,/ Enchast with precious jewels of mine own./ With milk-white harts upon an ivory sled,/ Thou shalt be drawn amidst the frozen pools,/ And scale the icy mountains lofty tops.&quot; And on, and on -- Marlowe, bless his enthusiastic heart, was never embarrassed by excess. No shoes in the royal dowry?&#0160; But wait. There&#39;s also Marlowe&#39;s best known poem, the &quot;passionate shepherd to his love.&quot; The Arcadian shepherd, following at the heels of the Scythian, also offers a long list of gifts to his beloved.</p>
<p>I will make thee beds of roses</p>
<p>And a thousand fragrant posies,</p>
<p>A cap of flowers, and a kirtle</p>
<p>Embroidered all with leaves of myrtle.</p>
<p>A gown made of the finest wool</p>
<p>Which from our pretty lambs we pull,</p>
<p>Fair linèd slippers for the cold,</p>
<p>With buckles of the purest gold.</p>
<p>&quot;Fair-lined slippers for the cold,/ With buckles of the purest gold!!&quot;&#0160; &#0160;Not your ordinary, trudging-around-Canterbury-in-the-mud shoes, but footwear nevertheless. When he wrote these lines, &quot;Marlowe could not help think&quot; -- to use the formula of biographers -- that he had celebrated and ennobled his father&#39;s profession.&#0160;</p>
<p>Or so I like to think. Although John Marlowe probably did very little business in the gold-buckle line.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>When I lived in Cambridge in the first years of the 1960s, it was not unusual to encounter, on a warm winter afternoon, the poet Robert Frost walking slowly along Massachusetts Avenue. I&#39;d watch him as he strolled over to Plympton Street and to the Grolier -- which was then as now, I imagine, the only all-poetry bookstore in America. One day I crept behind him to the shop and sat in a secluded corner, studying him as he browsed the shelf of new arrivals. With his leathery old skin and unruly iridescent white hair, he was an iconic figure -- famous not only among friends of poetry but among readers of <em>Life</em> and <em>Collier&#39;s</em> and <em>The Saturday Evening Post.</em>&#0160;When he &quot;said&quot; his poems at Sanders Theater (in late 1961 or 1962), he filled every seat and every standpoint of a large auditorium. He was an honest-to-goodness celebrity, a presence, a man who had created a body of work and had earned a reputation that no poet or cultural figure today can rival.</p>
<p>At JFK&#39;s inauguration in January of 1961, Frost commanded a national television audience. He started to read the poem he had composed for the occasion, but his 87-year-old eyes were blinded by the bright sunlight and he couldn&#39;t continue. There was a moment of embarrassment, and I remember cringing in sympathy with his struggle. But then he gathered himself and recited from memory, in a rejuvenated voice, &quot;The Gift Outright.&quot; &quot;She was our land more than a hundred years/ Before we were her people.&quot; It&#39;s an almost mystical but grandly patriotic poem about rude, unlettered colonials transforming themselves into a Nation. &quot;Such as we were we gave ourselves outright.../ To the land vaguely realizing westward,/ But still unstoried, artless, unenhanced, / Such as she was, such as she would become.&quot;</p>
<p>Frost died in January of 1963, just ten months before our young president was shot. It&#39;s almost impossible now to reconstruct the effervescence of the Kennedy years -- a brief exciting moment between the lukewarm bland Eisenhower administration and the interminable nightmare of Vietnam. Frost&#39;s &quot;Dedication,&quot; the poem that he couldn&#39;t read at the inaugural, is not his best work, but its last lines catch the spirit of the time. The poet took his inspiration from the Rome of Augustus and of Horace, Virgil, and Ovid. &quot;It is no miracle the mood is high,&quot; he wrote.&#0160; &quot;It makes the prophet in us all presage/ The glory of the next Augustan age/ Of a power leading from its strength and pride,/ Of young ambition eager to be tried,/ Firm in our free beliefs without dismay,/ In any game the nations want to play./ A golden age of poetry and power/ Of which this noonday&#39;s the beginning hour.&quot; Frost proved to be a better poet than a prophet. Instead of a golden age of poetry and power, we&#39;ve had, after the three horrible murders, a parade of fools: first the crook, then the senile puppet, then the congressional fellatio hunters, and now the smirking, dangerous dunce.&#0160;</p>
<p>Like the nation, I too am in steep decline. It used to be that I could memorize short poems with ease. Nowadays, it&#39;s a titanic effort of will. To forestall hardening of the mind, and in a desperate effort to keep my brain supple, I decided to memorize Frost&#39;s &quot;Birches.&quot; It&#39;s when you learn a poem by heart that you truly appreciate it, and so I can now say with absolute confidence and authority that &quot;Birches&quot; is a poem not just for the age, but for all time. In point of fact, I&#39;ve been bothering myself about how Frost will fare in civilizations as far into the future as Virgil and Horace are in our past. Will students of poetry be able to grasp the subtlety of &quot;Birches?&quot; The story, the plot itself, will pose no problem. Frost knows that birches are bent to the ground by ice-storms, but he would fancifully &quot;prefer to have some boy bend them/ As he went out and in to fetch the cows.&quot; For the &quot;boy,&quot; tree-climbing is a high art: &quot;He always kept his poise/ To the top branches, climbing carefully/ With the same pains you use to fill a cup/ Up to the brim, and even above the brim.&quot; Frost then shifts perspective, and the fantasy that birches are bent not by ice-storms but by athletic youngsters transforms into a memory, a truth: &quot;So was I once myself a swinger of birches;/ And so I dream of going back to be.&quot; He closes the poem with a vision in which he leaves the real world and starts life anew: &quot;I&#39;d like to go by climbing a birch tree,/ And climb black branches up a snow-white trunk/ Toward heaven, till the tree could bear no more,/ But dipped its top and set me down again.&quot; Even though our descendants will read the poem in an extinct language and in an edition encrusted with explanatory footnotes, I&#39;m sure that they&#39;ll understand its outline. (I imagine too that some future scholar will make his career by explicating the line &quot;A boy too far from town to learn baseball.&quot;) But will anyone in 4006 A.D. be sufficiently conversant with everyday twentieth-century American English to recognize the skill with which Frost masks his deep insights into the relationship between the material and the eternal with art-that-hides-art colloquialisms? Or appreciate to the full the sly understatement of &quot;one could do worse than be a swinger of birches?&quot; The beauty and the profundity of &quot;Birches&quot; tease us who share Frost&#39;s language. What a challenge the poem will be eighty generations down the road! Moreover, Is there even the remotest possibility that our successors will be equipped to grasp how much of Roman poetry (Ovid especially) Frost distills into &quot;I&#39;d like to get away from earth awhile/ And then come back to it and begin over./ May no fate willfully misunderstand me/ And half grant what I wish and snatch me away/ Not to return.&quot; Frost possessed the genius to keep us in touch with our past and to connect us to our future.</p>
<p>I wish that I had talked to Robert Frost that winter day when he was trudging on. &quot;How are you, Mr. Frost,&quot; I might have asked. Perhaps he would have smiled or said &quot;Nice day.&quot;</p>
<p>That would have been a good thing to recall.&#0160; &#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Here are two excellent poems, of different eras and origins, that are at heart surprisingly similar. The first, &quot;Politics,&quot; written in the pre-World War 30s, is by W. B. Yeats.</p>
<p>How can I, that girl standing there,</p>
<p>My attention fix</p>
<p>On Roman or on Russian</p>
<p>Or on Spanish politics?</p>
<p>Yet here&#39;s a traveled man that knows</p>
<p>What he talks about,</p>
<p>And there&#39;s a politician</p>
<p>That has read and thought.</p>
<p>And maybe what they say is true</p>
<p>Of war and war&#39;s alarms,</p>
<p>But O that I were young again</p>
<p>And held her in my arms!</p>
<p>This lovely verse restates a perennial literary theme: the conflict between public and personal, or, between the life of duty and the life of pleasure. The speaker of the poem, whoever he is, withdraws from a troubling weary political conversation into a succinctly limned but very concrete and nostalgic sexual fantasy. The anxieties heaped up in the first ten lines are overpowered by the buoyancy of the concluding two. The hinge of the poem is the daring &quot;But O&quot; -- &quot;O&quot; being the most dangerous syllable in poetry, which, when wrongly used, can be a sentimental disaster, but when discreetly employed, as here, condenses into one moan an outburst of genuine feeling that overwhelms a stultifying social ritual. For a pleasing moment, the speaker, powered by that great &quot;O,&quot; withdraws from politics to enjoy, at least in his imagination, the pleasures and consolations of sex.&#0160; I&#0160;</p>
<p>Here&#39;s another poem -- a song, actually -- quoted first in sixteenth-century manuscript version and then modernized.</p>
<p>Westron wynde when wyll thow blow</p>
<p>&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; The smalle rayne down can rain</p>
<p>Cryst if my love were in my Armys</p>
<p>&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; And I in my bed Agayne.</p>
<p>(And now the modernized version.)</p>
<p>Western wind, when wilt thou blow</p>
<p>&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; The small rain down can rain?</p>
<p>Christ, that my love were in my arms</p>
<p>&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; And I in my bed again.</p>
<p>In this anonymous quatrain, it&#39;s not politics but the cruel world itself that is so discomforting. It&#39;s winter, and the singer waits for the western wind that is the harbinger of spring. &quot;Small rain&quot; is not an idiom that is still in use;&#0160; nowadays we say &quot;light rain&quot; -- the meaning is something like &quot;April showers.&quot;&#0160; In the traditional world that we have lost, &quot;small rain&quot; might even have had just a touch of biblical resonance: &quot;as the small rain upon the tender herb, and as the showers upon the grass.&quot; The &quot;small rain,&quot; when it will at last come, will bring an end to harsh sterile winter and signal the start of fertile spring. To paraphrase the first two lines: &quot;when will the western wind bring in the showers that will cause the earth once more to bloom?&quot;&#0160; And then the hinge expletive &quot;Christ&quot; (paralleling Yeats&#39;s &#39;O&#39; but shockingly blasphemous) which precipitates a potent sexual fantasy: in his warm, no longer wet wintry bed, the speaker can shower sex upon his beloved.</p>
<p>Four exquisite, unmatchable lines of erotic poetry that are, miraculously, even more spare and resonant than Yeats&#39;s.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>One of the most joyful of nursery rhymes, and a personal favorite, is this:</p>
<p>&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160; Crosspatch,</p>
<p>&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160; Draw the latch.</p>
<p>&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160; Sit by the fire and spin.</p>
<p>&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160; Take a cup,</p>
<p>&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160; And drink it up.</p>
<p>&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160; Then call the neighbors in.</p>
<p>The clicky rhymes and jaunty meter are undeniably beautiful -- and there&#39;s much more meaning than poems of this kind usually contain.</p>
<p>In the first triad, a &quot;crosspatch,&quot; -- a &quot;cross or ill-tempered person, usually a girl or woman&quot; -- is at work, spinning. In the second triad, she&#39;s exhorted to drink and also to invite her neighbors &quot;in&quot; -- presumably into the room, or just as likely, the tiny cottage -- where she lives alone. In the first strophe, the theme is isolation, but in the second, isolation is challenged by the calls of society and by the hope of a more satisfactory and convivial life.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>What can we know or imagine about the surly individual addressed by the evocative designation, &quot;crosspatch?&quot;&#0160; The first element in the name --&quot;cross&quot;-- implies not only sourness, but also resistance, as in &quot;cross-grained.&quot; The second element -- &quot;patch&quot; -- suggests that the crosspatch&#39;s discontent is not without cause. We can infer that she&#39;s poor because she&#39;s a person whose garments are either assembled from various rescued materials, as in &quot;patchwork,&quot; or that her clothes are, in another sense of the word patch, repaired. In addition, it&#39;s possible that ill health has caused her skin to become &quot;patchy.&quot;&#0160; But &quot;patch&quot; also signals a degree of mental stress, as in Shakespeare&#39;s &quot;patched fool.&quot; In this signification, patch derives from Italian <em>pazzo</em>, crazy. The crosspatch is therefore disabled physically, socially and psychologically.</p>
<p>At the outset of the poem, our &quot;crosspatch&quot; sits glowering, impoverished, perhaps muttering indistinctly, friendless, without family, her youth blighted by poverty, huddled against the last embers of her dying fire. What is it that she is spinning? No doubt she ekes out a meager living in the impersonal mercantilist &quot;putting-out&quot; system. Some exploitative proto-capitalist venturer has delivered to her lonely door a quantity of unspun wool or cotton;&#0160; her job is to return the material to him in the processed form that will then be passed on to an equally poor weaver, then to a tailor, etc. She works alone and never sees the fruits of her labor except for the occasional, paltry farthing that allows her a bare subsistence. No wonder she is slightly barmy and has &quot;drawn the latch&quot; -- closed herself off from her fellows. But then, suddenly, comes the antistrophe, and in a series of importunate injunctives the crosspatch is asked to rejoin the company of humanity. &quot;Take a cup,/ And drink it up,/ Then call the neighbors in.&quot;&#0160; What&#39;s in the cup?&#0160; Spiritous liquors, no doubt, which, though designed to dull the pain of wage-slavery, also act to augment the revelry with which the poem climaxes. The wine is not sipped, but it is drained to the lees. And once the door is unlatched, and the neighbors -- neighbors of both sexes, no doubt -- are called &quot;in,&quot; why then, let the libations and the wild rumpus begin! Alienated labor is suddenly set aside and replaced by the natural bonds of one human being to another, and the stasis of the opening lines of the poem transforms in a flash into a wildly kinetic bacchanal. Emotional weakness transmutes into healthy liberated pleasure. Dour Puritanism, with its punishing work ethic, yields to the spirit of holiday and to pagan, perhaps even dionysian, excess. Here, in miniature, is the essence of the comic vision. In a few powerful lines, freedom, good humor, and natural appetite triumph over bondage, artificiality, social constriction and repression; the justifiably sullen crosspatch, in a burst of energy, reintegrates herself into the social nexus from which she has been banished.</p>
<p>Whether or not the crosspatch can permanently liberate herself from the oppressions of industrial capitalism, or whether the anodyne and spurious relief of alcohol is a merely transient solution is left unresolved. To ask a short poem, however dense with meaning, to answer so difficult a question would, just possibly, be to ask too much of it and, perhaps, to push the evidence the merest tad too far.</p>
