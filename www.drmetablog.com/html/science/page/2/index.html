		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>On the main street of Estes Park (Gateway to Rocky Mountain National Park), a sign outside the restaurant advertised &quot;deepfried oreos.&quot; I was both flabbergasted and thunderstruck, not believing my eyes. But here&#39;s the evidence:</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef01bb09921a68970d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Oreos" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef01bb09921a68970d img-responsive" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef01bb09921a68970d-800wi" title="Oreos" /></a><br />Just above ice cream and below &quot;funnel cakes&quot; (but that&#39;s another story). Is it a hoax, or can there be such a thing? Absolutely,&#0160;there&#39;s many a google-entry on &quot;deepfried oreos.&quot; Several different recipes, one more hideous than the next. A piece of <em>cuisine americaine&#0160;</em>that had somehow escaped me all these many years.&#0160;</p>
<p>One of my waggish friends writes: &quot;I should confess that the last time my wife and I were in Paris, we sampled the deep fried Oreos at a little caf√© on the rue de Rivoli. The sommelier suggested a hearty Cabernet to take the edge off the sweetness of the dish and the wine worked beautifully with the cookie filling, an amalgam of flavors that made our senses tingle.&quot; I of course was skeptical of his story. No knowledgeable sommelier would recommend a red wine because it was well known that deepfried oreos were best served with champagne or gatorade.</p>
<p>Is it possible that deepfried oreos could become part of the cuisine of old Europe? Will it be the case that in every Italian village, just between the <em>macelleria&#0160;</em>and the quaint&#0160;<em>pasticceria&#0160;</em>there will be an <em>oreofritteria?&#0160;</em>A mom-and-pop <em>oreofritteria </em>using recipes that have been in the family for centuries&#0160;-- but in danger of being taken over by the big American chain, a subsidiary of -- who knows what -- called Signor Oreofritto. A terrifying prospect all around. &#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>If you asked me to guess what the word &quot;chalaza&quot; means, I&#39;d say, from its sound, that it would have to be an odd cactus-y looking plant that grows only in the Atacama desert and flowers once a decade, or an extinct language formerly spoken in the southern Caucasus mountains, or perhaps some sort of Levantine breadstick. It&#39;s a strange exotic word. But if then I told you that you&#39;ve seen thousands, perhaps many thousands of chalazas (or chalazae) with your own eyes, and eaten as many, you&#39;d be perplexed, even startled. Because you have eaten them.</p>
<p>Anyone who&#39;s cracked an egg has noticed two ropey white bands that extend from the yolk and are rooted in the transparent albumen. &#0160;</p>
<p>Here&#39;s some more information about chalazae which I quote from Tim Birkhead&#39;s <em>The Most Perfect Thing</em> (2016), a detailed and most enthusiastic book all about eggs.&#0160;&#0160;&quot;<span style="color: #0000ff;">The role of the chalazae is to suspend the yolk within the albumen.... One end of each chalaza is attached to the ovum itself... and the other is firmly lodged in the layer of dense viscous albumen, which itself is attached to the shell membranes at the pointed and blunt ends of the egg. The chalazae allow the yolk to rotate when the egg is turned so that the embryo always remains on top of the yolk and within the inner liquid&#0160;albumen layers. This self-righting ability is [necessary] because the embryo develops on the least dense side of the yolk. Keeping the embryo uppermost ensures that it is always closest to the parent&#39;s brood patch for maximum warmth, but also closest to the inner surface of the shell for maximum access to oxygen.&quot;</span></p>
<p>No chalazae, no chicks.</p>
<p>I&#39;m astonished that although I have scrambled thousands of eggs, and certainly noticed the &quot;ropey strands,&quot; I never gave them the slightest thought. How incurious of me!&#0160;</p>
<p>Birkhead&#39;s book is a revelation. He is the egg man of our times. Occasionally he gets so carried away with his joy in the egg that he veers into unconscious comedy. I adore the phrase, &quot;a renaissance in the study of eggshell pigmentation.&quot; &#0160;Or, &quot;guillemots are not&#0160;quite unique in incubating shit-covered eggs.&quot; &#0160;Or, &quot;tinamous lay the most extraordinary and beautiful eggs.&quot; &#0160;Or, &quot;there is something sensual about eggs.&quot;</p>
<p>About the word chalaza: it&#39;s from the Greek meaning &quot;small knot.&quot; Nor is it new: it entered the language (in Latinized form) in 1704.</p>
<p>Some practical information: the more prominent the chalazae, the fresher the egg.</p>

It&#39;s a paraceratherium. Because it was extinct before humans came on the scene and perhaps because it&#39;s not cute or disneyesque, it doesn&#39;t have a common name but I think &quot;really big rhinoceros&quot; fills the bill. You can see from the illustration that it was enormous, much larger than any of our surviving megafauna. It dwarfs the elephant. Sixteen feet tall at the shoulder, according to Donald Prothero, the author of <em>The</em> <em>Princeton Guide to Prehistoric Mammals</em>&#0160;(2017), a page-turner if there ever was one for fans of brontotheres and titanotheres. If you&#39;re reading this post in a room with an eight foot ceiling, double that and you&#39;ll get the idea of the height of a paraceratherium. Six feet taller than the rim of a basket. &#0160;Not to mention the head (skull size 6.5 feet long.) Really big rhinoceros browsed the tops of trees, so that gigantic head must have been held way high in the air. The beast probably weighed somewhere in the range of fifteen to twenty tons.&#0160;Unquestionably imposing.</div>
<div class="thumbcaption">&#0160;</div>
<div class="thumbcaption">Moreover, really big rhinoceros had a long run. It was around for about a million years until it disappeared some twenty million years ago. Changing environment, very likely. Such a huge animal&#0160;and his family and friends would need a tremendous amount of forest for browse. It&#39;s hard to imagine that they had any natural enemies. Who&#39;s going to jump on a paraceratherium? &#0160;On the other hand, they must have made scavengers very happy when they met their very imaginative Maker (who really outdid Himself this time).</div>
<div class="thumbcaption">&#0160;</div>
</div>
<div class="thumbinner">I wish really big rhinoceros was&#0160;still around. I would have liked to have seen a herd at browse.&#0160;Or just listened to the thump-thump-thump of their feet as they wandered about.</div>
<div class="thumbinner">&#0160;</div>
<div class="thumbinner">We could put a few, perhaps a couple of paraceratherium cows and their babies and maybe one large bull, right out there in the back field. But how would we fence them? &#0160;Or feed them, after they&#39;d stripped the birches and the oaks? &#0160;How many truckloads of hay does an adult paraceratherium eat&#0160;in a day?&#0160;&#0160;What size barn would we need to house them during the long winter months?&#0160;</div>
<div class="thumbinner">&#0160;</div>
<div class="thumbinner">On the whole, I am forced to admit that although picturesque, paraceratherium would be&#0160;a&#0160;very&#0160;expensive, inconvenient pet.</div>
<div class="thumbinner">&#0160;</div>
<div class="thumbinner">And then there&#39;s the scat. Contemporary rhinocerotes are famous for making &quot;communal dung piles.&quot; &#0160;Did their ancestors also do so? &#0160;I can imagine some truly formidable foothill-size formations.</div>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I&#39;m most fond of the gasplant, also called fraxinella or dittany or, when formality is called for,&#0160;<em>dictamnus albus.&#0160;</em>It&#39;s a beautiful plant. In flower it&#39;s an ornament to the perennial garden, and even when it&#39;s done blooming, it&#39;s neat and orderly and retains a lovely shade of green throughout the summer. Smells good too. It&#39;s a long-lived perennial, very hardy. It takes a number of years to establish itself, but then lives almost indefinitely. If you have one, you treasure it. I have two, both of which I took from the garden of my late sister Phyllis when she died in 1998. Or should I say I had two, because over the winter one of them went missing. &#0160;</p>
<p>In the location where there should have been and always has been a fully-mature gasplant, there was nothing -- not a leaf, not a twig, not a root. If the plant had died, it would have left some evidence behind. It&#39;s a woody plant which dies back to the ground each year, so every spring there is a bundle of dry hollow stalks or kexes. But this year nothing. Not a shred.</p>
<p>What happened to Mr. Dittany. Here&#39;s a possibility. I transplanted him, put him somewhere else, and then forgot that I had done so. An unlikely possibility. I searched my brain but can&#39;t&#39; recall moving it. I searched the grounds -- no luck. If it wasn&#39;t me, was it someone else? &#0160;Did some malefactor steal the gasplant? &#0160;I have never heard of a gang of perennial thieves. Is it possible to believe that a nefarious individual entered the garden while I was away and heisted an out-of-season gasplant, roots and all? &#0160;Not an hypothesis I can much credit. Did the plant have enemies? If it&#39;s being held for ransom, I have yet to receive the note. &quot;We have your fraxinella. Either fork over $14.99 or we&#39;ll mow it.&quot;</p>
<p>Another possibility: there never was a dittany. It was&#0160;always&#0160;a hallucination of my decaying brain. Nope, no go. It&#39;s been in the same place for years. Many people have seen it. I show it off -- it&#39;s so dramatic, so striking.&#0160;</p>
<p>Or perhaps, it&#39;s a plot against me. Am I being gaslighted? &#0160;With a gasplant? &#0160;</p>

                                <p>Our sun is halfway through its life cycle. Its luminosity increases 1% every 110 million years. Therefore the Earth ineluctably grows hotter and hotter. In a billion years, life on its surface will be impossible. Global surface temperatures will reach 117F and the oceans will evaporate. Water molecules in the atmosphere will be broken apart by solar radiation and hydrogen molecules will escape the planet. Eventually the sun will exhaust the hydrogen fuel in its core. When it begins to exploit other material, its luminosity will increase a thousandfold until it stabilizes with a radius about 250 times its present size. It will consume Mercury and Venus but probably not the Earth which will become locked into an orbit with only one side facing the sun (as the moon does to the earth). This will mean impossibly hot temperatures on one side, impossibly cold on the other. The moon&#39;s orbit will reduce to 11,000 miles causing it to fracture, raining pieces of itself onto the Earth. Eventually the sun will lose mass and gravitational pull and the earth will drift away into a remote orbit -- dark, cold, and lifeless. &#0160;</p>

                                <p>It&#39;s a little late in the day for me to embark on a career in pteridology. Too many ferns, too little time. There may be a backup option: intimate, private pteridophilia or even pteridomania.&#0160;</p>
<p>But in fact, empty enthusiasm is no substitute for knowledge. It&#39;s mortifying that after all these years of treading upon, admiring and sometimes even transplanting them, I know almost nothing about the <em>Ophioglassales</em> or the <em>Marattiale</em>s, the<em> Equisetums</em> (although I can identify&#0160;both the scouring rush and the horsetail), the <em>Hymenophyllales</em>, the <em>lygodium</em> (which climbs with a twining midrib), nor the aquatic <em>Salviniales. </em>And then there are the&#0160;twelve thousand&#0160;separate and individual species of <em>Polypodiale</em>s. Although I could not help being aware of polypody ferns -- they&#39;re all over the place, sparkling in the understory and thriving in forest clearings -- I could not name the name of a single one save the extremely distinctive and graceful maidenhair and the undistinguished plain (and poisonous) and absolutely ineradicable bracken.&#0160;</p>
<p>Nor, until I read Robbin Moran&#39;s enchanting <em>A Natural History of Ferns&#0160;</em>(Portland, OR, 2004) did I have a clear idea of how ferns reproduce.&#0160;Of course I was familiar with the&#0160;folklore upon which Shakespeare drew -- that the seed of the fern is invisible and confers invisibility.&#0160;There&#39;s a micro-debate on the truth of this imaginative idea&#0160;in an early scene&#0160;of <em>The First Part of Henry the Fourth</em>:</p>
<p><em>Gadshill</em>:&#0160; We steal as in a castle, cocksure; we have the receipt [i.e. recipe] of fern-seed, we walk invisible. &#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>To which the skeptical chamberlain replies, &quot;Nay, by my faith, I think you are more beholding to the night than to fern-seed for your walking invisible.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Our sometimes clever but often obtuse ancestors, knowing that all plant must have seeds, and that ferns didn&#39;t, jumped to the conclusion that fern seeds must be invisible. Well, there&#39;s a theory. It took a surprisingly long time for the truth to out. In fact ferns bear very small, sometimes even microscopic spores, visible, at best, as a fine dust. It was not until 1794 that John Lindsay noticed that the spores produced a tiny green growth, nor until 1848 that Michael Jerome Leszczyc-Suminski deployed his microscope to determine that these so-called prothalli produced male and female sexual parts, and that from the union of egg and motile sperm an embryonic plant with roots, leaves, and stems was produced.</p>
<p>It seems like an unnecessarily complicated way to reproduce, but let&#39;s not judge it harshly because it&#39;s worked very successfully for 345 million years, more or less.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Of all the many ferns of past and present, the one that I would most like to see with my own eyes fell by the evolutionary wayside 225 million years ago and is unlikely to be resurrected in some vegetable Jurassic Park. They&#39;re the giant lepidodendrons of the late Carboniferous, tree-size ferns that in the form of coal are very likely providing right now the power for your and my computer.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>One oddity of some lepidodendra &#0160;was that after fertilization they took an unusual (perhaps even unique) path. The plant&#39;s root aborted while the burgeoning shoot produced both the usual stem and also a downward-growing rooting organ -- not a true root though it anchored the plant, but a root-like system called a rhizomorph. Because the plant was a monocarp --that is, a plant that grows for many years until mature, then flowers, fruits and dies -- both the upside and the downside of the plant were, so to speak, term-limited. And because the stem went both up and down, above ground and below ground, it was remarkably symmetrical along the axis of the soil.&#0160;</p>
<p>I wonder how a forest of lepidodendra would have appeared to a modern eye. Very exotic, I imagine. Lepidoptera differed from modern trees in many ways, but particularly in that their trunks were green with chlorophyll rather than bark-brown. I think that a grove of them would have been littered with many uprooted or rather uprhizomorphed plants. Quite a jungle, I should imagine, and quite a delicious menu for the lumbering beasts who feasted upon it.&#0160;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I enjoy&#0160;good relations with animal -- respectful,&#0160;sometimes even affectionate.&#0160;I remember with great fondness the many purring, playful&#0160;cats and kittens of my youth. I was once very taken with&#0160;a calf named September and, I confess, almost in love with the matriarch of a small herd of Morgans, a&#0160;lovely lady named Gillian.&#0160;The twin Nigerian dwarf goats, Orville and Wilbur, were, I think, special friends. But for some reason I&#39;ve never taken to dogs, even though I know the story&#0160;about dog/human&#0160;co-evolution. Doggy dogs are moderately acceptable, but the&#0160;various special&#0160;breeds of dogs, dog-show dogs,&#0160;seem to me to be freaks and monstrosities. We should have left them as wolves and not meddled.</p>
<p>Of all the various teratological breeds my least favorites are the ones who have been hybridized into snoutlessness.&#0160;Dogs deserve and need a snout.</p>
<p>I was once attacked by a snoutless ugly bulldog; its owner, who, incidentally, had quite a snout himself, instead of apologizing profusely, made the utterly unjustified claim that I had provoked the attack. The incident reinforced my prejudice against bulldogs. It&#39;s not just that bulldogs are aggressive; let&#39;s make no bones about it, it&#39;s that for some inexplicable perverse reason they&#39;ve been bred to be hideous. A travesty of a dog.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I was startled to read the following paragraph in Richard C. Francis&#39; new book on domestication of animals (<em>Domesticated</em>, <em>Evolution in a Man-Made World</em>, 2015):</p>
<p>The squashed face carries a heavy cost in and of itself. It starts with breathing problems. The shortened snout causes the soft palate to bunch up in front of the trachea in a way that impedes airflow. Since panting is the primary way for dogs to cool, bulldogs are also vulnerable to death by overheating. The mouth of a bulldog is also too small to accommodate its teeth, so they are crowded and grow at odd angles, trapping food debris. Gum disease is rampant. A bulldog&#39;s eyes don&#39;t seat properly In the skull and can pop out, even from straining at a leash. Often the eyelids cannot close completely, resulting in irritations and infection. The excessive skin folds often become infected. Perhaps most telling, the bulldog&#39;s head has become too large to pass through the birth canal; most births require Caesarean section.</p>
<p>Big mistake, the bulldog.&#0160;We humans should have learned to leave well enough alone.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Egregious Rush Limbaugh, who ranks number three&#0160;on my list of the people who, in the course of my&#0160;lifetime, have done the most damage to the United States of America (Dick Cheney and Antonin Scalia are one and two and Dick Nixon&#0160;only slithers in at number 6) speaks&#0160;a language that is extraordinarily difficult to parse.&#0160;His sentences are shapeless, wayward, and undiagrammable, equally indifferent to the conventions of language and the rules of logic.&#0160;When you&#39;re fact-free&#0160;there&#39;s no compelling reason not to be&#0160;grammar-free as well.&#0160;</p>
<p>Now there&#39;s a new and appalling example of Limbaugh&#39;s resistance to reality. NASA recently announced that the planet Mars must once have had flowing water and might still have underground water. Limbaugh, if I read his tangled language aright, not only rejects the discovery but claims that water on Mars is evidence a &quot;left-wing agenda&quot;&#0160; at work. Wow, we are tempted to exclaim. Double wow. Paranoia run amok.&#0160;</p>
<p>How can Limbaugh present such a counter-factual notion with a straight face?&#0160; In order to coherently present his &quot;thoughts&quot; on this subject, I will now extract and re-assemble some of his phrases from the linguistic rats&#39; nest in which they are embedded. Here&#39;s his chain of &quot;thought&quot; reduced to its essence. First of all, global warming is a myth. Secondly, NASA has been &quot;corrupted by the current regime&quot; and has falsified climate data. Inasmuch as NASA is a mendacious organization, its discoveries about flowing water must therefore also be false. And because NASA is subject to a leftist regime, its claims must be not only false but &quot;a technique to advance the leftist agenda.&quot; A watery Mars is therefore a &quot;leftist&#39; Mars. And so the circle is almost complete. Limbaugh knows he&#39;s correct but hasn&#39;t quite figured out how it all works:&#0160; &quot;I don&#39;t know what it is, I would assume it would be something to do with global warming.&quot;&#0160; So round and round we go.&#0160;</p>
<p>While Limbaugh&#39;s logic is roundabout, his perspective cramped and his evidence, how shall I say, perhaps a bit on the skimpy side -- all assertion and no fact -- &#0160;I feel that I must agree with his conclusion. Yes indeed, the discovery of ancient flowing water on Mars is definitely &quot;leftist&quot;-- and is leftist in at least two different ways.</p>
<p>Let us try to connect the subterranean dots inside the Limbaughian skull. What is it that is so paranoia-inducing and threatening about Martian water? Well, water on Mars might indicate life on Mars. If there is life on Mars, then there might be life elsewhere in the universe. If life elsewhere in the universe, then the creation story in Genesis is certainly incomplete and probably false. No creation myth, no biblical absolutism. Moreover, if there is life elsewhere, there are probably intelligent beings who are highly likely not to worship our earthly gods and are probably not -- horror of horrors --&#0160; subscribe to Baptist fundamentalism. Water on Mars therefore challenges his local and provincial Truth. Limbaugh is therefore correct to see Martian water as &#39;leftist&quot; in its implications.</p>
<p>Watery Mars is yet another blow to conservative &quot;thought.&quot; It&#39;s just like evolution or the big bang -- in actuality like any truth that comes to be discovered either by hard science or social science or by the unbiased study of history. Truth and fact are anathema to radical conservative Limbaughians. Of course they are repelled and confused by scientific discoveries.&#0160; Martian water is still another manifestation of the continual drip drip drip of facts that challenge their provincial world view and animate their paranoia.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Bats originated approximately 50 million years ago. Although warm-blooded, many have &quot;thermostats&quot; that allow body temperature to vary with ambient temperature; they are therefore &quot;heterothermic.&quot; There are 1300 living bat species -- about 20% of all mammal species. The Long-tongued Fruit bat has a wingspan of 1.5 centimeters; the Spectral Bat a wingspan of a meter. Many bats sport &quot;noseleaves&quot;&#0160; --fleshy projections around the snout and nostrils -- which aid in the transmission of sound. DNA studies have determined that the closest living relatives of bats are not rodents but hoofed mammals and whales. There are twenty bat families, nineteen of which employ laryngeal echolocation -- the twentieth relies on tongue clicks -- as well as ten extinct families. Bats have five unique muscles: the occipitopollicaris connects the back of the head to the hand and runs along the anterior edge of the wing. The coracocutaneous anchors networks of elastic fibers to the armpit. The humeropatagialis tightens and braces the distal parts of the wing membrane. The tensor plagiopatii anchor the trailing edges of the wing. The depressor ossis syloformis controls the interfemoral membrane between the hind legs. Hoary Bats can fly at 27 kilometers per hour. Migrating Silver Haired Bats fly at over fifty kilometers per hour. The heart rate of an alert Little Brown Bat hanging in a roost at room temperature is about 200 beats per minute but while flying the heart rate increases to about 1000 beats per minute. The heart of a hibernating bat beats five times a minute. Flying bats consume energy at about twelve times the rate of resting bats. Bats can feel changes in air pressure with the skin of their wings. Some bats&#39; feet lock into place when hanging upside down, so no energy is consumed except when the bat releases and drops. Common vampire bats engorged with blood have difficulty regaining flight. They urinate copiously, then use their long thumbs to provide extra lift leverage. Bats use echolocation (as do toothed whales, dolphins, shrews and tenrecs). When Lazzaro Spallanzani claimed&#0160; (in 1794) that bats could see with their ears, he was widely mocked. &quot;Does Signor Spallanzani also claim that bats can hear with their eyes?&quot;&#0160; Ultrasonic noises were not detected by scientists until 1938. Echolocation calls cover a range of frequencies. A Little Brown Bat searching for prey usually produces echolocations at the rate of twenty calls per second. but a Hoary Bat will produce only five calls per second. Calls increase in frequency during the actual attack. Bats can vary the length of the call from less than one millisecond to over 50 milliseconds. Bats are very loud to those who can hear them. A hunting bat can produce a sound that is twenty times more intense than the alarm of a smoke detector. Bats, unique among mammals, can turn off their hearing. At about two milliseconds before a vocalization is produced in the larynx, muscles in the middle ear contract, disarticulating three bones in the middle ear; then the ear is &quot;reconnected&quot; allowing it to hear the echo of the sound it has just emitted. Bats can be insectivorous, carnivorous, frugivorous, nectarivorous, piscivorous and sanguinovorous. Some bats eat birds, some eat other bats. Eastern Red Bats eat both tent caterpillars and gypsy moths. They must eat about 150 moths per night simply to retain their weight (thank you, Eastern Red Bats). The upper incisors of vampire bats are greatly enlarged, but since they don&#39;t chew their food, the cheek teeth are reduced to mere spicules. More than 500 species of flowering plants are pollinated by bats. Bats may eat up to 120% of their body weight each day. The common vampire bat can consume about two tablespoons of blood during a single night. Tiger Moths produce clicks that &quot;jam&quot; the echolocation patterns of bats. Because bats must minimize their weight, their digestive systems are extremely efficient --&#0160; Little Brown Bats move food through their system in twenty minutes. One million bats roost under the Congress Avenue Bridge in Austin, Texas. Bats are capable of eating 500 mosquitoes an hour. Some bats hibernate but bats can also enter into a state of torpor to consume less energy while roosting. Frio and Bracken caves in Texas each house over ten million Brazilian Free-tailed Bats during the summer. Bamboo bats roost in the hollow spaces in bamboo stems. In Borneo, Hardwicke&#39;s Wooly Bat roosts in the leaves of Raffle&#39;s Pitcher Plant and donates its feces to the plants nitrogen intake. Some Leaf-nosed bats bite the stems of banana and palm leaves in order to create tents for roosting. White-throated Round-Eared bats roost in excavated cavities of termite mounds. Hibernating Little Brown Bats bats breathe once an hour. Most bats bear one offspring rather than twins or multiples. Bats live surprisingly long lives. A banded Brandt&#39;s Myotis was at least forty-four years old. Vesper Bats mate in the fall but the female stores the sperm and does not ovulate until early spring. White nose disease is caused by a European strain of a common soil fungus. Bat droppings can contain spores that cause histoplasmosis in humans.

                                <p>I would have thought that&#0160;I&#39;d have had in the hopper all the senses, proper and improper, of &quot;&#39;stopper.&quot;&#0160; But I&#39;ve come a-cropper.</p>
<p>The most familiar stopper is, of course, the blocker of liquids, as for example the cork that fits into the top of the wine bottle -- or the polished glass stopper that used to slide into those old-fashioned ink bottles. And then there&#39;s the stopper in baseball -- the ace pitcher, the &quot;number one&quot; on the staff, who brings a&#0160; losing streak to a close. And also the show-stopper -- the performer who freezes the show in its tracks, so excellently that he or she earns several rounds of applause and encores. (Latterly, a supremely attractive woman has come to be called a &quot;show-stopper&quot;; when she enters a room all activities, even molecular motion itself, immediately cease).</p>
<p>But down here in South Florida, where I am enjoying a few days of indolent hedonism, there&#39;s a stopper of which even the OED is ignorant. It&#39;s a plant -- a bush or small tree. The best known stopper is the simpson, <em>myricanthes fragran</em>s, demotically known to all as the nakedwood twinberry. It&#39;s a member of the eucalyptus family and smells nutmeggy. The fruit is edible, as might be expected of a distant cousin of the guava. Simpson stoppers are a food of choice for Florida&#39;s state bird (not the pelican, as one might expect, but the mockingbird). And there are other stoppers beside the aristocratic simpson: the redberry stopper <em>Eugenia foetida</em>, whose leaves and flowers are foul-smelling;&#0160; the white stopper; and the inedible Spanish stopper.</p>
<p>I have no clue about the etymology of &quot;stopper&quot; in this sense.&#0160; Neither does anyone else.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Why Indeed?&#0160; And also, while we&#39;re considering the question, why don&#39;t chimpanzees get atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, endometriosis, myocardial infarction, falciparum malaria, HIV infection, or epithelial cancers?&#0160; Chimpanzees are, after all, our closest living relatives.&#0160;We share a common ancestry and we only embarked on&#0160;separate&#0160;path some six or seven million years ago --a blink of an eye in evolutionary terms.&#0160;Why is it that we human beings, so superior, as we like to think, in so many ways from our cousins -- in our big&#0160;brains and delicate hand manipulations, for example&#0160;-- are subject to an array of diseases&#0160;to which our inferior relations&#0160;are&#0160;immune.&#0160;What&#39;s the deal?&#0160;</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the current thinking on this important problem (which I draw from Eugene E. Harris&#39;s informative and up-to-date monograph <em>Ancestors in our Genome</em> [Oxford, 1914]). As I understand it, human beings went through a sort of bottleneck sometime in our recent (say 200,000 years ago) history and our&#0160;effective breeding population was reduced to a mere 10,000 or so souls.&#0160;When a population becomes so small, random genetic drift dominates over natural selection, and so moderately deleterious but not incapacitating mutations can survive and even thrive.&#0160;The defective&#0160;genes that would be&#0160;weeded out in larger populations persist in our genome.&#0160;Hence our many inherited susceptibilities and disorders.</p>
<p>But that&#39;s not the end of the story.&#0160; Yesterday there was a report that the Ashkenazim went through &quot;a severe bottleneck&quot; six or eight hundred years ago which reduced its&#0160;population to about 350 individuals. O my, what a boon to genetic drift, what a recipe for genetic disaster or genetic success, or more exactly, both success and failure simultaneously.&#0160;</p>
<p>And so our talents, our deficits, our strengths and weakness, our brains and our bodies, are determined&#0160;by arbitrary aleatory long-ago events.&#0160;No surprise, really, but another event in the continuously unfolding revelation.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I am inordinately fond of&#0160;mass extinctions.&#0160;I find them consoling.</p>
<p>The most recent mass extinction, the newly-famous Yucatan-comet-iridium K-T boundary event of&#0160;66 million years ago is one of my personal&#0160;favorites. To recall:&#0160;a comet six or seven miles in diameter, zooming along at 65,00 miles per hour and therefore generating a good bit of momentum, smacked into&#0160;what is now the Yucatan peninsula&#0160;with&#0160;the force of a heck of a large number&#0160;of&#0160;hydrogen bombs.&#0160;The impact produced&#0160;a crater that was initially&#0160;an astonishing 65 miles across and 18 miles deep, triggered massive earthquakes as well as tsunamis half a mile high, and briefly heated the earth&#39;s atmosphere to hundreds of degrees.&#0160;Within minutes, everything as far as&#0160;Illinois&#0160;became wasteland. Because of the blanket of smoke and dust, sunlight could not reach the earth, so temperatures plummeted, completely disrupting the world-wide chlorophyll-based food chain.&#0160;At the same time, downpours of acid rain corrosive&#0160;enough to dissolve rocks killed everything they&#0160;touched. A full 80% of the world&#39;s&#0160;animal&#0160;species disappeared -- along with half of all land plants.&#0160;</p>
<p>Although it must have been quite a show, it was not as thorough a disaster as the&#0160;Permian extinction (252 million years ago) which killed 95% of all living species, but it is, rather, comparable in scope&#0160;to the Ordovician extinction (444 million years ago), the Devonian&#0160;(375 million years ago) and the Triassic (201 million years ago).&#0160;It&#39;s no wonder that folks&#0160;in the know estimate that 99.9% of all the species that have ever existed have disappeared.</p>
<p>The knowledge that there will inevitably be another extinction helps to put our daily woes in perspective.&#0160;How can I worry about whether the grout should be &quot;Desert Sand&quot; or &quot;Forest Gray&quot; or whether my newest&#0160;skin thingy is benign or dangerous&#0160;when our species and the&#0160;cool green earth itself are doomed.&#0160;Judgment day is a-coming, whether in the form of another wayfaring comet, or a series of explosive volanoes, or the release of the nitrogen and carbon now sequestered in the permafrost, or some event entirely unpredictable. Something is going to happen, as sure as shooting.&#0160;Perhaps, some think, it&#39;s already happening.&#0160;</p>
<p>So that&#39;s one benefit of a mass extinction -- it helps you sleep well at night.&#0160;Why worry about trivialities?</p>
<p>And also:&#0160;if it weren&#39;t for the extinctions, we wouldn&#39;t be here at all.&#0160;If the dinosaurs hadn&#39;t been killed by the comet they would most likely&#0160;have continued to dominate the planet, and the&#0160;descendants of velociraptors and mosasaurs and thunder-lizards sure as heck weren&#39;t going to leave a lot of breathing room for&#0160;the proto-primates.</p>
<p>Extinctions are one of the many improbable accidents that got us here. Extinctions are jolly.&#0160;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I read <em>Planet of the Bugs</em> (Chicago, 2014) by Scott Richard Shaw, a Wyoming entomologist. It&#39;s a good book on a great topic -- the evolution of insects. In the acknowledgements, Shaw thanks his editor for helping him to &quot;shape a bulky manuscript into a sleeker book,&quot; but I think I would have much preferred the fatter unpublished version, which I imagine would have been heavier on curious, fascinating and sometimes lurid detail. I think that Shaw&#39;s editor may have misunderestimated his potential enthusiastic readership.</p>
<p>Shaw loves his insects and writes the evolution of life bug-centrically. Instead of the conventional telling, where everything leads ineluctably to majestic us, <em>homines sapientes</em>, Shaw inscribes the triumph of the six-legged kind. For example, Shaw disparages our (I mean mankind&#39;s) walking and running. &quot;Two-legged bipedal locomotion is so unstable and difficult to master that it seems highly improbable and almost pointless.&quot; He has a point there. A child takes a year to learn to walk, and even after he does so, he staggers like a drunken sailor for several months. No other creature on earth is so ungainly at the outset.</p>
<p>Moreover, Shaw adds, six-leggedness optimizes balance and stability and has the potential for rapid motion. &quot;Six legged form is sublime. Fifty million insect species can&#39;t possibly be wrong.&quot;</p>
<p>If I understand it correctly, most insect species propel themselves by alternately moving one of their two leg tripods -- and tripods are inherently stable.&#0160; It&#39;s a great system.&#0160;</p>
<p>Now that I&#39;ve achieved the &quot;golden years,&quot; I spend much too much time worrying about that I&#39;m about to crash to the ground and break a wrist or a hip -- all too common afflictions among the two-legged kind.&#0160; No one has ever seen a beetle trip, or an ant sprawl embarrassingly on the sidewalk.&#0160;</p>
<p>Too bad we don&#39;t have six legs. Or even four (the other two having evolved into arms). We&#39;d be better off. We&#39;d need two pairs of hips, of course, and copulation would be more complicated, but it would be worth it. Speed, stability, grace. Four legs would definitely be sublime.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I&#39;m glad that we evolved an internal skeleton, which the insects never did. I wouldn&#39;t want to bother with an exoskeleton or carapace. It would be ungainly, troublesome. And probably accompanied by all sorts of emotional displays. &quot;Don&#39;t pay any attention to him. He&#39;s moulting.&quot;&#0160;</p>

                                <p>&#39;The placement of the human male genitalia is ridiculous and ill-conceived. What in the living heck are such sensitive and vulnerable organs doing right out there -- in front, dramatically positioned to be bumped by furniture or careless hands, struck by flying objects, or pummeled by grandchildren. In any intelligently-designed universe, the penis would be entirely retractable, making its appearance only when summoned. (Nor would it be a dual-purpose organ. Every engineer knows that dedicated instruments always perform better than devices that combine functions.</p>
<p>Moreover, the testicles would be buried deep inside the body cavity, as, for example, the spleen or the ovaries -- not hanging loose, ungirded and swattable.</p>
<p>Freud once remarked that the male organs of generation have not evolved in the direction of beauty. And therefore not even the crassest male flaunts his stuff to attract a mate. Or never did, not until the coming of the internet. If the parts weren&#39;t intended to beautiful, then they might as well have been concealed and protected. But not so.</p>
<p>Why are they where they are?&#0160; The culprit, obviously, is evolution -- specifically, the shift to upright posture. Four feet on the ground and the apparatus is tucked away behind the hind legs, way back there in the anterior. Protected, inconspicuous, and discreet. Stand up, and there they are just where they shouldn&#39;t be. A three-year-old child with a box of crayons could produce a better design than frontward-facing genitalia.&#0160;</p>
<p>Instead, we&#39;re left with either another example of divine under-achievement, or further and supererogatory confirmation that the universe is disorderly, aleatory, and improvisational.</p>
<p>It was when women joined in standing upright that breasts came into prominence. There is no other&#0160; mammalian species in which the organs of lactation are so clearly displayed. But female breasts had the good sense to evolve into an essential part of sexual display.&#0160; &quot;Hey, mister, look at these. Look how well I can nurse your babies.&quot;</p>
<p>Now there, at last, is an evolutionary outcome that makes sense.One that a guy can bring himself to endorse and admire.</p>

                                <p>How are we new-millenium readers supposed to grasp the social significance of nineteenth-century horsedrawn vehicles when even characters&#0160;in nineteenth-century novels can be easily baffled?&#0160; True enough that Miss Alice Vavasor&#0160;and Lady Glencora are both&#0160;very young ladies, and true also that they&#39;ve lived marvelously protected lives, but still -- such appalling ignorance:</p>
<p>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&quot; [Alice Vavasor] saw a light stylish-looking cart which she would have called a Whitechapel had she been properly instructed in such matters, and a little low open carriage with two beautiful small horses....&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&quot;Dear Alice, I&#39;m so glad you&#39;ve come....&#0160; Your maid can go in the dog-cart with your things!&quot; -- it wasn&#39;t a dog-cart, but Lady Glencora knew no better.&quot;</p>
<p>A dog-cart was not pulled by dogs. It was an informal vehicle with a recessed box or cage in which dogs were transported. Trollope lords it over his Lady Glencora for her ignorance of such plebian matters. And a Whitechapel? There&#39;s no footnote in my edition of<em> Can You Forgive Her</em> and neither google nor wikipedia hazards a guess (though Wik is well aware of a &quot;deathcore&quot; band of the same name), so I&#39;ll just go with &quot;light stylish cart.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>And now add &quot;Whitechapel&quot; to the list: barouche, basket carriage, berlin, <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2006/01/new_words.html">britchka</a>, brougham, buckboard, buggy, cabriolet, caleche, cariole, carryall, chaise, chariot, clarence, concord wagon, coupe, croydon, curricle, cutter, daumont, dearborn, dennet, diligence, dog-cart, fiacre, fly, fourgon, four-wheeler, gig, go-cart, governess cart, hansom, herdic, jaunty car, jersey-wagon, kibitka, landau, <a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2010/04/horsedrawn-vehicle.html.html " target="_self">patache</a>, phaeton, pill-box, post-chaise, rockaway, shandrydan, shay, sociable, spider-phaeton, spring-van, stanhope, sulky, surrey, T-cart, telyezhka, tilbury, <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2008/01/the-tarantass.html">tarantass</a>, trap, troika, victoria, vis-a-vis, wagonette,&#0160;and&#0160;wurt.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                By March of 1962, John Fowles had finished but not yet published <em>The Collector,</em> a work that I&#39;ve never loved, and was still fussing with <em>The Magus</em>, the novel that hit me so hard when it appeared in 1965. Fowles was also reading just as randomly as I do, as I have now discovered from reading his journals, which have been condensed into two giant volumes.&#0160; (A &quot;journal,&quot; young readers, was a literary form that preceded and anticipated the blog.)
<p>On the whole, Fowles, as befit his name, was a birder rather than a &quot;snaker,&quot; so I don&#39;t know how he stumbled upon Clifford Pope&#39;s <em>The Great Snakes</em>. I am not surprised that the one fact that Fowles gleaned from Pope&#39;s herpetological knowledge that &quot;snakes copulate for hours, sometimes a day at a time.&quot;&#0160; A very Fowlesian piece of information.</p>
<p>I am surprised that he also reported in his journal the same snake anecdote that Dr. Metablog noted right here on this very blog. Back in 2006, Dr. M.&#0160; made mention of the instructions provided to early African missionaries on the proper response to meeting one of those 25-foot-long,&#0160; 300-pound reticulated Burmese pythons. I found it in a book called <em>Man the Hunted</em>. Here&#39;s the story:</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff00ff;">Remember not to run away; the python can run faster. The thing to do is to lie flat on the ground on your back with your feet together, arms to the sides and head well down. The python will then try to push its head under you, experimenting at every possible point. Ke<em>ep calm</em>, one wiggle and he will get under you, wrap his coils round you and crush you to death. After a time the python will get tired of this and will probably decide to swallow you without the usual preliminaries. He will very likely begin with one of your feet<em>. Keep calm</em>. You must let him swallow your foot. It is quite painless and will take a long time. If you lose your head and struggle he will quickly whip his coils around you. If&#0160;<em>you keep calm</em>, he will go on swallowing. Wait patiently until he has swallowed about up to your knee. Then carefully take out your knife and insert it into the distended side of his mouth and with a quick rip slit him up.</span></p>
<p>In 2006, Dr M. wrote:&#0160; &quot;Well-meant advice, I&#39;m sure, but perhaps difficult to follow. Suppose you&#39;re just not in the mood to allow the python such liberties with your person. Suppose you&#39;ve forgotten to bring your knife; suppose the python decides to start with your head rather than a foot. Suppose you involuntarily wiggle just a teensy bit. Suppose you just don&#39;t feel that it&#39;s a good day to be engulfed.&quot;&#0160; Fowles&#39; comment is shorter but equally pertinent.&#0160; He writes:&#0160; &quot;And spend the rest of your life in an asylum.&quot;</p>
<p>When I realized that Fowles and I had a common interest in giant man-eating snakes, I decided that the least I could to honor his memory was re-read <em>The Magus</em>. Which I did, at first with enthusiasm and then with increasing dismay as the the novel&#39;s flaws began to overwhelm its beauties. <em>The Magus</em> is too contrived, too obvious. Nicholas Urfe, the naif, is so unsuspicious that he is fooled by Conchis, the magician, over and over again -- many more times than is remotely credible. The reader (the 2013 reader, that is, not the 1965 reader) catches to the repeated gimmickry. But then after Urfe realize that he&#39;s been sadistically manipulated, he stockholm-syndromes his tormentors far too rapidly and cursorily.&#0160; It should take as much time to heal as to be harmed. As a result the book is out of balance -- too long in the middle, too short in the resolution. And then on top of that there&#39;s the heavy-handed Jungstuff and the grade-school pop Freudianism!! O my gosh. I was embarrassed. And in addtion, there is the deeply, unliberated Victorian attitudes toward sexuality in a book that claims to be &quot;advanced.&quot;&#0160; Anyway, it just did not work this time through. What a disappoingment.</p>
<p>And I&#39;m disappointed in Fowles as well. I began to read his journals in the hope that he would be&#0160; complex and philosophical and aware, but, no, he was just like me -- simple, defensive, insecure.&#0160; </p>
<p>And what a snob: so much and so often worried about his bourgeois background and so ashamed of his&#0160; well-meaning parents.</p>
<p>Most unforgiveable is not that he ran off with his best friend&#39;s wife, but that he wouldn&#39;t let Elizabeth keep her daughter. He made her choose between him and her own child.&#0160; In my view, a man should never come between a parent, a mother, and her offspring. It&#39;s a violation of the natural order, if there is such a thing as the natural order.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I&#39;m clinging to my most positive memoriesof Fowles T<em>he French Lieutenant&#39;s Woman,</em> which I still believe to be a novel that will last.&#0160; But frankly, I&#39;m just a tad frightened to re-read it.&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; </p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Shakuntala Devi, who died in India a week or so ago, was an incredible arithmetician. She once &quot;accurately multiplied two random 13-digit numbers in a few seconds.&quot; &quot;On a visit to this country, an American psychologist set her two problems: the cube root of 61,629,875, and
 the seventh root of 170,859,375. Shakuntala Devi gave the correct 
answers - 395 and 15 - even before he started his stopwatch.&quot;</p>
<p>No one knows how she did this. No one has even advanced a persuasive theory.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>It&#39;s difficult for me to remember a thirteen-digit number. I don&#39;t think I could remember two thirteen-digit numbers. It&#39;s beyond my imagination to think about multiplying them (to produce the correct twenty-six digit answer). </p>
<p>I&#39;m wondering whether Devi&#39;s abilities seem so astonishing because she&#39;s out there all by herself. If there were a cohort of people who could easily multiply 8, 9, or 12 digit numbers it wouldn&#39;t seem so wonderful that she could do 13. But she&#39;s unique.</p>
<p>And intimidating.</p>
<p>But then I&#39;m intimidated by Mozart, whose feats are also beyond imagining.</p>
<p>I wonder whether Ms. Devi carried some sort of genetic mutation. Is remarkable proficiency at mental arithmetic an inheritable trait?&#0160; Which makes me wonder, when did <em>homines sapientes</em> acquire the ability to learn the times table?&#0160; When did the mutation for that trait first appear?</p>
<p>I telephoned my consultant on such matters, the blogger Political Mammal. He says that the ordinary brain, yours and mine, does so many calculations just when we walk down the street and compare this storefront to the one that went out of business and to the similar one on the next block that, well,&#0160; we should be just as astonished at quotidian events as at mental arithmetic.&#0160; I see his point. Who knows how many synapses are firing now, even as I&#39;m writing this simplicity-itself post.</p>
<p>But writing a few words is a commonplace miracle;&#0160; extracting seventh roots -- now, that&#39;s something else.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>We were not always the earth&#39;s sole hominid. Neanderthals (and Denisovans, and <em>Homo floresiensis</em> (if they were truly distinct species) overlapped our time.&#0160; Here are two skeletons, one of ours and one of theirs.</p>
<p>&#0160;
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef017c37de78b1970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Neander-human-comp" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef017c37de78b1970b image-full" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef017c37de78b1970b-800wi" title="Neander-human-comp" /></a></p>
<p> The first Neanderthals appeared perhaps a quarter of a million years ago and certainly by 170,000 years BP. They seem to have supplanted <em>Homo heidlebergensis</em>, a more distant cousin of ours, and they flourished from Spain to Israel, as far north as Finland, and possibly as far east as the Altai mountains in Siberia. In order to live in cold climates, they would have clothed themselves, though of course not a trace of a garment has survived. Neanderthals, it&#39;s been newly determined, carried a gene associated with pale skin and red hair. Their brain cases were slightly larger than ours, but shaped differently --&#0160; bulging at the sides and protruding in the back. Their rib cases flared at the bottom and their pelvises were broad, which meant that their strides necessarily involved a lot more hip rotation than our straightforward gait. They were more robust than we, with heavier bones and muscles, and they were much stronger. They ate more than we did and matured more rapidly -- their wisdom teeth developed at six years of age. Earlier Neanderthal populations appear to have been scavengers, but later ones were predators, capable of taking mammoths and wooly rhinoceroses. The plaque of Neanderthal teeth reveal traces of phytoliths which occur in the roots and leaves of plants. It&#39;s known that they ate dates, barley and legumes. Both meat and plants were cooked. There is some fragmentary evidence that they practiced cannibalism, but, I&#39;d prefer to think, only &quot;survival cannibalism.&quot;&#0160; Neanderthals lived in bands or perhaps 8 or 10 members. They occasionally buried their dead, but left behind no evidence of ritual or ceremony. They knapped chert and flint into scrapers and hand axes and the knew how to bind stone to wooden handles with adhesives and sinew, but they did not make use of bone tools.</p>
<p> They were gone from the earth about 20,000 years ago, displaced by <em>homines sapientes</em> and perhaps reduced by changes in the climate or by other destructive natural events. </p>
<p>Humans of European origin (but not of African or Asian) interbred with 
Neanderthals, so that as much of 4% of human DNA is Neanderthal. On ther other hand, no <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Homo sapiens</span> DNA has been discovered in Neanderthal populations. No one knows why the one and not the other.</p>
<p>This report is filched from Ian Tattersall&#39;s <em>Masters of the Planet</em> (2012), an excellent book that brought me up to date on human origins. I recommend it with genuine enthusiasm. It&#39;s learned, clearly written, and sensible. And it displaces the cartoon history I grew up with in which monkeys lead to apes and then to Piltdown (!!!) man and then to insurance salesmen in tie and jacket.&#0160; The modern picture is more complicated and far more fascinating and also replete with unsolved puzzles. </p>

                                <p>Before there were dikes there were terpen.</p>
<p>I was disgracefully ignorant of terpen until I read Robert Van de Noort&#39;s <em>North Sea Archaeologies: A Maritime Biography, 10,000 BC to AD 1500</em> (Oxford, 2011). Van de Noort devotes many pages to terpen, which are artificial islands constructed between 500 BC and 1000 AD in parts of the Netherlands, Denmark, and Germany. The earliest terpen were simple mounds on which a house was built; later several or more would be joined together to form small elevated villages protected against high tides and flooding. They might be as much as forty feet high. With the coming of dikes (c. 1000-1200 AD), terpen ceased to be constructed.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a terp, viewed from above.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef017c362ef0e9970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Terp" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef017c362ef0e9970b" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef017c362ef0e9970b-800wi" title="Terp" /></a></p>
<p>And here&#39;s another, photographed from ground level.</p>
<p>&#0160; <a class="asset-img-link" href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef017d405e0cef970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Terp2" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef017d405e0cef970c" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef017d405e0cef970c-800wi" title="Terp2" /></a></p>
<p>I&#39;ve been to the lowlands and might have seen these peculiar topographical features with my own eyes, but I certainly didn&#39;t register them. Even if I had, I might have confused them with the grave barrows or tumuli that are common in Scythian Bulgaria, or even with drumlins, which have a similar look to the uneducated eye -- although drumlins are natural rather than man-made.</p>
<p>I love it that &quot;terpen&quot; retains its ancient plural, along with words such as oxen and brethren. There aren&#39;t many such words in the language (children is a reduplicated plural, the original &quot;-er&quot; plural supplemented by an -en plural -- and some day to be superseded, I predict, by &quot;childrens&quot;).</p>
<p>Van de Noort&#39;s book is fascinating reading for those who like terpen and bronze-age sewn plank boats and such. It&#39;s rich in detail but might have been even richer if the author hadn&#39;t felt the need to waste space by calling the seashore a &quot;place of liminality&quot; and shipboard &quot;a heterotopia sailing upon the Deleuzian ocean&quot; -- and also indulge himself with many unconvincing&#0160; speculations dependent on such peculiar,&#0160; modish, transitory vocabulary.</p>
<p>When it comes to odd words, give me the old ones every time. Here are some satisfying lovely words that were as new to me as terpen: saltern (an area in fenlands set aside for salt manufacture); cofferdam (a temporary dam), thwart (a seat in a rowboat), leister (a two-pronged spear for fishing), dromond (a medieval galley) and broch (a dry-stone tower).</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef017c35fac556970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Mountain lion" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef017c35fac556970b image-full" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef017c35fac556970b-800wi" title="Mountain lion" /></a><br /><br />Mountain lions frequently wander from the foothills right into the heart of town. It&#39;s routine for them to &quot;take&quot; a pet cat or dog. A full-grown mountain lion can jump over the 8-foot chain link fence behind which you&#39;ve sequestered your golden retriever, kill it, and then grab it with its mouth and bound back over the fence. The young lion pictured above has found itself on someone&#39;s back deck. Good thing that there are no children enjoying themselves on the swings to its left.</p>
<p>The lion doesn&#39;t seem to be fazed by her near-cousinhood to behind-glass-door domesicated kitty. Stay inside, Muffy! You&#39;ll have a better day. .</p>
<p>A few months ago, wildlife officers killed a lion that had followed the deer downtown and &quot;showed no fear of humans.&quot; More commonly, officers shoot the lions with tranquilizer darts and then banish them deep in the mountains west of town.&#0160;</p>
<p>Mule deer are totally at home in our city. They&#39;re so common that no one pays them much mind, except when they eat the shrubbery and the early spring flowers. They&#39;re so acclimated to humans that they don&#39;t even shy when you come right up to them. They just stare right back at you and go on eating your tulips.&#0160;&#0160; <a class="asset-img-link" href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef017ee79e401c970d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Mule deer" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef017ee79e401c970d" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef017ee79e401c970d-800wi" title="Mule deer" /></a></p>
<p>Black bears are also frequent visitors. They patrol unsecured garbage cans, especially in the fall when they&#39;re fattening up for hibernation. Recently, one of them became quite a celebrity:&#0160;</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef017ee7a943a4970d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Animalnews1" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef017ee7a943a4970d" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef017ee7a943a4970d-800wi" title="Animalnews1" /></a></p>
<p>It was shot with a tranquilizer dart and dropped from its perch in a tree on to a mattress, and&#0160;was then transported back into bear country.</p>
<p>We have another celebrity animal this week, but the story behind it is not so felicitous. A bull elk has been hanging out, for the last few years, right at the western edge of town. He&#39;s become a friend, or perhaps a totem, to his human neighbors. But for some stupid reason, two police officers (one of whom owns a taxidermy studio) decided to kill it. Which they did, with a shotgun. The &quot;Mapleton Elk&quot; has been mourned with a candlelight vigil; the police officers have been charged with &quot;suspicion of forgery, tampering with physical evidence, attempting to influence a public official as well as unlawful taking of a trophy elk, conspiracy, killing an elk out of season, unlawful use of an electronic device to unlawfully take wildlife and first degree official misconduct.&quot; I&#39;m not proud of them.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef017d403fc465970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Mapletonelk" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef017d403fc465970c" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef017d403fc465970c-800wi" title="Mapletonelk" /></a></p>
<p>Our local coyotes have also been in the news. Although we&#39;ve always known they were around, they&#39;ve been discreet. But lately, they&#39;ve taken to harassing joggers on the Creek Path.&#0160;</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef017c3610cff3970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Coyote" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef017c3610cff3970b image-full" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef017c3610cff3970b-800wi" title="Coyote" /></a><br />The plan is to &quot;re-educate&quot; them, but &quot;lethal control&quot; has not been ruled out.</p>
<p>Be sensible, coyotes! Stay out of sight. No nipping at the heels of strollers or bikers.</p>

                                <p>I doubt that I know any more about strigils than your average man in the street. I had read about them for years, of course, but I had never seen one with my own eyes until yesterday, when I took myself down to the Pompeii exhibit in Denver. There they were, kind of stuck away in the corner -- two bronze beauties. &#0160; </p>
<p>Strigils were used for cleaning the body, ancient Roman style. Early loofahs. The one posted below looks a lot like the one I saw yesterday -- a garden-variety Denver/Pompeii specimen that was retrieved from under 20 feet of Vesuvian ash:&#0160; </p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef017ee664efaf970d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Strigil2" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef017ee664efaf970d" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef017ee664efaf970d-800wi" title="Strigil2" /></a><br /><br /></p>
<p>&#0160;Here&#39;s another strigil, this one a little more elaborate.&#0160; </p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef017ee664f37a970d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Strigil" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef017ee664f37a970d" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef017ee664f37a970d-800wi" title="Strigil" /></a><br /><br /></p>
<p>They&#39;re kind of formidable, aren&#39;t they?&#0160; </p>
<p>If, two thousand years ago, you had been patrician enough to go to the <em>thermae </em>for your ablutions, you would have left the <em>calida piscina,</em> the warm bath, and hastened to the <em>destrictarium</em>, which was a room dedicated to strigiling. There you would have applied a mixture of olive oil and pumice to your skin, and then one of your slaves, who might be an <em>aliptes</em>, a masseur, or a simple <em>balneator</em>, a bath attendant, would have strigiled you clean.&#0160;&#0160; </p>
<p>But why olive oil and pumice? Greasy and gritty. Why not soap?&#0160; Did the ancients have soap?&#0160; Who invented soap?</p>
<p>Fortunately, there&#39;s a website devoted to these important questions. Its forthright, unapologetic url is soaphistory.net. </p>
<p>The first traces of soap appeared among the Babylonians, some 5000 years ago. The recipe: mix animal fat with wood ash and boil. So soaps were around, but -- <em>mirabile dictu</em> -- they weren&#39;t used for personal hygiene. They were used for cleaning wool and cleaning pots; Pliny, who was there for the explosion of Mt. Vesuvius, and knew all there was to know, records only that soap was used as a hair pomade.</p>
<p> The world we have lost was a far dirtier place than we like to imagine. In point of fact, our familiar cake soaps and their widespread use are an industrial revolution-nineteenth century invention.</p>
<p>Considering the effectiveness and convenience of modern soaps, I&#39;m not looking for a strigil revival -- no Mr. Strigil at every streetcorner. Nevertheless, there&#39;s not a brush or a washcloth in the modern world that can match the beauty of the best of the ancient strigils. Here, for example, is an old Etruscan strigil with a naked-girl handle (she herself brandishes a mini-strigil). It&#39;s less useful than a cake of Ivory, but -- let&#39;s face it--&#0160; a heck of a lot more glamorous.&#0160; </p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>George Drysdale (1823-1904) wrote, anonymously, <em>Physical, Sexual, and Natural Religion</em> (1854), a pioneering guide to contraception and sexual disease that was condemned by the pious as &quot;the Bible of the Brothel.&quot; </p>
<p>Drysdale arrived at his progressive ideas after an adolescence and young manhood crippled by sexual ignorance and sexual panic. At the age of fifteen, he &quot;accidentally&#39;&#39; discovered masturbation and found that the practice offered an &#39;easy mode of satisfying his passions, which had long been the source of unrest and torment to his vivid imagination.&#39; He masturbated, poor Victorian fellow, two or three times a day and involuntarily endured occasional nighttime &#39;discharges&#39;. He was overcome with guilt and even more so tortured by the fear that, as he was instructed by prevailing doctrine, the &#39;loss&#39; of semen would sap his strength and inevitably lead him to madness. Hard to believe -- but such notions were commonplace among our recent, ignorant ancestors.&#0160;&#0160; </p>
<p>It gets worse. He was so distressed by his uncontrollable onanism that on trip to Hungary, he faked a suicide, leaving his clothes and identification beside a river.</p>
<p> And worse still. While in Hungary, he underwent a series of procedures to deaden and destroy the nerve endings of the penis &quot;by inserting into the urethra a thin metal rod coated in a caustic substance. He submitted to this procedure seven or eight times.&quot; It didn&#39;t work -- at least in the sense that it didn&#39;t diminish his passion for masturbation. I also suspect that it might have hurt.</p>
<p>It gets better, though. He resurrected himself and came back to his family after he consulted a doctor who offered the breathtakingly brilliant prescription that he &quot;try coition.&quot; Intercourse with prostitutes, he discovered, quite cured his urge to masturbate. Holy moley, what a revelation! What a fucking breakthrough!</p>
<p>Drysdale never married but in later life he lived for many years with a woman named Susannah Spring.&#0160; </p>
<p>Now, if you were writing a novel about a person who &quot;dies&quot; and returns to life and you called his mistress or partner or whatever she was by the name Spring, with its obvious overtones of rebirth, you would be justifiably accused of moralism or allegorizing or heavy-handedness. Nevertheless, truth is truth to the end of the chapter and Susannah Spring she was.</p>
<p> I hope George and Susannah were happy together. I hope they frequently and joyously &quot;tried coition.&quot; The poor boy deserved a few good years.&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; </p>
<p>(I&#39;ve pilfered the story of George Drysdale from Kate Summerscale&#39;s revelatory&#0160; <em>Mrs.Robinson&#39;s Disgrace</em> [New York, 2012]).</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I read with enthusiasm Richard Fortey&#39;s <em>Horseshoe Crabs and Velvet Worms </em>(New York, 2012), a pop biology book which describes&#0160;various plants and animals that originated millenia ago and that survive outwardly&#0160;unchanged to the present day.&#0160;It&#39;s a great subject and might have been&#0160;a great book if Fortey had been less anecdotal and more informative,&#0160;and if he&#0160;not just blathered into&#0160;the tape recorder but had paid attention to&#0160;organization and prose style.</p>
<p>Ever since my summers at <a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2006/03/makamah.html" target="_self">Makamah</a>&#0160;in the 1940s, I&#39;ve had an affection for horseshoe crabs.&#0160;They were abundant then, although scary and definitely not-to-be-stepped-on, and although I can&#39;t say for sure, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised to find that they are very rare now, especially in populated areas like the Sound. I would not have known that horseshoe crabs date from the&#0160;pre-hemoglobin era and that their blood (or blood-equivalent) is based not on iron but on copper.&#0160;I did not know anything about velvet worms or the various ancient slimes with&#0160;which Fortey is so taken, but I am well-acquainted with horsetails, which, however primitive they may be, continue to thrive rather wonderfully around our West Bradford pond.&#0160;</p>
<p>Of all Fortey&#39;s species, my favorite is unquestionably the&#0160;welwitschia, or, as it is sometimes called, the tweeblaarkanniedood, or khurob, or nyanka, or onyango --&#0160;a plant which&#0160;is no less exotic than its various names.&#0160;</p>
<p>It&#39;s the only plant in its order&#0160;(although it can claim&#0160;fossil relatives) and it hangs on in Namibia and Angola.&#0160;It&#39;s a very distant relative of pines and spruces, having diverged in the late Permian. Welwitschia has an extremely odd growth habit. It makes only two true leaves in its lifetime, but the leaves, which might be imagined as very wide ribbons,&#0160;grow constantly throughout the long life of the plant.&#0160;The leaves can be fifteen feet long;&#0160; the plant can live for a thousand and some think&#0160;even two thousand years.&#0160; Here&#39;s a welwitschia: it&#39;s not a classically handsome plant, not a garden beauty.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>

                                <p>I&#39;ve been reading about the peculiar metamorphosis of the starfish, <em>Luidia sarsi</em>, which eats shellfish and dwells in the muddy sediment of seashores from Norway to the Mediterranean. Its diaphanous larvae are bilaterally symmetrical; the adult form, with its five arms, is radially symmetrical, a most irregular circumstance. Moreover, the adult emerges from the larva in a different way than the butterfly from the caterpillar, where the structure dissolves and reforms. The starfish develops from a cluster of cells lining the internal cavity of the larva.&quot;&quot;Here it grows and matures, an alien existence independent of the larval body structures, axis, bilateral symmetry, and form, imbued with a complete disregard for every embodiment of its larval stage.&quot;&#0160; Eventually, the starfish emerges, and, most oddly, the larva continues on its way &quot;swimming the pelagic waters and grazing on its vegetarian diet of algae&quot;. Essentially, the starfish develops from what might be called stem cells that are carried within the larva. It&#39;s all very alien, or perhaps even Alien.</p>
<p>The theory presented in Frank Ryan&#39;s <em>The Mysteries of Metamorphosis</em> (White River Junction, 2011) is that at one time the larva and the starfish were two different creatures (from two different phyla). Somewhere in the dark backward and abyss of time, sperm from the one creature encountered an egg of the other (both creatures eject enormous amounts of reproductive material into the sea) and cross-phyletic cross-fertilization occurred and the resultant chimera prospered.&#0160;</p>

<p>Biologists resist the hypothesis because of the challenge it poses to the standard view of the evolutionary branching of life. I&#39;m in no position to judge the theory&#39;s truth or falsity, but I&#39;m attracted to the idea because it makes life forms so much more complex and unpredictable, and because it overturns conventional thinking.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Knowing little of the finny tribe, I borrowed the Bradford Public Library&#39;s copy of Langdon&#39;s introductory <em>Fishes of Vermont </em>(2006). It&#39;s an excellent, informative, helpful guide. With Langdon&#39;s help, I can now declare that it&#39;s undeniably the brown bullhead, a species of catfish, that has been multiplying in our pond. The bullhead, a villainous omnivore, is one of the causes of the steep decline of our population of frogs. The big, plug-ugly, bebarbelled brute gobbles frog-egg globules.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>Readers of this blague will not be astonished to learn that Dr. M .has fallen deeply in love with fish names. Take the brown bullhead, for example. It&#39;s also known by such evocative and lunatic denominations as the horned pout, the mudcat, and the minister. Minister?&#0160; To whom, or under what circumstances, would a brown bullhead minister?</p>
<p>My favorite Vermont fish, nomenclature-wise, is the slimy sculpin, also performing under such titles as the blob, the chucklehead, the rock cusk, the stargazer, and the cockatouch. The slimy sculpin should not be confused with its near cousin, the mottled sculpin -- which can also be addressed as the slowfish or gudgeon.</p>
<p>&#0160; <a class="asset-img-link" href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef016766beb0fe970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Slimy sculpin" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef016766beb0fe970b" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef016766beb0fe970b-800wi" title="Slimy sculpin" /></a></p>
<p>Many of the common Vermont fishes have lost their colorful historic names. The bowfin was once called the John A. Gindle, the stonecat was the doogler, the lake trout was the togue or longue, the burbot was variously ling or lawyer (lawyer? minister? why not accountant? or dentist?), the quillback was the buffalo, and the gar was the needlenose. On the other hand, the blandly-named pond perch of olden days is trending in the reverse direction: it&#39;s now called the pumpkinseed -- a name which seems curiously vegetarian for a predatory denizen of the deep.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>If I had known that there was a fish called the cisco (known on jolly days as the tollibee and on prosaic days as the sand herring), I would long ago have promoted Galen Cisco to my all-time-great Baseball-Fish Team, adding him to such piscine luminaries as Catfish Hunter, Dizzy Trout, Chico Salmon, Sid Bream, Bobby Sturgeon, Art &quot;Red&quot; Herring, and Shad Roe.</p>
<p>No Sculpins in MLB that I can recall, but In a more poetic universe, &quot;Slimy&quot; Sculpin would have been a spitball pitcher, or perhaps even a team owner.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I was talking on the telephone with a fan of the Washington Nationals and for some reason neither of us could recall the name of the lanky, scraggly-bearded shaggy-haired high-salaried power-hitting right fielder who once played for the Phillies and had a hard time last season but seemed to be starting out well this year, and whose grandfather played shortstop for the Pirates fifty year or so years ago.</p>
<p>Inasmuch as I once had near-perfect recall of such trivia, I was frustrated by the failure of memory. But I decided that this time I wasn&#39;t going to google the Nationals&#39; roster but instead was going to force myself to cough up that name, no matter how many polysaccharides had clogged my synaptic pathways. I set my search memory program on full blast, and after about 45 minutes, while I was scrubbing the sink, out popped the moniker. I called the Washington fan and whispered into the telephone, triumphantly, these three syllables: Jay Son Werth.&#0160;</p>
<p>How does the human brain do that? You can&#39;t bring up a word or phrase, and then, an hour or a day later, there it is! Tiny chemical processes or electrical impulses chase from synapse to synapse until they just happen to happen upon the neuron or neurons where &quot;Jayson Werth&quot; is stored? Really? Hard to fathom. However it&#39;s accomplished, it&#39;s superbly miraculous.</p>
<p>But o-so-slow compared to the instant recall of my golden olden days.</p>
<p>So now I have this idea for a TV game show, modeled after College Quiz Bowl, but called Senior Bowl. The format: when a question is asked, competitors start the clock, which can run for, let&#39;s say, a couple of days. And also start the videotape machine. Competitors go about their business and the first person with the correct answer wins the round. When the tape is carefully and dramatically edited, it&#39;s perfect reality TV for oldsters.</p>
<p>Announcer: &quot;Congratulations to prizewinner Vivian de St. Vrain, who was able to correctly identify the singer of &quot;Duke of Earl&quot; in only 17 hours, 12 minutes, and 43 seconds!&quot;</p>
<p>A major breakthrough in golden-years tv.</p>
<p>And by the way, I can now proclaim to all the waiting world that the name of Jayson Werth&#39;s shortstop grandfather is -- &quot;Ducky&quot; Schofield.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I enjoy fighting off a sneeze. It takes practice and concentration. When the sneeze urge emerges, without warning, the battle is joined. On the side of the sneeze -- dust or some other foreign particles passing through the nasal hairs, reaching&#0160; the nasal mucosa, releasing a flood of histamines which irritate the nerve cells and signal the brain to stimulate the trigeminal network and activate the pharyngeal and tracheal muscles, producing a noisy, 100-mile-an-hour blast of microbes and snot. On the side of restraint -- nothing but enormous personal discipline and the desire not to surrender to animal nature. There are some, who are less committed to mind-over-body, who employ the fingertips to pinch the end of the nose, or, alternatively, who press a knuckle against the philtrum, the infranasal depression which Shakespeare, curiously, called &quot;the valley&quot; -- but frankly, when it comes to resisting sternutation, digital success is only half a loaf. It&#39;s far more rewarding to think one&#39;s way to a rare victory in the lifelong sneezomachia. Not to sneeze is a triumph of the will.</p>
<p>Which is not to assert that a good sneeze gives no pleasure, if a person would give oneself over to it. It&#39;s simply that the sneeze, especially one of the window-rattling variety, is entirely anarchic and inartistic, which might be why there is so slight a sneeze literature. Although hard to believe, it&#39;s a fact that Puck is the only character in all of Shakespeare&#39;s plays who deigns to mention the sneeze, but he weakens its disruptive force by employing the archaism &quot;neeze.&quot; The best-known literary sneeze (or, at least, the only one that now comes to mind) occurs in Pope&#39;s <em>Rape of the Lock</em>, when Belinda, ravished by Sir Plume&#39;s &quot;glittering forfex,&quot; throws snuff in the baron&#39;s nose. Immediately &quot;with starting tears each eye o&#39;erflows,/ And the high dome re-echoes to his nose.&quot;</p>
<p>Snuff artificially stimulates sneezing, which may or may not be be why Michael, Tsar of all the Russians, proposed amputating the noses of snuffers. Michael&#39;s contemporary, Pope Urban VIII, merely threatened excommunication. Some say that the practice of saying &quot;God bless you&quot; to sneezers originated with Pope Gregory the Great, and has to do with the superstition that the soul leaves the sneezing body, perhaps nasally.</p>
<p>Why is it that no one ever says &quot;God bless you&quot; to farters, who are as much in need of divine intervention as sneezers. Society demands that farting, though shameful (and belching, though comic), should be controlled; sneezing is, except for the most determined among us, uncontrollable.&#0160;&#0160;</p>

                                <p>Eric Sanderson&#39;s <em>Mannahatta</em> (New York: Abrams, 2009) reconstructs Manhattan as it would have appeared to Henry Hudson when he sailed the Half-Moon into the harbor in 1609. The glory of the book lies in its illustrations.&#0160; Here&#39;s a conjectural reconstruction of old Manhattan island: <br /><a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef016301560963970d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Mannahatta2" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef016301560963970d" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef016301560963970d-800wi" title="Mannahatta2" /></a></p>
<p>And here&#39;s a clever juxtaposition of ancient and modern:</p>
<p><a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef0167624b359e970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Mannahatta3" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef0167624b359e970b" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef0167624b359e970b-800wi" title="Mannahatta3" /></a></p>
<p>In 1609, the island of Manhattan was home to between 400 and 1000 Lenape Indians. They lived on fish, shellfish (leaving behind extensive middens), deer and other wildlife, on fruits and berries. They practiced some small-scale farming of corn, squash, and beans. Sanderson estimates that the Lenape had lived on Manhattan for 10,000 years, or 400 generations.</p>
<p>Why so few people? The land was fertile, the seas abundant, the weather not particularly harsh. While the Lenape sat still in Manhattan, advanced civilizations were created by the Mayans, the Aztecs and the Incas. Along the banks of the Mississippi, the city of Cahokia rose and fell. And yet the Lenape never domesticated a single animal beside the dog and left behind no pottery, weaving, or metals. They remained stuck in the paleolithic. Why, I wonder. Perhaps things were too good.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Lenape lived in harmony with the island for a very long time. What are the odds that our present civilization, which has totally transformed Manhattan in 400 short years, or just 16 generations, will last one tenth as long?&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><em>February 24</em>:&#0160; Still curious about the want of population growth or technological development among the Lenape, I read C. A. Weslager&#39;s T<em>he Delaware Indians, A History</em> (1972) (Lenapes were called by their Anglo name, Delaware, for many years). Wenslager does not suggest that the Lenape ever achieved larger populations. Nor does he point to any archeological evidence of cultural achievement. Still, I&#39;m mildly suspicious that there may be more to the story.&#0160; We know that Verrazzano contacted the Lenapes 90 years before Hudson sailed into the harbor, and no one knows what diseases he might have introduced.</p>
