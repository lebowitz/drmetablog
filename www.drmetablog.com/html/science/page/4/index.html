                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I don&#39;t like gore. I’m the kind of person who won’t recklessly channel-surf for fear that the changer gizmo will maliciously lock onto our 24/7 surgery channel, where some poor soul&#39;s innards will be on garish hi-def display. &#0160;And yet, despite my squeamishness, I steeled myself and read right through to the end of Katrina Firlik&#39;s <em>Another Day in the Frontal Lobe</em>, which is a young neurosurgeon’s bildungs-autobiography.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>Of course, I allowed myself the indulgence of zooming through some of the more gruesome parts. How much do I need to know about maggot infestations in the living brain?</p>
<p>I’m grateful to Firlik for her vivid stories, for the occasional moment of black humor and also for offering a forthright glimpse into an alternative world. Nevertheless, I&#39;m sorry to report, <em>Another Day </em>is not a good book.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>It&#39;s too transparently a package shaped by agent and editor for short-term commercial appeal. The author is so anxious to be cute and to be loved – she must have been one of those front-row, admiring-eyes-glued-to-the-professor straight-A pupils -- that whenever she comes up against a controversial topic, such as the irrational funding of our medical system or the egomania of surgeons or the morality of expensive, hopeless surgical interventions, she hints at concern but then swerves and punts. She doesn&#39;t want to offend a single potential buyer.</p>
<p>Not a courageous writer, she is not an admirable being either: what can one say about a highly-skilled professional who turns down job after job in the American hinterland and elects to live in New Canaan, Connecticut, because, she admits, it would be impossible to find a good Japanese restaurant in the sticks, &#0160;and who in one sentence notes that her rich town has more neurosurgeons than all of sub-Sahara Africa and in another reveals that she works on spines rather than brains nowadays because spines are more lucrative.</p>
<p>Hey, Katrina, the next time you publish something, sacrifice some of that royalty money and write directly from your heart (even though it&#39;s one cold and stony organ).&#0160;</p>
<p>Readers of this blague will not be surprised to learn that Dr. M. was much intrigued by the book&#39;s medical vocabulary.&#0160;<em>Another Day </em>serves up a feast of beautiful and exotic words:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span>venous infarct, dura, spicule, rongeur, neuroma, glioma, glioblastoma (you don’t want one!), bone dust, debulk, pachygyria. The ugliest of all: intubated.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>My personal favorite, and a word that I&#39;ve now put in the running for Word of the Year: bezoar.</p>
<p>How could I have lived all these years without knowing the word bezoar?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; Could there be a surer index of my ignorance of medicine?&#0160; </span>A bezoar, as everyone but me seems to know, is a concretion of indigestible stuff stuck somewhere in the digestive tract – hairballs, medicines, bits of food. Sometimes they can be dissolved, but on occasions they can only be removed by surgery. A bezoar was formerly thought to be a magical antidote for poisons –- so score another couple of strikes against our ignorant superstitious ancestors. The most common kind of bezoar is the phytobezoar, which is a collection of lignin, cellulose, or tannin of food fibers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>Common sources:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>celery, grapes, raisins, prunes, pumpkins, all of which, if you’re like me, you’ve probably unwittingly eaten without having given a thought to their bezoar-potential and therefore neglected a splendid opportunity for hypochondria.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">A </span>bezoar caused by eating persimmons (an especially dangerous fruit, bezoarwise), earns its very own word-- diospyrobezoar -- an odd amalgam of Greek and Persian linguistic roots and a word which, just as soon as a suitable opening arises, I intend to insinuate into the conversation.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Last summer, planning to extend a flower garden, I covered a weed-choked area of about 4 feet by 10 feet with a foot high pile of dense lawn clippings.&#0160; The plan was to kill the sod by excluding the light of the sun. It&#39;s an effective, proven method&#0160; -- most people use black plastic for the same purpose. What sort of weed was I combating?&#0160; The population endemic to this part of Vermont:&#0160; a mixed stand of goldenrod, milkweed, plantain, dandelion, blackberry, bindweed, dogbane, Indian paint-brush, buttercup, bracken fern. Yesterday I inspected the results. The sod is dead, but it&#39;s been replaced by a nearly pure stand of witch grass, which not not only survived but prospered. Every other plant was door nail dead. I spent the day pulling up and digging out forty square feet of tenacious witch grass.&#0160;</p>
<p>Witch grass is the most noxious of the weeds with which I daily contend. It&#39;s invasive, almost indestructible, powerful. If you dig it out and leave behind the merest shred of root (underground stem, actually), the plant immediately regenerates. It finds its way through wooden barriers and under metal barriers. It grows rapidly in almost all soils.&#0160;</p>
<p>Witch grass has forced me to stop growing bearded iris. It so surrounds and overwhelms the irises that they can&#39;t be weeded without dislodging the shallow corms. I&#39;ve occasionally dug up an iris where the witch grass didn&#39;t even bother to go around the corm -- just dug a hole and bored right through it. On the other hand, Siberian irises compete well with witch grass.&#0160; Siberians make such a dense deep cluster of roots that they squeeze the witch grass to death. Strangles it. Does my heart good.</p>
<p>There&#39;s some pleasure in weeding witch grass, especially when you can get a good grab and drag out a long root. In good soil, after a rain, I&#39;ve pulled out pieces three or four feet long. &#0160;But you have to dispose of it properly. It takes the sun a week to kill the root, and should you accidentally cover it with other weeds, it will come to life even even though it&#39;s not even under the ground.&#0160;</p>
<p>I used to say that I wanted my gravestone to read: &quot;He got the witch grass out of his garden.&quot; But now I know that it was mere vanity to think that I could win the battle of the witch grass.&#0160; Here&#39;s a prediction: there will come a day when witch grass will grow over and under and around my marble marker.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>Witch grass (<em>agropyron repens</em>) is not even native to the New World. It&#39;s come to us from Europe. Along with the dandelion, the starling and Dutch elm disease.&#0160;</p>

<p>Nurse, how good is the anaesthetist?</p>

<p>Does Medicare cover this procedure?</p>

<p>Pass me the scalpel.&nbsp; I mean, the scimitar.</p>

<p>What kind of steriods is this fellow on?</p>

<p>Doctor, wait until you see your next patient. </p>

                                <p>Last fall, I purchased two bottlebrush buckeyes by mail order and set them temporarily in the kitchen garden.&nbsp; Yesterday, I finally picked out the right spot.&nbsp; I cleared some weeds, carted over a generous supply of the well-dried,&nbsp; and transplanted the buckeyes into their permanent location on a slope that's been difficult to maintain, just at the edge of the sheep pasture.&nbsp; It's an experiment;&nbsp; I've never seen a bottlebrush buckeye this far north.&nbsp; But hey, they made it through their first winter with flying colors and the climate is warming up.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The bottlebrush buckeye is one of those magnificent flowering shrubs that I first encountered years ago in the Brooklyn Botanical Garden.&nbsp; &nbsp; It's a plant that will take three years to flower and a decade to mature, so it's touch-and-go whether I'll see it in its glory -- assuming that it survives when we have one of those snowless frigid winters that turn nominal Zone 4 into actual Zone 2.</p>

<p>In addition, I planted a four foot tall bur oak (also new to the norhern neighborhood). I like to plant an oak tree even though it will be a decade and a half before it makes an impact on the landscape.&nbsp; Oaks are for the grandchildren and the great-grandchildren,&nbsp; should there be any.&nbsp; And for the planet.&nbsp; Although this part of Vermont is rich in oaks, our particular property was oakless when we arrived.&nbsp; We now have many northern reds, a swamp white and a bur.&nbsp; I'm on the lookout for other varieties that can tolerate the winters.</p>

<p>Not everything's going up.&nbsp; Coming down, yesterday, a huge mature balsam fir, which was in the wrong place and needed to go.&nbsp; We finally bit the bullet yesterday.&nbsp; It took my neighbor Ed's big chainsaw and his Massey-Ferguson tractor, along with chains and cables to fell it.&nbsp; It will take a whole day to cut it up and prepare for the big bonfire.&nbsp; On the way down, the fir took some limbs of a beech and made quite a mess of the front lawn.&nbsp; We've replaced the divots and re-seeded and mulched the hard-hit areas.&nbsp; The beech will recover eventually, but it will take a couple of years. It can now see the light.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>My brother Jonathan says, &quot;The wheel.&nbsp; I could have invented the wheel.&quot;&nbsp; Meaning, I think, that he understands the advanced scientific principle -- a wheel turns round and round.&nbsp; Unlike, say, the refrigerator or the radio, which he doesn't understand and will concede that he couldn't possibly have invented.&nbsp; As for myself, I don't think that&nbsp; I could possibly have conceived of something so elegant as the wheel.&nbsp; The chair.&nbsp; I could have invented the chair.&nbsp; No moving parts.</p>

<p>And yet the wheel, history tells us, was anything but obvious.&nbsp; <em>Homo sapiens sapiens</em> had been on the planet for half a million years before some Mesopotamian genius, or series of geniuses, figured out the fine art of rolling (in fact, the wheel was apparently used for pottery for centuries before it was adapted for transport).&nbsp; In the Americas, both the Mayans and the Incas domesticated plants and animals, perfected smelting and weaving, carved out roads and aqueducts, but never hit upon the wheel.&nbsp; </p>

<p>If my brother had been born near the Olduvai rift in East Africa in the minus four hundred thousands, would he have been smart enough to come up with the wheel?&nbsp; Would he even have had the opportunity?&nbsp; Wouldn't he, like the rest of us, have spent his time cowering in the cave, occasionally rushing out to grab a hunk of dead gazelle whenever the lions turned their backs?&nbsp; And employing every bit of his brain power learning how better to knap the flint.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

<p>And besides, even if you figure out that a tree trunk can be made to rotate, you still have to invent the axle.&nbsp; And the spoke. </p>

<p>The lever?&nbsp; Yes, I think so.&nbsp; Put a hunk of wood or a piece of bone under a rock and pry it up.&nbsp; I could have done that.&nbsp; But how about the pliers -- a double lever, now in use for about 4000 years.&nbsp; I think I could have stared at a three pieces of metal for a zillion years and not invented the pliers.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

<p>I'll make a prediction.&nbsp; One day, when the aliens come to visit us from their infinitely more advanced civilization, they will marvel at us the way we marvel at the Incas.&nbsp; How astonishing, they're going to say, they got as far as they did but they never figured out the glugg.&nbsp; The glugg will be something as elementary and as obvious and as useful as the wheel or the lever or the inclined plane.&nbsp; Some simple machine that we've completely overlooked.</p>

<p>So wheel-man, whoever you are, I celebrate you.</p>

<p>Hey Jon, why don't you go invent the glugg?</p>

<p>Could I in actual fact have invented the chair?&nbsp; Well, perhaps I would have been smart enough to think of sitting on a rock or on a tree stump. But a chair with legs?&nbsp; Or with legs strengthened with stretchers?&nbsp; Not very likely that I would have been smart enough to invent a chair.&nbsp; If it had been left to me, we'd still be squatting on tree stumps.&nbsp; </p>

                                <p>Regular readers of this blague should be able to anticipate Dr. Metablog&#39;s best and favorite answer to the important question, &quot;What is a cutter?&quot;</p>
<p>Familiar with Dr. M&#39;s lifelong passion for baseball, the king of all sports, an informed reader might be tempted to say that a &quot;cutter&quot; is short for a &quot;cut fastball&quot; -- a variation, baseballophiles know, of the two-seamer -- perfected by the likes of Mariano Rivera. Or one might think to guess that a &quot;cutter&quot; is a skilled craftsman in the garment trades. Good answers both, but not the <em>echt</em> metablogian answer.</p>
<p>How about a utility knife or box cutter, prominent in the new world of terrorism?&#0160; Or a small fore-and-aft rigged sailing vessel, junior to the sloop?&#0160; Or one of those self-destructive teens who inflicts injury upon himself?&#0160; A shaper of gems?&#0160; An unlicensed, underworld surgeon?&#0160; A film editor? A queue-jumper? A quarry worker from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaking_Away">Bloomington, Indiana</a>?&#0160; A mohel?&#0160;</p>
<p>Good answers all. But Dr. M, in a moment of ultra-metablogism, is proud to announce that the properest answer can be found in William Dean Howells&#39; 1882 novel, <em>A Modern Instance:&#0160; </em></p>
<p>&quot;On a Saturday evening in February, a cutter, gay with red-lined robes, dashed away and came musically clashing down the street under the naked elms. The young man slackened the pace of his horse, as if to still the bells.&#0160; The girl took the hand he offered her when he dismounted at the gate, and as she jumped from the cutter, &#39;Wont you come in?&#39;, she asked.&#0160; &#39;I guess I can blanket my horse and stand him under the wood-shed,&#39; answered the young man, going round to the animal&#39;s head, and leading him away.&quot;</p>
<p>The answer: a cutter is a nineteenth-century horse drawn <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2008/05/the-springless.html">vehicle</a>.</p>
<p>Howells doesn&#39;t bother to mention whether it runs on wheels or on runners. He assumes that his readers will know.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Even a decade ago, wild turkeys were an utmost rarity, and the sight of one in the distance caused everyone to stop and peer. But each succeeding year, there are more and more of them. They&#39;re everywhere -- on the roads, in the fields, even under the apple trees, gorging themselves. Last week, a hen and a dozen poults walked bold as brass right up onto our front lawn, ten feet from the deck.&#0160; Didn&#39;t even bother to hasten away -- took their own sweet time wandering off.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t believe that turkeys were native to Vermont, but it&#39;s well known that since the reintroduction, they&#39;ve expanded well beyond their former range.&#0160;They&#39;re adaptable and wily creatures.</p>
<p>The domestic turkey is legendarily stupid. Its brains have waned as its breasts have waxed. The wild turkey, on the other hand, is smart, though given to occasional lapses. Sometimes the hen leads her brood through the woven wire fences. She knows the route, but one or two of the poults will find themselves barricaded from the flock. They set up a wail. The flock comes to a nervous halt. After a while, the spectator -- me -- can&#39;t endure the tension. I slowly head over to see what I can do, trying not to alarm the lost fowl -- whereupon the poults suddenly remember that they know how to fly. Unlike their domestic cousins, they&#39;re strong fliers. They clear the fences with ease.</p>
<p>I now understand a few words of Turkeyish. The male gobble: &quot;I am very large and handsome; come mate with me.&quot;&#0160; The poult peep: &quot;I&#39;m lost.&#0160; Where is everyone.&quot; The hen cluck: &quot;Come along with me.&quot; The double cluck: &quot;Everyone fly into the trees.&quot;</p>
<p>Here&#39;s what worries me.&#0160;Every year there are more and more turkeys.&#0160;Even the hunters can&#39;t keep up with the population explosion. Will the turkeys turn into a rural version of pigeon?&#0160;Overrun our gardens and fields?&#0160;</p>
<p>Where are the fisher-cats, the foxes, the coyotes, the hawks?&#0160; Get to work, guys.&#0160;While turkeys are not exactly sitting ducks, they&#39;re still very tasty.&#0160; &#0160;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>So I&#39;ve been trying, by god, to figure out why the riding mower has been cutting on an angle, the right side leaving the grass higher than the left, and I&#39;ve been crawling under the machine looking at the cutting deck from all angles and not able to understand the mechanism except it&#39;s obvious that it&#39;s not parallel to the ground, and my neighbor Ed was by and he&#39;s kind of a genius with machinery which I most definitely am not, and I said to him, Ed would you take look and see why the mower is cutting at an angle and he said, Well, here&#39;s one problem your left rear tire is flat which made me feel really dumb because I was so busy trying to understand the suspension system on the deck that I never even looked at the tire and I said, Flat, how can it be flat, I never run it anywhere but over the grass and he said, Well, look right there it&#39;s got a thorn in it, A thorn, I said, how can a thorn penetrate a Carlyle Super Tuff tire, and he said, Oh yeah they do that, but I can fix it, I&#39;m busy today but I&#39;ll do it tomorrow I have a system you just push through what looks like knitting needle with sticky stuff on the end and pull it out, it will seal it right up, it&#39;s a tubeless tire isn&#39;t it? and I said Yes it is, and if you could fix it tomorrow that would be great, well next day he took the tire and tried it his way but he couldn&#39;t get it to hold air so he says Take it down to PTOs and they&#39;ll patch it from the inside, so I put it in the trunk of the car and drove to town and they fixed it and then I put it back on the axle, it has three small washers and one large washer and one of those spring nuts and I started the engine but by god the mower wouldn&#39;t move and I thought what the heck is going on here, I put everything back exactly as it came off and it was running just fine when I took it off so what could I possibly be doing wrong, I took the wheel off and put it on again and I still couldn&#39;t figure it out so I got in the car and drove over to Ed&#39;s, he was cutting wood but he stopped and I said, Ed, what&#39;s wrong with that lamb, why do you have him penned up all by himself and he said, you know how the lambs are always butting heads and pushing each other around, well I went out in the field and he was down, couldn&#39;t move a bit, so I took him home and I don&#39;t know whether his brains are addled or he&#39;s really hurt, I thought we&#39;d better have him slaughtered but you can see he&#39;s doing better, getting up and eating so we&#39;ll hold off a day, and I said maybe he has a bad back like me, and he said, No, he&#39;s too young for a bad back, so I said, Well, maybe he has vertigo like you, which is not all that funny because Ed lost a week to vertigo last June, and he kind of laughed and said, Well, is your mower working now, and I said, Not exactly, the engine&#39;s fine and the belt turns but it&#39;s not moving frontwards or backwards and he said, How can that be, I&#39;ll come over and take a look so later that day he came by and sure enough it wouldn&#39;t move, so we took off the wheel again and studied it but I certainly couldn&#39;t figure it out and he couldn&#39;t either, everything looked good and perfect, we puzzled over it for a while and then he called the John Deere dealer in North Haverhill and the technician said maybe you lost the key when you took off the wheel and Ed said, O yes of course, we must have lost the key, I didn&#39;t think of that, and I said What the heck is the key and he said Well, in a lot of these machines the axle is broached which means there&#39;s a slot in it and a slot in the wheel and you have to have a key which is just a small piece of metal otherwise the axle will spin but the wheel won&#39;t rotate, so we looked all around for the lost key but couldn&#39;t find it and then Ed said, Look at your tire they didn&#39;t even mount it right, it&#39;s out of round, you&#39;d better bring it back in and while you&#39;re there check if the key is in the shop somewhere, it might have stuck in the wheel because of the grease, so I took the wheel and put it in the trunk and drove back to PTOs and showed him that the tire was out of round, the owner was embarrassed about the bad job he had done and wouldn&#39;t even look me in the eye but he re-mounted the tire and when he finished I said, By the way, you didn&#39;t happen to find the key I lost it, and he said I&#39;ll look inside but he couldn&#39;t find it, so he said I&#39;ll make you another one which was nice of him though the key is only at most a 50 cent piece but it saved me from having to go to Napa Auto Parts or drive 30 minutes to North Haverhill to the John Deere dealer, so he made the part it took him only a couple of minutes, he had the stock he just had to cut and file a two inch piece, I brought it home and I put the key in the slot and put the wheel on, I had to use a board for a lever to get the rear of the mower up in the air and it was tricky because I held the board with my right hand and the wheel in the left but I managed alright and then I got on the tractor and started the engine and everything worked perfectly except that the tractor still wouldn&#39;t go either forward or backward, I took the wheel off and put it on again, but it still wouldn&#39;t work, so I walked over to Ed&#39;s and I said, Ed, I can&#39;t for the life of me figure it out, I got the key and it fit just perfectly but the machine still doesn&#39;t move, and he said It&#39;s got to work, it makes perfect sense, I said, Hey look, your lamb looks a lot better but why did you put a hog panel across your driveway, he said It&#39;s because of the dog, he&#39;s been getting out, tomorrow he&#39;s going to be snipped and that will quiet him down a bit, which is a good idea because the dog is far too friendly even to me and I don&#39;t particularly like the dog, he&#39;s a beagle mix, not as bad as their other dog which was a rescue dog a bulldog, very ugly in my opinion, which also got out and trotted over to the pottery down the road where he was&#0160; seen running off with the Murrays&#39; Silkie in his mouth, a Silkie is a fancy chicken, they charged Ed a hundred and sixty dollars for vet bills and mental anguish, the chicken died anyway, so Ed got out his rifle and shot the bulldog and then dug a hole four feet deep, he said that all the way down it was nothing but powder, it&#39;s been that dry the last few weeks, anyway Ed came by again and we tried the machine and it wouldn&#39;t go forward or backward and I was about to surrender and load up the damn thing and take it back to the dealer when we lifted both back wheels off the ground and suddenly the axle which hadn&#39;t been turning even though the belt had been turning started to spin, it must have been something about the gears that didn&#39;t mesh properly anyway we put the wheel back on again and I started it up and by god it ran as good as ever but I had wasted a whole day fussing with the mower just because it had picked up a goddamn thorn probably blackberry which is in brief why I hate machines</p>

                                <p>That most malicious of all living creatures, the white-tailed deer, has been destroying the phlox. Also the roses, the blueberries, the plums, the hollyhocks (tender new leaves only), the day lilies, and most particularly, the precious new apple trees. They&#39;ve weakened the Wealthy, noshed the Norland and bonsaied the Baldwin. My friends and neighbors suggest various remedies. Eight-foot high fences is the consensus -- although occasionally, allowed a running start, the deer are able to leap even these. But do I want an unsightly eight-foot fence around my garden and orchard? Let&#39;s consider some other <em>wisdome </em>of the <em>ffolke. </em></p>
<p>Should I buy human hair from the local barber and hang bags of it around the orchard? I don&#39;t think so -- far too voodooish for a post-Enlightenment gardener such as myself. I could douse the grounds in coyote urine, though I&#39;m not sure that I want to milk a coyote -- or, <em>a fortiori,</em> a mountain lion. I know one kind of urine that doesn&#39;t repel deer&#0160; -- at least when anecdotally applied. Some folk, more determined than I could ever be, soak rags in human urine and ring the garden with them, but I suspect that I would not savor either the administration or the aesthetic repercussions of this method. A strong solution of garlic might work, but it&#39;s deer I want to repel, not vampires. A spray of peppermint seems like a more pleasant choice, but apparently it must be renewed after every rainfall, which is highly impractical in our moisture-abundant climate. A recipe of a slightly beaten egg mixed with a gallon of water is claimed to be effective, but must be applied nightly -- too much cookery for me. Some people claim that moth balls repel deer, but the same people claimed that moth balls would repel raccoons. My raccoons took the moth balls for marbles and made a game of them and of me. Decaying fish heads would no doubt repel deer, but they&#39;d also repel bees, birds, friends, and family. Even if I could procure them (&quot;I&#39;ll have a couple of pounds of decaying fish heads, please&quot;), do I really want to sit, contemplative, in a garden of such stinkiness?</p>
<p>Besides, I don&#39;t believe in these superstitions. I want data. I want double-blind experiments. I want science.&#0160;</p>
<p>My sister, who lives in prime white-tail country, hangs bars of Ivory soap in her apple trees. It works, she says. Not credible, not scientific, say I. But last week we visited her, and there they were, a half-dozen or so thriving young apple trees. Not a nibble on a one of them. New growth allowed to be new growth.</p>
<p>Hers are New Hampshire deer. I bet that our Vermont deer will sniff the soap, chortle, and proceed to bathe face and hoofs. We&#39;ll soon have the cleanest deer in all creation.</p>
<p>In desperation, I&#39;ve joined the ranks of the credulous. I&#39;ve threaded Ivory soap with baling twin and hung a cake on each of the young apples. White rectangular scarecrows. But for the first time all summer, I&#39;m seeing new growth. This could work.&#0160;</p>
<p>One of my neighbors says, &quot;No, no, don&#39;t use Ivory soap -- use Irish Spring.&quot;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>When we arrived here, in the summer of 1968, there were so many huge old dying elms that we jokingly referred to the place as &quot;Dead Elm Farm.&quot; One by one every single elm succumbed to the virus. Bare and leafless, they dropped their branches and then stood as barkless pillars until rot or a windstorm toppled them. For many years there were young elms around, but as soon as they grew to twenty or so feet, the disease would take hold. There are still a few adolescent elm skeletons, but they&#39;re harder and harder to find.&#0160;</p>
<p>We have some slippery elms and an occasional water elm, but the good old American elm, a prominent feature of our landscape for several hundred million years down to this present moment, is virtually extinct.&#0160;</p>
<p>Am I a member of the last generation on earth to marvel at the majesty of these great trees?&#0160; Sure the landscape is still rich -- maples, oaks, birches both white and yellow, beeches, spruce, pine, fir, hemlock, the big-toothed aspen, a cottonwood or two, cedars and our most plentiful wetlands inhabitant, the deciduous conifer variously called the hackmatack or tamarack or larch (in taxonomists&#39; parlance, the larchy larch<em>, larix laricina).&#0160; </em>But I grieve for the elms. Their absence makes a space in my mental landscape.&#0160;</p>
<p>I don&#39;t, of course, long for the American chestnut, which was gone for fifty years when I came on the stage. Just as my descendants won&#39;t notice the absence of the elms.</p>
<p>Not far from the house an old elm has coppiced in an awkward place, and it needs to be removed. It&#39;s ugly -- twenty or so stems ten or twelve feet high racing for the sun. It should go. But I imagine that I&#39;ll leave the best of the shoots and hope that it will thrive. It would be almost criminal to saw down the last lonely elm. There&#39;s always the one-in-a-million chance that this unhandsome specimen will prove to be virus-immune. Wouldn&#39;t that be something?&#0160; <em>&#0160; </em></p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>There are now five horses and about twenty-five sheep pastured on our fields. The horses are Morgans; they&#39;re handsome and dignified. They have mucho gravitas and very distinct personalities.&#0160; I&#39;m proud to say that we&#39;re friends; the horses make a point to trot over and say hello when I&#39;m working nearby. They have big brains (or, at least, room for big brains) and they seem to want to communicate. I sweeten our intimacy with windfall apples. My relationship with the sheep is less satisfactory. Frankly, we&#39;re not on the same wavelength. Today I was cutting some brush (mostly beaked hazelnut and red maple) on the other side of the pond right against the sheep fence. Because I know that sheep take a gourmet interest in leaves of any sort (although we keep them away from lilac and wilted cherry), I carried a stack of branches out into the field. The sheep were interested but wary. Finally, one of the lambs (Braveheart, let&#39;s call him) sidled up to the pile and pulled on a leaf -- at which point the whole stack moved an inch or two. The entire flock started and immediately skedaddled back home.</p>
<p>The sheep are Scottish Blackfaces. My neighbor Ed, who owns them, claims that Scottish Blackfaces are the smartest of all ovines. Talk about damning-with-extra-faint-praise. Here&#39;s how utterly brilliant sheep can be. There are two gates right next to each other to a second pasture. One of the gates is for the horses and one is for the sheep. The sheep gate is nothing more than a few boards tacked together to make a space 4 feet high and 4 feet wide -- just large enough so that the sheep can slip through but the horses can&#39;t. The gate for the horses must be 12 or 14 feet across. It&#39;s metal and it rests on a hefty pair of hinges. Sometimes it&#39;s left open to allow the horses access to the field. But even when it&#39;s wide open, the sheep don&#39;t use it. Instead, they line up single file at their own little gate and wait their turn. Not a one of them, even Braveheart, has the sense to look around and notice that the main thoroughfare is available to anyone who wants to show a little initiative.</p>
<p>The horses are organized. Gillian, who&#39;s a twenty-something-year old mare, is the boss. Gabe, an ex-boy, is at the bottom. In between, the two young chestnut mares and a newly gelded bay struggle for status. In social terms, the sheep are a horse of another color. If there&#39;s a system to the society of sheep, I&#39;ve not been able to discern it. It&#39;s all random Brownian movement. I asked Ed, who knows his sheep and has kept them for many years, if he&#39;d ever been able to discover the structure of ovine social life. &quot;Near as I can figure out,&quot; he answered, &quot;one of them gets it in his head to go somewhere, and the rest follow.&quot;&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>Horses are noble; sheep are amusing but duller than Charles B., who was twice left back in first grade in P. S. 217, and duller also than my long-time colleague Joel S.&#0160;</p>
<p>Whose idea was it, do you think, to placate the gods by sacrificing sheep?&#0160; Were our ancestors trying to pull the wool over their deities&#39; eyes?&#0160; Were they being deliberately disrespectful?&#0160; What sort of offering is a sheep?</p>
<p>&quot;Here, sir god, I&#39;ll kill you a sheep. It&#39;s enough. What would you want with a horse?&quot;</p>

                                <p>I&#39;ve been indoctrinated by our uncomprehending society to regard my geographical dyslexia, or my directional disability, or whatever it&#39;s to be called, as a shameful condition. So it&#39;s good to know that DD can be otherwise valued.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been informed by one of my readers that the Pilipino word <strong>ligaw</strong> has two meanings: a) courtship, and b) totally lost. As a result, the adjective <strong>ligawan </strong>can refer either to a person who has no sense of direction, or to someone who is especially attractive to suitors. It stands to reason that a person who has absolutely no awareness of direction (right or left, east or west) whatsoever and is constantly buffaloed and flabbergasted by the well-meaning instructions of friends and would-be guides must be extremely radiant, perhaps even charismatically magnetic.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>I find this new information to be both highly probable and extremely consoling.&#0160;</p>
<p>Moreover, my admiration for Pilipino language and culture and good sense has skyrocketed.&#0160;</p>
<p>I therefore propose that the term &quot;geographical dyslexia&quot; be replaced by &quot;ligawan.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>From this moment on, there&#39;s a new order to the universe: to be hopelessly dysgeographical, hopelessly lost is now, officially, sexy.&#0160;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>The house was unoccupied for a month and the mice moved in, bigtime. I peanut-buttered some mouse traps and caught five or six adults. But I&#39;m not finished with the mice; there&#39;s some compelling evidence that an occasional mouse is still attempting to share my food. Meanwhile, the lawn and garden are dotted with mole-holes. The moles are harder to deal with than mice, but they stay outside, so they&#39;re less offensive. In the compost pile, chipmunks are at work, but I don&#39;t begrudge them their scraps of vegetables. I&#39;m more worried about the groundhogs, who can strip a flourishing garden in an evening. I&#39;ve patrolled the places in which they&#39;ve installed themselves in the past, and, so far, there are no signs that they&#39;ve returned. One of these years, though -- the garden is a tempting target. But the big news is the beavers. When we arrived, two weeks ago Friday, the pond was up a good eighteen inches. It was also stagnant and there was a huge heap of mud and sticks where the water should have been flowing out rapidly. I tore out some of the material and produced a little Niagara&#0160; --&#0160; a couple of acre-feet of water leaving us in a hour. But by Saturday morning the dam had been re-built and the water was up again. I got out the shovel and hoe and totally dismantled the dam. I must have sent several hundred pounds of mud and a big pile of twigs and branches downstream. Sunday morning I made my inspection: no repairs. This meant one of two things: either the beavers had moved on, or they don&#39;t work Sundays. But it&#39;s now two weeks, and they haven&#39;t returned, so I&#39;m declaring victory in the rodent wars.&#0160;</p>
<p>This morning I found some suspicious stuff that looks like bat-droppings in one of the shed rooms. Are bats rodents?</p>
<p>The north American beaver, <em>Castor canadensis</em>, is a formidable creature -- males characteristically weigh 60 pounds and a big one can reach a hundred. But the extinct local beaver was 5 to 6 times larger --bear size. It&#39;s a good thing I didn&#39;t have to use shovel and hoe on the dam of one of those babies. I wouldn&#39;t want to get on the bad side of a four hundred pound rodent --even if it were a vegetarian.</p>
<p>July 5.&#0160; Sarah (see comments below) asks:&#0160; what&#39;s the problem with beavers. Well, they render the pond unusable, for one. No more grandchildren peacefully paddling. Because they create a new dike which water flows through, not over, algae, twigs, and scum of all sorts accumulates, rots, and sinks to the bottom.&#0160; The size of the pond expands very rapidly as the beavers move to create a suitably large habitat -- so the fields become flooded.&#0160; The beavers cut down all the trees that I&#39;ve been carefully cultivating.&#0160; In a few months, the land will be totally transformed.</p>
<p>I&#39;m hoping that the beavers find a new home on someone else&#39;s land. I didn&#39;t want to trap or kill them, but I&#39;m certainly happy that I was able to discourage them from taking up permanent residence.&#0160;</p>

                                <p>We&#39;ve named our GPS navigatrix, &#0160;who gives instruction with a schoolmarmish London accent, Dorcas (which is, along with Prunella, one of my very favorite English given -- or as they call them,&quot;Christian&quot;-- names).&#0160; Dorcas has proved to be, on the whole, a reliable friend. She had a little trouble in Cincinnati, where, it turns out, there are two entirely distinct 225 Hill Terrace addresses. She took us to the wrong one -- but I confess that in this case the error can fairly be traced to information-inputter, Dr. M. himself.</p>
<p>Dorcas also had a royal hissy fit when we had to detour onto a single-lane-on-the-other-side-of the-road somewhere in Ohio -- she &quot;recalculated&quot; twenty or thirty times, until I had to temporarily stop her mouth. &#0160; It could only be my imagination, but I thought I detected a trace of exasperation in her tone of voice.&#0160;</p>
<p>Despite these failings, the Dorcster is a dream at finding her way around unfamiliar towns. No longer will I have to stop at gas stations for incomprehensible advice about how to get back on the highway.&#0160; I just call on Dorcas and I&#39;ve got a friend, oh yeah, I&#39;ve got a friend.&#0160; &#0160;</p>

                                <p>Regular readers of this blague will remember that Dr. M. has long ago <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2006/09/geographical_dy.html">confessed</a> that he suffers from a serious case of &quot;directional disability,&quot; or as some call it, &quot;geographical dyslexia&quot; -- which means that he regularly loses his way, is subject to travel-based panic attacks, and is consequently abused by friends and family who refuse to recognize that he&#39;s not stupid, just utterly lost.&#0160;</p>
<p>Advanced technology rides to my rescue. I now own a mobile navigator. It affixes to the windshield of the car, and, using signals bounced off three or four satellites, instructs me how to get from point A to point B. I&#39;ve fallen profoundly in love with the disembodied female British voice who doesn&#39;t criticize me when I make a wrong turn: she just says, very politely, &quot;recalculating.&quot;&#0160; Then she says, &quot;drive point five miles and turn left.&quot;&#0160; What a boon to the chronically lost! I now drive as accurately as a migrating bird. My only reservation: I think that my friend should congratulate me when I get to where I&#39;m going. She should show a little enthusiasm. But all she says is &quot;arriving at destination, on left.&quot; What would it hurt her to offer congratulations?&#0160; I&#39;m not asking for a commitment or for flowers.</p>
<p>The navigator has now moved into first place among my prostheses, supplanting the <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2006/09/my_new_tooth.html">incisor.</a>&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;</p>

                                <p>Last October, I decided that one of my herbaceous peonies -- a Prairie Moon, to be precise -- needed to be separated and re-planted. I did the deed, but a few days ago, while cleaning the garden, I found a small, overlooked fragment of a tuber -- six inches in length and no more than half the diameter of a finger -- lying on the ground entirely exposed to the elements. I missed it last autumn, I guess.&#0160; But the good news: while there was no sign of rooting, there was a bud -- and the bud was swelling with new life.&#0160; (It had been a wicked winter, with temperatures down to 10F.)&#0160;</p>
<p>Peony-growers know that it&#39;s important not to plant the roots too deep in the soil. The experts say two inches at the most. My experience is that in our Colorado clay, two inches can be too much, and that peonies so planted may come up spindly and flowerless. But now I know that it&#39;s safe to err on the shallow side.&#0160; Herbaceous peonies are tougher than I imagined -- pretty much impervious to cold.&#0160; Or at least such is the case with this particular variety.</p>
<p>Friends, I can&#39;t tell you how much I admire that tenacious little cylinder of life.&#0160; It&#39;s toughness is inspiring.&#0160; I&#39;ve prepared a burrow for it -- the best in the way of soil and situation that I can offer. Let&#39;s see what it makes of its new opportunity. It&#39;s spring;&#0160; I&#39;m optimistic.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>A Venusian day, strange to say, is longer than a Venusian year. How can such an apparent paradox be allowed? &#0160;It&#39;s easy: Venus rotates on its axis once every 243 earth-days, but it revolves around the sun in 225 earth-days. How appallingly counter-intuitive!&#0160; If I had any gift at all for thinking in the abstract, I&#39;m sure that I wouldn&#39;t find the idea that a day can be longer than a year so disorienting. But I do;&#0160; for me, the word &quot;day&quot; has a metaphorical as well as a scientific dimension: &quot;days&quot; are short, &quot;years&quot; are long.&#0160; I&#39;m consoled by thinking that my counterpart, a philosophically-handicapped Venusian visiting the earth, would find our speedy days and our disproportionately long year quite incredible. On Venus, the lazy old sun takes 116 days to rise in the west and set in the east (Venus, ever the contrarian, rotates, so to speak, &quot;backwards&quot;).&#0160; So much for Ovid&#39;s swift horses; on Venus, they&#39;re all glue and molasses, their forward progress barely perceptible.&#0160; There&#39;s a mythological corollary that might please the poets. Randy Jupiter would be happy on Venus: the venereal night is truly a <em>megala nux.</em></p>
<p>I suppose that the example of Venus teaches us that days and years are not things but concepts. For me, this is a hard lesson. I recognize that it&#39;s earthocentric to measure the long Venusian day in terms of earth-days, but I can&#39;t seem to reason my way around doing so -- the only day that I&#39;ve ever experienced is 24 hours long and the only year with which I&#39;m familiar has 365 and a bit days. It&#39;s alarming to realize how short-sighted it is to assume that a day, a month, a year, tied in, as they are, to astronomical reality are natural, when, in fact, they&#39;re only artifacts of our earthly orbit.</p>
<p>Other measurements of time are less &quot;natural&quot; and therefore even more troublesome.&#0160; How entirely arbitrary to divide the day into 24 parts!&#0160; Since everything else is going metric, why shouldn&#39;t we divide the day into ten or a hundred parts -- decidays or centidays? &#0160;And minutes and seconds -- why sixty of them, when decihours and centihours makes so much more sense? &#0160;(The ancients, incidentally, struggled mightily with hours -- read all about it <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2005/11/the_clocks_of_r.html">here.</a>)&#0160; And the week?&#0160; No natural reason at all for the week. The Romans, as is well known, were weekless.</p>
<p>Venus, having no moons, has no months. Mars has two moons -- would a Martian calendar, if there were such a thing, have had months, or demi-months, or monthettes, or what?</p>
<p>When I was a boy, I was a diligent if uncritical reader of science fiction.&#0160; In those days, it was not uncommon for entire fanciful Venusian civilizations to rise, peak, and fall and the course of a novel. But in the 1950s, almost no data was available to us about the mysterious planet. Now, I&#39;m afraid, the glamour is long gone. The surface temperature of Venus averages 869F, the atmospheric pressure is 90 times that of the earth, the atmosphere is 97 per cent carbon dioxide and contains no oxygen, and the pretty swirling clouds are entirely composed of hot, concentrated sulfuric acid. It&#39;s hardly a place in which an advanced culture would be likely to thrive nor a place from which we would expect much in the way of sophisticated calendrical theory.&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;</p>

                                <p>Once upon a time I had a foolproof system for clearing a bedroom of mosquitoes.&#0160; Close the door, turn on a light, stick the left arm out of the bedclothes, keep track of the mosquitoes by their whine, and then, as soon as one lands on the exposed skin, smack it with the right hand.&#0160; After a few minutes, turn out the light, sleep tight. Used to work wonders.</p>
<p>The system doesn&#39;t work any more?&#0160; Why?&#0160; Because my antiquated ears no longer register high-pitched sounds. I can&#39;t hear mosquitoes until one of them pecks on my eardrum.&#0160; I&#39;m vulnerable to sneak attack.&#0160;</p>
<p>It&#39;s bad: all mosquitoes are now stealth mosquitoes. It&#39;s good: I&#39;ll never again be troubled by that nasty whine.&#0160;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Sexnews from the mosquitosphere: &quot;if larvae of <em>Aedes stimulans</em> are raised at 75F, about half become males and half become females. But if they are raised at 84F, only 9F higher, they all become almost complete females.&quot;&#0160; Almost complete females?&#0160; What&#39;s the meaning of &quot;almost complete?&quot;&#0160; Either they&#39;re male, or they&#39;re female.&#0160; Doesn&#39;t the good book say that &quot;male and female created he them?&quot;</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the surprising scoop. &quot;Larvae that would have become males lack the big bushy antennae of the normal male and have mouth parts and external genitalia that are indistinguishable from those of a &quot;real&quot; female. Furthermore, &quot;feminized&quot; males have no testicles or other internal male organs of reproduction, but they do have ovaries and other internal female organs of reproduction. Some feminized males have even mated with normal males and been inseminated, but they laid no eggs.&quot;</p>
<p>All this mosquito sex science comes from entomologist Gilbert Waldbauer, author of <em>A Walk Around the Pond (</em>Cambridge [Harvard], 2006).</p>
<p>Professor Waldbauer claims to love his insects but he is unmoved by the plight of the 84F feminized males. Can there be sadder words in <em>Aedes </em>households all over the warming earth than &quot;they laid no eggs?&quot;&#0160; It&#39;s poignant, perhaps even tragic.</p>
<p>How do the mosquitoes themselves feel about attenuated antennae and awkward genitalia?&#0160; If Waldbauer had looked with a more compassionate eye, he would have noticed that &quot;normal&quot; males of the 75F variety wave their big bushy antennae and point and laugh at the feeble mini-antennae of the wannabe females. He would also have noticed that wannabe females are stigmatized and often depressed because they are so frequently picked on by &quot;normal&quot; males, who regularly direct loud, scornful, threatening whines at the antennae-impaired.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a crisis of values in mosquitoland. Many &quot;normal&quot; males are fundamentally convinced that the wannabes have made a conscious choice to mimic females and that water temperature has absolutely nothing to do with it. Some among the &quot;normal&quot; males -- the more enlightened -- propose that with the right kind of counseling and prayer, the mimics can be reclaimed. But other &quot;normal&quot; males hate, simply hate, the males who consort with the feminized wannabes. They condemn as unnatural all intercourse between the normal and the feminized, and they proclaim the actual act of insemination to be the work of the devil.</p>
<p>I myself wonder why the &quot;normal&quot; males get themselves into such a twist.&#0160; I&#39;m tempted to think that they protest too much -- that they themselves secretly lust after the feminized males.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll ask the expert, Professor Waldbauer. If he doesn&#39;t know, I&#39;ll get a second opinion. Perhaps the Rev. Ted Haggard would like to share his insights.&#0160; &#0160;</p>

                                <p>In my Vermont garden, I grow a number of different varieties of German (also called bearded) irises. One variety -- a bicolor I inherited a decade ago from my sister-- had died. I put a spade into the ground to see if I could discover the source of the problem, and I found that the rhizomes had deteriorated to a loathsome smelly unholy mess the consistency of overripe bananas. It was a truly disgusting situation and one that I had never encountered before. For the sake of garden sanitation, I dug out the decay and some surrounding soil and carried the filth to the local dump.&#0160;</p>
<p>Later in the summer, I read this sentence in a garden book: &quot;we cannot confirm the folk wisdom that bacterial soft rot in irises can be caused by horse manure.&quot;&#0160; I knew that rot in iris rhizomes could be spread by iris borers, but these irises were borer-free. On the other hand, I had been working the soil with load after generous load of horse manure. So perhaps there&#39;s some truth to the derided superstition. In any case, since I switched to fertilizing irises with the abundant droppings of sheep I haven&#39;t had a recurrence of the disease. But then again, I haven&#39;t been able to re-test the particular susceptible variety--it being an iris now extinct in my garden.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>The pond, once brimful of brekkekkek-kexing, has become virtually silent. What&#39;s happened to all the frogs?&#0160; Is it acid rain?&#0160; Or is it the great blue herons who patrol the shoreline morning and evening?</p>
<p>I think we&#39;ve located the culprit. The pond has been colonized by catfish, specifically, by the brown bullhead or horned pout. &#0160;Omnivores that they are, the pouts must have been dining on those gelatinous strings of frog eggs, or perhaps even hunting down the tadpoles. At least that&#39;s the theory.</p>
<p>To reproduce, pouts scoop out a nest near the shoreline and deposit a cluster of eggs. Then they hover nearby for a week or so, fanning the area with their tails.&#0160; One pair made a nest just where we enter the pond to swim and they were guarding their clutch a little too aggressively, so I decided to take action. There I was, spade in hand and poised to strike. I felt as though I was a figure in a diorama at the natural history museum -- &quot;Paleolithic Man Hunted Fish with Sharpened Sticks.&quot;&#0160; My technique might have been primitiive, but nevertheless I managed to nail one of the ugly suckers -- a twelve inch guy with a flat face covered with nasty barbels -- and a few minutes later I planted him in the vegetable garden, where he&#39;s now recycling himself into tomatoes. Later in the summer, a guest caught a second pout with a net.&#0160; More juicy red tomatoes.</p>
<p>But what about the hatchlings and fingerlings?&#0160; Perhaps the herons are on our side.&#0160; Meanwhile, we&#39;ll put out a call for a fisherman. Although horned pouts are hideous, they&#39;re reputed to be good table fare -- not my table, however.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>We&#39;re looking forward to a froggy renaissance.</p>
<p><em>September 5</em>.&#0160; I&#39;ve now read in <em>Scientific American </em>that herons kill and eat catfish. They spear them with their long beaks, carry them to dry ground, and repeatedly wound them. Then they swallow them whole. So when the herons come to visit the pond, we&#39;ll have to maintain both distance and silence and let them work. It&#39;s good to know that the great blues are our allies.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>A few weeks ago, I <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2006/04/lions.html">noted</a> that in <em>The Songlines</em>, Bruce Chatwin made the case that early humans were prey more than they were predators. Now I&#39;ve read a new book on the subject: Donna Hart and Robert W. Sussman, <em>Man the Hunted </em>(Westview, 2005).</p>
<p>The book&#39;s title is a bit misleading because it concentrates on primates other than modern man. Nevertheless, it was good to be reminded of the circumstances under which our hominid ancestors lived. Seven million years ago and until recently, our diminutive forbears were forest dwellers who were pursued by huge crocodilians, outsized eagles, packs of hunting dogs, a variety of giant cats, and hyenas the size of modern lions who had jaws strong enough to crunch human skulls in a single bite.</p>
<p>And also man-eating snakes. In the course of their discussion of snakes, the authors of <em>Man the Hunted </em>report on the instructions provided to early missionaries to Africa on the proper response to pythons. (A 25-foot-long reticulated python can weigh up to 300 pounds.)</p>
<p><span style="color: #3333ff;">Remember not to run away; the python can run faster. The thing to do is to lie flat on the ground on your back with your feet together, arms to the sides and head well down. The python will then try to push its head under you, experimenting at every possible point. Ke<em>ep calm</em>, one wiggle and he will get under you, wrap his coils round you and crush you to death. After a time the python will get tired of this and will probably decide to swallow you without the usual preliminaries. He will very likely begin with one of your feet<em>. Keep calm</em>. You must let him swallow your foot. It is quite painless and will take a long time. If you lose your head and struggle he will quickly whip his coils around you. If <em>you keep calm</em>, he will go on swallowing. Wait patiently until he has swallowed about up to your knee. Then carefully take out your knife and insert it into the distended side of his mouth and with a quick rip slit him up. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Well-meant advice, I&#39;m sure, but perhaps difficult to follow. Suppose you&#39;re just not in the mood to allow the python such liberties with your person. Suppose you&#39;ve forgotten to bring your knife; suppose the python decides to start with your head rather than a foot. Suppose you involuntarily wiggle just a teensy bit. Suppose you just don&#39;t feel that it&#39;s a good day to be engulfed.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">I think that, on the whole, running away and screaming at the top of your lungs is a more sensible reaction. But then again, I never signed up to be a missionary.</span></p>

                                <p>According to <em>The New York Times</em> (3/31/2006), the world of prayer science is all in a dither. A new study has apparently demonstrated that &quot;prayers offered by strangers had no effect on the recovery of people who were undergoing heart surgery.&quot; The study was a big, expensive deal: ten years of work at a cost of $2.4 million (contributed by the ever-zealous Templeton Foundation, a powerful supporter of prayer research). The details are utterly and weirdly fascinating. &quot;Researchers monitored 1802 patients at six hospitals who received coronary bypass surgery. The patients were broken into three groups. Two were prayed for; the third was not. Half of the patients who received the prayers were told that they were being prayed for; half were told that they might or might not receive prayers. The researchers asked the members of three congregations -- St. Paul&#39;s Monastery in St. Paul; the Community of Teresian Carmelites in Worcester, Mass.; and Silent Unity, a Missouri prayer ministry near Kansas City -- to deliver the prayers, using the patients&#39; first names and the first initials of their last names. The congregations were told that they could pray in their own way, but they were instructed to include the phrase &quot;for a successful surgery with a quick, healthy recovery and no complications.&#39;&quot; The shocking result: &quot;researchers found no difference between those patients who were prayed for and those who were not.&quot; Prayer, it would appear (or intercessory prayer as this variety is called), does not change things.&#0160;</p>
<p>I admire the dedicated men and women of science who put heart and soul into this project, but with all due respect, I must question both their conclusions and their protocols. For starters, the inference that prayer doesn&#39;t work is far too broad. Inasmuch as the scientists engaged only Christians to pray, all that they proved was that Christian prayer doesn&#39;t work. It&#39;s marvelously ethnocentric to suggest that just because Christians tanked, other religions could not succeed. It was Bailey Smith, the President of the Southern Baptist Convention, who authoritatively proclaimed that &quot;God does not hear the prayer of a Jew.&quot; And yet, in a stunning theological upset, the scientific evidence now proves that God Almighty does not hear the prayers of Christians. But such a conclusion is itself far too hyperbolic. In actual fact, all that the study established is that God did not hear the prayers of three particular groups of prayer-providers. It&#39;s certainly a black mark against the Teresian Carmelites and their friends, and it will be a cold day in hell before they see another Templeton prayer contract, but there&#39;s nothing to say that Southern Baptists, even Bailey Smith himself, with his private line to the Almighty, might not have had more sway with the Great Jehovah.</p>
<p>If the researchers had not been so blindly and thoughtlessly ethnocentric, they might have solicited the prayers of people of various faiths, especially those praying to different gods. Or even better: they might have assembled disparate groups of prayer providers. In one set, for example, there would be a Catholic, a Jehovah&#39;s Witness, and a Hindu; in another, a Muslim, a Wiccan, and a Methodist; in a third, a Scientologist, a Baptist, and a Muggletonian. Although the number of possible permutations is intimidating, the cause is noble: to determine impartially which of these groups can best cut the prayer mustard. It&#39;s wrong to put the entire burden on Christians. Scientists need to mix and match the various religions so that they can discover the most effective synergistic combination, or as it might better be called, the appropriate prayer cocktail.</p>
<p>In addition, the study is guilty of flagrant mishandling of dosage. There was simply no control over the amount of prayer that was administered. Just as traditional medicines come in cubic centimeters, prayer comes in units of time. Let&#39;s say that one person praying for one minute yields one prayer unit.&#0160; Pending further study, there&#39;s no way to establish exactly how many prayer units a heart patient might need. For a bypass, fifty prayer units might be a minimum dosage, but perhaps twice or three times as many units might be necessary to alleviate the symptoms of a hallucinator of witches, extraterrestrials, or other supernatural beings. It&#39;s entirely possible that the prayers in this study failed simply because they didn&#39;t meet a minimum prayer-unit threshold. Moreover, it&#39;s important not to over-prescribe. For all we know, excessive prayer might precipitate iatrogenic illnesses. And it&#39;s also a question of efficiency: once an optimum dosage can be established, prayer providers can go about their business and not waste their time generating superfluous and expensive prayer units.</p>
<p>Moreover, prayer scientists seem to have given no serious consideration to the group power of prayer providers. Given the present abysmal state of prayer science, it&#39;s still unknown whether prayers are more effective when delivered by just one or a very few providers, or in large choruses. Jews seem to think that a <em>minyan</em>, or quorum, is ten, but hard science has not confirmed this number. It&#39;s therefore imperative to experiment with different size groups in order to establish a proper medical-<em>minyan.</em> This is not easy, or inexpensive, but it&#39;s essential.&#0160; It would indeed be unfortunate if it turns out that a thousand prayer providers are necessary to improve the condition of just one bypass patient, but good golly, the Ancient of Days works in mysterious ways, and it&#39;s not for us to question His prayer needs.</p>
<p>There are some other areas in which more scientific rigor is required. A)&#0160; different diseases: just because prayer didn&#39;t work for bypasses doesn&#39;t mean it won&#39;t work for scrofula. Perhaps some diseases are more prayer-responsive than others. B) fervor: prayer science has made the naive error of assuming that all prayer providers are equal. Yet the unalterable laws of random distribution determine that some people will pray more effectively than others. In point of fact, it&#39;s entirely likely that some prayer providers will be more effective with one disease than another. If I were a patient, I&#39;d be mighty bent out of shape (and might even seek legal recourse) if I were assigned a prayer provider who had a proven track record with ulcers but who amounted to zilch for my hip replacement.&#0160; C) identification: prayer providers were given only the first name and initial of their prayee. But &quot;Bob S.&quot; is entirely too vague-- there might be hundreds of &quot;Bob S&quot;&#39;s all over the world undergoing bypass surgery at any given time. How the blue blazes is the Lord of Hosts supposed to know which particular &quot;Bob S&quot; is meant?&#0160; Fortunately, there&#39;s an easy solution to this problem. Prayer providers should continue to pray for Bob S., but just remember to add the last four digits of his social security or major credit card number.&#0160;</p>
<p>I&#39;m not the only person disappointed with this study. According to the <em>Times</em>, &quot;Bob Barth, the spiritual director of Silent Unity, the Missouri prayer ministry, said the findings would not affect the ministry&#39;s mission. &#39;A person of faith would say that this study is interesting,&#39; Mr Barth said, &#39;but we&#39;ve been praying a long time and we&#39;ve seen prayer work, we know it works, and the research on prayer and spirituality is just getting started.&#39;&quot;&#0160; Bob B&#39;s assertion that &quot;prayer works&quot; is anecdotal thinking and has absolutely no merit whatsoever, but I can&#39;t imagine a single person who wouldn&#39;t agree with him that prayer science is &quot;just getting started&quot;-- and also that it has a long bumpy road to travel. Fortunately, the Bush administration invested over $2 million of our tax revenues in prayer research, with more in the pipeline, so some revolutionary breakthroughs in the spiritual sciences soon might be achieved.&#0160; We&#39;ll be waiting.</p>
