                                <p>I would not want to be reincarnated as a turtle. Not at all.</p>
<p>Should it happen that I were to be reincarnated, I would prefer to return as one of those great sea birds -- the Wandering Albatross or the Great Frigatebird&#0160; or the Northern Fulmar -- that cruise for hundreds of miles over the Pacific -- soaring effortlessly, joyriding the thermals, blissfully savoring the salt spray at dawn and dusk. It would be glorious -- although not entirely without a downside, because if I were such a bird I would have to sustain myself on a repulsive sushi diet of raw fish. Yeesh.</p>
<p>But to live the next or a subsequent life as a turtle -- what a grim unpleasant prospect! Turtles do not soar; they&#39;re earthbound, and they move so slowly that they&#39;re almost immobile. At very best, they slog or plod. It&#39;s not that they&#39;re unsuccessful in their own way; after all, they&#39;ve been around for 200 million years. Generations, therefore, have plod, have plod, have plod. But is there a creature on earth whose bodily configuration is more limiting, more dictatorial? Turtles spend a lifetime schlepping carapace and plastron up and down hills or over the desert sands. How can an animal constrained to eternally lug an outsize ponderous shell experience any kind of freedom or joy?&#0160;</p>
<p>Besides, turtles are ridiculously ugly.&#0160;</p>

No ears, none at all. Foolish, fatuous expression. The only part of the turtle that might be considered attractive is the carapace (when it&#39;s not coated with slimy vegetation or studded with leeches), but in the entire history of the planet, no turtle has ever been able to admire its own integument.&#0160;</div>
<div class="VQW0y Jl9NH">&#0160;</div>
<div class="VQW0y Jl9NH">Imagine being reincarnated as a creature so imperfectly designed that it can&#39;t regain its legs when tipped onto its back. If I were a turtle, I would hate that. Legs flailing in the air. Undignified. Double yeesh.</div>
<div class="VQW0y Jl9NH">&#0160;</div>
<div class="VQW0y Jl9NH">Plus, many turtles eat worms.</div>
<div class="VQW0y Jl9NH">
<div class="VQW0y Jl9NH">&#0160;</div>
<div class="VQW0y Jl9NH">Moreover, if I or someone dear to me were to become a turtle -- it&#39;s going to be a long haul, reincarnation-wise. Let&#39;s say, for example, that you were to be born again as a dung beetle -- why, you would endure a very unsavory couple of months, but then -- on you would go to the next life. Once reincarnated as a turtle, however, you&#39;re liable to be stuck in that ungainly shell for a century. And worse still -- some turtles &quot;brumate&quot; for half their lives. That&#39;s a heck of a lot of time to spend in a state of suspended animation. In addition -- and this is rather shocking -- some turtles extract oxygen from water through their &quot;cloaca.&quot; I can&#39;t imagine how they do that, and, frankly, &quot;&#39;twere to consider too curiously to consider so.&quot; Not to mention turtle sex. Do turtles cuddle or snuggle? It must be quite an accomplishment to work around those massive clanking&#0160; shells.&#0160;</div>
<div class="VQW0y Jl9NH">&#0160;</div>
<div class="VQW0y Jl9NH">So no turtle reincarnation for me. But to tell truth, I find reincarnation itself, like most religious or quasi-religious ideas, utterly baffling. I presume it works something like this. I die, my soul is released from my corpse and immediately enters into a new body -- in this case a newly fertilized turtle egg. (I have no idea how this process works -- but let&#39;s all agree that it does). Immediately, there&#39;s a glitch. Turtle gender is not determined in the usual way, by XX and XY genes. Turtle gender is a consequence of the temperature at which the embryos develop inside the eggshell. Warm, male; cool, female (or vice versa in some species). What this means is that if my soul was infused or assimilated or injected into a turtle egg, it would not be immediately known whether I was going to be a boy turtle or a girl turtle. I don&#39;t really care, frankly; there&#39;s not much advantage to being one or the other. Turtles are not particularly sexually dimorphic and both genders are equally hideous. But I would like to know right away and not have to wait on some quirk of the weather.&#0160;</div>
<div class="VQW0y Jl9NH">&#0160;</div>
<div class="VQW0y Jl9NH">Reincarnation puzzles me for still another reason. How can I be sure that I haven&#39;t already been reincarnated? Perhaps I was a turtle (or an albatross) in a past life. I don&#39;t remember being other than I am, but how can I be certain?&#0160;</div>
<div class="VQW0y Jl9NH">&#0160;</div>
<div class="VQW0y Jl9NH">Or, to switch points of view, perhaps one of the turtles pictured above was once, let us imagine, Ragnar Naess (1900-1972), a bachelor sorghum farmer from O&#39;Neill, Nebraska. Or even one of my less brainy former colleagues. How could we determine it; how could the turtle know it? If it&#39;s undeterminable, why does it matter?</div>
<div class="VQW0y Jl9NH">&#0160;</div>
<div class="VQW0y Jl9NH">Gosh, reincarnation is a tough nut to crack.</div>
<div class="VQW0y Jl9NH">&#0160;</div>
<div class="VQW0y Jl9NH">[December 15, 2022. Pearl Maneli writes: &quot;I believe current reincarnation theory explains that your soul wouldn&#39;t transmigrate into a turtle at the moment of conception; it would do so only when the turtle hatches from the egg. So you can let your mind rest easy on the question of your turtle gender.&quot;]</div>
<div class="VQW0y Jl9NH">&#0160;</div>
<div class="VQW0y Jl9NH">[December 16. Vivian de St. Vrain responds: &quot;Thanks, Pearl. I am much relieved&quot;]</div>

                                <p>Young &#39;uns, I don&#39;t know that you entirely grasp the glamor and mystery of maturity (which in some jaded circles is called &quot;old age.&quot;)&#0160; Let me tell you, the <br />golden years are just chockablock full of sensual romance of a kind that you might not now appreciate.&#0160;</p>
<p>Just the other day, for example, we were both instructed to make another visit to the phlebotomist (it seems hardly a month goes by that some specialist or other doesn&#39;t need to inspect a sample of our personal sanguineous fluids).&#0160;</p>
<p>Being economical people, we scheduled our appointments for the same time, same place.</p>
<p>Her blood draw was in anticipation of a knee replacement; mine for routine monitoring of my half-a-dozen annoying senior conditions.</p>
<p>So there we were, side by side, in adjacent cubicles, stripping our sleeves for the venipuncture.</p>
<p>I ask you, is there anything on earth more romantic than a senior couple experiencing simultaneous blood draws. Rapture, rapture! Joy and jollity!</p>
<p>In a merrier world, the instant of venipuncture would have been accompanied with an orchestra of swelling music, perhaps Brahms. And there would have been candles; next time this happens, we&#39;ll surround ourselves with a whole Liberace of candelabras. Dozens of long stem red roses. Beakers of Veuve Cliquot &#39;42.&#0160; An applauding audience of family and friends.&#0160;</p>
<p>It would have been even more thrilling if my technician hadn&#39;t taken three tries to hit the mark. &quot;Your vein rolled,&quot; she said accusingly, compromising ever so slightly the transcendent moment.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been six years since Dr. Metablog (aka Vivian de St. Vrain, aka The Modern Nostradamus) issued a set of predictions. His last collection, from 2016, earned a score of 100% correct, when every single one of his dazzling glimpses into futurity proved to be exactly accurate. An astonishing performance!!&#0160; Which is why The Modern Nostradamus once again won the Lifetime Platinum Award from the International Prophecy Society. Now, after a brief but pregnant retirement, Dr M returns to the prophecy lists and offers the following. Read and be dazzled, fit audience though few. Here&#39;s what&#39;s going to happen!</p>
<p>1)&#0160;&#0160; there will be unusual weather patterns in North America;</p>
<p>2)&#0160; &#0160;there will be a forest fire in one or more western American states;&#0160;</p>
<p>3)&#0160; &#0160;a famous Hollywood actress will sue for divorce; moreover, another (or possibly the same) star will become pregnant; another (or possibly the same) actress will gain or lose a great deal of weight;&#0160;</p>
<p>4)&#0160; &#0160;a politician will be accused of dishonesty;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>5)&#0160; &#0160;there will be either a monsoon, an airplane crash, or a capsized ferry in Asia;</p>
<p>6)&#0160; &#0160;there will be fluctuations in the stock market;</p>
<p>7)&#0160; there will be turmoil in the Middle East;</p>
<p>8)&#0160; a religious leader will be involved in either a financial or a sex scandal.&#0160; Or perhaps both;</p>
<p>9)&#0160; Mitch McConnell will continue to be a colossal asshole.&#0160;</p>
<p>You read it here first. Loyal readers: check back at the end of the year.&#0160; Let&#39;s see whether a senior but world-class professional augur still has enough on the oracle ball to foretell the future one more time.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>A few weeks ago, I found myself absentmindedly working in the perennial garden. I had wandered nearby and noted some weeds that needed emergency extirpation. I had therefore arrived without my usual trine of implements -- the dandelion puller, the hand shovel, and the Felco #2. Too lazy to fetch them, I began to tend to the plants toollessly and at the same time to muse upon effectiveness of hands alone. (Weeding often leads to musing, as every weeder knows.)&#0160; Is it not the case that the best tool of all is the human hand?&#0160; Because my garden soil is so friable, I was able to dig into the earth with my unaided index finger, grasp the roots of weeds and pull them. I wondered how the hand had come to so sensitive to small changes in soil temperature or soil moisture. Sensitive also, to the texture of things, so that I could identify the roots of witch grass, and remove them, while leaving untouched the very similar but different roots of the day lilies. For no good reason, my wayward mind wandered to the Houyhnhnms whom Gulliver outrageously claimed could grasp a needle between fetlock and pastern in order to sew garments. Amusing but impossible. The hooves of horses are wonderfully evolved for galloping but not for tatting or crocheting. Besides, why would a horse want to darn a sock?&#0160;</p>
<p>Our hands are superior implements&#0160; There&#39;s not another animal on the planet that can tie its own shoelaces.&#0160;</p>
<p>I&#39;ve just read a fascinating book by paleontologist Madelaine Bohme called<em> Ancient Bones</em>. Bohme is concerned to argue that the &quot;out of Africa&quot; hypothesis needs modification. I am not knowledgeable enough to accept or deny her thesis, but I much appreciate her effort to bring me up to date about the evolution of our species, which is much more complicated -- infinitely more complicated -- than the story we were told just a generation ago.</p>
<p>Bohme includes a couple of speculative pages about the evolution of the hand. First came bipedalism, freeing the hands for a variety of new tasks. Bohme thinks that the development of stone tools and the development of hands went, so to speak, hand in hand. The need to hold the tool meant that the hand evolved to hold it properly -- with an opposable thumb of course. More sensitive fingers conferred an evolutionary advantage. More information from the fingers caused the somatosensory cortex, which controls the hands, to enlarge and process more sensations.</p>
<p>So now we can play the piano, thread a needle, throw a ball, type a letter, weed a garden, and perform a thousand other tasks that even chimpanzees, who apparently do not have great sensory input from their fingers, cannot do.</p>
<p>Bohme does not discuss the role of hands in human communication, either everyday or erotic.&#0160; A topic for another book, perhaps.</p>

                                <p>Among my circle of friends, it is a shameful thing to be called &quot;house proud.&quot; It&#39;s a term to be avoided, even shunned. It&#39;s competitive and flaunts the wrong values. Conspicuous consumption. Vanity. &quot;I own a bigger house than you, and therefore I&#39;m a better person than you.&quot;&#0160; &quot;House pride&quot; is a very badddd feeling of the human heart. So therefore I was astonished when I opened a new edition of <em>Luxury Home Magazine</em> (which should be called <em>Conspicuous Consumption Quarterly</em>) to discover that in this publication shameless vanity is now not implied, hinted at, or disguised, but flaunted. The magazine&#39;s reiterated theme: &quot;Make your friends envy your trophy home.&quot; It says so in so many words!&#0160; Gasp!</p>
<p>And indeed, from the pictures and descriptions of these homes, it&#39;s clear that the advertised trophies are not designed o live in, but rather to let their owners wow their friends and demonstrate how wealthy (and wasteful) they can be.</p>
<p>Does anyone actually require a 15,000 square feet house with three kitchens, even if one of them is outdoors. &quot;Main kitchen boasts two islands, multiple refrigerators, freezers and sinks.&quot; And a wine cooler (in addition to the wine cellar). &quot;Five beds, eight baths, seven fireplaces?&quot; &quot;Massive vaulted ceilings with a towering three sided stone chimney?&quot; Also, a &quot;luxurious soaking tub, double-headed shower, and makeup vanity?&quot; Two &quot;indoor-outdoor pools?&quot; An elevator from the basement to the widow&#39;s walk?&#0160; &quot;Large tiered media room.&quot; Game room. Basketball court. A putting green. Five oversized garages with 20 foot windows?&#0160;</p>
<p>Also, &quot;breathability,&quot; whatever that is.</p>
<p>I&#39;m embarrassed that I&#39;m on the Luxury Homes&#39; mailing list and I&#39;m embarrassed, once again, to be a member of the species<em> homo sapiens</em>.</p>
<p>My advice to readers whose mouths water when they yearn for a trophy home: &quot;enough is as good as a feast.&quot;</p>

                                <p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef02788034f62d200d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Screen Shot 2021-06-19 at 5.37.12 AM" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef02788034f62d200d image-full img-responsive" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef02788034f62d200d-800wi" title="Screen Shot 2021-06-19 at 5.37.12 AM" /></a></p>
<p>It may not be immediately obvious or dramatic, but the large tree in the middle of the picture is a white birch. It towers over the red maple and the beeches that are to its left. White birches do not often attain such size, nor are they long-lived, at least in our part of the world. This particular white birch is old and imposing and thriving and healthy.&#0160;</p>
<p>Yet a few years ago this birch appeared to be at death&#39;s door. It sported only a handful of yellow leaves on its thin senescent crown.&#0160;</p>
<p>Inasmuch as it was an old tree (as measured in white-birch years) we all assumed that it had come to the end of its natural days. There was a vigorous family debate on whether it should be submitted to the chain saw before it fell over -- perhaps dangerously -- of its own accord. The consensus was to give it another year. It was a good decision -- as can be plainly seen.</p>
<p>I have no idea why the birch sprang from its hospital bed. Was it a victim of some nameless illness that it had overcome? Had it been merely listless and depressed? Had its local environment altered?&#0160; Perhaps some noxious insect pest had arrived, gone for a kill, failed,&#0160; and then decamped. I have no theory -- it&#39;s a total mystery, as is so much in life. Nevertheless, I&#39;m happy to welcome the birch back into our community. May it have many more happy years.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, just steps away, was a young vigorous yellow birch. Yellow birches are not as striking or famous as their white-barked cousins, but to my mind they are by far the better tree. They are, at least in our neck of the woods, larger, better shaped, longer-lived, and their wood is superior for either furniture or flooring or fuel. Their bark is a splendid glistening yellow gold. A tree to prize.</p>
<p>But, alas, not this particular yellow birch. Last summer it was a burgeoning adolescent, adding more than 18 inches of growth a season. This year, I&#39;m sorry to report, dead as a doornail.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef0282e10a2d56200b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Screen Shot 2021-06-21 at 9.14.47 AM" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef0282e10a2d56200b img-responsive" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef0282e10a2d56200b-800wi" title="Screen Shot 2021-06-21 at 9.14.47 AM" /></a></p>
<p>Not a single leaf. Not the slightest sign of life. This is an ex tree.</p>
<p>The yellow birch was in a perfect position and was one that I had counted on to live for at least a hundred years, perhaps two hundred.&#0160; A tree that should have lasted centuries and been an ornament to the property and a delight to grandchildren and great-grandchildren -- under whose spreading boughs picnics and&#0160; other rural pleasures would have been enacted far into the future.</p>
<p>But that&#39;s the inconstancy of life on earth. One tree, supposedly a short-lived one, springs to life while another, with a grand future, suddenly and inexplicably succumbs to the fate that awaits us all.</p>
<p>Mutability, they used to call it. Precarious, I&#39;d say. &quot;All is flux.&quot;</p>
<p>We are grateful that we had the yellow birch for as long as it lasted, and grateful also that the white birch has decided to stick around -- perhaps for another couple of decades.</p>

                                <p>I don&#39;t know much about economics and never did --it&#39;s an area of knowledge that has lived up to its reputation as a dismal, arcane science. It&#39;s not only economics -- I don&#39;t even understand money, which has become more ethereal and symbolic during the course of my lifetime.</p>
<p>In my first real job, at Sears, Roebuck during the now-historical 1950s, I was handed, come Friday at 4:00pm, an envelope containing a few bills and coins. Money as I understood it.</p>
<p>A guy had bills in his wallet and put some in the bank and blew some on CrackerJacks at Ebbets Field.&#0160;</p>
<p><img alt="vintage" class="hCL kVc L4E MIw" importance="auto" loading="auto" src="https://i.pinimg.com/236x/9e/99/c5/9e99c51b8fdfd5955047708ecdd70bb7.jpg" /> &#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>That was before credit cards and electronic transfers and bitcoins, whatever they are. Of course I understand that money is not just currency. It&#39;s a mysterious commodity -- much prized, but&#0160; also the root of all evil. It has no value until you spend it, and then, once you spend it, you don&#39;t have it. The monetary value of things is often inversely proportionate to their utility: diamonds, pearls, paintings. To have money in the bank gives you a sense of security. Then you die.&#0160;</p>
<p>Most people have way too little money, but some people have more money than is necessary and more than is good for their souls. I&#39;m enthusiastic about taxing wealth. Let&#39;s say a guy has $100,000,000. Suppose there&#39;s an annual 2% wealth tax and he has to contribute $2,000,000 a year to promote the general welfare. How is he harmed?&#0160; He now has $98,000,000. What can you do with $100M that you can&#39;t do with $98M? And moreover, how incompetent must you be if you can&#39;t make your $98M generate a few million and restore you to $100M. You can do good and still stay rich -- what a blessing!</p>
<p>In my opinion, many Americans think about wealth and money incorrectly. They&#39;re like the Johnny Roccos who always want &quot;more.&quot; I was fortunate to be taught by my father, who explained to me that &quot;no one owns anything. The most you can say is that you have a lifetime lease.&quot; He believed in this maxim even though he spent his life negotiating real estate deals. He wasn&#39;t much concerned with money and it didn&#39;t seem to harm him a bit. He had enough, and &quot;enough is as good as a feast.&quot;</p>
<p>To me, wealth means very little, but standard of living means a great deal. My standard of living is very high because my town has an excellent public library and a thriving public school system. And fine mountain trails and other recreational possibilities. These amenities aren&#39;t &quot;mine&quot; -- they&#39;re not money in my personal bank. But they contribute immensely to my standard of living.</p>
<p>What would improve my standard of living? That&#39;s an easy question. I would enjoy my life more if other people lived better. If there were no homeless people panhandling on the mall or sleeping under bridges. If unregarded old folks weren&#39;t thrown into corners. If refugees were welcomed. If medical help was available to all as a birthright. Etc., etc., etc.</p>
<p>I would gladly pay more in taxes if my tax money was spent wisely. I&#39;d be &quot;better off.&quot; There would be less money in my personal pocket but more joy in my life.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Dear T, O, E, L, L, C, and A:</p>
<p>A friend told us that when she entered Pomona College in 1961, it was the custom that all the newly arriving women (&quot;co-eds&quot; they were called in those dark days) were &quot;measured&quot; by the sophomore men. She said that the women were lined up and their measurements (height, weight, bust, waist, hips) taken and announced to the assembled spectators. This shameful blast from the past shocked and embarrassed me.</p>
<p>I&#39;m five years older than our friend, but I&#39;m glad to say that I never heard of any remotely similar goings-on at the college I attended. (Maybe such things happened in the backward, benighted frat clubs, but surely, I hope hope hope, not in my part of the campus). In fact, I was a bit skeptical of our friend&#39;s story -- it being so grotesque -- so I searched a Pomona alumni website for confirmation and found this picture. I&#39;m sorry to say that the evidence is incontrovertible. &#0160; &#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="   http://voices.pomona.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/FreshmanMeasuring1.jpg" style="display: inline;"><img alt="image from voices.pomona.edu" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef025d9b3562e4200c img-responsive" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef025d9b3562e4200c-800wi" title="image from voices.pomona.edu" /></a></p>
<p>Tale of the tape, 1961.</p>
<p>Crew-cut boy is smiling, and I think I understand why. He&#39;s almost touching shirtwaist girl&#39;s breasts. In those pre-Vietnam years, female virginity was still a mystical virtue, mechanical contraception (there were no pills) was near-impossible to obtain and prone to failure, pregnancy before marriage was a life-shattering disgrace, and abortion was illegal and sometimes fatal. It might be that taking the measure of the young lady&#39;s bosom was the sexual pinnacle of crew-cut boy&#39;s four years in college. Nevertheless, I&#39;m puzzled that shirtwaist girl is so amenable to the taping. Is she actually smiling? Doesn&#39;t she realize that she&#39;s participating in an absurd demeaning dehumanizing rite?&#0160;</p>
<p>I asked our Pomona friend how she dealt with the ritual. &quot;Well,&quot; she said, &quot;here&#39;s what I did. I went downtown and bought a large size inflatable bra. I put it on and blew it up to monumental proportions. I brought a pin to the ceremony. I planned to pop the bra just as I was being measured, but the thing was so tough it didn&#39;t deflate as planned. I wish it had. That was my protest. I should have done more. It was difficult to buck tradition. When things are customary, taken for granted, it takes a lot of strength to go against the system even when you know it&#39;s wrong.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>Here&#39;s another story, young &#39;uns, from the same era. In 1960, your grandmother, AGP, began teaching mathematics in Newton, Massachusetts. Her salary was $4200 a year, but if she had been a man, it would have been $4300. The district had two salary scales, one for men and one for women. I remember studying a printed schedule that had one column labelled M and one labeled F. The difference between M and F was small, but it increased with every year of experience. However small or large the discrepancy, it was still an insult and an injustice, designed as much to assert superiority and inferiority as to make an economic difference.</p>
<p>Both AGP and I knew it was wrong, but I&#39;m embarrassed to say that we did not protest. Before &quot;equal pay for equal work,&quot; it was taken for granted that Fs would be paid less than Ms. Why didn&#39;t we argue, agitate, organize?&#0160; Because we were paralyzed, I think, by the powerful forces of custom and convention.&#0160;</p>
<p>I wonder about crew-cut boy. Was he forever locked into 1960 attitudes or did he eventually come to enlightenment? What sort of relations did he establish with mature women? And did he, perhaps, have a daughter? Would he have advised her to attend Pomona College, and if he did so, did he try to ascertain whether first-year female students were still being measured?</p>
<p>I wonder also about the abuses in our society that we notice but tolerate because they are so embedded in the culture. And even more so, by the abuses we don&#39;t notice but will be clearly apparent in a generation or two. Which of today&#39;s events will look as antiquated and rearward in fifty years as that Pomona ritual?</p>

<p>I have the hardest time remembering the number of stars in our home galaxy, the Milky Way. Is it 300 million or 300 billion?&#0160; Either number is so far out of my ken, so far beyond my ability to grasp, that it won&#39;t stick in my head. Moreover, it doesn&#39;t seem to make much of a difference. But now I&#39;ve checked once again -- and it&#39;s 300 billion stars (ballpark --&#0160; not an exact door-to-door census). That&#39;s three thousand millions of stars. Also, it&#39;s 130,000 light years from one side of the galaxy across to the center (the radius). The mass of our galaxy is 1.5 trillion solar masses. Does that figure include or exclude Dark Matter? I don&#39;t know.&#0160;</p>
<p>That&#39;s just the start. The full story is even more astonishing still. In addition to the Milky Way, there are approximately 34 billion galaxies such as ours in the universe. Or there used to be until a few years ago; the most recent estimate is 100 billion galaxies. From my standpoint, here on what Shakespeare naively called &quot;the sure and firm-set Earth&quot; -- a smallish planet revolving around the lucky old sun in one of the spiral arms of the Milky Way -- whether there are 34 billion or 100 billion galaxies out there doesn&#39;t much change the situation. In a nutshell: it&#39;s big; we&#39;re little.</p>
<p>Even seventy years ago, when I was a boy just starting to learn about the stars, the universe was smaller and simpler. No one told me, because no one knew, about the Big Bang, about star formation, about black holes and supermassive black holes, standard candles, quasars, exoplanets, etc. Knowledge is expanding as rapidly as the universe; it&#39;s only a few centuries ago that Galileo was sent to his room for proving that Earth wasn&#39;t a still point at the center of the world. &quot;Eppure, si muove.&quot;</p>
<p>Actually, I&#39;m glad that Copernicus and Galileo and Newton de-centered the universe. I rather prefer being insignificant. Standing at the center of the universe -- well, it was too much responsibility, too much pressure. It&#39;s mighty consoling to be trivial. It helps to put our daily woes in perspective.</p>
<p>Is it more staggering that the universe is so ridiculously immense or that members of our species have had the smarts to figure it out. Not only the engineering skills to devise telescopes and spacecrafts to gather the data, but the brains to think abstractly and mathematically. And the courage to do so. We&#39;re an accomplished and admirable species when we&#39;re not torturing and killing each other for no particular reason. I&#39;m proud of us, some of the time.</p>
<p>When my father was the age I am now, he said to me, &quot;As far as I can figure, I&#39;m just a link in a long chain going from nowhere to nowhere.&quot; He was exactly on target. But we should also remember that the chain of which he spoke includes Bach and Rembrandt and Einstein. And you and me&#0160; And as long as I remain a link in that chain, I intend to make the most of my insignificant existence -- the only one I have.</p>
<p>&quot;That which we are, we are.&quot;</p>

                                <p>The hardest part of my day is the night. Sleep does not come easy -- has never come easy. I regularly wake at 2:00 am, and stay awake for two or three hours. I use this time to fret about the state of the Earth (precarious), the state of the nation (doomed), and whether that new black spot on my left ankle will lead to agonizing death, or perhaps (best case scenario) merely to amputation at the hip. I then sleep fitfully until dawn, the last hours of the night crowded with grotesque, humiliating nightmares, worse by a long shot than anything Gregor Samsa could possibly imagine.</p>
<p>Last night, up again, I experienced a moment of clarity -- a revelation, an epiphany. Here it comes:&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>My mattress is just the right degree of firmness -- I sleep neither on the hard earth nor on a gunny sack of corn husks. My blankets are soft Egyptian cotton -- not leaves or newspapers. I rest my head on an authentic goose-down pillow. There are no rats scrabbling under my bed, no poisonous spiders descending from the ceiling, no lions roaring outside the door. No bedbugs or parasites or mosquitoes or scorpions. I&#39;m dry and warm. The temperature of my bedroom is well-regulated: forced air heat in the winter, cooling breezes or air conditioning in the summer. I&#39;m well fed, not kept awake by gnawing hunger. No noxious smells or hideous shrieks. No pains, cramps, headaches, or wounds.&#0160;</p>
<p>I know that my situation is luxurious and is certainly superior to all of my ancestors and to 99% of the human beings on the planet,</p>
<p>I am thankful that I have nothing whatever to grumble at, but I feel that I&#39;m unappreciative. To lie awake as I do, not sleeping, is to scorn society&#39;s gifts. How my forebears would have reveled in my taken-for-granted comforts!</p>
<p>No question but that I should be much more grateful.&#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;Lack of gratitude&quot; will be the principal worry during tonight&#39;s insomnia.&#0160;</p>

                                <p>In a lifetime with pen in hand&#0160; or with fingers at the typewriter (or, latterly, at the word processor), I&#39;ve written a lot of bad sentences and a handful of good ones. But last week, I composed my absolute best sentence ever. It&#39;s pure Olympic gold; a bottom-of-the-ninth walk-off bases-loaded HR; a sensational buzzer-beater. Deathless prose.</p>
<p>Let us pause to savor this extraordinary sentence. &quot;I could have been a better prairie dog.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>Aficionados of Vivian de St. Vrain (fit audience, though few) will remember that this mellifluous sentence appeared just a few days ago, <a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2019/12/prairiedogs.html">right here</a>. You can appreciate it in context, if you will, but heck, the sentence stands alone.</p>
<p>It is beautiful in itself but one can only marvel at its delicate but meaningful irony. Moreover, (bonus) it&#39;s near-perfect iambic pentameter.</p>
<p>It&#39;s become, for me, a mantra of sorts. Whenever I start to bemoan my fate, or deplore my state, or bother myself over some missed opportunity or long-ago failure, I mumble, &quot;I could have been a better prairie dog.&quot;&#0160; And I immediately regain perspective. So it&#39;s a sentence that&#39;s <em>utile</em> as well as <em>dulce --&#0160;</em>as useful as it is sweet. Classic.&#0160;</p>
<p>I&#39;m absolutely confident that &quot;I could have been a better prairie dog&quot; will help me through episodes of middle-of-the-night self-laceration. In fact, it&#39;s working just as I write this.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p><a class="image" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cynomys_ludovicianus_2.jpg"><img alt="" class="thumbimage" data-file-height="762" data-file-width="1147" decoding="async" height="166" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Cynomys_ludovicianus_2.jpg/250px-Cynomys_ludovicianus_2.jpg" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Cynomys_ludovicianus_2.jpg/375px-Cynomys_ludovicianus_2.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Cynomys_ludovicianus_2.jpg/500px-Cynomys_ludovicianus_2.jpg 2x" width="250" /></a></p>
<p>For twenty-two of a day&#39;s twenty-four hours, I&#39;m a contented kind of guy. Not self-satisfied by a long shot, but by and large reconciled to both my modest achievements and to my inadequacies. Yet between 2AM and 4AM, in the dark insomniac gloom, I&#39;m a different person. I struggle with &quot;what ifs,&quot; with &quot;should have&#39;s,&quot; with alternative life choices of every ilk, however trivial. Although I am well aware that (in 80&#39;s pop psychology) one shouldn&#39;t &quot;should&quot; on oneself, I &quot;should&quot; relentlessly. I become a classic second-guesser, a merciless self-critic, a shrill Monday morning quarterback of my own life.</p>
<p>So because &quot;dark is the dawn when day is nigh,&quot; with sleep or the coming of the sun, I revert to my normal, equable self.</p>
<p>A parable: yesterday we went for a walk on one of our town&#39;s many lovely open-space trails. This walk took us right through an extensive prairie dog village. It was a sunny day and the little plague-bearing rodents were outside -- cute, furry, squeaky, sitting or standing, each one asserting possession of his or her own burrow.&#0160;</p>
<p>I said to my companion, &quot;If I were a prairie dog, I&#39;d probably be saying, &#39;I should have chosen a different spot for my burrow. If I had just dug it a yard or two north, or fifty feet away next to that tree, or even over the hill, I would have led a much more productive life. Who knows, I might have had a better burrow. I might have eaten more forbs and fescue. I might have had more mates, I might have achieved more. My kits would have been more advantaged. I could have made better use of my brief time on earth. I could have been better prairie dog.&#39;&quot;</p>
<p>Don&#39;t laugh, please! This is serious stuff.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t need to underline the lesson of this tale. It&#39;s plenty obvious.</p>
<p>But will its wisdom and perspective console me tonight?</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>In the back of our fourth-grade &quot;reader&quot; at P. S. 217, there was an appendix containing proverbs and other jots of wisdom. Most of these were commonplaces: &quot;look before you leap&quot;; &quot;a stitch in time saves nine&quot;; &quot;empty barrels make the most noise.&quot;&#0160; Many of these gnomic bits mystified me. For example:</p>
<p>For all your days prepare,</p>
<p>And meet them ever alike.</p>
<p>When you are the anvil, bear.</p>
<p>When you are the hammer, strike.</p>
<p>I had no idea what an anvil was (now I own a beauty!!) but I understood that it was something to beat with a hammer. For what purpose? I had no clue? &#0160;But I was a moderately progressive youth and I couldn&#39;t grasp why we anvils were being urged to &quot;bear.&quot; It seemed like a reactionary idea then and still seems so now. Way too passive, I thought. Why shouldn&#39;t the anvils join together and form a united front against the hammers, or whatever capitalist oligarch controlled the hammers? Why did my grandparents come to America if not to free themselves from the perpetual anvilhood of sorry Ukraine?</p>
<p>Moreover, I completely missed the mark on &quot;strike,&quot; which I interpreted to mean &quot;go on strike.&quot; An easy mistake, because the only other meaning I knew of strike was the &quot;three strikes and you&#39;re out&quot; of basebalI. Even naif me knew that baseball had nothing to do with anvils and hammers or fourth-grade readers.&#0160;</p>
<p>The poem was therefore incoherent. Endure and suffer when you&#39;re an anvil, but get on the picket line when you&#39;re a hammer.</p>
<p>Why couldn&#39;t anvil and hammer unite and resist their oppressors together?&#0160;</p>
<p>I should also confess that anvil and hammer fused and mingled in my youthful brain with a Phillies shortstop of the period named Granville Hamner.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef0240a4d842ee200b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="IMG_2731" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bfcce53ef0240a4d842ee200b image-full img-responsive" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef0240a4d842ee200b-800wi" title="IMG_2731" /></a><br />This is a photograph of the buildings on the West Bradford property as they existed when we made the deal in 1967. As you know -- children, grandchildren and other interested parties -- we are no longer in possession of this part of the property. It passed to Phyllis and Bruce in 1977 and then to Bruce entirely when he and Phyllis divorced in 1984 or thereabouts. &#0160;</p>
<p>But this is how it looked to the photographer, whom I believe to be my brother Jonathan, when he stood on the near knoll looking westward. &#0160;Much remains superficially constant but everything is different.</p>
<p>Still in place: the house and barn, the Red Duchess apple tree just to the left of the house and closer to the camera; the big sugar maple on the left, near South Road. &#0160;</p>
<p>But to my eye, there&#39;s much that has changed. Hanging over the house is a very large, very dead elm. There&#39;s another infected and doomed elm to the right of the barn. Indeed, the property was sometimes called by us &quot;Dead Elm Farm&quot; when we spent our first summer there, in 1968. There&#39;s a chicken house, barely visible, to the right of the white clapboard milk house; there is also another outbuilding once used as a garage and a storeroom for wood visible between the house and barn; there&#39;s a porch of sorts at the street side of the house -- all these elements have been removed though they remain vivid in my memory.</p>
<p>But what you can&#39;t see, grandchildren, is more interesting than what is visible.</p>
<p>The property was owned for forty years by Tom Roberts, who was probably as old in 1968 as I am now. He knew that he was too tired and probably too resource-poor to maintain ownership. His wife, eight years older than he, was mortally ill, and Tom himself had only a couple of years to live. It was time for him to move on.</p>
<p>The house itself (supposedly built in part in 1856) was out of an earlier era. It lacked a septic system (it had only a cesspool, which was an open sewer into which untreated waste flowed and stunk.) &#0160;There was a 15-foot deep dug well (you can see a bit of the topmost well tile and the concrete well cover just to the right of the apple tree) from which a very old electric pump pushed water up to an open copper-lined tank on the second floor of the house. There was no water pressure (because there was no pressure tank) but only a &quot;gravity feed&quot; to the faucets and toilet. The plumbing was rusted iron (in) and lead (out). There was no heating system -- the wood stoves that had heated the place were sold at auction before we took up residence. No insulation either, except (we later discovered) the piles of hazelnut shells that generations of squirrels and chipmunks had deposited in the spaces between the split lathe-and-plaster inner walls and the outer sheathing. The sills were rotten and the house was sagging in places -- although, as you can see, the roof line was still deceptively sound.&#0160;</p>
<p>The barn was in even worse condition than the house. Its partial collapse was the reason -- the last straw -- that Tom Roberts sold out. During the previous winter, the rotted-out floor on the east side of the barn had given way, strangling three of Tom&#39;s eight cows in their stanchions. Tom was heartbroken -- he dropped more than one tear when he told us about the disaster. &quot;I hooked them one by one to the tractor and dragged them out into the field, over there, and buried them.&quot; &#0160;He pointed to a spot that would be just about the lower right hand corner of the photograph.</p>
<p>The barn, at first, was a scary place. &#0160;It took us (Bruce and me) a couple of weeks to get up the courage to enter. It was a disaster area: giant spider webs, peeling whitewash, jumbled and distorted structures for dairy use, piles of twisted lumber. It&#39;s now been repaired and remodeled -- completely transformed. But I still treasure the memory of the way it was, at least after it wasn&#39;t in danger of further collapse. I miss the majestic 16&#39; by 16&#39; hemlock beams, the spacious haylofts, the hand hewn tree that served for a ridgepole.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that the buildings were way past their prime, barely functioning, I didn&#39;t think for a second that we had made a mistake in buying the place. I never thought of reversing course and selling out. I was totally at home from the first breath. I fell in love with the buildings, and even more so with the land. &#0160;</p>
<p>When Althea took her very first walk on the property, just as we passed what we call the &quot;meander&quot; and crossed over the spill (now enclosed in a culvert) through which water from the swamp (now a pond) courses into the Baldwin Brook, she said, &quot;This is too beautiful to be in private hands.&quot; &#0160;</p>
<p>It&#39;s even more beautiful now.</p>
<p>[Addendum October 24, 2019. &#0160;I suppose I should mention that the decision to buy the property was controversial. My father in particular, ever cautious, was adamant: you don&#39;t buy a second home until you&#39;ve bought your first home. You have no idea what you&#39;re buying. The land has never been surveyed; &#0160;you don&#39;t know the boundaries.&quot; &#0160;His reasoning was perfectly correct, but all wrong. Buying the property was the best financial decision of my life.] &#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Now that I&#39;m eighty (80!) years old, it&#39;s time to think about what, if anything, &#0160;I&#39;ve learned. For many years now, I&#39;ve been waiting for wisdom to kick in, but so far, no thunderbolts or grand illuminations. Yet I seem to have accumulated a number of maxims and cliches, which leads to the dispiriting conclusion that perhaps there&#39;s no difference between ordinary commonplaces and sophisticated wisdom. On the other hand, it is undeniably the case that I am a different person now than I was twenty or forty or sixty years ago, so perhaps all these years have produced some changes in attitude and behavior. What follows is the first installment of either &quot;wisdom&quot; or &quot;commonplaces&quot; -- take your pick.</p>
<p>Although it is true that there are psychopaths and sociopaths, there are very few of them. Almost all the people I&#39;ve known over the years have been poor struggling mortals, like myself, trying to act decently and respectably. The difficult people with whom I&#39;ve had to deal are pathetic rather than villainous. They act badly because of their own inadequacies, anxieties and fear, not because they are innately vicious. A surprising number of people have endured dreadful traumas and most of them have recovered to live satisfactory lives. There are some poor souls who compensate badly. They cause pain to us, but more to themselves. It&#39;s not true that to know everything is to excuse everything, but knowing people&#39;s stories certainly helps you to become more empathetic and understanding. My younger self was much harsher and less compassionate toward difficult people than my present self.</p>
<p>Genuine understanding between individuals is difficult and misunderstanding is rife. It&#39;s hard to translate what&#39;s in your head to your friend or neighbor, and just as hard to understand what&#39;s in someone else&#39;s head by words alone. If you&#39;re going to be surprised because someone misunderstood you, then you&#39;re going to spend half your entire lifetime in a state of dreadful shock. Although irony and understatement are most useful figures of speech, beware of them. There&#39;s nothing more awkward (and sometimes dangerous) than an ironic remark that is taken seriously, or a serious remark that is understood ironically. A meaningful exchange of ideas or insights can&#39;t be brief, because it takes time for a shred or glimmer of understanding to grow and ripen. If you want to have a real friend, make the time. Understanding someone else&#39;s brain is akin to Zeno&#39;s Paradox; &#0160;you get halfway there but you never get all the way. &#0160;</p>
<p>Everyone is engaged in &quot;presentation of self.&quot; You meet someone new, and they tell you about themselves, but they&#39;re not really doing so in any profound way. They&#39;re not trying to. They&#39;re acting out the &quot;presentation&quot; that they&#39;ve devised over the years. They offer you a handful of anecdotes which they think represent themselves. But the fun and the satisfaction only begins when that first mask drops away. In order to know someone, you have to ask a question that is not truly intrusive but manages to take your new friend (or old friend, for that matter), a hair&#39;s breadth apart from their usual style of presentation. Sometimes it&#39;s not worth the effort, &#0160;but there are occasions when it can precipitate a worthwhile friendship. Too many conversations are not exchanges of information. &#0160;A says something from his repertoire of self-presentations; then B, impatiently waiting his turn to talk about himself, responds with a nugget from his own store. No genuine communication takes place. This kind of exchange is disappointing and almost useless. We all generate these forms of presentation partly as a defense against revealing too much of ourselves and becoming vulnerable, and because we all have our own follies and weaknesses. So we act a role. The further the contrived role is from the true self, the more transparent and even offensive it becomes. It&#39;s hard for people to be true to themselves; &#0160;it takes work. &#0160;</p>
<p>More wisdom (or commonplaces) coming soon. Stay tuned.</p>

                                <p>I&#39;ve reached the age when, neuroscience claims, the &quot;wisdom centers&quot; of the brain (the anterior cingulate and ventromedial prefrontal cortices) are supposed to leap into action. Do they? Tell truth, I don&#39;t know. Have I, without awareness or drama, metamorphosed from a jejune larva, dull as dishwater, into a butterfly of wisdom? When did it happen? At this moment or writing, I confess that I feel less wise than tired. &#0160;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, let me offer, with maximum diffidence, a few homemade aphorisms and <em>sententiae.&#0160;</em>Whether they amount to wisdom, and whether they do credit to my anterior or prefrontal lobes, my loyal readers will have to decide. &#0160;</p>
<p>A) &quot;Nothing ever happens until it happens.&quot; This proverb is slightly gnomic, so let me gloss. If you assume that just because you&#39;ve carefully planned your trip to Tahiti or your visit to the new restaurant or even your outing to the local barbershop that it&#39;s going to happen, you might be in for disappointment. Wait until you&#39;re there before you get excited. There&#39;s many a slip twixt the cup and the lip. Rejoice appropriately -- when it&#39;s time. By doing so, you avoid elation deflation.&#0160;</p>
<p>B) &quot;No one knows what&#39;s going on between two people, even if you&#39;re one of them.&quot; &#0160;I think this proverb is eminently self-explanatory. It applies mostly to marriage but equally so to all dyadic relationships. Even between you and your dog.</p>
<p>C) &#0160;&quot;The only people who idealize the past are those that know nothing about it.&quot; &#0160;Slavery, plague, torture, injustice, famine, rapine, brutality, poverty, starvation. Etc.</p>
<p>D) &quot;You&#39;re immortal until the day you die.&quot; Of course you are and don&#39;t let the nay-sayers and &quot;realists&quot; bother you.</p>
<p>E) &#0160;&quot;Religion: my Prince of Peace can beat up your Prince of Peace.&quot; Tribalism sucks.</p>
<p>F) &#0160;&quot;Enough is as good as a feast, and often better.&quot; Figurative meaning: a modest sufficiency is all that is needed for a happy life. Literal meaning: one hamburger (or half a hamburger) lies more easily on the stomach than two or three. And hold the fries.</p>
<p>G) &#0160;&quot;The secret of life is to turn routines into rituals.&quot; &#0160;Self-explanatory, I think. Make a fuss about that glass of wine at four o&#39;clock. Savor it.</p>
<p>H) &#0160;&quot;The longer something has been believed by mankind, the less likely it is to be true.&quot; &#0160;See C above.</p>

                                <p>Many years ago, sometime during the previous millennium, I was taken to an African game park -- elephants, rhinoceroses, giraffes, and lions (the hippos were AWOL). It was astonishing to see these huge beasts. I didn&#39;t realize at the time that it was semi-miraculous that these creatures had survived to our day, even in a de facto zoo, when so many other massive animals had recently gone extinct. When <em>homo sapiens</em> arrived on the scene, say 50,000 years ago, there were many animals that would have made a zoo park several orders of magnitude more remarkable that the one I visited. Why did these beasts go extinct? &#0160;Disease, habitat change, and competition are likely culprits but it&#39;s hard to deny that our predatory ancestors must take some of the blame. &#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Yes, the game park had lions, but it would have been infinitely more exciting if it housed not only the African lion, but the European lion&#0160;<span style="line-height: 1.3;">which was half again as large and which survived lately enough to be well known to the Greeks.</span></p>

<p>Other big cats were also missing: the famous saber tooth, everyone&#39;s nightmare, as well as the American false cheetah, a cheetah-like cougar weighing 190 formidable pounds. I would also have liked to see the thylacine, the so-called &quot;marsupial lion&quot; or sometimes &quot;Tasmanian tiger&quot; which survived until 1936, late enough to be photographed.<a class="irc_mil i3597" data-noload="" data-ved="2ahUKEwitucqSuubfAhUSO30KHYjZAxIQjRx6BAgBEAQ" href="https://www.news.com.au/technology/science/animals/not-science-fiction-any-more-the-tasmanian-tiger-could-soon-be-back-from-extinction/news-story/b26dcb89e8c28f1232b5153e2c2c07e7" jsaction="mousedown:irc.rl;focus:irc.rl" rel="noopener" tabindex="0" target="_blank"></a></p>

<p>I would also have liked to see a cackle of European hyenas. Even more, the two-ton short-faced Bear, with whom our paleolithic ancestors competed, which was three times the size of a modern polar bear. The equally large ground sloth, even the bones of which are impressive.</p>
<p><a class="image" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Megatherium_americanum_Skeleton_NHM.JPG"><img alt="Megatherium americanum Skeleton NHM.JPG" data-file-height="2560" data-file-width="1920" height="293" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/Megatherium_americanum_Skeleton_NHM.JPG/220px-Megatherium_americanum_Skeleton_NHM.JPG" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/Megatherium_americanum_Skeleton_NHM.JPG/330px-Megatherium_americanum_Skeleton_NHM.JPG 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/Megatherium_americanum_Skeleton_NHM.JPG/440px-Megatherium_americanum_Skeleton_NHM.JPG 2x" width="220" /></a></p>
<p>And the sloth lemur, the size of a big male gorilla. The Irish deer, as big as a moose, with an outsized, out-of-proportion rack. Then there were the elephant-like animals: the Columbian mammoth of the American southwest, smaller than its modern African cousin, but with astonishingly curved tusks. The wooly mammoth, surviving until just 3700 years ago on Wrangel Island off the Siberian coast. The straight-tusked elephant, two or three times the size of modern African elephant. The North American mammoths. And also Cuvier&#39;s gompothere, which looks like an elephant but isn&#39;t one, but which was seven feet tall at the shoulder and which lasted until about 14,000 years ago:</p>
<p><a class="image" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cuvieronius.jpg"><img alt="" class="thumbimage" data-file-height="473" data-file-width="904" height="115" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/Cuvieronius.jpg/220px-Cuvieronius.jpg" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/Cuvieronius.jpg/330px-Cuvieronius.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/Cuvieronius.jpg/440px-Cuvieronius.jpg 2x" width="220" /></a></p>
<p>And along with them, the morningstar-tailed glyptodon, a five thousand pound armadillo:&#0160;</p>

<p>I would have loved to cast my eye on the diprotodont, the largest known marsupial, which weighed in at three tons and lived until 45,000 years ago</p>
<p><a class="bia" data-ved="2ahUKEwjNg7TkheLfAhUM1oMKHYi3AWYQ_B0wE3oECAQQBg" href="https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/Diprotodon_optatum.jpg/220px-Diprotodon_optatum.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diprotodon&amp;h=165&amp;w=220&amp;tbnid=HPkNwKxSjAYwbM:&amp;q=giant+diprotodon&amp;tbnh=150&amp;tbnw=200&amp;usg=AI4_-kSgHJvlChfL4u8a6oKOnhAgJpw2Ew&amp;vet=1&amp;docid=VNT4Bj14we5RRM&amp;itg=1&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjNg7TkheLfAhUM1oMKHYi3AWYQ_B0wE3oECAQQBg" id="HPkNwKxSjAYwbM:" jsaction="fire.ivg_o" role="link" tabindex="0"><img alt="Image result for giant diprotodon" class="rISBZc M4dUYb" data-atf="3" height="150" id="dimg_4" src="https://scrolling.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bfcce53ef022ad3ccd444200b-pi" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diprotodon" width="200" /></a></p>
<p>The wooly rhinoceros, as large as a diprotodont. The sivathere, an odd-looking &#0160;giraffid. The tree kangaroo. The short-faced kangaroo, three times the size of any living kangaroo.</p>
<p>And right there in Vermont, rustling and stomping in the forest, were the stag moose and Jefferson&#39;s ground sloth and the long-nosed peccary and Harlan&#39;s musk ox and the Vero tapir and the giant beaver, all recently gone. (You wouldn&#39;t have wanted to come face-to-face with a giant beaver. Or swim in its pond, if it made ponds. You&#39;d be better off listening to it slapping its tail in a game &#0160;park.)</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 4: A scaled cartoon showing the size of the largest Giant Beaver, relative to an adult human. Image from  prehistoric-wildlife.com" class="thumb-image loaded" data-image="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/57c6f3bc725e25f822bf4657/t/58c45edd893fc021adec4664/1489264360117/castoroides-size_giant_beaver_Prehistoric_wildlife_Mar1117" data-image-dimensions="567x366" data-image-focal-point="0.5,0.5" data-image-id="58c45edd893fc021adec4664" data-image-resolution="750w" data-load="false" data-position-mode="standard" data-src="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/57c6f3bc725e25f822bf4657/t/58c45edd893fc021adec4664/1489264360117/castoroides-size_giant_beaver_Prehistoric_wildlife_Mar1117" data-type="image" src="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/57c6f3bc725e25f822bf4657/t/58c45edd893fc021adec4664/1489264360117/castoroides-size_giant_beaver_Prehistoric_wildlife_Mar1117?format=750w" /></p>
<p>&#0160;And then there were some true avian oddities worth taking a gander at:&#0160;the flightless moas of New Zealand, the female at 440 pounds, two-and-half times the size of the male. The cursorial owl, a three-foot tall flightless owl, which pursued its prey afoot. Haast&#39;s eagle, with a wingspread of seven and a half feet. The&#0160;five hundred pound Elephant Bird, which survived in Madagascar until a thousand years ago.&#0160;</p>
<p>And then the tarpan, the warrah, the toxodon. Strangest of all,&#0160;macrauchenia, a three-toed ungulate not closely related to anything alive today, which looked something like a humpless camel with a droopy snout and which was around until about 10,000 years ago.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Although my parents were pure and perfect atheists, they did not advertise their atheism or disparage the religions of others -- at least not in my hearing. They were exactly the opposite of what is sometimes called &quot;militant atheists.&quot; To be militant would have been to give religion too much regard, too much importance -- and they wouldn&#39;t have bothered. To the best of my recollection, they were utterly indifferent. In our house, it was as if theology and worship had never been invented, practiced, or pondered. While my parents didn&#39;t enforce or evangelize their views upon their children, their unconcern, their lack of interest, was eloquence enough. Of course my brothers and I grew up to be atheists, and have remained so. Peaceful and positive atheists.</p>
<p>My parents were both readers. Every Tuesday my mother trundled over to the McDonald Avenue branch of the Brooklyn Public Library and trucked home a shopping basket full of books. There were volumes of all kinds -- mostly fiction and mysteries for my mother and, for my curiosity-driven father, politics, law, science, history, art, and of course, gardening. But I never saw a book on religion. Not a one. In their bookshelves at home, I remember only one volume that might have touched on the subject. It was a collection of essays by the Freethinker Robert Ingersoll.&#0160;</p>
<p>I was young boy, perhaps 10 or 11, when I overheard some friend or acquaintance of my mother say something to her about prayer, or putting faith in the lord, or some such platitude. She waited politely until the person departed and then turned to me and murmured, quietly, &quot;Well, I suppose some people need a crutch.&quot; &#0160;I think that&#39;s the sum of all I ever heard from her on the subject of religion. One might think that the dismissive term &quot;crutch&quot; hinted at disdain or superiority (<em>they</em> need crutches but <em>we</em> don&#39;t) but it was not so. My mother&#39;s observation was made without prejudice or judgment.&#0160;</p>
<p>Where other households might have worshiped or wondered or discussed, for us there was absolutely nothing. Religious education? &#0160;None, not a drop. In our home, there was no attendance at temple, mosque or tabernacle, no religious ceremonies, and not even a Bible. I can remember my father and me dribbling our basketball to the schoolyard to shoot some hoops. When we passed the local orthodox synagogue, my father said, &quot;Bingo.They play bingo in there.&quot; But he was not condemning the religion. It was the gambling. He disapproved of gambling (even Bingo) and the idea that a religious institution would allow gambling every Tuesday night offended him deeply.&#0160;</p>
<p>When I was a questioning adolescent, out of a spirit of curiosity and perhaps rebellion, I liberated a bible from our local public library and secreted it under my treasured collection of <em>Mad</em>&#0160;magazines. While others of my age cohort were squinting at smuggled <em>Playboys</em> or at <em style="line-height: 1.3;">The Amboy Dukes</em> <span style="line-height: 1.3;">under the blankets by flashlight, I was acquainting myself with the holy scriptures. In my ignorance, I thought of the bible as a forbidden book, one which my parents would have disapproved. But I was wrong. They wouldn&#39;t have noticed; they wouldn&#39;t have cared. Looking back, I&#39;m sure that they knew about my thirst for forbidden knowledge and probably enjoyed a giggle at my expense. Many years later, when my father was a widower, I gave him a copy of an annotated, edited Bible that I used as a textbook in one of my literature courses. Did he disapprove? &#0160;Not at all. He said, &quot;It&#39;s interesting.&quot; &#0160;But of course he read it not as an inspired text but as history and as fiction.&#0160;</span></p>
<p>To have been raised in such a household was my good fortune. My atheism was an unearned gift. I got it free, and I&#39;m perpetually grateful. Many of my friends, growing up in religious families, have struggled to achieve atheism -- often with painful inner conflicts and anger and resentments. I admire them for the strength to break free -- especially those that live with irreparable breaches to the family. I endured no such struggle.&#0160;</p>
<p>Philosophically speaking, it&#39;s been an easy life. There&#39;s a clarity about atheism. It&#39;s based in reality, not (dare I say what my parents wouldn&#39;t!) in wish and myth and superstition. Atheists, I think, are afforded a purer appreciation of human achievement and a clearer, less conflicted understanding of health, disease, and death. Reason and the evidence of the senses may not always lead to perfect understanding, but they&#39;re the best tools that we have, and we must cherish them. &#0160;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I&#39;ve been reading about the death of Alexander at the beginning of the Hellenistic period. It&#39;s all new to me, and much of it is fascinating, especially about cultural matters, but there&#39;s also page after page of difficult-to-retain accounts of warfare and of particular battles. Here&#39;s an example of the kind of material that takes up three-quarters or perhaps even 80% of the book. &#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;The two armies faced each other quite conventionally, with the phalanx composed mostly of Lysimachus&#39; and Cassander&#39;s troops confronting Antigonus&#39;&#0160; phalanx. On their right, Seleucus and Lysimachus stationed a vast mass of Seleucus&#39; &#0160;light infantry; on the left was their heavy cavalry commanded by Seleucus&#39; son Antiochus. &#0160;Confronting Antiochus was Demetrius in command of Antigonus&#39; &#0160;heavy cavalry. As the battle commenced, Demetrius and his cavalry charged Antiochus and drove the enemy cavalry off. Demetrius proceeded to commit the worst blunder a cavalry leader can commit: he over-pursued, leaving the main battle well behind, instead of turning to attack the enemy infantry from behind. As soon as Demetrius had disappeared in the distance, Seleucus brought forward four hundred war elephants and placed them as a screen between Demetrius and his path back to the battle. Meanwhile Lysimachus&#39; phalanx came to grips with that of Antigonus, and Seleucus led his light cavalry in an outflanking maneuver to attack Antigonus&#39; infantry from behind....&quot; &#0160;Etc.&#0160;</p>
<p>Exactly what is at stake in this war? The historian (Richard Billows, <em>Before and After Alexander</em> [New York, 2018]) leaves us rather in doubt. He puts no emphasis on the usual economic or ideological issues; the struggle seems to be entirely about personalities. Will the kingdom be ruled by Lysimachus or Demetrius, by Antiochus or Antigonus? &#0160;It doesn&#39;t seem to matter, either to me or to the historian.</p>
<p>But what of the soldiers? &#0160;Whether on one side or the other, they&#39;re likely to be impaled by the dreaded Macedonian larissa, trampled by horses, or squished by elephants. For what purpose?</p>
<p>I think that at one point in my life I might have been intrigued by these dynastic struggles, but now, what I feel most strongly is sympathy for the ordinary soldier and sorrow for the stupidity of my species.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Here are some reasons, young &#39;uns, why you should steer clear of tattoos.</p>
<p>a) because tattoos are permanent and because taste, your taste, is impermanent and will inevitably change. There&#39;s a poster on the wall of your bedroom that you love. Five years later, you&#39;re indifferent to it, and ten years later, you&#39;ve trashed it. &quot;How could I ever have thought that thing was beautiful?&quot; Same with your taste in all the visual arts. So with the tattoo. You may think t&#39;s beautiful now, perhaps, but ten or twenty years on it has become a permanent definition of your callow taste. Without remedy or the possibility of amelioration. You&#39;re stuck with it.</p>
<p>b) because ink fades and bodies sag. That crisp tattoo is going to bend, distort, twist and fade as your body ages. Face facts: that tattoo is going to become uglier and uglier. Have you caught sight of someone of my age who&#39;s tattooed?&#0160; If you have, you know what I&#39;m talking about; if you haven&#39;t, don&#39;t look. It ain&#39;t pretty.</p>
<p>c)&#0160; tattoos are expensive if they&#39;re done by someone with talent. The cheap ones are horrid. What a waste of money! You could donate the same amount to a useful cause and feel good about yourself.&#0160;</p>
<p>d)&#0160; tattoos hurt in the application; sometimes they become infected.</p>
<p>e)&#0160; because tattoos limit your romantic options. For many a potential partner, that pseudo clever tattoo will be a deal breaker. &quot;You have a tattoo where? There? Right there? Ugh?&quot; And also, don&#39;t tattoo yourself with the name of your present beloved. Consider the divorce rate.</p>
<p>f)&#0160; &#0160;if the tattoo is in plain sight, it will lower your earning power. No problem getting a job as a dishwasher, but perhaps that upscale employer is going to think twice before hiring someone who made such a bad choice. Because the employer doesn&#39;t want to offend potential customers.</p>
<p>g)&#0160; because the Bible tells you so. &quot;Do not cut your bodies for the dead or put tattoo marks on yourselves. I am the LORD” (<em>Leviticus</em> 9:28). Your body is a temple; do not mutilate or desecrate it. And for god&#39;s sake don&#39;t tattoo yourself with religious symbols. To do so is like throwing ashes in the face of the Almighty. The injunction against tattoos is one of the few biblical proscriptions that I can sincerely embrace.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>h) because tattoos are an expression of vanity, like wearing show-off jewelry or expensive designer clothes. Let us take pride in our achievements and not in our shallow foppery.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>j ) because you don&#39;t want to cause me, ME, to look askance or into the air and wrinkle up my nose whenever I meet you.</p>

                                <p>Many a restaurant in New Orleans; and many visited by us during our latest stay.</p>
<p>Two divergent experiences. &#0160;Shaya, and Venezia.</p>
<p>Shaya:</p>
<div class="photo"><img alt="Shaya, New Orleans, LA" height="386" large-data-url="https://resizer.otstatic.com/v2/photos/large/23751171.jpg" onerror="error()" src="https://resizer.otstatic.com/v2/photos/large/23751171.jpg" title="Shaya, New Orleans, LA" width="386" /></div>
<p>Slick, elegant, ultra-modern, carefully designed. Waitpersons stylishly costumed and coiffed. Well-trained. Reservations mandatory. Customers: jacketed and tied, or on high heels. Price: whole wallet.</p>
<p>The place to go if you&#39;re looking for wood roasted Brussels sprouts with black harissa, tahini and sumac pickled onions. Or ikra made with paddlefish caviar and shallots. Or if you want your crispy halloumi with strawberries, mint and pistachio. Perhaps shakshoula made of tomato, Jerusalem artichokes, poached egg, chilies and chermoula. The roasted chicken is cooked with shawarma spices, heirloom carrots, and chickpea mujadara. Etc. Very enjoyable experience.</p>
<div class="menu-item f42dd212">
<div class="menu-item-title">Then there&#39;s Venezia. Not pronounced ven-ets-ia after the Italian style, but ven-ezh-a by local custom. Red-and-white checked tablecloths. Families, large and extended. Waitresses as wide as tall who call you &quot;honey&quot; or &quot;dearie.&quot; &#0160;Sausages, peppers, spaghetti with tomato sauce, shellfish. Excellent pizza. Sorry, no picture available on website. No website, actually. And, added bonus, Venezia is just down the street from famous historic Angelo Brocato (ice cream and pastries).</div>
<div class="menu-item-title">&#0160;</div>
<div class="menu-item-title">Guess at which restaurant I felt more at home.</div>
<div class="menu-item-title">&#0160;</div>
<div class="menu-item-title">New Orleans is a high contrast city where the Whole Foods sits directly adjacent to the Dollar General. Honest.</div>

                                <p>Donald Trump has taken credit for the rise in the stock market. &quot;The stock market hit yet another record high yesterday. There is great confidence in the moves that my Administration is making.” If he is responsible for the rise, then surely he is also responsible for the fall. It can be no accident, and can only be a signal from the other world, that Trump&#39;s market fell exactly 666 points last Friday. One trillion of market value was erased with the wave of the supernatural wand. Six hundred and sixty- six is &quot;the number of the beast&quot; in <em>Revelation.</em>&#0160;Inasmuch as everything happens for a reason, we must ask what the Lord is telling us. The 666 point drop undeniably demonstrates that DT is &quot;the man of sin&quot; who &quot;opposes and exalts himself above every god or object of worship&quot;&#0160;(<cite>2 Thessalonians 2:1). </cite><span style="line-height: 1.2em;">He is the false god who has erected his tower at 666 Fifth Avenue. Heed, O supporters of Trump, the words and acts of the Lord, for the man of the flaming hair is the egg of the serpent, the false prophet, the anti-Christ.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.2em;"> No possible probable manner of doubt.</span></p>

                                <p>It wasn&#39;t until I reached college that I discovered poetry. My comic-book, super-hero and baseball-infused brain was until then, poetry-wise, an almost complete tabula rasa; I say &quot;almost&quot; because at eight or nine eight years old I had already memorized two great classics of American literature: &quot;Casey at the Bat&quot; and also the poem by Grantland Rice about Tinkers, Evers, and Chance. In addition, I knew the ubiquitous stercoraceous distich the first line of which is &quot;Here I sit, broken-hearted&quot; and a related gnomic verse that begins, &quot;No matter how much you wiggle and dance.&quot; Then in 1956 I left Flatbush for higher education and enrolled in a course in English Literature. The rest, as they say, is history. It was love sonnets and rich luscious liquid poems by Marlowe and Keats and Hopkins that entranced me. The more intellectual poems were too taxing for my immature head. <em style="line-height: 1.2em; font-size: small;">Lycidas</em><span style="line-height: 1.2em; font-size: small;">, which I now can acknowledge to be the finest poem in&#0160;the language, was utterly impenetrable for at least a decade, although I immediately&#0160;responded to its music:&#0160;&quot;With nectar pure&#0160;his oozy locks he laves.&quot;&#0160;</span></p>
<div class="entry-content">
<div class="entry-body">
<p>One of my teachers sagely observed that certain poets and certain poems were for youth, some for maturity, and some for old age. &quot;You may no longer like then what you like now.&quot; Which has come to pass. As an example of poetry for the latter years, he adduced Tennyson&#39;s &quot;Ulysses.&quot; &quot;This poem may not mean much to you now, but it will some day, if you live long enough.&quot; I remember that I was much taken with the touchstone line &quot;Far on the ringing plains of windy Troy&quot; but I thought that &quot;Ulysses&quot; was too much about a really old guy trying to cheer himself up and I did not see it holding a place in any future that I could envision.&#0160;</p>
<p>Well, folks, I&#39;ve now arrived at the so-called golden years, or, more properly, the endgame, or extra innings (which in some sports is called&#0160;sudden death) and guess what? &#0160;&quot;Ulysses&quot; has returned,&#0160;front and center,&#0160;exactly as was predicted 50+ years ago.&#0160;It&#39;s right on target.&#0160;</p>
<p>Tennyson&#39;s Ulysses is Homer&#39;s adventurer a generation older, kinging it in Ithaca, but bored, unchallenged, and unstimulated.&#0160;&quot;It little profits that an idle king,/ By this still hearth, among these barren crags,/ Matched with an aged wife, I mete and dole/ Unequal laws unto a savage race,/ That hoard and sleep, and feed,/ And know not me.&quot;</p>
<p>To put it vulgarly, Ulysses plans to bust out of the home for old kings. He&#39;s been a warrior, a hero, and a roving explorer. He &quot;cannot rest from travel.&quot; He needs to search &quot;beyond the utmost bound of human thought.&quot; He leaves Penelope, and he resigns the government of Ithaca to his bureaucratically-minded son Telemachus. The last lines of the poem, the leave-taking, are most stirring: &#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Come, my friends</p>
<p>&quot;Tis not too late to seek a newer world.</p>
<p>Push off, and sitting well in order smite</p>
<p>The sounding furrows;&#0160;for my purpose holds</p>
<p>To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths</p>
<p>Of all the western stars, until I die.</p>
<p>It may be that the gulfs will wash us down:</p>
<p>It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles,</p>
<p>And see the great Achilles, whom we knew.</p>
<p>Though much is taken, much abides,</p>
<p>And though we are not now that strength which in old days</p>
<p>Moved earth and heaven, that&#0160;which we are, we are;</p>
<p>One equal temper of heroic hearts&#0160;</p>
<p>Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will</p>
<p>To strive to seek, to find, and not to yield.</p>
<p>Yes, I know -- the diction is a little antiquated and artificial, the urge to get away a trifle too vehement. But nevertheless, I&#39;m moved by the resilience, the perseverance. Though tear-inducing, the poem is anything but lachrymose. And it&#39;s accepting: &quot;that which we are, we are.&quot;</p>
<p>It has lately become the fashion to interpret &quot;Ulysses&quot; as a poem about capitalism and imperialism. In this reading, Ulysses is just another white male, off to conquer and colonize The Alien Other. Or to see it as a poem about male privilege: he&#39;s a bad husband, abandoning the family. Or to conceive the poem as a structure of ironies, in which Ulysses doesn&#39;t realize that he undermines his own suppositions. There&#39;s a tad of truth in these arguments, as there always is, because Tennyson was caught up in a Victorian striving that he didn&#39;t fully or consciously assimilate. But frankly, I feel sorry for readers who can&#39;t hear the verve and excitement in Ulysses&#39;s expansive view of things.&#0160;</p>
<p>Moreover, it turns out that Tennyson was absolutely correct to proclaim that there is a time in life when &quot;not to yield&quot; is an act of daily heroism.</p>

		<a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2017/12/grassley.html">Why I Am So Damned Pissed at Charles Grassley</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Inasmuch &quot;on horror&#39;s head horrors accumulate&quot; every single Trump day, I wonder why an atrocity out of the mouth of Senator Charles Grassley (of once progressive Iowa) pisses me off to the top of my bent. Over the top, actually, even though he&#39;s probably no worse than the others.&#0160;</p>
<p>In an aha!! moment with the <em>Des Moines Register</em>, Senator Grassley defended his vote against the inheritance tax thusly: &quot;I think not having the estate tax recognizes the people that are investing as opposed to those that are just spending every darn penny they have, whether it&#39;s on booze or women or movies.&quot; &#0160;His very words. Out of his own ignorant head.</p>
<p class="p-text">Why am I so enraged? Let us count the ways.</p>
<p class="p-text">First, it goes without saying that Grassley doesn&#39;t know that most ordinary citizens have a hard time making ends meet. That they raid the kids&#39; piggy-bank at the end of every month. That they regularly postpone filling that prescription or repairing the car until next month&#39;s paycheck arrives. That they can&#39;t invest in stocks because they&#39;re busy &quot;investing&quot; in bananas and oatmeal and potatoes, not because they&#39;re frittering their money away on playthings. Grassley is completely out of touch with reality -- with the way real people live.</p>
<p class="p-text">But it&#39;s worse than that. It&#39;s not only that he&#39;s unconnected to his constituents &#0160;-- &#0160;he oozes contempt for them (and therefore for me). Wasting their money on movies, the poor ignorant slobs. If they had self-control and brains of Chuck Grassley quality, why they&#39;d go out and buy a couple of hundred shares of a good growth stock and contribute to the American economy. He&#39;s worse than Marie Antoinette, who, bad as she was, never said, &quot;let them buy stocks.&quot;</p>
<p class="p-text">And therefore it follows in the universe of Grassley values that the tax system should penalize the improvident and reward the rich. (Which it already does in myriad ways, most obviously by taxing unearned income -- e.g. capital growth -- at half the rate of sweat labor).&#0160;</p>
<p class="p-text">And in Chuck Grassley&#39;s view, to reward the rich and penalize the poor is the higher morality -- because &#0160;the rich will invest and the poor will do nothing but spend every darn penny. &#0160;To those who have much shall be given, even if they don&#39;t need or want it.</p>
<p class="p-text">And while I&#39;m stoking my indignation, let me add that I&#39;m offended by the Chuckster&#39;s sanctimonious &quot;darn&quot; -- he can thieve from the working class but he&#39;s too prissy to swear while doing so. And I&#39;m also just slightly off my gourd that he includes &quot;women&quot; among the vices of regular Iowans -- as though (if I understand his point) all money is earned and spent by &quot;men.&quot; I think that the dumb Chuck slipped -- let down his guard for a second -- and revealed that in his heart he doesn&#39;t acknowledge that women are wage-earners nor that they are wage-earners who vote.&#0160;</p>
<p class="p-text">And I am also pissed because the whole argument against the estate tax is fraudulent. The case for repeal has nothing to do with small farmers or small businessmen. It already excludes the first $11,000,000 of estates and therefore affects only a very small number of multimillionaires and billionaires who can well afford to contribute a bit to the general welfare. The sole purpose, and the intended effect of the repeal, is to satisfy the greed of a handful or plutocrats who want to pass their wealth to their heirs and therefore maintain a perpetual class of wealthy aristocrats. Just like France before the revolution, when the titled were exempted from taxation. Chuck -- do &#0160;your realize that your sentiments are profoundly unAmerican. &#0160;</p>
<p class="p-text">So let me say to Senator Charles Grassley, with respect for the high office that you hold and with as much love as I can muster, Chuck, you are a moron, and you can take your insulting opinions, roll them up, and stick them where the sun don&#39;t shine.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>When I was a exceedingly young fellow (teens and twenties), I suffered from a great fear of death. It was not obsessive or constant, but enough to keep me lying awake at night, sometimes in a sweaty panic. It was not a fear of death itself, nor a concern about anguish in an afterlife -- hell a story which I always regarded as a pathetic fiction and fraud. No, my fear was that I would miss out on things. Children, grandchildren, springtimes, love, baseball, mountains, travel, books, knowledge, corn and hamburgers in August, the works. I wanted to live to an old age for the experiences. I well remember that in the 1960s, when I was barely out of adolescence, I would project myself forward to the distant future, as far as to the year 2000, the new millennium. I remember thinking, if I can just make it to 2000, when I&#39;ll be sixty-one, I&#39;ll have lived a full life. I&#39;ll be ready to go.</p>
<p>Well, 2000 has long ago come and gone, and here I am, pushing eighty, and in excellent, almost miraculous health. Such good health, in fact, that on good days I climb our neighboring foothills like a gazelle. (On bad days, even walking downhill seems as though I&#39;m slogging through a swamp of mucilage, but that&#39;s another matter.)</p>
<p>I no longer fear death. No matter what else happens to me, I&#39;m not going to die young, with my promises, such as they were, unfulfilled.</p>
<p>But the fear of dying young has been superseded by a new fear -- the fear of living too long. When did the transition occur?</p>
<p>I don&#39;t want to outlive my time. I don&#39;t want to outlive my friends, my family, my health. I&#39;m already the senior member, the patriarch, of my extended family -- not just the direct line from my grandparents, but of the extended cousinhood. In my family, there are no elders and only a couple of near-coevals. I don&#39;t want to become an isolate. Even more so, I don&#39;t want to lose my mobility or my mind. I don&#39;t want to find myself in a nursing home, pee on my pants, bedridden, &quot;locked-in&quot;. And I&#39;m going to do everything I can to avoid allowing myself to get into that situation. I&#39;ve seen people in that trap at close hand too many times -- and it ain&#39;t pretty. &#0160;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I&#39;m enjoying the perspective of the moment. I&#39;m glad that I managed to get to this point. From where I stand, I can remember my grandparents and I know my grandchildren. I&#39;m at the midpoint, the apex, of five generations. I marvel at the changes -- recall, will you, that my grandfather was born in darkest Ukraine in 1863, my youngest grandchildren were born in hi-tech Boulder, Colorado in 2013. Need I say more?</p>

		<a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2017/10/theeventjune30.html">What I Said at Our "Event"</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>&quot;Thank you all for coming. We appreciate it more than you can possibly imagine. We&#39;ve needed, and relied on, the support that all of you have given us.</p>
<p>It&#39;s no secret that both Lynn and I have gone through some difficult times. It&#39;s good to host a cheerful event. &#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>A number of people have asked us about our use of the word &quot;wed&quot; in the invitation that we sent to you. (We said, you remember, that we were &#39;wed&quot; on June 30). I don&#39;t want to mislead you. We didn&#39;t mean to imply that we involved either state or church in our relationship. There didn&#39;t seem to be any point for us to get married legally. People marry for the sake of children, but we&#39;ve decided that we&#39;re not going to have children.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the story. Lynn and I wanted to acknowledge in a public way the seriousness and permanence of our friendship -- for our families, and, I think, especially for our grandchildren (there are ten of them). We wanted our families to know that our relationship wasn&#39;t like some streetcar or trolley that you hop on and hop off. So we decided to invite our most nuclear&#0160;family to Lynn&#39;s backyard garden for a brief &quot;ceremony&quot; -- just my children and grandchildren, her children and grandchildren, her brother, my brother, the various spouses -- and pledge our love and fidelity. But then one of my daughters-in-law, Connie, said that we couldn&#39;t ask people to fly&#0160;in from all over the USA just for a five minute ceremony. She suggested that we at least exchange rings. It seemed like a good idea. So we walked over to Classic Facets on the Pearl Street Mall and bought two not antique but vintage rings -- because we&#39;re vintage people. Handsome rings, as you can see. And then as long as everyone was coming here a day early we decided that we should have dinner the night before. And if you&#39;re going to have a dinner you might as well have some music. So gradually the &quot;ceremony&quot; evolved and grew. But more importantly -- and here&#39;s the point -- the meaning of the event evolved as well. It became more significant, more profound, more intimate.&#0160;We never liked the phrase &quot;commitment ceremony&quot; or even the word &quot;commitment&quot; because it sounds as though you are being sent either to jail or to a mental institution, and we didn&#39;t have the vocabulary for what we intended to do. But little by little, while we planned the event, and even more so, after we performed the ceremony, we began to feel more and more married -- in all the positive senses of the word. We can now say &quot;wed&quot; and mean it. I haven&#39;t yet been able to say &quot;husband&quot; or &quot;wife&quot; but I suspect that one day in the not too distant future those words will manifest themselves. But the point is that in all the ways that matter, we are &quot;wed.&quot;</p>
<p>When my Vermont friend Bert, who&#39;s just my age, got married 18 years ago, I said to him, Bert, is it real --that you&#39;re head over heels in love at age 60? At the time, it seemed so improbable. But now, here I am, just a year and a half short of 80, and setting out on a new life. And 60 seems like dewy youth.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>So let me repeat to you now what I said to Lynn on June 30. &quot;I bring you my children and my grandchildren, my prosthetic tooth, my lens implants, my hearing aids, my non-standard but warm heart, and I take you and your children and grandchildren and your titanium hip and arthritic finger&#0160;and I say, &quot;let us make a life of it.&quot;</p>
<p>And let me just add that between us we have been married for 100 years (an average of 50 apiece). So we ought to know what we&#39;re doing.</p>
<p>And what we&#39;re going to do is to ride this old trolley right to the end of the line.&quot;</p>

		<a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2017/05/enoughisasgoodasafeast.html">"Enough is as Good as a Feast" or Possibly Better</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <div>&quot;Enough is as good as a feast&quot; has become my very favorite proverb.</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>It&#39;s&#0160; a warning against crass consumerism, against materialism, against the excesses of capitalist acquisitiveness. Cold water in a jelly glass, it asserts, is as good as your $500 wine in crystal. As they used to gloss the proverb, no &quot;<em>avaricious scraping together that knows no bounds</em>.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>But for a fully &quot;mature&quot; guy like me, the proverb carries not only a figurative but a plain literal instruction, i.e., &quot;do yourself a favor, eat less.&quot; Enough is as good as a feast if a feast makes your stomach swell, makes you heavy-lidded and gassy and passive, and if you feel a heck of a lot better when you haul yourself away from the Table of Plenty long before you reach satiety.</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>I can remember, as a voracious adolescent, eating <em>three </em>large, overstuffed hamburgers at a single sitting -- the roll overflowing with tomatoes, onions, relish, ketchup, etc. Along with a bottomless bowl of fries. And craving more. Then as a vigorous young man, a good portion was two hamburgers. Nowadays, I go halves with a friend. Hold the fries.</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>When my grandmother dished up those glorious blintzes of my youth, eight was my number. Now my number is -- one. And I feel the better for it.</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>Digestion is slower and, I suppose, less efficient. And then there&#39;s the embarrassing fact that hamburgers and blintzes and everything else settles right in the enlarged belly, the &quot;front porch.&quot;</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>So here&#39;s a proverb for this latter age: &quot;enough is better than a feast.&quot; Much.&#0160;</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>By the way, I first encountered the proverb, believe it or not, as the title to William Wager&#39;s 1581 morality. And then in Latin in Shakespeare&#39;s<em> Love&#39;s Labor&#39;s Lost</em>,<em><em>&#0160;</em></em>where, Sir Nathaniel and the pedant Holofernes come on stage having just completed, apparently, a more than substantial dinner. &quot;<em>Holofernes</em>: &#0160;&#39;Satis quod sufficit.&#39;&quot; Perhaps Holofernes paraphrases and simplifies&#0160;Horace:&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div><em>Multa petentibus<br />Desunt multa.<br />Bene est, cui deus obtulit<br />Parca, quod satis est manu.</em></div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>(Those who seek for much are left in want of much. Happy is he to whom God has given, with sparing hand, as much as is enough.)&#0160;</div>
                        </div>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Once Leonardo defeated the old king and began to rule the pride, he evolved into a more modern lion -- more sensitive, more sharing, and more mindful. While he did not trim his mane or become less manly, he transitioned to a new kind of male.</p>
<p>First he decided no longer to bite the necks of the lionesses whom he mounted. Instead he wooed them gently with wine and flowers. He was a considerate mounter -- always taking care that the experience was sweet for his lionesses. He learned to roar more musically.</p>
<p>And soon after, he gave up the custom of breaking the backs of the kittens of the previous king. Instead, he nurtured the babies and brought them porridge and toys and stuffed animals. Nor did he drive the juvenile males into the bush. He taught them to dance and to draw and to meditate.</p>
<p>And finally Leonardo stopped treating other animals as prey. He became a gazelle guardian. Conscious of the environment,&#0160;he encouraged all in his pride to eat organic fruits and vegetables and wholesome ancient grains.</p>
<p>Nowadays Leonardo the enlightened lion starts each day with a large bowl of gluten-free granola and yoghurt.</p>
<p>He&#39;s into wellness.</p>
