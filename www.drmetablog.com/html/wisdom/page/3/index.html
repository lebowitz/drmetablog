                                <p>A:&#0160; Do you remember Walter Peter, used to teach history at the university?</p>
<p>B.&#0160; Yes, he had quite the reputation.</p>
<p>A.&#0160; Lazy as sin, among other things. I was his grader in the late 60s. He never looked at a paper or at an exam. When a girl would complain about a grade, I&#39;d tell them to go see Professor Peter. Some of them would, some of them wouldn&#39;t dare. There was this one young nubile maiden, very beautiful. She had a D on the mid-term and didn&#39;t show up for the final, so of course I gave her an F. She was one of those who were willing to see Professor Peter in his office. I never heard back from her but eventually I took a look at the grade sheet. He had changed her grade from F to B.&#0160; I asked him, how come?</p>
<p>B.&#0160; Did you get any kind of explanation?</p>
<p>A.&#0160; He said, I talked to her, and I felt sure she would have gotten an A on the final, if she had taken it, so I changed her grade. He said it with a straight face.</p>
<p>B.&#0160; I wonder if he thought you believed him.</p>
<p>A.&#0160; I don&#39;t think he even cared.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>B.&#0160; Let me tell you my favorite plagiarism story. I was handed a paper which began, &quot;Moreover....&quot;&#0160; Student just took a couple of paragraphs out of the middle of a chapter. Didn&#39;t even bother to change the first word.</p>
<p>A.&#0160; There&#39;s also the story of the student who handed in a paper with the bill from the ghost writer still in it.</p>
<p>B.&#0160; Here&#39;s one I heard from Don Baker.&#0160; He was teaching in&#0160; Mississippi, early in his career. Freshman English. He receives identical papers from two students in the same class. He gives an A to one and an F to the other. This would be in the 1950s sometime. The F student comes into his office.&#0160; He says, &quot;Uh, uh, Mr. Baker.&#0160; I have a friend in the class. I sometimes study with him. He, uh, uh, handed in a paper, kind of, uh, you know, similar to mine.&quot;&#0160; Baker says, &quot;and.&quot; The kid says, well, he got a much better grade than I did.&quot;&#0160; Baker says, or at least he swears he says, &quot;Oh, but I like him. And I don&#39;t like you.&quot;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Richard Poirier died last week at age 83. <em>The New York Times </em>paid tribute with a long obituary and an appreciative essay. Poirier was a &quot;distinguished man of letters&quot; and also a Professor of English.</p>
<p>In 1960, as the juniorest and least-sophisticated graduate student in the history of the universe, I enrolled in an AmLit course taught by Poirier. Fifty years later, I can affirm that it was the single course in my graduate career in which I performed the absolute worst -- both in the instructor&#39;s judgment and in my own. I&#39;m still embarrassed at the woeful mess of a paper I offered him. I remember little of it, except its incompetence and the recollection that I used the phrase &quot;a writer of his ilk&quot; -- I can&#39;t remember to which I writer I referred -- and that Poirier wrote a longish exasperated note explaining to me that I did not have the standing to treat any American author with disrespect. However, the honest-to-goodness reason why I did so badly in the course was that Poirier expected his students to think -- and thinking was not an area in which I was gifted. I had discovered early in my educational career that my memory was far superior to most of my contemporaries, that I had an ear for language, and that I had a moderately fluent prose style. But I never, ever, possessed a logical, orderly, or penetrating intelligence. (I could remember sentences and phrases and whole poems, but not arguments or chains of reasoning).&#0160; My skills were sufficient for literary study -- indeed I doubt that I could have managed an academic career in any other discipline.</p>
<p>In fact, I did rather well&#0160;in studies&#0160;with most of&#0160;my graduate-school professors -- distinguished&#0160;and learned gentlemen all of them -- who&#0160;were&#0160;so happy to encounter facility that they didn&#39;t notice the want of brain.</p>
<p>It is curious that some of the most profoundly learned of my professors were the least adventurous of thinkers. I remember, particularly, Douglas Bush, now a mere trivia question, but a most renowned scholar in his day, whose superficial, fey, conservative, neoChristianist, pixie observations on Spenser and Milton I duly recorded. for two endless semesters, learning absolutely nothing of worth or value.</p>
<p>Poirier was more serious. Only 35 (I was 21), he was thinking deeply about the qualities that made American literature distinctive (he was formulating the ideas that came together in <em>A World Elsewhere</em>). He was an intellectual rather than an academic. It would have been wise for me to have listened carefully to him. I might have learned something.&#0160;</p>
<p>It&#39;s shocking to me that the young, dashing lecturer whom I remember so clearly could be so old, so dead -- but there&#39;s no denying that half a century has slipped away since I last listened to his rumbling voice.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>

                                <p>For the new downtown apartment, we&#39;ve purchased a Sonos ZonePlayer. What does this oddly-named machine do?&#0160; It simply allows me to capture the signal of radio statios all over the world (through the internet connection), pipe them through the amplifier, and broadcast&#0160;them on our old but functional speakers.</p>
<p>Quite a step up in standard of living, especially since&#0160;over-the-air reception in our mountain town is severely compromised by the bumpy terrain</p>
<p>With&#0160;this new device, I can listen to classical music stations from all the capitols of Europe -- all over the planet, in fact. I can choose from among&#0160;5 or 6 crystal-clear stations dedicated entirely to opera, as well as a&#0160;few that specialize in the baroque period, or in chamber music, or piano.&#0160;There are also five Beatles stations, one of them&#0160;from Moscow!&#0160; Several &quot;big band&quot; stations. An all&#0160;Grateful Dead specialist beaming directly to me from&#0160;Connecticut. An all Bruce, all the time.</p>
<p>I&#0160;love the &quot;Paris Chanson&quot; station, twenty-four hours a day of Edith Piaf and friends,&#0160;from Tokyo.</p>
<p>But so far my favorite is&#0160;the all doo-wop station out of&#0160;Winter Haven, Florida, which, on demand, has the power to return me to my&#0160;teen-age years.&#0160;Just now I heard the Jacks&#39; plaintive, &quot;Why Don&#39;t You Write Me,&quot; a song which functioned, earlier in my life, as a personal anthem of&#0160;self-flagellation. And just at this moment,&#0160;a glorious version (and one that I didn&#39;&#39;t know) of the much-recorded &quot;The Glory of Love.&quot;&#0160; Aural bliss!&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>What&#39;s missing?&#0160; A good American roots (1920s and 1930s)&#0160;station. A station specializing in 1940s and 1950s black gospel -- definitely not &quot;contemporary gospel&quot; -- which, according to&#0160;AH, the world&#39;s expert, is called contemporary&#0160;because it is both&#0160;a &quot;con&quot; and &quot;temporary.&quot;&#0160; An all Gilbert and Sullivan station -- but perhaps that would be a gift too precious to imagine?</p>
<p>But if&#0160; there can be&#0160;eight&#0160;all-Elvis stations, shouldn&#39;t there be at least one that is all-Haydn, all the time?</p>
<p>And yet&#0160;I&#39;ve only begun to search.&#0160;&#0160;Who knows what other pleasures are out there in modern radioland?</p>

                                <p>&quot;I was born in 1920 in Bayonne. I had four older sisters.&#0160;When I was eleven, my mother died and my father disappeared.&#0160;I was taken in by my sister Jennie and her husband Jack.&#0160;She was eighteen, he was nineteen.&#0160;They raised me.&#0160;I graduated from Bayonne High School in 1938.&#0160;For years I&#0160;worked for an insurance company in New York City.&#0160;I started at&#0160;$5 a week.&#0160;I lived with Jack and Jennie in Bergenfield.&#0160;I took the bus and then a train and then a subway.&#0160;One of my girlfriends was seeing a guy, I can&#39;t remember his name, but he had a friend named Dave.&#0160;I married Dave in 1942.&#0160;He was sent overseas, I didn&#39;t see him for three years. In Oman, he was coming off a ship, they were shooting at them, he was wounded right here, if it had been an inch this way&#0160;I wouldn&#39;t have any children.&#0160;Dave&#39;s father had a business, Broadway Arcade on Broadway and 53rd Street.&#0160;Dave took over the business. He was a good mechanic. We had Madame Esmerelda the fortune teller.&#0160;Pinball, skiball.&#0160;In the basement were pool tables, we sublet the space.&#0160;It was a good business. We were famous for our nuts. We had two boys, Steve and Mark.&#0160; Steve ran the&#0160;Arcade after we moved to Florida, Mark is a food chemist. The Arcade is closed now -- the landlord kept raising the rent.&#0160;If we had bought the building I&#39;d be rolling in it.&#0160;Dave died at 68 in 1987.&#0160;I play mah-jong&#0160;once a week.&#0160;I go bowling once a week.&#0160;My team is in first place.&#0160;I take my sister Sophie with me but she can&#39;t see well enough to bowl.&#0160;She&#39;s ninety-six. So I&#39;ve been married, it&#39;s sixty-seven years.&#0160; Hard to believe.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Evreryone down here, all they ever talk about is their pains, their doctors, their diets, their diseases.&#0160; Now&#0160;I have something to talk about.&#0160; For years I went to this doctor, maybe forty years, he&#39;s almost as old as I am&#0160; Every time I go into see him, with a sore knee or pains in the chest or whatever,&#0160;he&#39;d look at it, and he&#39;d say,&#0160;&#39;what can you expect at your age?&#0160; You&#39;re lucky to be alive.&#39; &#0160;I&#39;d go in with a sore throat.&#0160; He&#39;d say, &#39;Can you swallow.&#0160;So what it hurts.&#0160;You&#39;re too old to worry.&#39;&#0160;&#0160;If I had a headache, he&#39;d say,&#0160;&#39;whatever happens, happens.&#0160; You&#39;re old, enjoy the day.&#39;&#0160;&#0160;Finally he retired.&#0160; He took a job as a&#0160;dance instructor on a cruise ship. I&#39;m not kidding. He leads exercises or something.&#0160; So I went to a younger doctor.&#0160; He listens to me breathe, pokes around a bit, puts me in the hospital, and&#0160;now&#0160;I have three stents.&quot;&#0160;</p>

                                <p>Our local chamber players, the Takacs, performed the Schubert Quintet (D.956). It&#39;s a glorious work -- one of the finest in the entire chamber repertoire -- and was brilliantly performed.&#0160; It&#39;s a turbulent, nervous, tense piece of music. With the last notes, the entire audience rose simultaneously to cheer.&#0160; There were fist-pumpings, whistles, &quot;bravos,&quot; &quot;yesses,&quot; and other spontaneous shouts of pleasure from the octogenarian listeners.&#0160; It was a rock and roll moment at Grusin Hall.&#0160;</p>
<p>I cheered too, but not so much for the Takacs as for Schubert.&#0160;&#0160;It&#39;s so often the case that the interpreters are rewarded while the creator is neglected.&#0160; Here&#39;s Schubert, dead of poverty and syphilis and mercury poisoning at age 31, never having made a nickel out of his many compositions.&#0160; In desperate straits, with only two months to live, Schubert sent his new quintet to the Leipzig publisher H. A. Probst. Probst rejected it, asking instead for something &quot;easily understandable.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;The world &quot;does not yet sufficiently and generally understand the peculiar, often&#0160;ingenious,&#0160;but perhaps now and then&#0160;somewhat curious precedures of your mind&#39;s creations.&quot;&#0160; The quintet was first performed in 1850, twenty-two years after&#0160;Schubert breathed his last.</p>
<p>Is there a moral?&#0160; Yes, I think there is.&#0160; If you&#39;re in the composing or painting or novel-writing business, do it your own way -- not the easy way.&#0160; If you lose, you lose.&#0160; So what?&#0160; If you win, you win big.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Last night I&#0160;awoke from troubled sleep with a mysterious and inexplicable&#0160;Latin phrase drumming on my&#0160;agitated brain. As best I can remember the dream, I had taken a razor to an essay I was writing and had cut out the two words--and I mean &quot;cut out&quot; as in scissored, not merely deleted--&quot;sursum corda.&quot;&#0160; And&#0160;then there I was&#0160;with a slip of paper on which the two words were inscribed -- andnow&#0160;comes the nightmare part--I couldn&#39;t translate the damn phrase. I went so far (still in the&#0160;dream!) as to hypothesize&#0160;a past participle &quot;*sursus&quot; of the verb &quot;surgere&quot; (to rise)--although, as everyone knows, the proper form would be&#0160;&quot;surrectus&quot;--but I still couldn&#39;t parse the phrase (*&quot;sursum&quot; or &quot;risen&quot;, would be a singular, &quot;corda,&quot;&#0160;&quot;hearts,&quot; a plural). I forced myself out of sleep,&#0160;distressed&#0160;that I couldn&#39;t&#0160;make sense out of what my dreamatorium was screaming was an important&#0160;phrase. So there I was in the middle of the night, checking the Latin dictionary&#0160;to&#0160;discover that &quot;sursum corda&quot; is a versicle in the Roman mass generally translated &quot;lift up your hearts,&quot; but, inasmuch as&#0160;&quot;sursum,&quot; I&#0160;can now attest, is not a participle but an adverb, might&#0160;more properly come into English as something like &quot;upward&#0160;your hearts.&quot; OK, now I&#0160;understand the phrase, but why&#0160;in the living bejeesus was&#0160;I&#0160;a) dreaming in Latin, b) dreaming a part of a mass, and c) slicing&#0160;the phrase out of&#0160;some papers of my own composition?&#0160;</p>
<p>Enough of that. Back&#0160;to bed, back to sleep and then, holy moly, another weird dream. No more Latin, at least, but now I&#39;m being&#0160;held responsible for the low rate of pollination of&#0160;apple trees. Whose apple&#0160;trees?&#0160; I can&#39;t say.&#0160; And what&#0160;is&#0160;the remedy.&#0160;Brain surgery -- and on my brain. The surgeon announces to me (somehow we&#39;re in a very official looking operating room)&#0160;that &quot;we&#39;re going to&#0160;remove the smallest bone in the human body, which is&#0160;in the hinge to the top of your head.&quot;He takes his scalpel,&#0160;cuts through my hinge, and&#0160;flips opens my skull. Inside the dome&#0160;(somehow I can observe the interior) right where my brain should be, is a heap of glowing stuff that looks like orange Jell-o.</p>
<p>OK,&#0160;that&#39;s enough. Time to wake up once again.&#0160;</p>
<p>Unanswered questions. a) why am I responsible for the fruiting of apples?&#0160; Blame the lazy bees, for goodness sake. b) Who says the smallest bone in the body is this imaginary&#0160;hinge?&#0160; The smallest bone is&#0160;in the inner ear--the stirpes, I think. c)&#0160; what&#39;s with the Jell-o? Just because I couldn&#39;t translate &quot;sursum corda,&quot; must it therefore&#0160;follow that my brain is gelatinous?&#0160; Some of your most intelligent Wall Street investors and bank presidents couldn&#39;t translate sursum corda, and they must be the most accomplished people we have, at least to judge by their annual bonuses.</p>
<p>On the whole, I think that both of these dreams&#0160;put&#0160;me in somewhat of a bad light. Nevertheless, I&#39;m impressed that my unconscious is so gosh-darned creative. Let&#39;s face it -&#0160;it&#39;s a ton more&#0160;imaginative than my daytime self, which doesn&#39;t much concern itself with either the Latin mass or the pollination rates of&#0160;<em>mali domesticae.</em>&#0160;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>In an earlier life, Dr. M. served as&#0160;chair of a large academic department at a state university out here in the American west.&#0160; On the whole, the teachers that Dr. M.&#0160;nominally supervised did their work very well.&#0160; They were responsible, self-motivated, liked their teaching and reading and writing,&#0160;and fortunately, did not expect to be lavishly&#0160;rewarded either in salary or appreciation or assistance.&#0160; But there were a few employees who were difficult.&#0160; There always are.&#0160; Ten per cent of the people take 90% of your time, no matter what the enterprise. </p>
<p>We had very little secretarial staff -- not even enough people to take and relay telephone messages, So (this was before the advent of&#0160;sophisticated electronic communication), innovative chair that I was, I took some scarce departmental funds and purchased inexpensive, tape-driven answering machines and attached one to each professorial telephone.&#0160;&#0160;The theory was simple:&#0160; most of the faculty weren&#39;t in their office many hours a week (nor were they paid to be), but the new technology would allow them to come to work,&#0160;listen to yesterday&#39;s telephone calls, and return messages rapidly and efficiently.&#0160; Ninety-five per cent of the faculty was happy with the new system.&#0160;&#0160;But a few of them&#0160;rebelled.&#0160; One particularly recalictrant member of the faculty -- let us call him RR -- categorically refused to touch his new machine.&#0160; His reasoning:&#0160; pushing the button and playing back the tape was not a &quot;professorial responsibilty&quot;;&#0160; it was mere secretarial work, and in his view&#0160; the new system asked that&#0160;a professor lower himself to the level of staff.&#0160; It would be&#0160;&quot;unprofessional&quot; for him to listen to recorded telephone call, asserted RR..</p>
<p>I should mention that RR was the least distinguished&#0160;member of our faculty.&#0160; He was a poor teacher and his contributions to scholarship lay somewhere between non-existent and negligible, depending on the decade.&#0160; You might think that his sense of nobility derived from a ducal or regal&#0160;grandfather, but not so --he came from a working-class Kansas background, if I remember correctly.</p>
<p>&quot;Professional&quot; is a word about which I have ambivalent feelings.&#0160;In its best incarnation, when it denotes adherence to an internalized set of responsible and shared values, it&#39;s a damn good word and an uplifting concept.&#0160;But there are many occasions when&#0160;&quot;professional&quot; is used to camouflage willfulness, laziness, and privilege, and then it is a word of which I am ashamed.&#0160;&#0160;I take the case of RR to be an example of &quot;professional&quot; used in order to justify&#0160;indolence.&#0160;&#0160;For the rest of my faculty, it was &quot;professional&quot; to make ourselves&#0160;available to the students whom they state paid us to&#0160;educate and assist; not for RR.</p>
<p>I think that RR had a peculiar, retrogressive understanding of university life.&#0160; He didn&#39;t like students or scholarship, but he did enjoy ceremony.&#0160; He was the parliamentarian at meetings of the university&#39;s governing board.&#0160; And every year, at commencement, he was the person who led the procession, bearing the university&#39;s mace (or whatever the heck that strange object was).&#0160;&#0160;Not a born teacher, he was a born presider&#0160;at rituals.&#0160; A large, ponderous fellow, he&#0160;was a terrific mace-bearer -- and a truly crappy colleague.&#0160;</p>
<p>I never did find a way to make him use his answering machine.&#0160;&#0160;If I&#0160;owned the company, I would have fired him in a flash.&#0160; But&#0160;the university likes to separate&#0160;responsibility&#0160;from authority, so all I could do was&#0160;cajole and&#0160;beseech and shame -- a procedure that proved in his case to&#0160;be totally without effect.&#0160;&#0160;You can&#39;t shame the shameless. &#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; </p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Grandma is 96+ years old.&#0160; She&#39;s an accomplished, strong-willed, tough old lady who has survived just about everything life can throw at a person: polio in childhood,&#0160;over two dozen major surgeries, diabetes, and then two times in the last decade, cancer. Now she&#39;s very close to the end.&#0160;&#0160;She has been&#0160;in a nursing home for four years, declining almost imperceptibly from day to day. Until last week, she could carry on a conversation of sorts. But then something happened. She lost the ability to move, even a little; she became agitated, her long-term memory collapsed,&#0160;and she could not, however hard she tried,&#0160;complete a thought&#0160;(though she&#0160;was able to say, and repeat,&#0160;&quot;This dying business doesn&#39;t bother me&quot;). &#0160;She recognized only one person,&#0160;her eldest daughter, and it was not clear that she knew her own name.</p>
<p>For the last six months&#0160;someone at the nursing home has had to help her with fork and spoon. Last week, we decided that to prop her up, sit her at the table, feed&#0160;her cake and then propose that her insulin intake&#0160;be increased&#0160;was a senseless, bizarre procedure.&#0160;&#0160;A compassionate doctor suggested that it was time for insulin and other non-palliative medicines to be withdrawn. We readily agreed. We confronted the head nurse at the nursing home; she announced to us that&#0160;the home&#39;s chief of medicine would reverse the order to withdraw insulin;&#0160; Grandma must be fed (&quot;We&#39;re a nursing home,&quot; she said, &quot;we nurse&quot;). Last Friday, we moved Grandma&#0160;from the nursing home to&#0160;our local hospice.&#0160; Grandma immediately stopped eating and drinking. I would like to think that she chose to&#0160;give up food, but there&#39;s no way to know. Her&#0160;eyes have a&#0160;glazed, far away look on the rare occasions that she is strong enough to open them. She fumbles with the sheets.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, on Monday, hospice told us that they couldn&#39;t keep her. She&#39;s not &quot;actively dying&quot; -- according to the official Medicare rules -- and is therefore not eligible for hospice.&#0160;Where to take her?&#0160; Unclear.&#0160; We negotiated a two-week reprieve. Grandma will be&#0160;allowed to remain in hospice&#0160;as a private patient for fourteen days, but unless she starts &quot;actively dying&quot; during that period, she&#39;ll be expelled. We cried.</p>
<p>Yesterday, however, we were told that Grandma&#0160;had taken a step forward.&#0160; She&#39;s &quot;entered her process&quot; --another bit of&#0160;hospicespeak.&#0160; She&#39;s experiencing, we&#39;re told,&#0160;sufficient&#0160;pain to warrant&#0160;morphine and her heartbeat has become&#0160;rapid&#0160;and irregular.&#0160;&#0160;She&#0160;is&#0160;&quot;less responsive.&quot;&#0160; Good news for Grandma, I guess.&#0160; Unless she &quot;plateaus&quot; and stops &quot;actively dying,&quot; she&#39;ll be allowed to stay to the finish,&#0160;which, if there&#39;s any mercy,&#0160;will not be very long.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Here&#39;s what Kent says about Lear, at the end.&#0160; &quot;O let him pass.&#0160; He hates him/ Who would upon the rack of this tough world,/ &#0160;Stretch him out longer.&quot;</p>
<p>January 17.&#0160; Grandma died last night, having squeezed the last drop out of life and sliced&#0160;through the last shred&#0160;of bureaucratic red tape.</p>

                                <p>I&#39;m reading, or re-reading (what does it matter when it&#39;s been fifty years since the last go-around) Henry James&#39; <em>The Wings of the Dove. </em>Once again, I&#39;m variously stimulated, frustrated and infuriated. Has there ever been a writer who cries out to be parodied more than does Hank the J? Try to resist the impulse to make fun house mirrors of this representative, convoluted sentence.</p>
<p>&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&quot;Her welcome, her frankness, sweetness, sadness, brightness, her disconcerting poetry, as he made shift at moments to call it, helped as it was by the beauty of her whole setting and by the perception at the same time, on the observer&#39;s part, that this element gained from her, in a manner, for effect and harmony, as much as it gave -- her whole attitude had, to his imagination, meanings that hung about it, waiting upon her, hovering dropping and quavering forth again, like vague faint snatches, mere ghosts of sound, of old-fashioned melancholy music.&quot;</p>
<p>Let me guess that most of Dr. M.&#39;s loyal readers did not finish reading the quoted bit. They made a good faith attempt at the first few words, then whistled, threw up their metaphorical hands, and surrendered. Or if they did get all the way to the end of the sentence, they were certainly puzzled as to whether they had fully deciphered the Jamesian code. It&#39;s not that the sentence has no meaning, but is it worth a reader&#39;s time to parse and disentangle its many syntactic knots? Now, dear friends, just Imagine 539 small-print pages of prose, every paragraph on every page loaded with similar abstractions, assertions, modifications, withdrawals, subordinations, and equivocations. It&#39;s taxing. James takes it out of you, wears you down.</p>
<p>And therefore let me confess that a big chunk of my Henry James problem is that it&#39;s so damn hard to keep the ol&#39; eye on the ball when every sentence is so laborious to construe. In most novels, readers are pulled along by the plot. You might have trouble &quot;getting into it,&quot; but once you do, your attention is galvanized and you start to sail. In the case of HJ, there&#39;s very little plot, very little in the way of story. It&#39;s all hyper-subtle character analysis and teasing conversation. I can&#39;t speak for every reader, but I must admit that, while reading <em>Wings</em>, my mind frequently took flight. I regularly had to forcibly snap myself back to attention. It&#39;s anything but effortless to stay with the Jamester.&#0160;</p>
<p>But let me return to the exemplary sentence that I quoted above. The two key words are &quot;poetry&#39; (line 1) and &quot;meanings&quot; (line 5).&#0160; To paraphrase: she (i.e. James&#39;s character Millie Theale) has &quot;poetry&quot; and the situation has &quot;meanings.&quot; Underneath all the wobbly circumlocutions, that&#39;s kind of it.</p>
<p>But neither of these two crucial nouns gives much away. What sort of poetry does Millie &#39;have,&#39; you might ask?&#39; What particular &#39;meanings&#39; inhere in the situation? I myself want --crave, in fact -- further definition and explication. That&#39;s the novelist&#39;s job. If he wants to keep me happy and focused, he has to provide considerably more specificity that HJames deigns to supply. Words such as &quot;poetry&quot; and &quot;meanings&quot; don&#39;t constrain a reader;&#0160; rather, they are empty vessels into which I, or any other reader, can pour a variety of significations. The reader, i.e. me, is simply asked to do far too much of the work. I resent it, some of the time.&#0160;</p>
<p>Which takes me back to where I came in, in the 50s and 60s, when James was the king of the American canon -- or at least he was very much the boss in the Large Eastern University where I was a graduate student in literature. I don&#39;t know how my ever-so-civilized teachers managed it, but to appreciate and understand Henry James was framed not as a test of the author&#39;s creative skill, but as a test of the reader&#39;s sensitivity. James, it was confidently and regularly asserted, was subtle, delicate, loaded to the gills with the most exquisite sensibility. Did I, a kid from Coney Island Avenue, possess the sophistication, the tact, the sensitivity to grasp James superfine insights and his characters&#39; inclinations and velleities?</p>
<p>You know what? I didn&#39;t.I failed the test.</p>
<p>James portrays a world to which I could not easily relate. No one in <em>Wings of a Dove </em>works for living.The characters all live off their incomes, derived who knows how? When HJ has to bring two characters together, he has two choices and two choices only -- a dinner party or a chance encounter at a museum. Action?&#0160; Yes, the characters travel from one resort city to another. I&#39;m exaggerating just the tiniest bit. There is one character in <em>Wings </em>who has an occupation. Although we never see him at work, Merton Densher is a journalist. Which is precisely his problem. How can he be a suitable mate for Kate Croy if he has a job? How shockingly vulgar!&#0160;</p>
<p>It was a chore to take James seriously, especially in 1960 and especially for someone of my background. But then, not to take James seriously, not to understand him, was presumed to disqualify a guy from the serious study of literature. Which turned out not to be the case.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>But I&#39;m glad to say that I persevered with Wings. If I hadn&#39;t, I never would have re-read the infinitely splendid, magnificently tawdry piece of dialogue between Densher and Croy that brings Book 8 to a conclusion -- a conversation that&#39;s as well done as anything in English since WS lay down his quill in 1613.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>Coming soon to these pages: my Marcel Proust problem. Hint: way worse than my James problem.</p>

                                <p>Praise for what is not praiseworthy is mere flattery. All the more so, if fair words gain advantage. Praise even of the dead is suspect if it flatters survivors. Persons in authority must be wary of false praise: be mindful that for every man who praises you, ninety-nine hold their peace or mutter imprecations aside. &#0160;A friend of long standing said to me, &quot;You are the hardest person to praise of anyone I&#39;ve ever known,&quot; by which words he meant to tax me, but which I took as compliment. I offer praise generously when it is merited, but not for ordinary deeds. Of a churlish man, it was justly said at his funeral, that he was a good speller; of a sloven, that his fingernails had never been so clean. Praise need not be effusive and is most sincere if simply couched. I was once most happy to be praised, when a discreet man, looking over a landscape of which I am vain, said to a friend who marveled, &quot;He works on it.&quot;&#0160; Of all virtues, I am most apt to praise diligence, the want of which I deplore in myself. Children are most easy to praise as they know not irony.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>It was the evening of a cloudy day and I had my face in among the clumps of blooming day lilies, which I was trying to protect from the constant encroachment of witch grass. It&#39;s a minor art -- to lie on the ground and reach arm&#39;s length into the forest of leaves, careful not to knock the fragile buds off the scapes, and identify and remove the underground stems of the witch grass by feel alone. I had pulled out a heap of noxious weeds and was lost, absolutely lost, in the project, when suddenly, from behind my back the about-to-set sun emerged and illuminated the scene&#0160; &#0160;For no more than thirty seconds the day lily spectrum was on full display: apricot, pink, a range of yellows, each slightly different from its neighbor, a near white, along with a few fully saturated, shimmering crimsons, plus some bi-colors with their cute contrasting throats. For a glorious moment, everything leaped at me. It was truly theatrical to be surrounded by such brilliant colors and shapes and fragrances -- a rare and memorable instance of transcendent aesthetic bliss.&#0160;</p>
<p>The next day, on he telephone, I tried to convey my rapture to The Daughter. She was concerned. One of her friends had had a similar moment. Her friend was walking in the Colorado mountains and came upon a magnificent field of wild flowers. The experience was powerful and life-changing, and she&#39;s now, after years of study, an Episcopal priest. &quot;You&#39;re not going to tell me that it was a religious experience, are you?&quot; I could hear the worry in her voice. My response: &quot;I would have thought you&#39;d have known me better than that.&quot;</p>
<p>Some people conflate beauty with spirituality and religion. I&#39;m not one of those people. Beauty is transcendent, yes, but it&#39;s also material and explicable.&#0160;</p>
<p>No question but that the profusion of day lily colors is glorious. For a hundred years now, careful hybridizers have worked on the homely fulvous lily, a roadside weed sometimes inelegantly called the &quot;outhouse lily&quot;, and have transformed it into the bearer of the rainbow colors in which it now sparkles.&#0160; Thank you, clever day lily breeders, for your generations of imaginative work. Thanks also to the parcel post driver who every year brings me three or four more new varieties from Oakes in Tennessee. And while I&#39;m at it, I would also like to thank the people who designed and built that brown truck and its rubber tires and constructed the roads and refined the gasoline -- no border of day lilies without their help. Nor without the designers and manufacturers of my spade and my favorite dibble and my all-purpose dandelion puller. I could add other equally essential people -- go right back to the first practitioners of smelting -- but I think I&#39;ve made my point.&#0160; The day lilies do not declare the glory of god; they declare the glory of human civilization and human enterprise.&#0160;</p>
<p>I&#0160; grow a single wild fulvous lily on the grounds, just as a reminder.</p>
<p>It&#39;s drab.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>The most widely-known as well as the most notorious poem of the second half of the twentieth century is Philip Larkin&#39;s &quot;This Be the Verse.&quot; For those of you who don&#39;t know the poem by heart, here it is in its brief and startling entirety.</p>
<p>They fuck you up, your mum and dad.</p>
<p>&#0160; They may not mean to, but they do.</p>
<p>They fill you with the faults they had</p>
<p>&#0160; And add some extra, just for you.</p>
<p>But they were fucked up in the turn</p>
<p>&#0160; By fools in old style hats and coats,</p>
<p>Who half the time were soppy-stern,</p>
<p>&#0160; And half at one another&#39;s throats.</p>
<p>Man adds on misery to man.</p>
<p>&#0160; It deepens like a coastal shelf.</p>
<p>Get out as early as you can,</p>
<p>&#0160; And don&#39;t have any kids yourself.</p>
<p>Pessimistic? Jaded? Angry?&#0160; Yes, I think it&#39;s fair to call it so. And let&#39;s also add, unsubtle with a vengeance.</p>
<p>Larkin is hyperbolically illogical. It can&#39;t be that every generation is more deranged than the one that preceded it. When were the good times? A few generations ago?&#0160; In the medieval period?&#0160; In antiquity?&#0160; In Larkin&#39;s view, it&#39;s been all downhill, all the time. No doubt those early primates were already fucking up their kids when they came down from the trees and started to walk upright on the savannah. &quot;There&#39;s only one piece of roasted rhinoceros left. You take it. I don&#39;t mind being hungry.&quot;</p>
<p>Despite its dyspepsia and illogicality, &quot;This Be the Verse&quot; is a curiously lovable poem. Whenever I&#39;ve heard it read or recited, audiences react not with horror but with amusement. The poem&#39;s misanthropy is so absolute and its language so blunt that it can&#39;t help but provoke tittering.</p>
<p>The laughter arises because the poem doesn&#39;t earn its pessimism. It&#39;s too fluent and too easy. Unlike, say, <em>King Lear, </em>where the sublunary world is rank with incest, betrayal, and murder.&#0160; After three thousand lines and five full horrific acts, Shakespeare acquires the standing to conclude that life is miserable and that &quot;humanity must perforce/ Prey on itself, like monsters of the deep.&quot;</p>
<p>The events in <em>Oedipus </em>lend credibility to the difficult apercu that it&#39;s best not to be born at all, next best to die very young.</p>
<p>While Shakespeare and Sophocles are philosophically serious, Larkin is merely flip. There&#39;s a monumental disproportion between his gloom and the light-verse vessel in which his gloom is contained. And as a consequence, the off-kilter comedy. It&#39;s a whiny poem. &quot;Poor poor pitiful me. I had a difficult mommy.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>If &quot;This Be the Verse&quot; is in fact the most popular poem of the last fifty years, it supersedes Frost&#39;s &quot;Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening.&quot; What a remarkable devolution! While Frost endures, Larkin abhors.</p>
<p>I doubt whether Larkin had &quot;Stopping by Woods&quot; in mind, but he certainly glosses Robert Louis Stevenson&#39;s &quot;Requiem&quot; -- the poem from which he drew his title. Stevenson&#39;s performance is charming, gentle, self-effacing, and modest.&#0160;</p>
<p>Under the wide and starry sky,</p>
<p>Dig the grave and let me lie.</p>
<p>Glad did I live and gladly die.</p>
<p>And laid me down with a will.</p>
<p>This be the verse you grave for me:</p>
<p><em>Here he lies where he longed to be.</em></p>
<p><em>Home is the sailor, home from the sea,</em></p>
<p><em>And the hunter home from the hill. </em></p>
<p>Stevenson praises the adventurous life lived well and brought to completion. Death may end it all but it also closes the circle. No completion, no circles in Larkin, where natural processes are crudely truncated: &quot;don&#39;t have any kids yourself.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This Be the Verse&quot; is a hilarious and wonderful piece of joking, but it&#39;s victimology is unsettling. It&#39;s tempting to claim that it satirizes its own pessimism, but, sorry, it doesn&#39;t. Larkin loves his own gloom.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s another Victorian variation on the thema Larkiniana.</p>
<p>Is life a thorn?</p>
<p>Then count it not a whit.</p>
<p>Man is well done with it.</p>
<p>As soon as he&#39;s born,</p>
<p>He should all means assay</p>
<p>To put the plague away.</p>
<p>Pessimistic, yes.&#0160; But Colonel Fairfax, even-handed, also entertains the possibility that life might be a boon (which, as we all know, is true for at least part of the time).&#0160;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>When we arrived in West Bradford forty years ago, there were lots of cows but very few people. The main road was unpaved and aside from morning-and-evening milk trucks and the tractors pulling hay wagons, there were very few vehicles. Now, they&#39;ve run electricity out Welch&#39;s old road and must have built forty new homes and as a result there are a ton more folks who commute south. (In the 1960s, the nearest exit off the interestate was thirty-five miles away; now, the interstate is just five miles away.) Very few milking cows are left nowadays -- some horses, some sheep, some heifers raised for beef. Hobby farms, mostly. Inch by inch we&#39;ve been surburbanized. Or more properly, exurbanized.&#0160;</p>
<p>In the 1960s, when two cars passed on the road, the drivers would often stop to chat, knowing that it wasn&#39;t likely that another vehicle would pass by for a half an hour. If they didn&#39;t stop to talk, they&#39;d at least wave. It was bad manners not to acknowledge an oncoming vehicle. I remember that Ron Jepson, now long dead, who made a living off twelve acres and a handful of cows, complained to me once about one of our neighborhood grumps. &quot;He doesn&#39;t even wave when he goes by.&quot; Not waving was an intolerable breach of road etiquette.</p>
<p>What&#39;s happened to the custom? The wave is in steep decline and only survives as a vestige of an older way of life. When we take our morning walk on South Road or on Hackett Hill Road, I make a point of waving at the oncoming drivers. The response is inconsistent. There&#39;s a rare enthusiastic open palm wrist-waggle, an occasional mock salute, and sometimes a big windshield wiper wave, but more often merely a perfunctory palm lift off the steering wheel. Sometimes the palm lift is reduced even further, to a right index finger lift -- a feeble gesture to antiquity.&#0160; Half the drivers don&#39;t wave at all; they are recent immigrants who don&#39;t know that the wave has a history. They&#39;re in a hurry to get where they&#39;re going, wherever that may be.&#0160;</p>
<p>Clearly, the great age of waving has passed. But not for all of us. That will be me out there on the side of the road, elbow raised and wrist oscillating, clinging to the customs of our forefathers.&#0160; &#0160;</p>

                                <p>My granddaughter Ella, who is pushing six, is here for a brief visit.&nbsp; Yesterday, after catching four salamanders, kicking the soccer ball, planting the yellow snap beans, and running in exuberant circles, she asked me to tell her a story.&nbsp; I'll report only the gist of my long, detailed, but uninspired narrative.&nbsp; </p>

<p>A young princess is born with a birthmark on her back in the shape of a red heart.&nbsp; Her parents consult a wizard, who tells them that their daughter is destined to marry a powerful, handsome prince.&nbsp; The parents are elated and the princess grows up with the guarantee of a blissful marriage.&nbsp; However, one day, when the princess is in high school and trying out for the swimming team, one of her friends notices the birthmark and asks her why she has a birthmark on her back in the shape of a diamond.&nbsp; &quot;A diamond?&quot; says the princess.&nbsp; She consults the wizard who tells her that she's not going to marry a prince after all;&nbsp; instead, she's going to have to carve out her own career.&nbsp; She'll have to study her French, take her piano lessons seriously, learn arithmetic and work very hard in school.&nbsp; So the princess takes the advice and becomes a very diligent and hard-working young girl and has many successes.</p>

<p>I was now putting myself to sleep with this highly moral and improbable tale, so I asked Ella whether she would finish the story.&nbsp; &quot;Sure,&quot; she said, &quot; one day the diamond turned back into a heart and she married the prince and lived happily ever after.&quot; </p>

<p>So much for contemporary, enlightened fairy tales.&nbsp; </p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>One of my childhood friends confesses to me that his otherwise peaceful early years were marred by a perfectly unnecessary bit of fighting -- which he himself initiated. &quot;We were in the middle of a softball game in the P. S. 217 schoolyard and I struck out with two or three men on base. One of my teammates said something uncomplimentary to me and started to walk away. Humiliated and frustrated, I charged after him and jumped on his back. I&#39;m not sure what I intended to do (my fighting skills were even worse than my softball skills).&quot;</p>
<p>This less-than-earthshaking softballmachia occurred somewhere between fifty-five and sixty years ago. It is impossible that anyone in the known universe remembers either the score, the sides, the game, the strikeout, or one boy&#39;s vault onto the back of another -- no one, that is, except the perpetrator himself, who goes on to confess that he is &quot;embarrassed and ashamed even now.&quot;&#0160; I do not doubt for an instant that he&#39;s telling the exact truth, because even though glaciers have receded and oceans of water have passed under the bridge, embarrassment is forever.</p>
<p>Like my friend, and like many another poor suffering mortal, I too retain ancient memories that make me cringe.&#0160; A few of these acts, I&#39;m sorry to say, are, like my friend&#39;s, instances of unjustified and petty violence. A larger category: the recollection of saying something stupid at a party or over dinner. Or a lame, feeble, failed witticism. An irony that was misunderstood and taken to be serious. A mispronounced word. The realization that my presence was unwelcome or that I had overstayed my welcome. The largest category of all: something that I did or said that was vain or pretentious or self-aggrandizing.</p>
<p>My Better Half, who knows that often, half-asleep, I will suddenly recall an embarrassing moment and will vent a profound sigh or pound my fist into &quot;Everyone who heard what you said has been dead for years. Go back to sleep.&quot; It&#39;s a good protocol and is moderately effective. But the hallmark of authentic embarrassment is that even though the offending act was performed in public, it will be recollected in solitude years later to disorder our tranquility and to disturb our rest. Whether the witnesses have long since forgotten the event (if they noticed it in the first place) or even if they&#39;ve been underground for decades doesn&#39;t seem to moderate self-flagellation.</p>
<p>In point of fact, embarrassment is the only natural phenomenon that has tempted me to believe, even slightly, in an afterlife. If anything is eternal, it&#39;s embarrassment.</p>
<p>It is sometimes said that Western society has evolved from a shame culture to a guilt culture. In earlier ages, social disapproval kept the lid on our transgressive impulses. Nowadays, the theory goes, we&#39;ve been psychologically transformed and have learned to internalize shame as guilt, so that we regulate ourselves without our fellow tribesman crying tut-tut and shame, shame, shame. Perhaps there&#39;s a bit of truth to this formula, but it&#39;s simplistic. In my own fragile ego, guilt has not supplanted shame; both emotions are thriving rather nicely, thank you very much.</p>
<p>Embarrassment is neither guilt nor shame, but a third thing that combines the two emotions -- as for example in the case of Joey Valachi, mafia hit man and stool pigeon, who once told an investigating committee, and I quote <em>verbatim, &quot;</em>you can imagine my embarrassment when I killed the wrong guy.&quot; An awkward moment for Joey V., but whether its memory would be sufficient to disturb his pleasant dreams is not for me to guess. It is certainly embarrassing to all concerned that he would classify a murder as an embarrassment. Compare Macbeth in the same situation:&#0160; &quot;O full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife.&quot;</p>
<p>I guess I should be happy that my sleep is troubled by social gaffes rather than by crimes. Mini-scorpions, so to speak.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p><a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2007/11/empson.html">Last week</a> I reported that in 1929 William Empson was expelled and expunged from Cambridge University for owning a condom, a circumstance that I judged to be an scandalous instance of ancient prudery. But in thanks to one of those fascinating moments of cultural convergence, I&#39;ve just re-read, after almost fifty years, Philip Roth&#39;s <em>Goodbye, Columbus, </em>which also turns on a discovered contraceptive -- in the latter case, a diaphragm. Readers of the novella will remember that Roth&#39;s Newark alter ago, Neil Klugman, enjoys a summer romance with rich &#39;Cliffie Brenda Patimkin and pressures her to obtain a pessary. In due time the incriminating object is discovered by Brenda&#39;s protective, overbearing mother. Shock and outrage ensues, and the romance founders.&#0160; </p>
<p>When I read about the Empson-Cambridge contraceptive scandal, I felt as though I was entering an alien, distant and incomprehensible past. But <em>Goodbye Columbus </em>appeared in 1959, when I was an undergraduate at Cornell -- and is therefore very much a part of my conscious lifetime. Nor is Roth inaccurate about 50s sexual prudery. Contraceptives were difficult to obtain (even for married folk) and pre-marital sex was still taboo -- though, I must say, a taboo honored more in the breach than the observance. The old ways were slowly changing. In 1958, I participated in my first political demonstration -- or riot -- when Cornell authorities tried to prohibit women from visiting men&#39;s off-campus apartments. We staged a late-night moderately out-of-control protest march to the president&#39;s office. It was an all-male event because after 11 pm, women were confined to their all-female dormitories.(The action is recorded in Richard Farina&#39;s <em>Been Down So Long It Seems Like Up to Me </em>[1966]). It all seems so positively quaint now -- the university trying to police our sexual life and all that. Parents nowadays, at least the parents that I know, would be delighted to learn that their college-age daughters are using contraceptives.</p>
<p>In <em>Goodbye, Columbus</em>, Neil Klugman accuses Brenda of allowing her diaphragm to be discovered so that she can end the uneasy romance. Neil&#39;s argument seemed rational in 1959, but it no longer does so. From the vantage of 2007, it&#39;s clear that the many Roth alter egos have consistently been able to find justifications and excuses to end both their affairs and their marriages. Klugman, and Kepesh, and Zuckerman are never, ever, going to be more than momentarily and intermittently loyal or satisfied, but on the whole it&#39;s going to be circumstances, not their own volition, which causes them to flee. We didn&#39;t know that then. In 1959, <em>Goodbye, Columbus </em>seemed like a disinterested clearing of the Victorian air; now it has been transformed into a overture&#0160; to Roth&#39;s long and tormented psychosexual opera. </p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>It&#39;s easy to forget that our immediate forebears were absurdly prudish. Consider the case of William Empson, who ran afoul of the sex police in the late 1920s.</p>
<p> Empson may be the most influential literary critic of the previous century. All &quot;close reading&quot; was pioneered by him. <em>Seven Types of Ambiguity</em>, written when Empson was twenty-one years old and published in 1930, was the book with which my teachers were still wrestling well into the 1950s. Prompted by their puzzlement and by their enthusiasm, I dutifully read all about &quot;ambiguity&quot; and I also tried my best with the equally influential <em>Some Versions of Pastoral </em>(1935). In all frankness, both books were far too subtle for my blunt, unphilosophical brain. In 1961, when I was a graduate student, the pious and reactionary Douglas Bush, whose course in Milton was thrice-weekly transporting me to the caves of Morpheus, dismissed Empson&#39;s ground-breaking <em>Milton&#39;s God (</em>1961) as the work of the &quot;village atheist.&quot;&#0160; (Empson thought that Christianity was a cruel and savage religion because it was grounded in scapegoating; he demonstrated that <em>Paradise Lost </em>became muddy and opaque when Milton struggled with the ethical basis of core Christian doctrines. In later years, the literary leviathanette Stanley Fish made his reputation by domesticating, diluting, and popularizing Empson&#39;s challenging ideas.)</p>
<p>Although I had lived with Empson&#39;s work since mid-century, I had absolutely no knowledge of the author&#39;s troubled private life until I read John Haffenden&#39;s <em>William Empson, Among the Mandarins </em>(Oxford, 2005) which at 695 pages is the first of a projected two-volume biography. (It&#39;s far too detailed; let me confess to skipping and skimming.)&#0160; </p>
<p>As a student at Magdalen College, Cambridge, Empson was mostly homosexual.&#0160; Haffenden says that he was interested in &quot;male bliss and buggery.&quot; The upper-class students with whom Empson interacted were gay-tolerant and the authorities practiced a <em>de facto &quot;</em>don&#39;t ask-don&#39;t tell&quot; policy.&#0160; In 1929, Empson was elected to the prestigious Charles Kingsley Bye-Fellowship, which paid the then-splendid sum of 150 pounds annually. By that time, Empson had turned his attention to the other gender and was conducting an affair with a woman named Elizabeth Wiskemann who was seven years his senior. Somehow or other, a porter, an employee of the College, &quot;found that Empson had some contraceptives in his possession.&quot; It was a scandal and Empson was arraigned by the college authorities for &quot;sexual misconduct.&quot; He was stripped of his fellowship, expelled, his name expunged from the college records, and he was even banished from the city of Cambridge (by what authority Haffenden doesn&#39;t make clear).</p>
<p>For using contraceptives! For sexual relations with a woman! For preventing pregnancy! Clearly, Empson should have stuck to boys or kept clear of condoms.</p>
<p>Let us remember the situation of William Empson whenever conservative commentators trumpet &quot;family values&quot; and call for a return to the stricter sexual codes of previous generations. Or when we might be tempted to admire the wisdom of our ancestors.&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; </p>

                                <p>&quot;Skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it is,&quot; said the Great One, famously.&#0160; There you have it: perfect advice for hockey players.&#0160; It goes without saying that Gretsky&#39;s sentence applies equally well to entrepreneurs, intellectuals, artists, and in fact, to anyone who has to cope with a world in continual flux. Ah, but how can anyone know where the puck is going to be next second, or next week, or a decade hence?&#0160; Gretzky was one of those rare intuitive geniuses who did it all by instinct.&#0160; Ordinary mortals must wrack their tiny brains until their heads hurt to guess at the trajectory of their own particular puck.&#0160; Most of us, no matter how hard we try, are doomed to skate counter.&#0160; There are other people (alas, I&#39;m one of them) who skate aimlessly, only dimly aware that somewhere out there on the field of play is a target puck.&#0160; Gretzky&#39;s wisdom deserves a prominent spot on the refrigerator of every moderately forward-looking, ambitious human being, where it can hang as both goad and frustration.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s another brilliant bit of Gretskyiana:&#0160; &quot;You miss 100% of the shots you don&#39;t take.&quot;</p>
<p>Let us now turn to wisdom from Alan Sillitoe (young &#39;uns might not remember Sillitoe, but he was one of the important &#39;angry&#39; English writers of the 1950s).&#0160; Sillitoe blessed us with the forceful and epigrammatic truth that &quot;all writing is fiction, especially non-fiction.&quot;&#0160; I particularly savor that uncompromising, zingy &quot;especially.&quot;&#0160; If I understand rightly, Sillitoe meant that a) no matter how faithful to experience a writer wishes to be, the act of writing inevitably emphasizes or omits or compresses or expands and therefore transforms experience into a story, a fiction.&#0160; And he also implied that b) no matter how factual the information, if it doesn&#39;t tell a story and act as a fiction it&#39;s not going to make its point.&#0160; &#0160;Moreover, and more subtly, he meant that c) any story is ineluctably influenced and shaped by common modes of storytelling, and even against a writer&#39;s will assimilates itself to existing genres.&#0160; Bloggers, for example, are willy-nilly fictioneers who can&#39;t help writing bloglike posts.&#0160; But beware:&#0160; Alan Sillitoe most definitely did not mean to imply that because all narratives are culturally and artistically determined that they are therefore equivalent in value or truth;&#0160; he was a practiced, practical writer, not some post-modern theory-soaked obscurantist.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>Here&#39;s wisdom from the great Anatole Broyard.&#0160; &#0160;Of his adolescence, he wrote, memorably, &quot;if it hadn&#39;t been for books, we&#39;d have been entirely at the mercy of sex.&quot;&#0160; &quot;Mercy&quot; is the well-chosen word that makes the sentence so piquant.&#0160; Books, says Broyard, have the power to civilize all of us, even pubescents.&#0160; Books can, and did, rescue him.&#0160; As for myself, if I remember accurately, adolescence was, in spite of extra-large doses of books, merciless.&#0160;</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know who first said that &quot;you can&#39;t coach seven feet,&quot; but it&#39;s a common enough saying.&#0160; It doesn&#39;t mean that that you can&#39;t coach a seven-footer, but that no matter how much instruction you offer a guy who&#39;s five-ten, he&#39;s never going to be seven feet tall or fill the space on the floor that requires a seven-footer.&#0160; As I once heard a track coach remark, &quot;I can teach them everything but speed.&quot;&#0160; A similar sentence, of baseball pitchers: &quot;you have to be born with the whip.&quot;&#0160; For those of us who tried to teach less exotic subjects, I can offer some parallels from my own experience.&#0160; &quot;You can&#39;t coach brains&quot;;&#0160; &quot;you can&#39;t coach talent.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>But you can do something.&#0160; You can, in words of great uncommon wisdom, &quot;play the hand you&#39;re dealt.&quot;</p>

                                <p>So I&#39;ve been trying, by god, to figure out why the riding mower has been cutting on an angle, the right side leaving the grass higher than the left, and I&#39;ve been crawling under the machine looking at the cutting deck from all angles and not able to understand the mechanism except it&#39;s obvious that it&#39;s not parallel to the ground, and my neighbor Ed was by and he&#39;s kind of a genius with machinery which I most definitely am not, and I said to him, Ed would you take look and see why the mower is cutting at an angle and he said, Well, here&#39;s one problem your left rear tire is flat which made me feel really dumb because I was so busy trying to understand the suspension system on the deck that I never even looked at the tire and I said, Flat, how can it be flat, I never run it anywhere but over the grass and he said, Well, look right there it&#39;s got a thorn in it, A thorn, I said, how can a thorn penetrate a Carlyle Super Tuff tire, and he said, Oh yeah they do that, but I can fix it, I&#39;m busy today but I&#39;ll do it tomorrow I have a system you just push through what looks like knitting needle with sticky stuff on the end and pull it out, it will seal it right up, it&#39;s a tubeless tire isn&#39;t it? and I said Yes it is, and if you could fix it tomorrow that would be great, well next day he took the tire and tried it his way but he couldn&#39;t get it to hold air so he says Take it down to PTOs and they&#39;ll patch it from the inside, so I put it in the trunk of the car and drove to town and they fixed it and then I put it back on the axle, it has three small washers and one large washer and one of those spring nuts and I started the engine but by god the mower wouldn&#39;t move and I thought what the heck is going on here, I put everything back exactly as it came off and it was running just fine when I took it off so what could I possibly be doing wrong, I took the wheel off and put it on again and I still couldn&#39;t figure it out so I got in the car and drove over to Ed&#39;s, he was cutting wood but he stopped and I said, Ed, what&#39;s wrong with that lamb, why do you have him penned up all by himself and he said, you know how the lambs are always butting heads and pushing each other around, well I went out in the field and he was down, couldn&#39;t move a bit, so I took him home and I don&#39;t know whether his brains are addled or he&#39;s really hurt, I thought we&#39;d better have him slaughtered but you can see he&#39;s doing better, getting up and eating so we&#39;ll hold off a day, and I said maybe he has a bad back like me, and he said, No, he&#39;s too young for a bad back, so I said, Well, maybe he has vertigo like you, which is not all that funny because Ed lost a week to vertigo last June, and he kind of laughed and said, Well, is your mower working now, and I said, Not exactly, the engine&#39;s fine and the belt turns but it&#39;s not moving frontwards or backwards and he said, How can that be, I&#39;ll come over and take a look so later that day he came by and sure enough it wouldn&#39;t move, so we took off the wheel again and studied it but I certainly couldn&#39;t figure it out and he couldn&#39;t either, everything looked good and perfect, we puzzled over it for a while and then he called the John Deere dealer in North Haverhill and the technician said maybe you lost the key when you took off the wheel and Ed said, O yes of course, we must have lost the key, I didn&#39;t think of that, and I said What the heck is the key and he said Well, in a lot of these machines the axle is broached which means there&#39;s a slot in it and a slot in the wheel and you have to have a key which is just a small piece of metal otherwise the axle will spin but the wheel won&#39;t rotate, so we looked all around for the lost key but couldn&#39;t find it and then Ed said, Look at your tire they didn&#39;t even mount it right, it&#39;s out of round, you&#39;d better bring it back in and while you&#39;re there check if the key is in the shop somewhere, it might have stuck in the wheel because of the grease, so I took the wheel and put it in the trunk and drove back to PTOs and showed him that the tire was out of round, the owner was embarrassed about the bad job he had done and wouldn&#39;t even look me in the eye but he re-mounted the tire and when he finished I said, By the way, you didn&#39;t happen to find the key I lost it, and he said I&#39;ll look inside but he couldn&#39;t find it, so he said I&#39;ll make you another one which was nice of him though the key is only at most a 50 cent piece but it saved me from having to go to Napa Auto Parts or drive 30 minutes to North Haverhill to the John Deere dealer, so he made the part it took him only a couple of minutes, he had the stock he just had to cut and file a two inch piece, I brought it home and I put the key in the slot and put the wheel on, I had to use a board for a lever to get the rear of the mower up in the air and it was tricky because I held the board with my right hand and the wheel in the left but I managed alright and then I got on the tractor and started the engine and everything worked perfectly except that the tractor still wouldn&#39;t go either forward or backward, I took the wheel off and put it on again, but it still wouldn&#39;t work, so I walked over to Ed&#39;s and I said, Ed, I can&#39;t for the life of me figure it out, I got the key and it fit just perfectly but the machine still doesn&#39;t move, and he said It&#39;s got to work, it makes perfect sense, I said, Hey look, your lamb looks a lot better but why did you put a hog panel across your driveway, he said It&#39;s because of the dog, he&#39;s been getting out, tomorrow he&#39;s going to be snipped and that will quiet him down a bit, which is a good idea because the dog is far too friendly even to me and I don&#39;t particularly like the dog, he&#39;s a beagle mix, not as bad as their other dog which was a rescue dog a bulldog, very ugly in my opinion, which also got out and trotted over to the pottery down the road where he was&#0160; seen running off with the Murrays&#39; Silkie in his mouth, a Silkie is a fancy chicken, they charged Ed a hundred and sixty dollars for vet bills and mental anguish, the chicken died anyway, so Ed got out his rifle and shot the bulldog and then dug a hole four feet deep, he said that all the way down it was nothing but powder, it&#39;s been that dry the last few weeks, anyway Ed came by again and we tried the machine and it wouldn&#39;t go forward or backward and I was about to surrender and load up the damn thing and take it back to the dealer when we lifted both back wheels off the ground and suddenly the axle which hadn&#39;t been turning even though the belt had been turning started to spin, it must have been something about the gears that didn&#39;t mesh properly anyway we put the wheel back on again and I started it up and by god it ran as good as ever but I had wasted a whole day fussing with the mower just because it had picked up a goddamn thorn probably blackberry which is in brief why I hate machines</p>

                                <p>Last October, I decided that one of my herbaceous peonies -- a Prairie Moon, to be precise -- needed to be separated and re-planted. I did the deed, but a few days ago, while cleaning the garden, I found a small, overlooked fragment of a tuber -- six inches in length and no more than half the diameter of a finger -- lying on the ground entirely exposed to the elements. I missed it last autumn, I guess.&#0160; But the good news: while there was no sign of rooting, there was a bud -- and the bud was swelling with new life.&#0160; (It had been a wicked winter, with temperatures down to 10F.)&#0160;</p>
<p>Peony-growers know that it&#39;s important not to plant the roots too deep in the soil. The experts say two inches at the most. My experience is that in our Colorado clay, two inches can be too much, and that peonies so planted may come up spindly and flowerless. But now I know that it&#39;s safe to err on the shallow side.&#0160; Herbaceous peonies are tougher than I imagined -- pretty much impervious to cold.&#0160; Or at least such is the case with this particular variety.</p>
<p>Friends, I can&#39;t tell you how much I admire that tenacious little cylinder of life.&#0160; It&#39;s toughness is inspiring.&#0160; I&#39;ve prepared a burrow for it -- the best in the way of soil and situation that I can offer. Let&#39;s see what it makes of its new opportunity. It&#39;s spring;&#0160; I&#39;m optimistic.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>It appears to be the case that martyrs of a certain persuasion will be rewarded in the afterlife with the ministrations of seventy-two virgins. It would take a theologian of extraordinary skill to explain why acts of violence should be rewarded with sexual indulgence. I raise a far less knotty question: if the aim is bliss, then why virgins?&#0160; Why not women of experience and expertise? Benjamin Franklin, the most practical of our Founding Fathers, was dogmatic on this nice point: shun the callow in favor of women who&#39;ve been around the block, because &quot;every Knack... by Practice [is] capable of improvement.&quot;&#0160; I think that B-Frank would agree that there is something about the virgins-for-martyrs deal that&#39;s kind of, how shall I say, impractical or counter-intuitive or even, dare I say, kinky.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a second theological conundrum. What is the reward when the martyr is herself female? I must presume that she will be blessed with seventy-two male virgins -- if not, there&#39;s a very serious afterlife asymmetry. Not to reward females who give themselves to the cause would be a statement that the culture of religious martyrdom does not support sexual equality, which I can hardly bring myself to believe. But in the case of female martyrs, the matter of sexual expertise is further exacerbated. Specifically, of what conceivable value are seventy-two knackless male virgins? If we postulate that each male virgin is good for between ten and fifteen seconds of actual intercourse, it follows that they will be consumed at the rate of four to six every minute, which means that on average a martyress, however patient, would enjoy a sum of only twelve or so minutes of pleasure (setting aside time for re-mounting and repositioning), which is surely insufficient exercise to produce a meaningful let alone heavenly experience.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>Nor will it be all that great for the male virgin at the end of the queue who has to settle for sloppy seventy-seconds.&#0160; &#0160;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>At a community meeting a few days ago, the question of alcohol consumption came up (as it frequently does in our adjacent-to-a-university neighborhood). One young man complained that when local bars (where over-serving is -- in theory -- proscribed) shut down, the students then take their drinking to &quot;house parties&quot; where there is no adult present to oversee how much can be consumed. &quot;They just go and get themselves totally wasted,&quot; said the student. Our local police sergeant challenged him. &quot;What do you do,&quot; she asked, &quot;when your friends make plans to get drunk? Do you try to stop them?&quot; Her question took the student aback. I don&#39;t think that the idea that someone his age could or should intervene had occurred to him until that moment.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>I was surprised that the sergeant asked the young man to look after his friends. It was as though she asked him to become that dreaded folk-figure, the busybody.&#0160;</p>
<p>What are the rules in such cases? Isn&#39;t the notion that each person is responsible for only his own welfare a contemporary American dogma? &quot;You can&#39;t help people; they have to help themselves.&quot;</p>
<p>Some score or so years ago, I had a friend (I&#39;ll call him Vincent) who was a two-(or three) pack-a-day smoker. He was an intimate enough friend that I crossed the invisible busybody barrier. I&#39;d argue with him about the health risks of using tobacco; I&#39;d send him articles to read. He was not impressed or persuaded, but he was often irritated. Once he said, scornfully, &quot;you are trying to be your brother&#39;s keeper.&quot; Vincent was angry when I asked him not to smoke when he visited my house. His conviction was that when you have a friend, you don&#39;t try to change him or to regulate his habits; you accept him with all his foibles. Perhaps he was right, but nevertheless, for several years I didn&#39;t invite him home, which was a great loss, because he was smart and informed and charming and sociable.&#0160;</p>
<p>Then came the lung cancer, the surgery, the chemo, the false remissions, the swings between hope and despair, and eventually, the premature death. In an interview in the local newspaper a few weeks before he died, Vincent said, &quot;I have simply lost twenty years of my life to smoking.&quot; To me he said, once, very quietly, &quot;you were right.&quot;&#0160; Did he mean, &quot;you were right that smoking was dangerous,&quot; or did he mean, &quot;you were right to try to change me?&quot; I don&#39;t know.</p>
<p>I may have been right, but what good did I do? I alienated a friend and I didn&#39;t add a day to his life.&#0160;</p>
<p>When I look back now after so many years have passed, my regret is not that I intervened but that intervened so ineffectively. It haunts me that I didn&#39;t I do a better job.&#0160;</p>
<p>In our neighborhood, we lose a local student to alcohol poisoning each and every year. Can there be a sadder or more useless death?&#0160; Mom and dad nurture a child for eighteen years, send him or her off to college, and a week later receive a phone call that their child has choked to death on his own vomit.</p>
<p>Who is the responsible party?&#0160; Friends, teachers, police, family, liquor-purveyors? Or only the individual?&#0160; &#0160;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>A Venusian day, strange to say, is longer than a Venusian year. How can such an apparent paradox be allowed? &#0160;It&#39;s easy: Venus rotates on its axis once every 243 earth-days, but it revolves around the sun in 225 earth-days. How appallingly counter-intuitive!&#0160; If I had any gift at all for thinking in the abstract, I&#39;m sure that I wouldn&#39;t find the idea that a day can be longer than a year so disorienting. But I do;&#0160; for me, the word &quot;day&quot; has a metaphorical as well as a scientific dimension: &quot;days&quot; are short, &quot;years&quot; are long.&#0160; I&#39;m consoled by thinking that my counterpart, a philosophically-handicapped Venusian visiting the earth, would find our speedy days and our disproportionately long year quite incredible. On Venus, the lazy old sun takes 116 days to rise in the west and set in the east (Venus, ever the contrarian, rotates, so to speak, &quot;backwards&quot;).&#0160; So much for Ovid&#39;s swift horses; on Venus, they&#39;re all glue and molasses, their forward progress barely perceptible.&#0160; There&#39;s a mythological corollary that might please the poets. Randy Jupiter would be happy on Venus: the venereal night is truly a <em>megala nux.</em></p>
<p>I suppose that the example of Venus teaches us that days and years are not things but concepts. For me, this is a hard lesson. I recognize that it&#39;s earthocentric to measure the long Venusian day in terms of earth-days, but I can&#39;t seem to reason my way around doing so -- the only day that I&#39;ve ever experienced is 24 hours long and the only year with which I&#39;m familiar has 365 and a bit days. It&#39;s alarming to realize how short-sighted it is to assume that a day, a month, a year, tied in, as they are, to astronomical reality are natural, when, in fact, they&#39;re only artifacts of our earthly orbit.</p>
<p>Other measurements of time are less &quot;natural&quot; and therefore even more troublesome.&#0160; How entirely arbitrary to divide the day into 24 parts!&#0160; Since everything else is going metric, why shouldn&#39;t we divide the day into ten or a hundred parts -- decidays or centidays? &#0160;And minutes and seconds -- why sixty of them, when decihours and centihours makes so much more sense? &#0160;(The ancients, incidentally, struggled mightily with hours -- read all about it <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2005/11/the_clocks_of_r.html">here.</a>)&#0160; And the week?&#0160; No natural reason at all for the week. The Romans, as is well known, were weekless.</p>
<p>Venus, having no moons, has no months. Mars has two moons -- would a Martian calendar, if there were such a thing, have had months, or demi-months, or monthettes, or what?</p>
<p>When I was a boy, I was a diligent if uncritical reader of science fiction.&#0160; In those days, it was not uncommon for entire fanciful Venusian civilizations to rise, peak, and fall and the course of a novel. But in the 1950s, almost no data was available to us about the mysterious planet. Now, I&#39;m afraid, the glamour is long gone. The surface temperature of Venus averages 869F, the atmospheric pressure is 90 times that of the earth, the atmosphere is 97 per cent carbon dioxide and contains no oxygen, and the pretty swirling clouds are entirely composed of hot, concentrated sulfuric acid. It&#39;s hardly a place in which an advanced culture would be likely to thrive nor a place from which we would expect much in the way of sophisticated calendrical theory.&#0160; &#0160;&#0160; &#0160;</p>

<p>DEAR ABBY: Am I a &quot;sicko&quot; because I step out of the shower naked in front of our dog? My wife, Amy, thinks so. The trouble started when we got a female dog, &quot;Taffy,&quot; from the local animal shelter. Taffy sleeps in our bedroom and is there in the morning when I take my shower. Amy insists that I cover up in front of the dog and that Taffy is no different from a child. This has created a lot of stress between us because, to me, a dog is a dog. Is it wrong to be naked in front of a dog? -- SCOTT IN NEW JERSEY</p>
<p>How even to begin?&#0160; My immediate thought was to take the opportunity afforded by ABBY and Scott and Amy to make some jokes. E.g., is it wrong to be naked in front of a dog?&#0160; Depends on the dog&#39;s attitude toward sexuality and gender. Depends on whether it&#39;s the kind of dog who likes to worry a bone. Depends on whether it&#39;s a hairy or a hairless dog. And also: would it matter if the dog is gay?&#0160; Or male? &#0160;How does Amy feel about Taffy eyeballing her?&#0160; Would Tuffy be granted the same privilege?&#0160; Does Taffy spend extra time licking her genitalia after getting a full frontal view of Scott? Etc. Lots of opportunities for bad humor. In addition to the jokes, I thought that I might also write a few serious sentences about sentimentality toward animals. And also about flagrant anthropomorphism -- I&#39;m deeply troubled when someone proclaims that a dog is &quot;no different from a child.&quot;</p>
<p>I wrote an e-mail to confidants asking for help, thinking that they might provide me with some one-liners. One of the answers that I received came from my old friend Spike Schapiro, who, diligent readers will remember, wrote to me a couple of days ago on the subject of marriage and animals (see the entry for January 21 titled &quot;Marriage Advice). Spike got himself a little bent out of shape by DEAR ABBY, but I must admit that he took the plight of Scott and Amy much more seriously than I did.&#0160; Here&#39;s a excerpt from Spike&#39;s response:&#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;The trouble began when we got a female dog, Taffy.&quot; No, Scott, the trouble didn&#39;t begin when you brought home the little bitch.The trouble began long before that. It all started when Amy was a child and her neo-Victorian God-fearing parents, who more than likely had sex once and only once, and then only to fulfill a legal requirement, found their daughter frolicking clothesless and with a hand &quot;down there&quot; and patiently and sensitively explained to her that the great Jehovah would wither her finger if her naked skin ever saw the sun again. Amy&#39;s been in a psychological twist ever since. And Scott&#0160; -- why the heck do you bother writing to ABBY?&#0160; You must know the score. Your wife is a total nutball. She&#39;s nuts about animals, nuts about nakedness, nuts about sex&#0160; -- which, I guarantee, you&#39;re not getting a lot of. Think seriously whether you want to stay in this relationship. Amy -- get a hold of yourself before it&#39;s too late. If you want to save your marriage, which is now staggering to a nasty conclusion, don&#39;t worry about the intimacy of Scott and Taffy. Throw Taffy and your dancing hyena and the fool baboon out of the window. Worry about Scott and Amy.&#0160; Exercise your buccinatory muscles. Learn how to make winky-winky. Unlearn everything that you learned from your parents. Take off your clothes and look at yourself in the mirror.&#0160; Grow up.&quot;</p>
<p>I guess I see Spike&#39;s point.&#0160; I think, though, that he&#39;s confused this Amy and Scott with the Amy who wrote about training her husband Scott in the well-known <em>NYT </em>article. Although, come to think of it, they could be the same couple.</p>
<p>In any case, I think that Spike could have made the same point a little more gently. I&#39;ve edited out some of his harsher adjectives.&#0160; &#0160;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>High on the list of <em>The New York Times&#39;</em> &quot;most e-mailed articles&quot; is one with the catchy title &quot;What Shamu Taught Me About a Happy Marriage,&quot; by a writer named Amy Sutherland. Apparently it&#39;s a well-regarded, influential essay. I think it&#39;s misleading and wrong-headed, and I think that couples who heed its advice will soon find themselves not in a happy marriage but in one that&#39;s sterile and empty.</p>
<p>Amy&#39;s column is at <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/25/fashion/25love.html?ex=1169528400&amp;en=7c808a42b50f67a0&amp;ei=5070">this address</a>, and will be available unless and until the greedy <em>Times</em> decides to put it behind a paid wall. A summary: poor Amy is perpetually annoyed by Scott, her husband of twelve years. He loses his keys and asks her help finding them; he keeps her waiting at restaurants; he &quot;hovers around her in the kitchen asking if she has read this or that piece in the New Yorker.&quot; She&#39;s tried nagging, but it doesn&#39;t work. As it happens, Amy is writing a book on animal training and she&#39;s watched people &quot;do the seemingly impossible,&quot; such as &#39;teaching baboons to skateboard&quot; and &quot;hyenas to pirouette on command.&quot; She decides to adopt the animal model and &quot;train&quot; her husband. &quot;If he threw one dirty shirt into the hamper, I&#39;d thank him. If he threw in two, I&#39;d kiss him.&quot; She rewards &quot;approximations.&quot; She uses &quot;least reinforcing syndrome&quot; in which the trainer doesn&#39;t respond in any way when an animal does something wrong -- just stands and stares. When Scott loses his keys, she ignores his pleas for help, and eventually he finds them by himself. By the end of the article, Scott has changed. &quot;After two years of exotic animal training, my marriage is far smoother, my husband much easier to love.&quot;</p>
<p>What&#39;s so awful about this advice? Let&#39;s take the shirts-on-the-floor crisis.Amy can imagine only two methods to deal with this problem. There&#39;s nagging, which she now rejects, and there&#39;s re-training. But there are other responses. The first is for Amy to gain a bit of perspective. Marriage isn&#39;t about whether the dirty shirts are in the hamper or on the floor. People have had long and happy marriages without resolving such issues. Amy seems to assume that getting her way about the shirts is crucial. But when she and Scott married, they agreed to love, honor, and respect each other; they didn&#39;t agree that every shirt would immediately find its way into a hamper. Perhaps Amy should re-think her priorities and try to keep the larger picture in view. Secondly, Amy can&#39;t seem to imagine any ground between nagging and animal training. But there is -- there&#39;s an enormous territory. There&#39;s discussion, negotiation, and compromise. Amy:&#0160; &quot;It bothers me that you expect me to pick up your shirts.&quot; Scott: &quot;I&#39;ll try not to drop them. I&#39;ll pick them up myself.&quot; Amy: &quot;And I&#39;ll try not to make such a big deal out of it.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>When Scott comes into the kitchen and wants to read to her from a <em>New Yorker</em> article, Amy could say, if she had any imagination, &quot;Oh, good. Scott wants to involve me in his intellectual life. He wants to talk to me.&quot; But she doesn&#39;t see it that way; she wants him out of the room so she can &quot;concentrate on the simmering pans.&quot; But what&#39;s important about marriage, or about life?&#0160; Is it the pans, or is it the conversation?&#0160; Once again, Amy has it all wrong. She cares about her cooking, and getting the soup exactly right, more than she cares about the marriage. It shouldn&#39;t be beyond her ability to stir and to listen at the same time; it&#39;s been known to happen. Amy is, let&#39;s face it, a bit of a narcissist. She wants to make Scott into an extension of herself; she wants to subordinate the marriage to her own convenience.&#0160;</p>
<p>Readers and friends, here&#39;s my opinion. If your spouse comes to you and says, &quot;I&#39;ve lost my keys, I&#39;m distressed,&quot; you should stop whatever you&#39;re doing and you should start searching. When you do so, you&#39;re treating your spouse with respect and you&#39;re taking your marriage seriously. And if you happen to misplace your own keys, it&#39;s perfectly fair to ask your spouse to help find them. Because sometimes finding keys is a team activity. I&#39;ll go even further: sometimes it&#39;s less important to find the lost keys than it is to search for them together.&#0160;</p>
<p>But you should engage yourself with the problem of the keys, or the shirts, only if you want a relationship of equals. If you think that it&#39;s so important to train your spouse to stay out of your damn kitchen, then go ahead and follow Amy&#39;s advice. But you might wind up with not with a husband or wife, but with a pirouetting hyena or a skateboarding baboon.&#0160;</p>
<p>Amy and Scott: here&#39;s some valuable advice. It comes to you courtesy of Mr. Hart, who lived a couple of houses down from us. He died at age 90, in the same month as his equally aged wife. The Harts had been married for 60 or so years. &quot;What&#39;s the secret of a long, happy marriage,&quot; he was asked. He said, &quot;find out what your wife wants and make sure that it happens.&quot; Which is, if you think about it for a moment, only a variation of the traditional golden rule and of its even more practical cousin: &quot;do unto others as they want to be done unto.&quot;</p>
<p><em>January 23.</em>&#0160; Today I received an e-mail from my old friend Spike Schapiro. Spike says, &quot;How come Amy and Scott have been married for twelve years and don&#39;t have any children. I&#39;ll tell you why. Because Amy doesn&#39;t want kids who would leave their toys in her kitchen or leave their clothes in the bathroom. She&#39;s quite a piece of work, isn&#39;t she?&quot;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I&#39;ve been staring into my crystal ball, sorting through chicken bones, tea leaves and the Tarot cards, observing the flights of birds, inspecting the entrails of sacrificed animals, and diddling with the Ouija board. Now I&#39;m ready. Here are my widely-anticipated predictions for the year 2007.</p>
<p>1)&#0160; there will be unusual weather patterns in North America;</p>
<p>2)&#0160; a famous Hollywood actress will sue for divorce; moreover, another (or possibly the same) Hollywood star will become pregnant; another (or possibly the same) actress will gain and lose a great deal of weight;&#0160;</p>
<p>3)&#0160; a well-known athlete will be accused of taking drugs;</p>
<p>4)&#0160; a politician will be involved in a sex scandal;</p>
<p>5)&#0160; questions will be raised about America&#39;s food supply;</p>
<p>6)&#0160; there will be either a monsoon, an airplane crash, or a capsized ferry in Asia--perhaps all three;</p>
<p>7)&#0160; there will be fluctuations in the stock market, and, finally,</p>
<p>8)&#0160; there will be turmoil in the Middle East.</p>
<p>There it is right on the page in black and white. No taking it back now. Eight major predictions. I know that I&#39;m going way out on the proverbial limb, but I feel confident -- not vain or proud, mind you -- of my abilities as a forecaster. Let&#39;s all remember to check back at the end of the year and see how well I&#39;ve performed.&#0160; If I come through, I&#39;ll rank up there with the true greats of the prognosticating game: John the Revelator, Nostradamus, the <em>National Enquirer, </em>and Pat Robertson.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Intermittently throughout the decades, I&#39;ve been afflicted with what has been called, at various times in history, &quot;the spleen,&quot; &quot;vapors,&quot; &quot;falling into a brown study,&quot; &quot;melancholy,&quot; &quot;the blues,&quot; and currently, &quot;depression.&quot; But now I have devised a very effective remedy for this affliction.</p>
<p>With the help of the Ellis Island Foundation, I located the manifest of the <em>Rotterdam</em>, the ship that arrived in New York on August 23, 1904 and which brought my grandparents to the new world. I purchased and studied a copy of this document. My grandfather, Joseph Uzilewsky, was 27 years old when he arrived and is listed as a &quot;chemist&#39;s (i.e. pharmacist&#39;s) assistant.&quot; My grandmother, Sonia, was 20 and has no profession. Neither of them admitted to being either a polygamist or an anarchist. There&#39;s a specific column on the manifest in which each new arrival was required to say how much money he&#39;s bringing into the country. Almost all of the immigrants have a few dollars, but Joseph and Sonia have nothing at all. Nothing.</p>
<p>When I fall into periods of unhappiness, I think about my grandparents arriving here without a nickel in their pockets and unable to speak the language. And then I think of my own position in life. I had a job that allowed me -- no, required me -- to read as much as possible, and occasionally to write something about what I had read. My principal task was the pleasant and useful one of learning the young &#39;uns how to read and write. Now I&#39;m retired and someone puts money in my bank account at the beginning of each month. It&#39;s not a lot of money, but it&#39;s enough to allow me to do whatever I please.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>I have no reason to think that I&#39;m smarter or more talented than my grandparents&#0160; -- in fact, everything that I know about genetics leads to the conclusion that they were exactly as gifted as I. No question but that I&#39;ve been a heckuva lot luckier. I could have spent my entire lifetime rolling cigars in a hot, airless back-room-behind-the-store, as my grandfather did.</p>
<p>I keep the <em>Rotterdam</em> manifest under the glass on my desk. When I start to feel gloomy, I force myself to take another look. I don&#39;t dare allow myself to succumb to depression. How justly would my grandparents have scorned the mopings and the woe-is-mes of someone so privileged as I have been.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>A while ago, I <a href="http://www.scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2006/11/my_favorite_inv.html">reported</a> on my very favorite innovations of the last half-century&#0160; -- including such wonders as the retractable vacuum cleaner cord, fitted sheets, duct tape, and the mute button.&#0160; I now realize that I was remiss in not celebrating the most revolutionary invention of recent decades -- the disposable diaper.&#0160;</p>
<p>I was knuckle-deep in the diaper business from 1965 to about 1973. Cloth was then the material of choice. In our family there were three infants and each one had, roughly speaking, 900 days of diaperhood. Suppose that there were nine changes of diaper a day (a conservative estimate) -- that&#39;s a total of 24,300 diaper-changes.&#0160; Let&#39;s say that I personally presided over one-third of those off-with-the-foul-on-with-the-clean exchanges. We&#39;re talking more than 8000 excretory experiences. So, dear reader, I know whereof I speak.</p>
<p>Post-cloth diaper parents live in a world of decadent ease. Here&#39;s what they&#39;re missing. A) cloth diapers had to be changed more frequently than the new ones -- they didn&#39;t wick away the liquid as the disposables do. Rashes and irritations were all too common. b) gagworthy solid material had to be carefully flushed away. c)&#0160; soiled diapers sat in a waste receptacle, where they generated an ammonia-based chemical one whiff of which could revive a morgueful of corpses. d) cloth diapers had to be washed, dried, and folded for next use. e) diapering with cloth and safety pins was a fine art. Badly-applied diapers hung to the ground to shame the diaperer; open pins and pin-sticks were a constant worry.</p>
<p>Nowadays, it&#39;s pop &#39;em off, throw it in the trash, pop on a new one. Piece of cake. Perhaps disposable diapers are not ecologically sound&#0160; -- I don&#39;t know. But frankly, I can&#39;t think of a better use for the vast Canadian forests.</p>
<p>But I shouldn&#39;t complain too much. We owned an automatic washer and dryer. My mom had the same number of diapers, but she scrubbed them on a washboard in the &quot;laundry sink,&quot; put them through the wringer (first a hand-crank, later an electric), and hung them outside to dry. She was a true heroine of diaper labor. And I can&#39;t even bring myself to imagine the diaperworld of older generations.</p>
<p>Today&#39;s parents, wallowing in sybaritic luxury, cannot appreciate what it means to be &quot;put through the wringer.&quot; And just as well.&#0160;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>We&#39;ve had two major snowfalls in the last week and the road crews haven&#39;t yet found their way to our street. It&#39;s a knee-deep icy mess out there. Yesterday one of my neighbors spun himself into quite a hole. He needed a push, so I went outside to help. Even with my professional-grade ice-chopper, I had to bang around for a while and the task took a lot longer than I had expected.&#0160; Eventually, I had to resort to the old towel trick to gain enough traction to release the vehicle. My neighbor said, &quot;I&#39;m embarrassed. You shouldn&#39;t be doing this.&quot;&#0160; Which took me aback, of course. I replied, quite spontaneously, &quot;It&#39;s exactly what I should be doing.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>And then I recalled one of my father&#39;s maxims: &quot;Never omit an opportunity to do a favor for a friend, and never be embarrassed to accept a favor.&quot;</p>
<p>The old guy did lots of favors. When someone on East 9 Street had a problem or got into a little trouble, my father acted as <em>consigliere</em>; as far as I know, he never took a nickel for his trouble--though occasionally someone would drop off a compensatory lasagna. In his last years, when he lived alone and his arthritis was very bad, someone mowed his lawn and someone took in his garbage cans and someone raked his leaves.</p>
<p>My father was the least materialistic person that I&#39;ve encountered in an entire lifetime. He didn&#39;t seem to need possessions. No car, no clothes beyond the absolute minimum, no items of personal adornment. He didn&#39;t &quot;shop.&quot; I was with him once when bought a new hat: &quot;See this. I want another one just like it.&quot; We were in and out of the store in two minutes.&#0160;</p>
<p>Although he lived in a world of weasels (he was a real-estate lawyer), he was uncontaminated by what went on around him. He&#39;d often tell me stories about the various chicaneries by which people cheated each other--and every time he would express the same astonishment at the fallibility of human nature. He knew of public officials who were on the take, but he preferred to talk about the state legislator who had a large sign on his desk that said, &quot;NO GIFTS.&quot;</p>
<p>In one of our very last conversations, I asked him if he himself had ever done anything illegal. He thought for a long time. &quot;I don&#39;t know if you&#39;d call this exactly illegal. Do you remember the B-----s?&#0160; Rose was a widow and she was dying of cancer, but she didn&#39;t know it. She was a teacher with two young children and she had a benefit coming to her from the city. She made a very bad decision--a lump sum instead of an annuity for her children. I went to her school and substituted a new form for the one that she had filed. It was technically a violation and I could have gotten into a lot of trouble.&quot; And then he surprised me by quoting some Wordsworth--the lines from <em>Tintern Abbey </em>about the &quot;best portion of a good man&#39;s life,/ His little, nameless, unremembered acts/ Of kindness and of love.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#39;s hard to believe that he&#39;s been dead for twenty years now. But I remember him when we come around to the winter solstice (he was born on December 22, 1904)--and he&#39;s especially real to me when a neighbor lets me help him extricate his car from a snowbank.&#0160;</p>
