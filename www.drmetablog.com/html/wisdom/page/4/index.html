                                <p>If the profoundly religious seventeenth-century founders of our country had a single favorite Biblical moment, it might be where the Lord (speaking through His prophet Amos) severely condemned the vanity of holidays. &quot;I hate,&quot; said the Lord, &quot;I despise your feast days, and I will not smell in your solemn assemblies.&quot;&nbsp; The Lord of Hosts specifically enjoined against the attempt to placate him by sacrificing animals (a matter of topical concern in Amos' time).&nbsp; &quot;Though ye offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings, I will not accept them; neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat beasts.&quot;&nbsp; Nor did He rest with these easy-to-follow injunctions, but He went on to condemn all musical tributes as well.&nbsp; Nor more chants, glees or carols: &quot;Take thou away from me the noise of thy songs; for I will not hear the melody of thy viols.&quot;&nbsp; Our Puritan forefathers interpreted these lines correctly; they recognized that the Lord opposed not only ritual sacrifice and music but all formal observance and rote piety. The Ancient of Days made it abundantly clear that what moved him was not empty ceremony but genuine morality.&nbsp; HIs solution: &quot;let justice run down as waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream.&quot;&nbsp; Taking these uncompromising sentences as their guide, our founders dug in their heels against the ostentatious celebration of of all holidays, especially Christmas.</p>

<p>Would they not have been reduced to angry and impotent sobs by the grotesque consumerism -- the burnt offerings and squeaking timbrels&nbsp; -- that in 2006 substitute for justice and righteousness?&nbsp; Could there be anything more loathsome either to Amos or to our devout ancestors than &quot;Silent Night&quot; at a shopping mall?</p>

<p>Ah for a twenty-first century Amos!</p>

<p>Further observations on the &quot;holiday season&quot; can be found <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2005/12/a_gosse_xmas.html">here</a>. </p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span>On September 6, 1664, Sam Pepys purchased for his young wife a&#0160;pair of gloves trimmed with yellow ribbon. At 20 shillings, he knew that he overpaid but he was not at all sorry, because Doll, the &#39;Change woman from whom he made the purchase was &quot;so pretty, that, God forgive me! I could not think it too much -- which is a strange slavery that I stand in to beauty, that I value nothing near it.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span>Pepys, God forgive him, was not only enthralled by handsome women, but was attentive to beauty in all its manifestations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span>He loved plays and performances, paintings and prints and architecture, as well as music, especially songs and ballads.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; Pepys&#39;s </span>life was ruled by his&#0160;&quot;strange slavery to beauty.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span>&#0160;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span>But why should he have described his fascination as &quot;strange?&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; If there is a single trait that </span>distinguishes not just Pepys but human beings as a species, it is an irrepressible love of things beautiful.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span>For every one of their senses, humans have created an appropriate form of art.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>Hearing?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span>Music and song.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span>Sight? drawing and painting and sculpture and film.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>Taste?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>elaborate cookery.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>Motion?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; the </span>dance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span>Speech and language?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span>literature from lyric to epic to novel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span>Moreover, there&#39;s scarcely a substance that human beings have encountered in their time on the planet that they haven&#39;t transformed into something harmonious and elegant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span>At first, bone and stone and fur; and then wood and metal and cloth and clay.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; O</span>ccasionally, some anthropologist will emerge from his laboratory with a theory that the fundamental human trait is&#0160; -- you name it -- aggressiveness, or territoriality, or the ability to play games, or an interest in the future, or the capacity for bonding into societies.&#0160; Such theories have a bit of truth, but they overlook the obvious.&#0160; The essence of humanity, in my view, is the drive to create and to appreciate beauty.&#0160; Pepys&#39; &quot;strange slavery&quot; is not a bit strange;&#0160; it&#39;s universal.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&#0160;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span>As</span><span> for myself, I believe that I can remember the exact day, hour and minute when I was first struck by beauty.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span>My moment of ascension occurred in a garden.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span>I must have been twelve or thirteen years old (and therefore not fully human).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span>One spring day I<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> tagged along with a</span> gang of schoolyard savages to the Zoo to see if we could get ourselves into a little trouble.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span>So there we were, running about, screaming and hiding and throwing stones at each other and clods of dirt at the respectable zoo patrons. Someone must have called the cops, because the next thing I knew we had all scattered and I was running as fast as I could.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span>In those days I was small and spry and any fence that I couldn&#39;t squeeze through I could certainly clamber over.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; And w</span>hat&#39;s a little barbed wire to a frightened urchin?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span>Separated from my cohort, I became completely lost.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; Eventually, </span>I found myself in the Brooklyn Botanic Garden which was then as now adjacent to the zoo.&#0160; I climbed over one or two more fences and entered (not by a gate, but surreptitiously) the famous, mature, refined Japanese Garden -- one of the great artistic achievements in all of America.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span>I was dazzled in all my senses-- it was a true epiphany.&#0160; I particularly remember the red cut leaf maples and the wisteria.&#0160; Of course I was too ignorant to know that it was<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>wisteria;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span>I only knew that I was surrounded by magnificent cascades of blue flowers in abundant bloom.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&#0160;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span>Here are some <a href="http://66.39.46.24/exp/stroll/japanese_photos.html">pictures</a> of the garden.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; Just take a look, and then try to imagine a</span>n uncivilized pre-adolescent, a scared, sweaty, ragtag child, a product of concrete schoolyards and filthy subways stumbling upon such a amenable place.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&#0160;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span>What good fortune it was to have vaulted that one last fence!</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&#0160;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span>I</span><span> think that I&#39;ve spent the rest of my life trying to get back to that garden<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160;</span>-- or, more accurately, I&#39;ve spent it trying to recreate and to re-live the aesthetic explosion that I experienced at that epiphanic moment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; When I travel. I make it a point to visit the world-famous gardens, and </span>when I&#39;m at home I work on my own landscape.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span>But it&#39;s not just gardens -- the most ephemeral of art forms --to which I stand in strange slavery.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; I&#39;ve found the aesthetic shiver in other places.&#0160; Poetry, Shakespeare in particular, is always at hand.&#0160; Is there a civilized soul who can read </span>&quot;Do not laugh at me;/ For (as I am a man) I think this lady/ To be my child, Cordelia&quot; without dropping a pleasurable tear.&#0160; <em>The Winter&#39;s Tale, </em>which is the finest play in the history of this or any other universe, is a fountain of delights, especially Perdita&#39;s &quot;I <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">was not much afeard; for once or twice/ I was <span class="keyword1">about</span> <span class="keyword2">to</span> <span class="keyword3">speak</span> and tell him plainly,/ The selfsame sun that shines upon his court/ Hides not his visage from our cottage but/ Looks on alike&quot; -- a sentiment which may be the most genuinely democratic in thirty-eight otherwise monarchist dramas.&#0160; </span>Visual arts also are a constant source of pure delight;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span>in a gallery of Rembrandts at the Metropolitan Museum I was once so ecstatic that my heart began to beat uncontrollably.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; And in Helsinki, </span>I had a moment of pure architectural joy at the Church of the Rock -- the most beautiful and holy of buildings. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&#0160;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span>But of all art forms, it&#39;s music that is most reliably transcendent.&#0160; My tastes have evolved over the years:&#0160; Dvorak and Mahler are in the past but Beethoven&#39;s great fugue still sets my spine on edge and so does the long harpsichord solo in Bach&#39;s Fifth Brandenburg.&#0160; Recordings usually (but not always) work better than live performances.&#0160; When I&#39;m in the right mood, I play the shivery passages again and again.&#0160; Nowadays the single most lovely piece of music is the great chaconne from Bach&#39;s second violin partita.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#0160; </span>Hilary Hahn&#39;s performance is my favorite, but the chaconne is almost as exciting in Celadonio Romero&#39;s guitar transcription and in the Brahms piano version (for virtuoso left hand only).&#0160; The chaconne does all that music can do, and it does it in fifteen unaccompanied minutes.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&#0160;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span>It&#39;s </span><span>not just classical music.&#0160; I&#39;m also strangely enslaved to what is now called &quot;golden era gospel&quot; -- the singing of the &quot;Heavenly Gospel Singers&quot; and the &quot;Harmonizing Four&quot; and Clara Ward and Brother Joe May and Dorothy Love Coates and the &quot;Swan Silvertones&quot; and the &quot;Five Blind Boys of Alabama.&quot; A small sample of some of my many, many favorites:&#0160; Mahalia Jackson&#39;s long live version of &quot;How I Got Over&quot;; the &quot;Roberta Martin Singers&quot;&#39; &quot;Standing on the Promises&quot;; Sister Rosetta Tharpe and Marie Knight singing &quot;Beams of Heaven&quot;; the &quot;Sensational Nightingales&quot; &quot;Brightly Beams&quot;;&#0160; perhaps the best of the best:&#0160; Professor J. Earle Hines, &quot;God Be With You.&quot;&#0160; In such great music resides the aesthetic ecstasy, that, when we open ourselves to it, makes us most completely human.&#0160; </span></p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>It&#39;s the scandal of the month that Republican Representative Mark Foley solicited sex from adolescent male congressional pages in the same years that he headed the House Caucus on Missing and Exploited Children and made his reputation for his work on legislation targeting sexual predators.</p>
<p>Foley has been universally condemned for his &quot;hypocrisy,&quot; as well he should be. It&#39;s especially piquant that his castigation of a much-reviled-by-moralists former president has resurfaced to embarrass him and to amuse the rest of us: &quot;It&#39;s vile. It&#39;s more sad than anything else, to see someone with such potential throw it all down the drain because of a sexual addiction.&quot; What kind of rationalizing maneuvers were going in the Foley mind when the Congressman uttered these words about Bill Clinton?</p>
<p>Foley&#39;s &quot;hypocrisy&quot; is anything but unique.&#0160; Shakespeare nailed the phenomenon centuries ago. In one of his great wisdom-in-madness moments, King Lear sees beneath the surface: &quot;Thou rascal beadle, hold thy bloody hand!/ Why dost thou lash that whore? Strip thine own back;/ Thou hotly lust&#39;st to use her in that kind/ For which thou whipp&#39;st her.&quot;</p>
<p>Every few weeks or so, it&#39;s discovered that one of our very own American beadles is enthralled by the exact sin against which he inveighs. There&#39;s the anti-pornography campaigner who has accumulated some unusual apparatus in his clammy basement; the anti-vice TV preacher caught with a shady lady in a by-the-hour motel on the Memphis strip;&#0160; the anti-gay state legislator photographed dancing in a downtown bar that caters only to men; the radio talk-show host who wants to send drug-users up the river for life but is himself addicted to hillbilly heroin; the flabby propagandist for virtues who pulls all-nighters at Atlantic City blackjack tables.&#0160; ll of them are hypocrites, I suppose, but in my view &quot;hypocrisy&quot; is a label that has no explanatory value.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not as though people set out to become hypocrites. It&#39;s not an aspiration or a chosen career path. There&#39;s no Hypocrisy 101.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not an anti-vice campaigner or a psychologist and have no particular claim to expertise in this area, but I don&#39;t believe that people like Foley are cloven-footed sociopaths.</p>
<p>Nor do I hold to the theory that it&#39;s simply protective coloration: &quot;if I scream loud enough no one will suspect me.&quot; That shabby dodge has long since worn through; who else do we suspect nowadays if not the loudest shouters?</p>
<p>I think the migration to hypocrisy must be very gradual. The Foleys of this world are driven by the flesh. Their vice becomes their obsession. I believe that they try to turn that obsession, that vice, in a positive direction.&#0160; Let&#39;s say a person is fascinated by adolescent boys;&#0160; he can then take on the cause of sexual exploitation and he can manage his compulsion in a socially acceptable manner. He can study it, observe it, catalog it; he can stay in close touch with the temptation but not succumb to it; he can in fact turn his vice into virtue. It&#39;s an excellent game plan.&#0160; It&#39;s a healthy compensatory reaction.</p>
<p>I&#39;m sure that there are anti-vice campaigners who employ such tactics successfully. But there are others who, in moments of weakness, do succumb. Now they&#39;re in a tricky psychological pickle.&#0160; Who better to appreciate the damage to adolescents than the person who has made a professional study of the outcomes?&#0160; So now Foley and the others know in their hearts that they are truly hateful. Perhaps they persuade themselves that their power makes them invulnerable. Meanwhile, they redouble their efforts to help the exploited; they pass legislation and start foundations.&#0160; And so the gulf between their professed beliefs and their private practices becomes deeper and deeper. Good deeds and evil deeds become inextricably entwined.</p>
<p>In the story, Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde (a child-molester) inhabited the same body.</p>
<p>I think that what must happen next is that self-loathing kicks in, big time. And as we all know, self-loathing and self-betrayal are twinborn. So the Foleys among us cooperate in their detection.&#0160; They engage in riskier and riskier behavior until they are exposed. Because, in fact, they want to be exposed. As Lear says, they &quot;strip [their] own back[s].&quot;&#0160; Because once they&#39;re exposed and the punishment commences, they can then set out on the path of redemption, which, I&#39;m absolutely convinced, they crave as much or more than they crave the pleasure of their vice.&#0160;</p>
<p>When La Rochefoucauld said that &quot;hypocrisy is the tribute that vice pays to virtue,&quot; he acknowledged that the term &quot;hypocrisy&quot; did not explain anything--that it&#39;s an incidental by-product of human frailty.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I once read the last 200 pages of Hardy's <em>Jude the Obscure </em>in a single hour.&nbsp; This extraordinary feat occurred in, I think, 1959 or 1960.</p>

<p>As a general rule, I'm not a speedy reader -- just about average, in fact.&nbsp; But for one splendid hour, I was able to read at four or five times my usual pace.&nbsp; I can't explain why except to say that I was so focused on Jude and Sue and Arabella that the whole world outside of that book just disappeared.&nbsp; Moreover, it wasn't only that I read rapidly --I read with insight and with imagination.&nbsp; I felt that I was in touch not only with the novel but with the author himself and that I could grasp and appreciate all of Hardy's contrivances and triumphs.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Thirty or so years later, I re-read <em>Jude </em>and I was astonished to find that my recollection of the novel was superb -- much more detailed and more accurate than of novels that I had recently read or re-read.&nbsp; What a difference from my usual plodding self!&nbsp; What a joy it must be to be truly intelligent about books!</p>

<p>It's obvious that my mind, and everyone's mind, must have much greater capabilities than it ordinarily exhibits.&nbsp; If only we knew how to access that ability.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Three or four times in my life, at a concert or listening to music at home I've felt myself jump to a higher level of understanding.&nbsp; All of a sudden, the form of the music -- even of complex music-- becomes crystal clear and the inevitability of the next note becomes plain.&nbsp; I seem to know what the composer thought he was doing.&nbsp; And then, after a few moments, I become self-conscious and self-aware, the flood of insights wanes, and I decline to my usual, rather pedestrian level of appreciation. </p>

<p>I also had one unique experience when I was between sleep and awake and a tune was repeating itself in my head, and just like! that I started to create interesting variations on the theme.&nbsp; Composers sometimes say that they transcribe music that they hear in their brains, and for a brief moment, it was as though I myself was a composer.&nbsp; But alack, after a few short moments, I came to conscious realization of what was happening and I was roused from my reverie;&nbsp; creativity screeched to a halt.&nbsp; I've never been able to revive within me that particular symphony and song.&nbsp; </p>

<p>It's also happened that while I'm writing something, I enter what could be called a trance state and the world seems to drop away.&nbsp; It's then that I can write four or five good pages in the same amount of time in which I would usually grind out a hundred or so words.&nbsp; It almost seems as though I engage a part of my brain that's not ordinarily available.&nbsp; Rimbaud once remarked that &quot;literature is my unconscious talking to your unconscious.&quot;&nbsp; Maybe geniuses are those who can achieve a level of concentration that allows them to delve into inaccessible areas of the brain.&nbsp; There's a story about Charles Dickens:&nbsp; it's said that he wrote the death scene of Little Nell in the midst of a crowded party and that while he was plying his quill, tears were running down his face and that he was totally oblivious to the noise around him.&nbsp; He was there, in the room, but in another sense, he wasn't there.&nbsp; </p>

<p>It happened to me two or three times that I was speaking to a group when all of a sudden I became aware that I was constructing elegant and artistic paragraph-length sentences -- that my vocabulary had enlarged and that my metaphors were apt and expressive.&nbsp; I can even remember admiring my sudden burst of eloquence-- as though I was simultaneously both performer and observer.&nbsp; But then, after a few moments, the synaptic connections that transformed me into an accomplished orator short-circuited and my supernova sentences reverted to mere competence.&nbsp; Wouldn't in be wonderful to be effortlessly eloquent!&nbsp; One can only lament.&nbsp; But to look on the bright side -- I'm fortunate to have had a few grand moments.&nbsp; Even Kekule only dreamed his benzene rings into existence one single time.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I was taught, and I have no reason not to believe, that there are three forms of matter.&nbsp; There are solids, there are liquids, and there are gases.&nbsp; But nowadays I'm expected to believe that there are at least two other forms of matter.&nbsp; No matter how I frazzle my brain trying to imagine what in the world can exist that isn't a solid, a liquid or a gas, I make no headway.&nbsp; But then I think-- suppose I happened to live in a world in which there were only solids and gases -- where all solids, when heated, immediately sublimed into gases?&nbsp; Suppose there was no ice made of water-- only substances such as dry ice which, it will be remembered, turns directly into carbon dioxide when warmed.&nbsp; In such a world, it would have been beyond my conceptual ability to conceive of matter other than the two forms with which I was familiar.&nbsp; Liquids would have been unimaginable.&nbsp; I can only conclude that other forms of matter are definitely possible;&nbsp; it's just that I myself can't imagine them.</p>

<p>Similarly, there are the familiar colors of the visible spectrum:&nbsp; red, orange yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet.&nbsp; These are the only colors (well, except for brown, and black, and white).&nbsp; But it's well known that birds see colors that humans (who apparently lost some color-sensitive cells during the course of evolution) cannot detect.&nbsp; There are infra-red and ultra-violet colors to which birds respond but that humans are not equipped to perceive.&nbsp; What do these colors look like?&nbsp; I can't possibly imagine, although I dearly wish that I could. An analogy:&nbsp; let's say that we humans were constructed in such a way that we could see only the colors of the spectrum that lie between yellow and blue;&nbsp; there would be no way that we could imagine red or orange, even if we knew that other creatures detected those portions of the spectrum.&nbsp; We would live in a world that had been drained of color.&nbsp; But, in fact, compared to the birds, we do live in a color-attenuated universe.&nbsp; Moreover, there's no way that we can imagine what it is that we're missing.</p>

<p>I wonder also about bats.&nbsp; Bats are blind but they navigate very precisely by echolocation, which is nothing more than very sophisticated radar.&nbsp; They emit high-pitched squeals, and they process the echoes of these emissions in a manner that is so precise that they can catch mosquitoes on the wing.&nbsp; But what is in their minds?&nbsp; Does the radar create a picture -- perhaps something like a three-dimensional black-and-white movie?&nbsp; Or more likely, is something created in the bat brain that only a bat will ever know and that humans will never, ever be able to imagine.&nbsp; And what about whales, who are not blind as bats but both see and also gather information by sonar.&nbsp; What's it's like being a whale?&nbsp; </p>

<p>We're limited by the evolved architecture of our brains.&nbsp; We can't imagine what we can't imagine.&nbsp; We can, however, know that there are phenomena that we can't imagine -- which is something, I guess, but all-in-all a rather paltry compensation.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>(Plasma and the Einstein-Bose condensate, sometimes termed alternative forms of matter, are not so much alternatives to solid, liquid, and gas as they are states of the atoms themselves:&nbsp; plasma amounts to, if I understand what I've read, atoms stripped of their electrons, while the EBC is a bunch of atoms that don't form themselves into a lattice as they would in solids.&nbsp; They just lie there, a frigid clump, each unrelated to the other except by proximity.)&nbsp; </p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Most people either don&#39;t understand academic tenure or regard it as a flagrant scam -- nothing more than a lifetime cushy job burdened with little work and rewarded with long summers vacations. Popular wisdom is entirely incorrect. Tenure is a good deal for those who achieve it and it&#39;s a bargain for America.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>The conventional defense of tenure is that it protects freedom of speech. &#0160;Professors, it&#39;s thought, are natural born dissenters who are likely to propound unusual ideas, which, unless they&#39;re &#39;dangerous,&#39; should be tolerated. (Even though it should be obvious that it&#39;s only the dangerous ideas that need protection.)</p>
<p>There&#39;s some truth to this proposition. Some jobs have been saved (but those who remember the McCarthy period know that university administrators often tripped over themselves to appease the attackers). The professoriat should be encouraged to dissent -- it&#39;s good for the country to encourage divergent and challenging views. But it&#39;s also true that on the whole, professors are not particularly controversial. If there have been cases in which scientists, or business faculty, or professors of literature or music have needed the protections of tenure, they must be rare indeed. Occasionally, very occasionally, a social scientist says something just a bit too anti-establishment, and then along comes some yahoo legislator to demand that the dissenter be fired and tenure be &#39;investigated.&#39;&#0160; &#0160;Nevertheless, it&#39;s hard to make the case that a hundred thousand faculty in non-controversial fields need to be tenured so that one or two people a decade can say something outrageous. I myself think that first-amendment rights as confirmed by the courts are just as good and perhaps better protection than tenure for dissenting views.&#0160;</p>
<p>In my opinion, the best justification for tenure is not freedom of speech but frugality. Let&#39;s begin with the self-evident truth that a person who earns tenure in a respectable institution possesses some very positive intellectual and psychological traits. While one doesn&#39;t have to be a genius to write a dissertation, one has to be able to amass evidence and structure a logical argument and write a decent sentence or two. One must be diligent;&#0160; one must be self-motivated (only half of people who finish graduate courses manage to complete a dissertation); moreover, in the process of securing tenure, a person gains experience in presenting information to groups and also learns a great deal about management and mentoring. These various skills are readily transferable to the private sector of the economy where they would be well rewarded. But when a person of talent and ability chooses to work in the academy, he or she forgoes a large part of his potential earning capacity. &#0160;nstead of a high salary, he receives a lower salary plus the security which comes in the form of tenure. So it&#39;s perfectly reasonable to conceive of tenure as compensation in lieu of cash.&#0160;</p>
<p>When an accomplished individual accepts tenure and a diminished salary, society benefits in a number of ways. It hires talent on the cheap, so education becomes less expensive. If universities had to match private-sector salaries, the cost of sending a million young adults to universities would become prohibitive. There&#39;s also a less obvious but equally important benefit. Without tenure, only the independently wealthy would be able to specialize in, say, in old Mayan, or Tokugawa Japan, or any of thousands of subjects that require concentration and effort but do not have any particular market value. These important but exotic subjects would either disappear from the curriculum, or they would be taught by faculty who would bring to the table the biases of the moneyed classes.&#0160; (This was indeed the case in America before the 1940s when tenure became institutionalized.)&#0160; Faculties would revert again to what they were when Harvard had its Gold Coast: social clubs for amateurs and coupon-clippers. More than any other innovation, tenure has produced the modern democratic university, where faculty can be drawn from any social class.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t mean to say that there aren&#39;t problems with tenure. &#0160;Tenure is difficult to obtain, but it&#39;s also difficult to lose, and faculties could do a much better job at self-policing. If a professor isn&#39;t doing his job, isn&#39;t keeping up with his subject, isn&#39;t make a good faith effort to make a contribution to learning, then he should surrender his claim to lifetime employment. There certainly is such a thing as &quot;deadwood&quot;-- though much less of it than popular mythology would claim. But the deal is this:&#0160; lifetime security for a lifetime of learning. Those who don&#39;t honor the agreement should be speedily purged. No free rides for the lazy dogs.&#0160; But this caveat aside, tenure is a fine, successful institution.</p>
<p>American universities have become and still remain the envy of the world;&#0160; the tenureless university would be less innovative, less democratic, and less distinguished.&#0160;</p>

		<a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2006/06/pythons.html">How to Deal With Enormous, Man-Eating Pythons</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>A few weeks ago, I <a href="http://scrolling.blogs.com/drmetablog/2006/04/lions.html">noted</a> that in <em>The Songlines</em>, Bruce Chatwin made the case that early humans were prey more than they were predators. Now I&#39;ve read a new book on the subject: Donna Hart and Robert W. Sussman, <em>Man the Hunted </em>(Westview, 2005).</p>
<p>The book&#39;s title is a bit misleading because it concentrates on primates other than modern man. Nevertheless, it was good to be reminded of the circumstances under which our hominid ancestors lived. Seven million years ago and until recently, our diminutive forbears were forest dwellers who were pursued by huge crocodilians, outsized eagles, packs of hunting dogs, a variety of giant cats, and hyenas the size of modern lions who had jaws strong enough to crunch human skulls in a single bite.</p>
<p>And also man-eating snakes. In the course of their discussion of snakes, the authors of <em>Man the Hunted </em>report on the instructions provided to early missionaries to Africa on the proper response to pythons. (A 25-foot-long reticulated python can weigh up to 300 pounds.)</p>
<p><span style="color: #3333ff;">Remember not to run away; the python can run faster. The thing to do is to lie flat on the ground on your back with your feet together, arms to the sides and head well down. The python will then try to push its head under you, experimenting at every possible point. Ke<em>ep calm</em>, one wiggle and he will get under you, wrap his coils round you and crush you to death. After a time the python will get tired of this and will probably decide to swallow you without the usual preliminaries. He will very likely begin with one of your feet<em>. Keep calm</em>. You must let him swallow your foot. It is quite painless and will take a long time. If you lose your head and struggle he will quickly whip his coils around you. If <em>you keep calm</em>, he will go on swallowing. Wait patiently until he has swallowed about up to your knee. Then carefully take out your knife and insert it into the distended side of his mouth and with a quick rip slit him up. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Well-meant advice, I&#39;m sure, but perhaps difficult to follow. Suppose you&#39;re just not in the mood to allow the python such liberties with your person. Suppose you&#39;ve forgotten to bring your knife; suppose the python decides to start with your head rather than a foot. Suppose you involuntarily wiggle just a teensy bit. Suppose you just don&#39;t feel that it&#39;s a good day to be engulfed.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">I think that, on the whole, running away and screaming at the top of your lungs is a more sensible reaction. But then again, I never signed up to be a missionary.</span></p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>When I was no more than a hemidemisemiquaver, I would listen attentively as my mother sat at her old Hardman piano and sang ditties by Gilbert and Sullivan. I believe that the first song I ever learned “by heart” was “I’m called Little Buttercup” with its still mysterious “pretty polonies.” In 1947, when the D’Oyly Carte company made its first post-war American tour, I was taken to see a performance of <em>H. M. S. Pinafore</em>. I was utterly transported. No subsequent theatrical experience has worked equivalent magic. I still think that it’s a little miracle that I saw with my own rapt eyes such legendary Savoyard stalwarts as Ella Halman, Darrell Fancourt, and Martyn Green.</p>
<p><em>Pinafore</em> was the only stage play that I saw until I was past adolescence and out of the house. What could have prompted such uncharacteristic extravagance on my parents&#39; part? Whatever the cause, the result was that my infatuation with Gilbert and Sullivan&#39;s operas was early established. The attachment was difficult to sustain because there was no family phonograph; moreover, those thick, heavy albums of 78s would have broken the budget. I was fortunate to possess a tattered old anthology of G&#0160; &amp; S songs from which I would pick out tunes as best I could.</p>
<p>In college I had a roommate who was a genuine savoyardophile and who arrived with a &quot;hi-fi&quot; and an extensive collection of ‘long playing’ records. I took advantage of his resources and his knowledge. During the fifties and sixties I attended performances of the full G &amp; S repertory in various amateur and semi-pro productions-–even a rare <em>Utopia Ltd</em>. at the Loeb Drama Center in Cambridge. I also acquired a treasured collection of D’Oyly Carte and Glyndebourne performances on vinyl. During the seventies and eighties, I couldn’t clean the house or cook a meal without the assistance of Sir Arthur. But turntables and 33s went the way of 78s, and then the vinyl itself came to be sequestered in plastic tubs in the basement.</p>
<p>I was G &amp; S-less for a decade or so, but <em>Topsy-Turvy (1999)</em>, the great Mike Leigh film, rekindled an unfaded love. Now, sixty years after my first <em>Pinafore</em>, I’m compiling a new collection of recordings (everything’s out there on CD if you’re patient). I now own reissues of classic D’Oyly Carte recordings and also of a sparkling <em>Mikado </em>by the Welsh National Opera. In the fall, the entire collection will be transferred to the iPod. Who would have guessed that I&#39;d have gone through four or five new technologies in my lifetime? And yet the song remains the same.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">What is the attraction? Gilbert and Sullivan, I think, gave me early authorization to be silly. The operas licensed criticism of oppressive or irrational social norms. Everything was fair game. Inasmuch as I was raised in a rigidly conformist society, the G &amp; S precedent was a great liberation. I’m absolutely convinced that a great big hunk of my sense of humor was formed around a Gilbertian core.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When I was a boy, it was the clever patter songs that most struck me. They’re still good, and some are brilliant. Bunthorne’s soliloquy in <em>Patience</em>, in which he confesses that “he’s not fond of uttering platitudes/ In stained glass attitudes” is as fully on target now as it was in 1881. Simply substitute tired modish Derridadaism for the &quot;high aesthetic line,&quot; and “the meaning doesn’t matter if it’s only idle chatter of a transcendental kind” jumps right out at you.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">But nowadays, it’s not Gilbert&#39;s free-standing wit but Sullivan&#39;s glorious ensembles that cause the shiver of delight. Instances: <em>Iolanthe&#39;s </em>“Oh, many a man in friendship’s name”<em>; </em>Ko-ko, Pooh-Bah, and Pish-Tush singing “To sit in solemn silence in a dull dark dock”; in <em>Ruddigore, </em>the trio “In sailing o’er life’s ocean wide,/ No doubt your heart should be your guide/ But it is awkward when you find/ A heart that does not know its mind.” And many others, including, certainly, the quartet from <em>Yeoman of the Guard</em>: “Strange adventure, maiden wedded/ To a groom she’s never seen.” Still another transcendent moment: the high silliness in <em>Pirates</em>, when the assembled choruses kneel to sing the resplendent, ridiculous: &quot;Hail poetry, thou heaven-born maid… &#0160;All hail, divine emollient.&quot; I think that the touchstone of all touchstones is a truly wondrous brief duet in <em>Iolanthe, </em>when the lovesick Lords Tolloler and Mountararat, tenor and baritone, rejected by Phyllis, who chooses a simple shepherd over their dignities, leave the stage singing &quot;Neath this blow/ Worse than stab of dagger/ Though we mo-/ Mentarily stagger,/ In each heart,/ Proud are we innately,/ Let’s depart, dignified and stately.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In addition to the satire, and the splendid music, G &amp;S also supplies great big helpings of joy. G &amp; S manage to persuade me, at least for the duration of the play, to give credence to “rapture, rapture,” and that “pleasures come in endless series,” and “joy unbounded,” and “laughing song and merry dance,” and “happier than any/ A pound to a penny,/ A lover is when he/ Embraces his bride.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There’s much to deplore in Gilbert’s creations: nasty racism, an insufferable obsession with class (embraced even as it appears to be refuted), jingoism, which is sometimes satirized but often (as in the faux-japonisme of <em>The Mikado</em>) unconsciously accepted, as well as the constant distasteful bludgeoning of middle-age women. But just as we forgive Shylock in order to embrace King Lear, so we must suspend our moral indignation to revel in the best of Gilbert.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Last week, two of the grandchildren visited for a few days. We rented the DVD of the Central Park Kevin Kline-Linda Ronstadt <em>Pirates. </em>The kids were attentive, engaged. Next time they visit: more Gilbert and Sullivan. Perhaps we can plant a savoyardian seed.&#0160; &#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I first stumbled over Spellcheck&#39;s wayward sense of humor years ago when I was writing about Shakespeare&#39;s <em>Romeo and Juliet.&#0160;</em>Spellcheck rejected Capulet, which is Juliet&#39;s family name, and presumptuously instead offered the choice of either &quot;co-pilot&quot; or &quot;copulate.&quot;</p>
<p>Spellcheck is deeply offended by proper names, uncommon words, neologisms, words in a language other than English, etc., and sometimes makes its impatience known by suggesting dadaist or absurd substitutions.</p>
<p>For example, everyone (everyone except Spellcheck, that is) knows that Muggletonians are members of a religion founded in England in the 1650s by Lodowick Muggleton which held, among other doctrines, the idea that heaven was only slightly above the reach of our uplifted arms. Spellcheck has an irrational animus toward this harmless, near-extinct religion and proposed as substitutes for Muggletonian, the words &quot;Argentinian,&quot; &quot;Miltonic,&quot; &quot;Macedonian,&quot; &quot;Justinian&quot; and (as a pure instance of spellcheckian whimsy) &quot;melatonin.&quot;</p>
<p>Apparently untutored in geography, Spellcheck rejected the ancient north African and modern upper New York state city of Utica in favor of &quot;Attica,&quot; which makes a kind of sense, but also &quot;Utah,&quot; which is a bit off-the-wall, &quot;Utopia,&quot; which is nowhere, and the imaginative but bizarre &quot;erotica.&quot;</p>
<p>A recent entry on berries provoked an orgy of spellcheckian absurdity. For fenberry, &quot;Canberra&quot;; for crowberry, both &quot;crowbar&quot; and &quot;crockery&quot;; for lingonberry, &quot;linguine,&quot; &quot;lingerie&quot; and &quot;nunnery&quot;; for whortleberry, &quot;wheelbarrow&quot;;&#0160; for earthberry, &quot;authoress&quot;; for cloudberry, &quot;glittery&quot; and the truly wild, out-of-left-field &quot;Goldberg.&quot;&#0160; Speaking of left field: for rbi&#39;s, Spellcheck proposed both &quot;ribs&quot; and &quot;rabbis&quot;; for Ebbets (as in Ebbets Field), simply &quot;beets&quot;;&#0160; for Newcombe, as in the great Dodger pitcher Don Newcombe, &quot;encumber.&quot;</p>
<p>In another recent post I invented the word &quot;mccranwichorama,&quot; defined as a display of inferior coinages of words in which detached segments (such as the wich in cranwich) acquire new meaning. I knew that when I batted mccranwichorama over the net, I would probe the outer limits of Spelllcheck&#39;s powers, but I must say that the program rose to the occasion when it parried with a transcendent absurdity: for mccranwichorama:&#0160; &quot;mercurochrome.&quot; &#0160; &#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p class="MsoNormal">There&#39;s more neighborhood mountain lion news: yesterday a seven-year-old boy, walking in the rearward of a group of six or seven hikers, was pounced upon in the mountains just west of town by a big guy. The child was bitten and clawed but is now recovering. Family members drove the lion away.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In my view, they should never have allowed the child to pull up the rear.&#0160;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I’d been thinking about predators even before this last attack (see the entry for April 8).&#0160; By one of those curious convergences that make life so rich, I just happened to be reading Bruce Chatwin’s <em>The Songlines</em> (New York: Viking, 1987), a travel narrative ostensibly about the sacred but invisible paths along which the ancestors of the Australian aborigines traveled and &#39;sang the world into existence.&#39;&#0160; The thesis of this quirky, self-indulgent and intermittently brilliant narrative is that human beings are by nature not sedentary but migratory.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">But the book isn&#39;t only about migrants; &#0160;n one of <em>The Songlines&#39; </em>many meanders, Chatwin writes a few pages on the age-old interaction of human beings with big predators like the mountain lion. He takes issue with the much-loved claim of right-wing thinkers that human beings are naturally territorial and aggressive -- that we are nothing more than naked apes who must continually strive to control larger and larger dominions. Instead, he offers the alternative view that because of our long history of fending off predators, human beings are naturally not aggressive but defensive&#0160; -- and, moreover, that It&#39;s the defensive imperative that caused our species to move from savagery to civility. He asks us to think of the situation of the earliest humans. &quot;The first men were humbled, harried, besieged -- their communities few and fragmented… clinging to life and one another through the horrors of the night.&quot;&#0160; &quot;Might not,&quot; he asks, &quot;all the attributes we call ‘human’ – language, song-making, food-sharing, gift-giving, intermarriage... have evolved as stratagems for survival, hammered out against tremendous odds, to avert the threat of extinction?&quot;&#0160; It&#39;s a challenging, overarching hypothesis -- and whether or not there are facts to validate it is beyond my ken.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It&#39;s certainly true that first humans in Africa had to cope with a variety of nasty predators -- lions were there long before people -- and that when&#0160; our ancestors migrated to Europe they walked into a wild, dangerous country. The European lion, <em>panthera leo,</em> widespread from 900,000 years ago to the end of the last ice age, was a third taller and longer than surviving African lions, which themselves can weigh 450 pounds and reach a length of 8 1/2 feet. The lions in the virginal land that our ancestors crossed the Mediterranean to colonize would have been as tall as a fully grown Paleolithic man and might have weighed as much as 880 pounds.&#0160; And remember that for 99% of our time on earth, humans were either entirely unarmed or possessed only of the hand ax -- a palm-size piece of sharpened but haft-less flint. No matter what theory of the origins of civilization we embrace, we should remember that our genes were selected in a world of woolly rhinoceroses, mammoths, aurochs, and wolves and that we competed with the big bears for what were then the best residences on earth-- the limestone caves in the Ardeche region in France.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It&#39;s in these caves that the memory of European lions is beautifully preserved. Thirty thousand years ago, a long tradition of animal representation climaxed in the paintings in the Chauvet Cave. There are beautiful representations of European lions on the hunt and at rest in Jean-Marie Chauvet&#39;s <em>The Dawn of Art: The Chauvet Cave </em>(New York: Abrams, 1995) --&#0160; irrefutable evidence that our forefathers knew them at first hand.&#0160; It&#39;s unquestionable that many a child -- and many an adult -- fell prey to these adversaries. And perhaps Chatwin is right; perhaps those humans who survived to reproduce were selected not for aggressiveness but for congeniality and especially for artistic ability. How else can we account for our species&#39; continual preoccupation, or perhaps obsession, with all the many forms of beauty?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>April 17.&#0160; </em>The authorities tracked and killed an 80-pound female panther. I sincerely hope that it was the offending animal and not an innocent bystander.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>In my post on the Templeton prayer study, I did not mention the outcome least congenial to prayer enthusiasts: not only did prayer do no good, it also caused real harm. “A significantly higher number of the patients who knew that they were being prayed for — 59 percent — suffered complications, compared with 51 percent of those who were uncertain [whether or not they were being prayed for”].&#0160;</p>
<p>How could it happen that prayees did worse than patients who were just let alone?&#0160; Dr. Charles Bethea, co-author of the Templeton study and cardiologist at the Integris Baptist Medical Center in Oklahoma City proposed that &quot;it may have made [patients] uncertain, wondering am I so sick they had to call in their prayer team?&quot;&#0160; It&#39;s a possible scenario -- it’s no secret that depressed and anxious patients do worse than happy ones. But the “patient is anxious” explanation doesn’t work for those who didn’t know that they were on the receiving end of prayers.&#0160; Among the group of unwitting prayees, “18 percent suffered major complications, like heart attack or stroke, compared with 13 percent in the group that did not receive prayers.”&#0160; Researchers offered no hypothesis for this unanticipated result except to say that it was a chance outcome.</p>
<p>So let us review: when prayees know that they’re being prayed for, their decline is a product of anxiety; when they don’t know that they&#39;re being prayed for, their decline is the result of chance. In both cases, the unwanted phenomenon is explained by natural rather than supernatural causes.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Let us now imagine that the study produced contrary results and that the prayees had lower rates of complications than the unprayed. Would there not have been banner headlines in newspapers and on Fox proclaiming that prayer has been proven to be effective remedy for the complications of surgery?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The error in logic is enormous and obvious. When prayer fails, it&#39;s for natural reasons. If and when prayer succeeds, it&#39;s because of supernatural intervention. It&#39;s a flagrant double standard where a symmetrical standard should be mandatory. If prayer succeeds because of divine intervention, it&#39;s only logical that it must fail because of symmetrical supernatural intrusions -- because, for example, malificent demonic forces located the prayer providers, hijacked their prayers mid-flight, and turned good into evil. It&#39;s a difficult hypothesis to prove, it&#39;s true, but it&#39;s exactly as credible as the ideas that are put forward by prayer science.&#0160; &#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>On the night of August 23, 1990, an eighty-pound, two-year-old female mountain lion wandered into our backyard.</p>
<p>The story appears in a book on cougar-human interactions (David Baron, <em>The Beast in the Garden</em> [New York: Norton, 2004], 182-187) -- a book which also contains a picture of &quot;our&quot; lioness, lying drugged on the ground (167).</p>
<p>My strongest memory of that encounter doesn&#39;t appear in the book and deserves a report.&#0160; The lioness was crouching on a low branch of a box elder, and a goodly number of police loitered on the street and in the yards and alleys waiting for the wildlife-control officer and his tranquillizing dart. Eventually the marksman arrived and shot the lioness. The animal leaped down from the tree. As soon as she hit the ground and started to run, we could hear the sound, resonating throughout the neighborhood, of car doors being slammed shut as the officers rushed into their vehicles -- to re-emerge only when the lioness collapsed.</p>
<p>Last week, there was another mountain lion in a near neighbor&#39;s backyard. It was daylight;&#0160; the owner of the house had her video camera available and produced a very clear record of a magnificent animal -- much larger and more formidable that the one we had seen. Two nights ago, the neighbors held a meeting and the author <em>of The Beast in the Garden</em>, who lives in town, came to tell us about cougars in our county and what to do if we encounter them. The good news is that the odds of being attacked are small: only one local person (a high school student jogging alone near Idaho Springs) has been killed -- or taken, the word is -- during the last decade. The author&#39;s advice: bring a companion with you when you go walking in the mountains-- it&#39;s unlikely that a catamount will attack two people, and if he should attack, then there are two of you to fend him off. (He didn&#39;t repeat a familiar bit of local humor: &quot;Always bring&#0160; a friend with you when you walk in mountain-lion country. Remember, you don&#39;t have to outrun the lion; you just have to outrun your friend.&quot;)&#0160; He also reminded the audience that it&#39;s wrong to run away (because you will look like prey) but that you should make yourself look big, make noise, throw rocks, etc. Do not, repeat do not, play dead -- or worse yet, get down on all fours and try to crawl away. But on the whole it&#39;s not the mountain lion you see who&#39;s the danger; it&#39;s the mountain lion whom you don&#39;t see, but sees you. The one you feel.</p>
<p>A jogger was in the mountains with his faithful pooch at his side.&#0160; He came to the top of a rise and there, on the road, was a big panther.&#0160; The jogger&#39;s dog immediately disappeared into the roadside vegetation. The man did everything right -- shouted, threw things, stared the lion down. Eventually, and slowly, the big beast moved away and the jogger continued on his run. When he came to the bottom of the hill, Faithful Companion, who had taken the long way around,&#0160; reappeared and resumed running&#0160; with his master.</p>
<p>Man&#39;s best friend, but within sensible limits.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>A friend, a retired nurse, was keeping watch when her ninety-plus-year-old mother was about to breath her last. The mother, who had not been coherent for some days, was either unconscious or sleeping deeply when she suddenly roused herself, looked closely at the daughter, uttered the words &quot;you need rouge,&quot; and died.&#0160;</p>
<p>This story is self-explanatory but nevertheless I feel compelled to embark on a course of no doubt supererogatory explications. The mother expresses a variety of emotions: some positive, some not so good.&#0160; Primarily she is affectionate and protective. She wants her daughter to take care of herself and be her best, so she proposes a practical cosmetic enhancement. But at the same time, she is intrusively judgmental, because the statement &quot;you need rouge&quot; clearly finds the daughter deficient and in need of cosmetic enhancement.</p>
<p>&#0160;The mother is also impolite -- but only in the way that people who know each other intimately can sometimes be unmannerly. This particular mother wouldn&#39;t speak nearly so frankly to anyone in the world but her own daughter. In addition, she&#39;s competitive. &quot;You need rouge&quot; means not only &quot;you&#39;re pallid, you need help,&quot; but also hints at &quot;I never needed rouge.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#39;s a humorous anecdote, because it&#39;s about the eternal continuity of mothering.&#0160; Even at the moment of death, the mother remains entirely and unequivocally maternal. The phrase &quot;you need rouge&quot; also makes us smile because it displaces other last words&#0160; -- words of wisdom or serenity or love -- that we might anticipate or for which we might hope.</p>
<p>And what about the daughter?&#0160; Was she, or should she be, pleased, resigned, offended, amused?&#0160; &#0160;</p>
