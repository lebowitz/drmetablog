		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Every once in a while, I experience something that I call a &quot;cultural convergence&quot; -- perhaps an event reported in a daily newspaper that closely resembles something on the very page of the novel that I happen to be reading. A cross-genre overlap, let us say.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s in example of such a coincidence that amused me much.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Yesterday evening I watched the classic western <em>The Magnificent Seven (1960) </em>and this morning I read, once again, Shakespeare&#39;s <em>Twelfth Night</em>. It&#39;s hard to believe but yes, there is a very brief moment where two such very distinct works brush against one another.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Unlike <em>TN,</em> The<em> Magnificent Seven </em>is a violent spectacle that steers clear of humor, or subtle characterization or extensive dialogue. After the climactic concluding battle to preserve the Mexican village has been both lost and won, the two surviving gunmen share a moment before trotting off on their separate ways. Chris Adams (Yul Brynner) inquires of Vin Tanner (Steve McQueen) if he has a plan for what comes next. Laconic Vin, cowpoke and gunslinger, responds, &quot;driftin&#39;.&#0160;</p>
<p>In <em>Twelfth Night</em>, there&#39;s a similar question and a similar answer, but in a far different idiom. Antonio asks Sebastian, who has survived a shipwreck, about his plans. Sebastian&#39;s view of his future is essentially the same as Vin&#39;s, but there is none of that &quot;ah shucks&quot; minimalism in his reply. Instead, Sebastian responds, &quot;My determinate voyage is mere extravagancy.&quot; &#0160;</p>
<p>[While Vin&#39;s one-word answer is clear as clear can be, Sebastian&#39;s &quot;mere extravagancy&quot; requires a bit of a gloss. Nowadays, &quot;extravagancy&quot; (usually &quot;extravagance&quot;) signifies a &quot;lack of restrain in purchasing luxury goods.&quot; Not so in 1600, when &quot;extravagant&quot; remained much closer to its root etymological inheritance. The word descends from L. <em>vagare, &quot;</em>to wander.&quot; Extra-vagance therefore means something like &quot;wander beyond.&quot; Here&#39;s a more familiar example of the word at work: when Roderigo characterizes Othello as an &quot;extravagant and wheeling stranger,&quot; he does not criticize Othello for spending too many ducats on his fancy get-up. He means that he&#39;s a rootless and wandering non-native. (Wheeling? my dictionary glosses wheeling as &quot;roving, wandering, <strong>drifting&quot;).</strong> And also: &quot;mere&quot; did not then connote triviality; its meaning is closer to &quot;pure.&quot; &quot;Determinate&quot; meant and still means &quot;decided.&quot;)</p>
<p>Therefore Sebastian&#39;s sentence --&quot;My determinate voyage is mere extravagancy&quot; -- is directly equivalent to&#0160; Vin&#39;s &quot;driftin&#39;&#39;&quot;. Cultural convergence at its best.</p>
<p>It&#39;s just two ways of talkin&#39;.&#0160;</p>
<p>I sometimes wonder about Shakespeare&#39;s intent here. Why did he bother to put such a difficult sentence in Sebastian&#39;s mouth? For purposes of characterization, certainly. But at the expense of clarity. Wouldn&#39;t it have been more economical, more transparent, for Sebastian to say something plain, such as &quot;I don&#39;t have a plan, I&#39;ll just wander.&quot; It&#39;s certain that some percentage of Shakespeare&#39;s audience, perhaps most, will not grasp the meaning&#0160; of the sentence as written and will be left puzzled. Yet as he so often does, Shakespeare preferred eloquence to transparency.&#0160;</p>
<p>In my opinion, Shakespeare delighted in his own fluency.&#0160; And sometimes I think that Shakespeare wasn&#39;t just writing to be heard by his Globe or Blackfriars audience. He was writing to be read and studied --&#0160; although I doubt he could have imagined a future in which his sentences would be glossed with crowded inches of small-type footnotes.</p>
<p>It it possible that Shakespeare also had an inkling that, as Beethoven once put it, he was writing for &quot;a latter age?&quot;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>&quot;Bottom&quot; is another of the many words that came into my life through the medium of baseball. As soon as I was able to walk and talk, I learned that an inning has both a &quot;top&quot; and a &quot;bottom.&quot; &quot;Bottom of the ninth&quot; was an optimistic phrase because there was always the Ebbets Field hope that the Dodgers might come through with a game-winning rally. Later, when I discovered that there was more to human existence than baseball, the various and colorful meanings of &quot;bottom&quot; began to reveal themselves. For example, the posterior part of the human body, which I knew as the ass or the behind or the tuchas, was, I learned, called the &quot;bottom&quot; by people of sophistication. A euphemism?&#0160; A Britishism?&#0160;</p>
<p>Even later on, I discovered that bottom, signifying buttocks or butt was not the root meaning of the word but a metaphorical extension of its original sense. Old English <em>botm, </em>cognate with Latin f<em>undus</em>, meant land or farm or soil. This meaning of &quot;bottom&quot; is well-preserved in the phrase &quot;bottom land&quot; -- the level and fertile acres along the banks of a watercourse. Many English family names are consequently topographical surnames of ancient inhabitants of various river fronts -- such as Bottoms, Robottom, Higginbottom, Ramsbottom, Longbottom, Winterbottom, and Bottomley. Names that have nothing to do with either innings or asses.</p>
<p>The oddity that &quot;bottom&quot; can refer both to farmland and to the human butt can sometimes yield unconscious comedy. For example, in 1977, I was a guest at a wedding in the infelicitously named Kent village of Pett Bottom. I must hope that Pett is a variant of Pitt, a &quot;hollow,&quot; rather than commonplace &quot;pet&quot; with a supernumerary &quot;t&quot;.</p>
<p>These days, &quot;bottom&quot; is more likely to mean something like &quot;the essence&quot; -- as in such phrases &quot;to get to the bottom of the matter&quot;; or &quot;the bottom of one&#39;s heart.&quot;</p>
<p>And then there&#39;s egregious Bottom in A <em>Midsummer Night&#39;s Dream</em>, who does not disdain the mandatory pun: &quot;This is to make an ass of me.&quot;</p>
<div class="word--C9UPa">
<div class="">
<div id="etymonline_v_43248">Shakespeare likes the word &quot;bottom.&quot; Here&#39;s Malcolm&#39;s most memorable characterization of Macbeth.&#0160;&#0160;</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>&#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; I grant him bloody,<br />Luxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful,<br />Sudden, malicious, smacking of every sin<br />That has a name: but there&#39;s no&#0160;<strong><span class="keyword1">bottom</span>,</strong> none,<br />In my voluptuousness: your wives, your daughters,<br />Your matrons and your maids, could not fill up<br />The cistern of my lust, and my desire<br />All continent impediments would o&#39;erbear<br />That did oppose my will:</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>This &quot;bottom&quot; is not farmland or butt; it&#39;s the low point in a downward trajectory. This &quot;bottom&quot; is associated with &quot;cistern&quot; -- a receptacle for holding water.&#0160; Curiously, Shakespeare regularly uses the word in its relation to the water of oceans, most specifically the sea-bottom:&#0160;&#0160;</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>&#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; the slimy <strong><span class="keyword1">bottom</span></strong> of the deep.&#0160; &#0160; (<em>Richard III</em>)</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>O coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz, that thou didst know how many fathom deep I am in love! But it cannot be sounded; my affection hath an unknown&#0160;<strong><span class="keyword1">bottom</span></strong>, like the Bay of Portugal.&#0160; (<strong>As You Like It</strong>)</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>By heaven, methinks it were an easy leap,<br />To pluck bright honor from the pale-faced moon,<br />Or dive into the&#0160;<strong><span class="keyword1">bottom</span></strong>&#0160;of the deep,<br />Where fathom-line could never touch the ground,<br />And pluck up drowned honor by the locks.&#0160; (<em>I Henry IV</em>)</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>As is the ooze and&#0160;<strong><span class="keyword1">bottom</span></strong> of the sea. (<em>Henry V</em>)</div>
<div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>Who ever yet could sound thy&#0160;<strong><span class="keyword1">bottom</span></strong>? find<br />The ooze, to show what coast thy sluggish crare<br />Might easiliest harbour in?&#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160;(<em>Cymbeline)</em></div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>I suspect that Shakespeare would have savored the modern phrase, &quot;bottom feeder.&quot;&#0160; But I doubt he would have understood, any more than I do, the names of the fifth and sixth quarks, which are top and bottom (exactly like an inning).</div>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Many years ago, in what sometimes seems like an earlier life, I taught Shakespeare courses to both young and &quot;mature&quot; students.&#0160;When we reached <em>Othello</em>, halfway through the semester, I would, of course, point out that the play did not take the traditional form of tragedy-- of a great man or king gone awry as in the case of Macbeth or Richard III. <em>Othello</em> instead introduced a formula that was innovative for its time but which has become commonplace in ours. <em>Othello</em> is a domestic drama in which a marriage falls all to pieces. I liked to tell my captive audience, only slightly facetiously, that the whole of life is divided into two parts: the comic, which begins with birth and ends with marriage, and the tragic, which begins with marriage and proceeds to death. A statement which is a kind of shorthand, simplified version of a cliche of criticism. Like many such abbreviations, this formula contains a dollop of truth. <em>Othello</em> in fact begins with a marriage -- or more accurately a defiant elopement -- and comes to conclusion with Desdemona strangled in her bed and her husband the Moor a suicide. It&#39;s the sole play of Shakespeare&#39;s that follows the strict marriage-to-death path, although <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> is comic until the secret wedding but becomes tragic afterwards, while the wondrous <em>Winter&#39;s Tale</em> begins with Leontes and Hermione already married and pushes through some desperate circumstances only to come to a miraculous comic climax with the restoration of a woman presumed dead and a glorious second-generation wedding. Both RJ and WT sometimes seem like two different and opposite kinds of plays condensed into one -- and yet are all the more triumphant for being so.</p>
<p>These musings were precipitated by the film that we watched a couple of nights ago -- <em>Nora Prentiss </em>(1947), which Wikipedia characterizes as a film noir, but which is better thought of as two films in one -- a film that starts as an instance of domestic drama or &quot;bourgeois realism&quot; or even soap opera and doesn&#39;t become a murder mystery until two-thirds along the way. In a limited sense, it&#39;s not unlike Shakespeare&#39;s hybrids, but alas does not successfully yoke or blend its disparate plots. As a result, the last section of <em>Nora Prentiss, </em>I&#39;m sorry to say, becomes not intriguing but unbelievable and ludicrous. It&#39;s an odd and interesting film, although not a good one, but it&#39;s worth watching for aficionados of TCM not only for its manipulation of genre expectations but also because it is one of a large group of films that are so very common and ordinary in twentieth-century America where such enormous value is attached to a happy and fulfilling marriage -- and to the disappointment that arises when the marriage comes a-cropper. In <em>Nora Prentis</em>s, a midlife couple with a pair of kids, who live in an orderly picket-fence house, ought to be living a happy life, but, by golly, both husband and wife are discontented and bored. They are afflicted with the whole package of suburban anxieties. It&#39;s Cheever-land or Updyke-land: demanding children and divorcing friends, the stultifying daily routine, the unsatisfying jobs, the dull obligatory social events, and especially the lack of sexual excitement which is signified in these Code-burdened movies by the gulf between the twin beds and the sterile head-to-toe sleepwear and also by that pathetic chaste kiss before husband and wife turn away from each other as they extinguish the cute matching bedside table lamps. Gosh, it&#39;s a scenario that is familiar from dozens and perhaps scores of postwar (and later) films.&#0160;</p>
<p>Melodramatic <em>Nora Prentiss</em> follows the fortunes of steady-Eddie Dr. Richard Talbot, enacted by Kent Smith, who meets nightclub chantoosie Nora, played by Anne Sheridan. Flirtation turns into an affair, and the affair evolves into true love or at least into genuine sexual passion. But all goes from bad to worse when Talbot, instead of seeking a divorce from his stern unlovely wife, concocts a dumb whopper of a plot that makes Friar Lawrence&#39;s harebrained sleeping-dram waking-up-in-the-tomb plan seem brilliant in comparison. Talbot fakes his own death and disappears -- causing the film to turn police-procedural. And then, through a series of hard-to-credit mischances and gimmicks, Talbot finds himself in his newly assumed fake guise indicted for murdering -- oh no yes indeed! -- his very own self. <em>Nora Prentiss </em>by this time has metamorphosed into a film that by rights should be renamed <em>City of Naked Death</em> or<em> Shadow of Evil Night. </em>Even so, the film might have been salvaged had not so much depended on the acting skill of Kent Smith, who is perfectly fine in the first part of the film, but incapable of managing the switch from reliable doc to nervous fugitive. It&#39;s not entirely his fault: the role puts too much pressure on the actor. I doubt whether such a transition could have been handled by Roscius or Burbage or Garrick or Sir Laurence Olivier himself.</p>
<p>Here is a picture of Ann Sheridan and Kent Smith. Sheridan wisely holds on to her hat; Smith&#39;s chapeau dominates the scene; very 1940s.&#0160;</p>

He wears it when he&#39;s a straight suburbanite and shaves it off when he goes underground -- an infranasal situation highly out of synch with the psychological trajectory of the film; by rights, he should have been clean-shaven when he was domestic and hirsute when he was a criminal.</div>

<div class="uhHOwf BYbUcd" data-bla="">Just to bring these ramblings to conclusion, I should add that the evening after we watched <em>Nora Prentiss</em>, we gambled on a newish HBO film called <em>Date Night</em> (2011) only to experience a moment of extreme cultural convergence. Once again, a suburban couple (this time Steve Carell and Tina Fey) are stuck in a boring suburban marriage --&#0160; same sheaf of symptoms as in <em>Nora P</em>. They jointly decide to liven things up and before push comes to shove, they find themselves in a big city world of traditional noir tropes: mistaken identity, guns and gangsters, police on the take, a corrupt mayor, deserted dark buildings, death threats. <em>Date Night</em> even flirts with old archetypes: in order to renew themselves, the couple must pass through an underworld (not Hades this time, but the criminal underworld) where Acheron is played by a lake in Manhattan&#39;s Central Park). It&#39;s not credible, of course, but then, it&#39;s not meant to be so.</div>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Here on Walnut Street, we&#39;re trying to make more and better use of locatives -- words that have long been underemployed and undervalued. We think that the language (and therefore the world) would be richer and more commodious if others would join with us in this endeavor. But we&#39;re not evangelizing, heck no! We honor and respect each and every person&#39;s private and personal linguistic choices, locatively-speaking.&#0160;</p>
<p>Nor do we refer to the common adverbial locatives, such as homeward, downtown, underground, or nearby.&#0160; The locatives that we wish to revive and reinvigorate are the neglected -- even forsaken -- classics of locativity.</p>
<p>Everyone uses the locative <strong>where -- </strong>the point upon which you metaphorically stand --&#0160; but how many of us remember to employ the excellent and useful &quot;to&quot; form, <strong>whither</strong>, or the &quot;from&quot; form, <strong>whence</strong>.&#0160; It&#39;s true that whither and whence sound a trifle obsolescent, but with frequent use the flexible ear will soon accommodate. One might be tempted to say &quot;wither goest thou&quot; or &quot;whence com&#39;st thou&quot;, but with a little effort, &quot;whither do you go&quot; and &quot;whence do you come&quot; will sound perfectly natural, I&#39;m sure.</p>
<p>Similarly, we regularly use the word <strong>here, </strong>but by golly, we have slighted <strong>hither</strong> (to here) and <strong>hence</strong> (from here).</p>
<p>Equally neglectful is the abandonment of <strong>thither</strong> and<strong> thence </strong>(&quot;to there&quot; and &quot;from there&quot;). Extraordinary useful words, relegated thoughtlessly to the rear of the locative line.</p>
<p>And then of course, there&#39;s <strong>yon,</strong> <strong>yond</strong> and <strong>yonder</strong>, all related varieties of &quot;there&quot; but further off than &quot;there.&quot; At a distance. Shakespeare, as one would expect, is a most skillful deployer of <strong>yons</strong>. From <em>Hamlet: &quot;</em>But look, the morn in russet mantle clad/ Walks o&#39;er the dew of <strong>yon&#0160;</strong>high eastern hill.&quot;&#0160; From J<em>ulius Caesar</em>. &quot;<strong>Yond</strong> Cassius has a lean and hungry look;/ He thinks too much; such men are dangerous.&quot;&#0160; From <em>Romeo and Juliet. &quot;</em>What lady&#39;s that/ Which doth enrich the hand of <strong>yonder</strong> knight?&quot;</p>
<p>A yonnish locative that is not endangered and continues to thrive is the word <strong>beyond</strong>. Shakespeare&#39;s most remarkable and I daresay most beautiful use of &quot;beyond&quot; occurs in <em>Cymbeline</em>, when Innogen learns that her exiled lover Posthumus Leonatus has returned to England. She is impatient to meet him at Milford Haven; Innogen&#39;s speech that begins with the plaintive cry, &quot;O, for a horse with wings&quot; includes the most transcendent barrier-busting locative in the entire history of the English language. Her longing to see her lover is, she claims, &quot;beyond beyond.&quot; A superlative locative, beyond anyone&#39;s imagination but Will&#39;s.&#0160;&#0160;</p>

		<a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2023/03/boot-booty-bootless-.html">Words of My Life: Boot</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Is there another common English word that exhibits such varied meanings as &quot;boot?&quot; Or one that has shown such continual transformation during my brief years on the planet?</p>
<p>Like much of my early vocabulary, &quot;boot&quot; entered my life through the medium of <a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2006/10/radio_baseball.html">radio baseball </a>. In my mind&#39;s ear, I can hear the voice of Red Barber announcing that &quot;umpire Babe Pinelli has just given the <strong>boot</strong> to Leo Durocher.&quot; &quot;Given the boot&quot; does not make the claim that Durocher was presented with footwear; it means that he was kicked out of the game as if with a metaphorically-booted foot.</p>
<p>Nor was it only obstreperous managers who were &quot;booted.&quot; &quot;There&#39;s a two-hopper to third, but Cox boots it&quot; -- meaning that he bobbled it, even though the ball never touched his foot. In baseball, curiously, you can boot a ball with your hand, which is, logically speaking, as nonsensical as mis-gloving it with your foot.&#0160;</p>
<p>As everyone knows, a boot primarily protects the area from the shin down to the toes. But there&#39;s a second common meaning to &quot;boot&quot;: &quot;something extra,&quot; as in the phrase &quot;to boot.&quot; &quot;He&#39;s a great pitcher -- and a good hitter <strong>to boot</strong>.&quot; The shoe-ish meaning comes through old French from a Germanic source; the profit or use or something-extra meaning derives from an unrelated OE (Old English) word; moreover, in latter stages of its development &quot;boot&quot; has also been influenced by its phonological neighbors booty, and, I suspect, butt.&#0160;</p>
<p>In order to gain some historical perspective, let us consider the ways in which Shakespeare makes use of the word boot. &quot;To boot&quot; meaning &quot;in addition&quot; is employed frequently, as, for example, when Henry IV swears &quot;by my scepter and my soul <strong>to boo</strong>t,&quot; or when Macduff says to Malcolm that &quot;I would not be the villain that thou think&#39;st/ For the whole space that&#39;s in the tyrant&#39;s grasp/ And the rich east to <strong>boot</strong>.&quot; A less familiar use occurs in <em>The Winter&#39;s Tale</em>, when Hermione, accused of adultery, concedes that&#0160; &quot;it shall scarce <strong><span class="keyword1">boot</span></strong> me/ To say &#39;not guilty.&#39;&quot; Her &quot;boot&quot; means that it will not be to her advantage or profit to assert her innocence. This signification can shade over into gain or even into a coin itself, as for example when Camillo passes money to Autolycus, saying,&quot;hold thee, there&#39;s some <strong>boot</strong>.&quot; Contemplating his gain, Autolycus muses, &quot;What an exchange had this been without <strong><span class="keyword1">boot</span></strong>! What a&#0160;<strong><span class="keyword1">boot</span></strong> is here with this exchange.&quot; Just as boot is gain, so bootless means without gain or helpless, as when Henry V explains that he will be powerless to restrain a rampage: &quot;We may as<strong> <span class="keyword1">bootless</span></strong> spend our vain command/ Upon the enraged soldiers in their spoil.&quot;</p>
<p>Shakespeare gets some punning mileage out of the multiple meanings of &quot;boot.&quot; Glendower boasts that &quot;[T]hree times hath Henry Bolingbroke made head/ Against my power; thrice from the banks of Wye/ And sandy-bottom&#39;d Severn have I sent him/ <strong><span class="keyword1">Bootless</span> </strong>home and weather-beaten back. &quot;Bootless&quot; means helpless; but sardonic Hotspur, never noted for a sophisticated sense of humor, cannot resist the obvious pun: &quot;Home without boots. And in foul weather too.&quot;</p>
<p>So a boot can be a shoe, an advantage, an addition, a reward, a help. But look what&#39;s happened to the poor helpless word in more recent times. &quot;Boot Hill&quot; is a cowboy frontier cemetery.&#0160; Across the waters, a &quot;boot&quot; is the trunk of an automobile. The infamous &quot;Denver boot&quot; is a wheel clamp that immobilizes a vehicle. In the army, a boot is a recruit or rookie who is sent to &quot;boot camp.&quot;</p>
<p>But then, along came the computer, where one &quot;boots&quot; or restarts one&#39;s machine. This use, I&#39;m told, originated with the phrase, to &quot;pull oneself up by one&#39;s own bootstraps&quot; -- i.e. perform a difficult task at one&#39;s own initiative, just as a computer starts itself. There&#39;s also the <strong>warmboot</strong>, which sounds little too much like the old torture device, the <strong>Spanish boot</strong> and which can also be called a s<strong>oftboot </strong>(but not by me).&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>In Shakespeare&#39;s day,<strong> boot</strong> was not always distinguished from &quot;booty&quot; as in the case of the Archbishop of Canterbury&#39;s famous bees, which &quot;like soldiers, armed in their stings,/ Make <strong>boot&#0160;</strong>upon the summer&#39;s velvet buds,/ Which pillage they with merry march bring home.&quot; Booty as pillage survives to this day, but is, I think, obsolescent. Nowadays, booty is more likely to be used in the phrase &quot;booty call&quot; which means (and here I&#39;m relying on the invaluable <em>Urban Dictionary</em>) a &quot;telephone call made to request a sexual encounter.&quot; Who would ever have devised or imagined such an innovation?&#0160; Does this booty derive from &quot;shake your booty,&quot; meaning to move your butt or bottom in a sexually suggestive way?&#0160; Not a meaning known to Shakespeare, or at least, not one that the Shakespeare concordance acknowledges.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>The word &quot;nostalgia&quot; has a curious history. It was coined in the late 17th century by attaching Greek άλγος (algos - pain) to νόστος (nostos -homecoming). Originally, nostalgia carried a strongly negative signification: &quot;intense homesickness&quot; -- &quot;the depressing symptoms...&#0160; that arise in persons when they are seized with a longing to return to their home and friends.&quot; Then, for reasons that are not on the record, sometime during the first part of the last century, the meaning of nostalgia shifted and became much more positive. It&#39;s now a good word: &quot;a wistful yearning for the past.&quot; A useful word.</p>
<p>Nostalgia is a familiar phenomena that all can recognize: the savoring of a pleasant memory from earlier in our lives. It seems that nostalgia contains within it a bias toward or even a falsification of the past. It&#39;s implicit in nostalgia that things were better &quot;back then.&quot; For example: I am a member of a Facebook group called M<em>y Flatbush House from</em> <em>Years Ago. </em>Its contributors routinely idealize their childhoods. Reading their posts, you&#39;d think that the Flatbush of our youth was if not the the classical Golden Age at least the Garden of Eden. &quot;I loved my Brooklyn childhood.&quot; &quot;I wouldn’t trade my childhood for anything.&quot; &quot;I grew up in the 40s and 50s! We were so lucky to have known those days.&quot; &quot;Much simpler times, more real and human-sized.&quot; &quot;There was no fear, everybody felt safe; we played out in the streets, unsupervised, until it was suppertime.&quot; &quot;We walked to and from school in every weather.&quot; <a across="" also="" and="" anymore="" at="" breathe="" catch="" could="" cross="" days="" dir="auto" div="" do="" don="" everywhere="" fireflies="" fragrance="" get="" go="" have="" holes="" hung="" i="" in="" it="" jars="" let="" lid="" me="" miss="" nbsp="" night="" of="" on="" out="" parent-approved="" perfume="" put="" roses="" so="" stoop="" strangers="" street="" summer="" t="" the="" them="" then="" there="" they="" those="" to="" trust="" was="" we="" why="" with="" would="">&quot;Going out meant playing games in the street.&quot; &quot;</a><a across="" also="" and="" anymore="" at="" breathe="" catch="" could="" cross="" days="" dir="auto" div="" do="" don="" everywhere="" fireflies="" fragrance="" get="" go="" have="" holes="" hung="" i="" in="" it="" jars="" let="" lid="" me="" miss="" nbsp="" night="" of="" on="" out="" parent-approved="" perfume="" put="" roses="" so="" stoop="" strangers="" street="" summer="" t="" the="" them="" then="" there="" they="" those="" to="" trust="" was="" we="" why="" with="" would="">I feel so blessed to have lived such a wonderful free life.&quot; &quot;</a><a across="" also="" and="" anymore="" at="" breathe="" catch="" could="" cross="" days="" dir="auto" div="" do="" don="" everywhere="" fireflies="" fragrance="" get="" go="" have="" holes="" hung="" i="" in="" it="" jars="" let="" lid="" me="" miss="" nbsp="" night="" of="" on="" out="" parent-approved="" perfume="" put="" roses="" so="" stoop="" strangers="" street="" summer="" t="" the="" them="" then="" there="" they="" those="" to="" trust="" was="" we="" why="" with="" would="">The fragrance of roses was everywhere in July (why don&#39;t roses have perfume anymore?)&quot;</a></p>
<p>&quot;Ou sont les neiges d&#39;antan?&quot;&#0160; &quot;Those were the days, my friend,/ We thought they&#39;d never end.&quot; &quot;Rocky Top you&#39;ll always be/ Home sweet home to me.&quot;</p>
<p>Of course I also remember the good times, but I can&#39;t embrace such unalloyed, uncritical celebrations. Yes, I can savor some pleasant moments in my seventy-years-ago life. But I also recall that the 1950s was the era of &quot;juvenile delinquents&quot; and gang wars, back alley abortions, ethnic strife, &quot;broken homes,&quot; heroin, segregation, overcrowded chaotic schools, imminent nuclear holocaust and &quot;take cover&quot; drills, McCarthyism, polio, the Korean War, Stalin, and Walter O&#39;Malley.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>It&#39;s fascinating that the English language does not have a word for an antonym of nostalgia. One of my sources suggests &quot;cynicism.&quot; But I&#39;m not a cynic;&#0160; I&#39;m an intermittent and realistic anti-nostalgist.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>And why, when I lie insomniac (as is my too-frequent custom), do I not savor the odor of those ever-perfumed Coney Island Avenue hybrid tea roses but instead am tormented by nightmares of fear, humiliation, awkwardness, embarrassment and loneliness. My childhood was pretty good one, thanks to my attentive parents. So why do I obsess about the bad times? Have I gone full curmudgeon? Or am I simply more honest than my cohort of Flatbush contemporaries?</p>
<p>In <em>The Second Part of Henry the Fourth, S</em>hakespeare explores nostalgia and its opposite. Two old guys, Shallow and Silence, reminisce.&#0160;</p>
<p>SHALLOW: I was once of Clement&#39;s Inn, where I think they will talk of mad Shallow yet.</p>
<p>SILENCE: You were called &#39;lusty Shallow&quot; then, cousin...</p>
<p>SHALLOW: On that very same day did I fight with on Samson Stockfish, a fruiterer, behind Gray&#39;s Inn. Jesu, jesu, the mad days that I have spent. And to see how many of my old acquaintance are now dead.</p>
<p>SILENCE:&#0160; We shall all follow, cousin...</p>
<p>SHALLOW:&#0160; Death is certain. Is old Double of your town living yet?</p>
<p>SILENCE: Dead, sir.</p>
<p>SHALLOW: Jesu, jesu, dead. He drew a good bow; and dead. He shot a fine shot...&#0160; And is Jane Nightwork alive?...&#0160; Nay, she must be old; she cannot choose but be old; certain she&#39;s old, and had Robin Nightwork by old Nightwork before I came to Clement&#39;s Inn.</p>
<p>SILENCE:&#0160; That&#39;s fifty-five years since.</p>
<p>And then comes the correction, the anti-nostalgist.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>FALSTAFF:&#0160; Lord, lord, how subject we old men are to this vice of lying. This same starved justice hath done nothing but prate to me of the wildness of his youth, and the feats he hath done about Turnbull Street;&#0160; and every third word a lie.... He was the very genius of famine, yet lecherous as a monkey,... And now is this vice&#39;s dagger become a squire and talks as familiarly of John o&#39; Gaunt as if he had been sworn brother to him, and I&#39;ll be sworn he never saw him but once in the tilt-yard, and then he burst his head for crowding among the marshal&#39;s men.</p>
<p>And on and on, at great amusing length.</p>
<p>Shallow and Silence indulge their nostalgia;&#0160; Falstaff sees thing differently, but whether he is a realist, a cynic or a curmudgeon is open to interpretation.</p>

                                <p>I&#39;m detecting oxymorons in everything I read. Perhaps I&#39;m even imagining them.<em> Love&#39;s Labour&#39;s Lost</em> is a &quot;great feast of languages&quot; and also a savory banquet of rhetorical figures. Here are some of the oxymorons (or &quot;cross-couplers,&quot; as Puttenham called them) that I came upon in my latest re-reading of the play. Some require explanation.</p>
<p>&quot;Civil war,&quot; not &#39;civil&quot; as in the American Civil War but civil as in &quot;civility&quot; or good manners (like the &quot;merry war&quot; between Beatrice and Benedick). &quot;Trencher-knight&quot; because a trencher was generally a wooden dish, not suitable for knights -- and therefore a trencher-knight would be a low-born knight. &quot;Living art,&quot; where the art is a portrait or a statue, and therefore not living and breathing. &quot;Loose grace,&#39; where &quot;loose&quot; means worldly rather than spiritual. &quot;Profound simplicity.&quot; &quot;Evil angel.&quot; &quot;Dainty Bacchus,&quot; because Bacchus was notably disorderly. &quot;Sweet misprision,&quot; because misprision is a dereliction of duty and therefore not sweet but sour or bitter. &quot;Rational hind,&quot; whether hind refers to an animal or to a person of exceedingly small intellectual gifts. In addition, two near-oxymora: &quot;merry days of desolation,&quot; &quot;as swift as lead.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>These figures of speech are not as obvious as those in <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>, but they allow us to observe Shakespeare at work, experimenting with the ingredients of language, just as he was hitting his stride.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>The oxymoron, a figure of speech in which there is a sharp contradiction between modifier and noun, has become a boon to humorists: &quot;business ethics,&quot; &quot;military intelligence,&quot; &quot;pretty ugly,&quot; &quot;jumbo shrimp,&quot; &quot;Christian Science,&quot; &quot;Utah Jazz.&quot;&#0160; But it&#39;s a figure that has a serious side as well. The oxymoron expresses very well the contradictions inherent in literary and also human life.&#0160; Life is a mingled yarn, is it not?&#0160; Both fair and foul, sometimes in the same moment; sweet sorrow. Because Shakespeare tried to convey the complexity of things, he employed oxymorons&#0160; throughout his career -- in simple straightforward formulas at the early plays, but in his maturity in innovative and sometimes startlingly beautiful ways.</p>
<p>The oxymoron has a long pedigree. It may go as far back as to a classical trope called the <em>adynaton</em>, or collection of impossibilities. There is a treasure-trove of oxymora in Alain of Lisle&#39;s thirteenth-century poem (or, more exactly, <em>prosimetron</em>) <em>De Planctu Naturae</em> in which &quot;amor&quot; is described as &quot;<em>pax odio, fraudique fides, spes juncta timor... mistus cum ratione furor,/ Naufragium dulce, pondus leve</em> (peace in hatred, faith in fraud, hope joined to fear, madness mixed with reason, sweet shipwreck, light heaviness); there is a similar passage, from the same century, in Guillaime de Lorris extremely popular <em>Romaunt of the Rose</em> that begins &quot;Love is a hateful peace and loving hate.&quot;</p>
<p>The oxymoron was given new life and vitality by Petrarch, whose sufferings for young Laura famously caused him to freeze in summer and burn in winter. Many sonneteers, continental and English, were indebted to Petrarch, among them Thomas Watson, a poet who flourished in the years of Shakespeare&#39;s adolescence. One of Watson&#39;s poems, which contained the lines &quot;Love is a sour delight, a sugared grief/ A living death, and ever-dying life&quot; lay behind young Romeo&#39;s modish and easily parodied oxymoron-rich rhetoric: &quot;O brawling love, o loving hate,/ O heavy lightness, serious vanity,/ Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms,/ Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health.... &quot; Romeo was so besotted by his own rhetoric that Juliet couldn&#39;t resist a joke at his expense: &quot;You kiss by the book.&quot; Romeo in 1595 owes a lot to Will in 1580.</p>
<p>Shakespeare knew that Romeo indulged too much of a good thing. Half a decade later, in&#0160;<em>All&#39;s Well That Ends Well</em>, Helena imagined her perjured promiscuous lover Bertram at the French court dancing attendance on the ladies in a series of tired oxymora: &quot;his humble ambition, proud humility,/ His jarring concord, and his discord dulcet,/ His faith, his sweet disaster.&quot;&#0160; In these lines, Helana, and Shakespeare as well, repudiated fashionable oxymoronic couplings. On the other hand, it is not love but hatred and anger that give rise to Timon&#39;s oxymorons. For him, the loathed Athenians, those &quot;smiling smooth detested parasites, are &quot;courteous destroyers, affable wolves, meek bears.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>In <em>Hamlet</em>, Claudius&#39;s insincere but brilliantly accomplished oxymorons camouflage his sin. He has</p>
<p>&#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160;as &#39;twere with a defeated joy,<br />With an auspicious, and a dropping eye,<br />With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,<br />In equal scale weighing&#0160;<span class="keyword1">delight</span> and dole</p>
<p>taken Gertrude as his wife. The pairing of &quot;auspicious&quot; (the root meaning of which is looking to the heavens to prognosticate by the flight of birds) with &quot;dropping&quot; is especially wonderful.</p>
<p>Claudius&#39;s &quot;delight and dole&quot; were anticipated by Richard II&#39;s rhetorical theatricality upon his return to England:</p>
<p>As a long-parted mother with her child<br />Plays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting,<br />So, weeping,&#0160;<span class="keyword1">smiling</span>, greet I thee, my earth.</p>
<p>And there&#39;s the &quot;wholesome iniquity&quot; of the bawdy house in <em>Pericles --&#0160;</em>a play in which calm comes in the form of &quot;litigious peace.&quot;</p>
<p>In <em>King Lear,&#0160;</em>a play about, among other subjects&#0160; a &quot;precious unprized&quot; daughter, there is a submerged but stunning oxymoron when (in Edgar&#39;s words) Gloucester is at last released from his suffering: &quot;his flaw&#39;d heart.../ &#39;Twixt two extremes of passion, joy and grief,/ Burst smilingly.&quot; &quot;Burst smilingly&quot; is a phrase which the younger Shakespeare could not reach; nor could any other poet before or since.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>&quot;Bisson conspectuities&quot; is one of my all-time favorite Shakespearean oxymorons. Although it&#39;s not as transparent as, say, &quot;hot ice&quot; or &quot;living death,&quot; it&#39;s much more quirky and colorful. &quot;Bisson conspectuities&quot; appears in <em>Coriolanus </em>in one of the scenes in which Menenius banters with the Roman crowd. They attack and he parries by enumerating his own strengths and weaknesses. He concludes with an insult that flaunts his patrician education: &quot;What harm can your bisson conspectuities glean out of this character?&quot; (In this case, a &quot;character&quot; is a summary statement of a person&#39;s habits or nature, a &quot;characterization&quot;.)</p>
<p>The odd word &quot;conspectuities&quot; is an invention of Shakespeare&#39;s. He derived it from the participial form of the Latin verb &quot;<em>conspicio</em>&quot; -- to observe, gaze, or watch. It&#39;s a nonce word, a <em>hapax legomenon</em>; unlike some of Shakespeare&#39;s more inspired coinages, conspectuities never domesticated into English -- the OED lists only this sole appearance. &quot;Bisson,&quot; on the other hand, which means &quot;blind,&quot; was not new to the language but was in fact an ancient word of Germanic origin -- and already obsolescent in 1608, although the venerable proverb &quot;the bysom ledys the blynde&quot; might still have been current in the provinces. In <em>Hamlet,</em> the deliberately archaizing First Player uses the expression &quot;bisson rheum&quot; for &quot;blinding tears.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;Bisson conspectuities&quot; means &quot;blind sight&quot; or &quot;blear vision.&quot; It&#39;s an especially striking oxymoron because its component parts are drawn from opposite ends of the word hoard -- old and new, plain and polysyllabic, Germanic and Latin, rustic and citified.</p>
<p>But there&#39;s a complication. The word &quot;bisson&quot; doesn&#39;t actually appear in the Folio; there it is &quot;beesome.&quot; &quot;Beesome, usually spelled besom, meant and still means, &quot;broom.&quot; But in the context of <em>Coriolanu</em>s, broom is meaningless; and so, beginning&#0160; with Lewis Theobald in the 1720s, editors have uniformly substituted &quot;bisson&quot; -- an inspired conjecture but still a guess. It&#39;s possible that Shakespeare wrote &quot;bisson&quot; and a scrivener or printer incorrectly read &#39;beesome&quot; -- but perhaps not. An oxymoron of transcendent genius might be merely an illusion -- a creation not of Shakespeare but of editorial tradition.</p>
<p>&quot;Bisson conspectuities&quot; puts quite a burden on members of the Blackfriar&#39;s audience. It&#39;s hard to believe that Shakespeare thought his first hearers would grasp the phrase&#39;s meaning on the fly. It&#39;s easy for us to understand it now, four hundred years later, with a treasury of annotations at the foot of every page. Perhaps Shakespeare didn&#39;t care if the audience comprehended? Is it possible that he was writing just for his own delight, for his pleasure in words? For readers rather than playgoers? Or perhaps he had already divined that he was writing for enthusiasts and scholars of a latter age.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <div>Sir Smile is a &quot;character,&quot; in a way of speaking, in Shakespeare&#39;s <em>The Winter&#39;s Tale. </em>He&#39;s one the play&#39;s most fully-realized figures, even though he says no words, doesn&#39;t appear on stage, and exists nowhere but in King Leontes&#39; diseased, paranoid fantasy life-- and then only for an evanescent second. Truth to tell, Sir Smile also appears to be an emanation from a dark corner of Shakespeare&#39;s own individual imagination.&#0160;</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>When does Sir Smile make his momentary appearance?&#0160; Leontes has gone off the deep end. Without the least shred of evidence, he generates the extremely destructive fantasy that his wife Hermione has been a-bed with his best friend and fellow king, Polixenes. He&#39;s in a rage, so much so that in the course of a stunning soliloquy, he busts right through the inviolable fourth wall and addresses himself directly to the men in the audience. He looks them right in the eye. &quot;There have been,&quot; he laments, &quot;cuckolds ere now&quot;</div>
<div><br />And many a man there is, even at this present,<br />Now while I speak this, holds his wife by the arm,<br />That little thinks she has been sluiced in&#39;s absence<br />And his pond fish&#39;d by his next neighbor, by<br />Sir Smile, his neighbor.</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>Leontes&#39; soliloquy is &quot;to the moment.&quot; &quot;This is not make-believe. Look to your left and right, guys -- while you&#39;re clutching your wife&#39;s elbow, enjoying the play, that sly impudent fellow standing there, Sir Smile, has been fishing in your pond, ploughing your field, sleeping in your bed. It happens to everyone. Men -- we&#39;re all victims, all of us. We&#39;re drowning in sea of betrayal. You can&#39;t trust your neighbor, you can&#39;t trust anyone. And worse -- the seducers, the enemy, don&#39;t just diddle your wife; they triumph, they grin, they fleer. They amuse themselves at your suffering. Every one of them, sitting or standing in this theatre, is now or will be a such a person.&quot;</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>Sir Smile embodies Leontes&#39; deepest fears. He distills humiliation and jealousy into a figure who is half nightmare and half allegory. In psychological terms, he&#39;s Leontes&#39; doppelganger or double.</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>But why does Shakespeare call him Sir Smile? Why not Lord Lewd or Viscount Vice?</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>The honorific, the &quot;Sir&quot; part, is easy. Shakespeare regularly employs the word almost as a nickname. Sometimes his &quot;sir&quot; can sometimes be affectionate -- Leontes himself calls his son Mamillius,&quot;sir page.&quot; Similarly, Lucius is &quot;sir boy&quot; to Titus. There&#39;s even a &quot;Sir King&quot; in <em>Cymbeline.</em> &quot;Sir&quot; can also be hostile: &quot;sir knave.&quot; And sometime it&#39;s neutral; timid Viola would rather &quot;go with sir priest than sir knight.&quot;&#0160; Sir-ness becomes more meaningful when its use is exemplary or abstract: &quot;Sir Valor&quot; in <em>Troilus and Cressida; &quot;</em>Sir Prudence&quot; in <em>The Tempest; &quot;</em>Sir Oracle&quot; in <em>The Merchant of Venice.</em> The Sir in Sir Smile has an instructive history.</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>But why is he a smiler?&#0160; Why does Shakespeare offer us a profligate or a roue who smiles as he goes about his amorous business?&#0160; To followers of Shakespeare, there&#39;s a ready answer. It&#39;s well known that false and hypocritical smiles transfix the Shakespearean imagination. The locus for this is <em>Hamlet, </em>where&#0160;Denmark&#39;s prince is beside himself, furious at what he has seen in the face of Claudius, who is a</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>&#0160; &#0160; villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!<br />My tables! Meet it is I set it down<br />That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain.</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>Smiling and villainy merge inextricably. Exactly as in the case of Leontes&#39; imaginary neighbor, there&#39;s evil lurking beneath Claudius&#39; smiley face. When Hamlet writes in his &quot;table&quot; -- we would say &quot;tablet&quot; --that &quot;one may smile and be a villain,&quot; his characterization has the force of revelation or of a proverb or gnomic utterance.</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>But it&#39;s not only Claudius. The smile in &quot;Sir Smile&quot; emerges from a Shakespearean underworld. There&#39;s Richard of Gloucester, an unequalled villain, who can not only &quot;cry &#39;Content&#39; to that which grieves my heart,/ And wet my cheeks with artificial tears,/ And frame my face to all occasions&quot; but who can also, most pertinently, &quot;smile, and murder whiles I smile.&quot; And then there are the &quot;smiling smooth, detested parasites&quot; of <em>Timon of Athens</em>; the &quot;villain with a smiling cheek&quot; and the &quot;smiling rogues&quot; of <em>The Merchant of Venice; &quot;</em>the smiling pick-thanks&quot; --sycophants or flatterers -- of <em>The Second Part of King Henry the Fourth</em> as well as the assassins whom Calpurnia dreams &quot;came smiling&quot; to bathe their hands in Caesar&#39;s blood. Shakespeare&#39;s smiles are often linked to danger: Iago of Cassio; &quot;Ay, smile upon her, do.&quot; Kent, in K<em>ing Le</em>ar is enraged by condescending smiling Oswald: &quot;A plague upon your epileptic visage! Smoile you my speeches, an I were a fool?&quot;</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>Hence loathsome &quot;Sir Smile.&quot;&#0160;</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>Fortunately, even for Shakespeare there are redeeming moments when when a smile is still a smile. Touchstone (in <em>As You Like It</em>) is in love. He remembers kissing his beloved&#39;s batler, &quot;and the cow&#39;s dugs that her pretty chapt hands had milk&#39;d; and remember[s}&#0160; the wooing of a peascod instead of her; from whom I took two cods, and giving her them again, said with weeping tears &#39;Wear these for my sake.&#39;&quot; The name of Touchstone&#39;s lovely rural mistress is &quot;Jane Smile.&quot; No &quot;sirs&quot; in this Smile family, no sirree!</div>

		<a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2020/05/petruchio-and-othello-1.html">Petruchio and Othello?</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>It&#39;s an unlikely pairing -- what possible connection could there be between Petruchio, a creature of farce, and Othello, distinguished general and tragic victim of the green monster. Yet there is a surprising point of contact -- two similar (but very different) reminiscences. It&#39;s not usual for Shakespeare&#39;s characters to have a &quot;backstory,&quot; but both P and O attempt one.</p>
<p>Petruchio brags that a shrew can&#39;t scare him, because he&#39;s been there before. &quot;Think you a little din can daunt mine ears?&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>He riffs on the word &quot;din.&quot; He&#39;s inured to noise, he claims -- and how he came to be so adds a new and improbable dimension to his character.</p>
<p>Have I not in my time heard lions roar?<br />Have I not heard the sea puff&#39;d up with winds<br />Rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat?<br />Have I not heard great ordnance in the field,<br />And heaven&#39;s artillery thunder in the skies?<br />Have I not in a pitched battle heard<br />Loud &#39;larums, neighing steeds, and trumpets&#39; clang?</p>
<p>I, for one, don&#39;t believe a word that Petruchio utters and I doubt whether Shakespeare expects us to do so. It&#39;s all bluster, the words of an accomplished bullshitter. Petruchio is a youthful fortune-hunter, full of bravado and effrontery to be sure, but except in this passage, he lacks an adventurous past or a military history. When did he hear lions roar?&#0160; While on a Roads Scholar tour of Scythia or central Africa? And where was the sea like an &quot;angry boar?&quot; Where was the &quot;great ordnance&quot; and &quot;loud alarum?&quot; More likely at Saturday afternoon serials than in the tented field.&#0160;</p>
<p>Othello&#39;s story, on the other hand, though more extravagant and fantastic, is grandly persuasive. Here&#39;s a piece of it:&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160; &#0160; &#0160; I spake of most disastrous chances,<br />Of moving accidents by flood and field<br />Of hair-breadth scapes i&#39; the&#0160;<span class="keyword1">imminent</span>&#0160;deadly breach,<br />Of being taken by the insolent foe<br />And sold to slavery, of my redemption thence<br />And portance in my travels&#39; history:<br />Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle,<br />Rough quarries, rocks and hills whose heads touch heaven<br />It was my hint to speak,—such was the process;<br />And of the Cannibals that each other eat,<br />The Anthropophagi and men whose heads<br />Do grow beneath their shoulders.</p>
<p>Othello veers into the mythological yet his story comports with what we otherwise know of him.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Petruchio&#39;s tale is an instance of &quot;just-in-time&quot; characterization. Shakespeare needs to display Petruchio&#39;s bravery in the face of a scolding woman -- so he produces a soldiership story. It doesn&#39;t accord with Petruchio&#39;s history, but it doesn&#39;t need to, because it serves an immediate necessary dramatic function. Othello&#39;s speech is part and parcel; Petruchio&#39;s is a loose end.</p>
<p>And the language! The first passage, in early T<em>he Taming of the Shrew</em>, is perfunctory; the second, in the mature tragedy, is simply magnificent. Anyone looking for evidence of Shakespeare&#39;s progress of a poet could do worse than compare these two passages.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>There are so many overlaps between <em>Richard III</em> (1593) and <em>Macbeth</em> (1606) that it sometimes seems as though Shakespeare pillaged and reformed the earlier play when he composed the later. Both plays feature cynical upward strivers (&quot;hellhounds,&quot; the playwright calls them both) who risk damnation to murder their way to the throne, and then lose their kingdoms in battle and are succeeded by spotless young heirs. Both Richard of Gloucester and Macbeth kill innocent children and both are haunted by the ghosts of those they have murdered.</p>
<p>Yet the two plays are very different. <em>Macbeth</em> is a tidy economical play (Shakespeare&#39;s second shortest), while R<em>ichard III</em> (his second longest) is sprawling and repetitious, sometimes even bewildering, stuffed to the gills with incident and declamation. Moreover, <em>Richard III</em> lacks witches, moving forests, young Malcolm, Macduff&#39;s mysterious birth, and above all, ambitious Lady Macbeth. While Richard is famously amusing, Macbeth hasn&#39;t the slightest sense of humor even though he can be unconsciously ironic.&#0160;</p>
<p>When similar circumstances arise, as they must, it becomes obvious that the rhetorical strategies of<em> Richard III</em> are rudimentary compared to the richer and more satisfying language of <em>Macbeth.</em></p>
<p>Here is one passage in the earlier play that has an echo or correspondence in the later. Richard instructs a follower to slander King Edward (&quot;luxury&quot; means &quot;lust&quot;)&quot;</p>
<p>&#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; urge his (i.e. Edward&#39;s) hateful luxury,<br />And bestial appetite in change of lust;<br />Which stretch&#39;d unto their servants, daughters, wives,<br />Even where his raging eye or savage heart,<br />Without control, listed to make a prey.</p>
<p>In <em>Macbeth</em>, Malcolm slanders himself.</p>
<p>&#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160;There&#39;s no bottom, none,<br />In my voluptuousness. Your wives, your daughters,<br />Your matrons and your maids, could not fill up<br />The cistern of my lust, and my desire<br />All continent impediments would o&#39;erbear<br />That did oppose my will.</p>
<p>Unbounded lust is the subject of both speeches - &quot;servants, daughters, wives,&quot; expands into the even more inclusive wives, daughters, matrons, and maids. Richard&#39;s statement is strong, its power strengthened by the litany of allusions to the uncivil wild: &quot;bestial,&quot; &quot;raging,&quot; &quot;savage,&quot; &quot;prey.&quot; Macbeth&#39;s is considerably more powerful, primarily because of the extended metaphor in which lust is conceived as some sort of fluid. Many an acre foot of lust could be contained in a &quot;cistern&quot; without a &quot;bottom.&quot;&#0160; Yet in fact a bottomless cistern would impound only a portion of Malcolm&#39;s sexual gusher which, it seems, is many times more abundant than a single cisternfull; it&#39;s a deluge that &quot;continent impediments&quot; such as embankments or dikes or dams cannot restrain. It&#39;s a tsunami.</p>
<p>A second correspondence occurs when Richard engages in a moment of self-evaluation. &quot;But I am in/ So far in blood that sin will pluck on sin;/ Tear-falling pity dwells not in this eye.&quot; Macbeth&#39;s improvement: &quot;I am in blood/ Stepped in so far, that should I wade no more/ Returning were as tedious as go o&#39;er.&quot; Blood in both, to be sure, but there are improvements. In the earlier passage, the key terms are sin and pity, abstractions which are rooted in the antecedent allegorical drama. &quot;Sin&quot; becomes a personage: &quot;sin will pluck on sin.&quot; And pity or perhaps Pity, is also vivified through the use of the modifier &quot;tear-falling.&quot; But these harkings back to allegory hint at the less abstract and more imaginative figure adumbrated in the phrase &quot;so far in blood.&quot; It would be more ordinary and idiomatic to say not &quot;stepped in so far&quot; but &quot;stepped in so <em>deep</em>.&quot; Unless, of course, the playwright had an idea lurking in the recesses of his brain which he didn&#39;t quite articulate. Ten years later, Richard&#39;s puddle became Macbeth&#39;s river or lake or even ocean, deep enough that it required the usurper king to &quot;wade&quot; in it. Shakespeare pursues the metaphor to its completion: &quot;should I wade no more/ Returning were as tedious as go o&#39;er&quot; -- a figure which makes it clear that Macbeth is overshoes, knee deep -- or even hip deep --&#0160; in a nightmare swamp of his own making, There&#39;s no side channel, no bridge, no way out.</p>
<p>So apprentice &quot;sin&quot; and &quot;pity&quot; are superseded by masterly &quot;cistern&quot; and &quot;blood&quot; and &quot;wade.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>It&#39;s not by accident that <em>Macbeth</em> is so deeply unsettling.</p>
                        </div>

                                <p>In <em>Cymbeline</em> (1611?), Shakespeare, still innovating even at the end of his career, deepens the character of Innogen by supplying her with an unusual psychological trait. He presents her to us as an escapist or fantasist who leaps to imagine herself a different person in a different world. Here&#39;s Innogen early in the play, when she realizes that her cross-class marriage to Postumus (she&#39;s a princess, he&#39;s a poor but worthy gentleman) is at risk: &quot;Would I were/ A neatherd&#39;s daughter, and my Leonatus/ Our neighbor shepherd&#39;s son.&quot; She fantasizes herself surrendering her nobility to become a peasant. A few moments later, she learns that her lover Leonatus and his rival the clotpoll Cloten have been in a sword fight and that Cloten has retreated. Innogen&#39;s reaction: &quot;I would they were in Afric both together/ Myself by with a needle, that I might prick/ The goer-back&quot;. Why Africa? Because, among other reasons, it is far from the British court where Innogen&#39;s activities are heavily restricted. So in two short speeches Innogen has expressed willingness to being transformed in both class and geography. Shortly afterward, Innogen describes (in another &quot;would that&quot; imagining) how she would have stared at the retreating ship which takes Postumus into exile: &quot;I would have broke mine eye-strings, cracked them,/ To look upon him till the dimunition/ Of space had pointed him sharp as my needle.&quot; Indifferent to physical pain, she now imagines herself transcending not only class and space, but also the limitations of her own body.</p>
<p>It was no accident that Shakespeare gave Innogen such freedom to re-invent herself, because in the scenes that follow, she will undergo a series of radical transformations -- from princess to a &quot;franklin&#39;s wife,&quot; into a boy cooking fancy food for three cave-dwelling mountain-men, and then a dutiful page to the general of the invading Roman army, all the while avoiding betrayal, attempted rape and apparent poisoning. It&#39;s a lot for Innogen to deal with, but Shakespeare knew exactly what he was doing when he started her off with an imagination equal to the task.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>This entry is written at the specific instruction of my daughter, who says, &quot;your grandchildren will want to know about your birth. It&#39;s their history too.&quot; The following paragraphs are for them and for their descendants.</p>
<p>My older sister, Susan, died of pneumonia at the age of nine months on March 15, 1938. If she had lived, I wouldn&#39;t exist, nor would my ten descendants, and no one would notice.</p>
<p>I was born on March 11, 1939, just one year minus four days after Susan died. It seems obvious that I was purposely conceived as a substitute for the dead child -- and it therefore follows that I was delivered into a disrupted, stressed family. Was I to be treasured as a compensation for past grief or to be resented as an imperfect interloper? Or both, simultaneously? To raise the ante, it is also a fact that during that fatal March of 1938 when Susan lay dying, my older brother Eugene, then just shy of three years of age, was gravely ill of the same disease that killed his younger sister, and that although he was at death&#39;s door, he managed to pull through.</p>
<p>So let us consider the situation of my parents, Manny and Lil, in June of 1938, the month of my conception. Poor Susan lay a-mouldering in her tiny grave for just three months. The Great Depression was still going strong and Hitler&#39;s Nuremberg Laws had been in force since 1935. Father Coughlin, celebrity Jew-hater, was agitating thirty million American radio listeners a week. Kristallnacht was just five months away and most everyone knew that war was imminent. Residing on East 9th Street in Flatbush were my grief-stricken young parents, who had helplessly watched one child die and had come within a hairbreadth of losing another. We must imagine them reeling, tearful, clinging to one another, dealing as best they might with heartbreaking anxiety and pain. Yet despite public and personal disasters, they made the courageous choice to throw the dice again, and out of their anguish to bring forth another child -- and to run the real risk, in those pre-antibiotic days, of offering still another sacrifice to pneumonia or some other dread incurable illness.</p>
<p>If my parents were still alive, I&#39;d congratulate them, celebrate them, not because their resilience produced me, but because to beget a substitute child in chaotic, dangerous 1938 seems to me, now, looking back from the perspective of 2020, to be an act of unfathomable courage.</p>
<p>Or so I would like to think. It&#39;s also possible that I&#39;m here not because of their heroism but because of a failure of contraception. I&#39;ll never know. I didn&#39;t ask; they never said, and the facts are unrecoverable. Lil and Manny wouldn&#39;t dream of speaking aloud about anything so intimate as sex or reproduction, certainly not with their children and, who knows, perhaps not even with one another. In that regard, they were typical of their generation. Personal matters were kept close to the vest.&#0160;</p>
<p>When Lil was five months pregnant, Hitler annexed the Sudetenland. Exactly three weeks before I landed on this planet, 20,000 Nazi supporters rallied, complete with Fascist salutes, at the old Madison Square Garden on 49th Street. Four days after I arrived, on the anniversary --the yahrzeit -- of the death of little Susan, while my mother was regaining her strength in Manhattan&#39;s Park East hospital on East 83rd Street, German tanks rolled into Czechoslovakia. For Lil, for Manny, personal and public crises intersected. Nazis foreign and domestic were at the gates, and inside the hospital, my mother was still mourning the loss of the little girl whom my Uncle Dan, my mother&#39;s brother, remembered as an &quot;exceptionally beautiful child.&quot; And lying beside Lil in her bed was the newborn, who was welcomed with joy, I&#39;m sure, but with ambivalence also. Not an eternally glowing-in-memory girl child but me --an undistinguished chap, to put it in the most favorable light. Not &quot;trailing clouds of glory&quot; but instead enveloped in a fog of danger and possibly regret.</p>
<p>My parents, as I have said, kept their emotions tightly buttoned, so while Susan was not mourned or even mentioned within the family, she was never forgotten. In fact, throughout my childhood she remained a mysterious ghostly presence. In my parents&#39; bedroom was a simple display -- a child-size wood-and-wicker chair and above it, on the wall, a gold-framed picture of a very pretty infant. The shrine fascinated me, and I would sneak into my parent&#39;s bedroom to study it. Sneak? Yes, because their bedroom was a consecrated place not to be defiled by Eugene or Jonathan or me. Off limits. It was the sin of all childhood sins to violate the taboo and cross into the forbidden zone. My mother made an unholy fuss about this rule. &quot;You are not to go into our bedroom. Ever.&quot; Which I did, regularly, when no one was looking --- but it felt like a midnight intrusion into a deep dark country graveyard. Very creepy. Who is that infant in the picture? And why is she not allowed to rest in peace? I knew better than to ask.</p>
<p>I never thought, then, to wonder how Manny and Lil, contemplating the gilded idol morn and eve, could fail to compare their frozen-in-time lost infant to her scruffy successor? Of course I was aware that my &quot;difficult&quot; mother was a deeply troubled woman. But never, trust me, did I have the least glimmer that the shade of the dead infant haunted our family -- and myself in particular. No child, certainly not me, would have been so insightful. It&#39;s transparent now, but it was anything but obvious then. Nor could anyone possibly have predicted that there was to be an area of study within the discipline of psychology called &quot;The Replacement Child Syndrome&quot; (RCS). And that I was unequivocally a textbook case of such.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>RCS lay dormant. Forty years later, and forty years ago, when I was in midlife, not having thought for decades about my dead sister or her shrine or my long-departed parents, I experienced something of a revelation. It came about indirectly, but dramatically.</p>
<p>I was teaching classes on Shakespeare&#39;s plays. and I found myself paying much more heed to <em>Romeo and Julie</em>t than that immature early tragedy warrants. I was especially intrigued by Shakespeare&#39;s invention of the character of young Juliet -- which is far more subtle than is necessary for the plot. With Juliet, Shakespeare attempted something utterly unprecedented in any previous work of literature. He cleverly situated his young heroine in a complicated family in which Juliet had, in effect, two mothers -- a birth mother, <em>Capulet wife</em>, who is cold, distant and aloof, and a metaphorical and therefore real mother, Nurse Angelica, who is undisciplined but sensual and sexual. The two mothers, carefully differentiated, precipitate or echo or explain the conflict within Juliet between propriety and passion. One mother embraces and promulgates Verona&#39;s rigid mores, while the other is impulsive, emotional, and anarchic. In addition -- and now it all was starting to become extremely personal for me -- Shakespeare provided Juliet with a backstory (unusual because his characters rarely have prior histories). It comes to light that the Nurse&#39;s own natural daughter had died in infancy, that the bereaved mother was engaged to suckle Juliet -- and that Angelica has been Juliet&#39;s surrogate mother and companion for almost fourteen years. So Juliet is, for the Nurse, clearly and obviously a replacement child. How curiously relevant! How provocative!</p>
<p>I then remembered that William Shakespeare himself was such a child. According to the Trinity Church records, John and Mary Shakespeare had suffered two tragedies before April 23, 1564 when William was born. Their first child, a daughter named Joan, had been baptized four years earlier, in 1560, but lived only for two months. A second daughter, Margaret, was baptized in 1562 and lived for just under one year. A full year! and then the grave! How horrible for all concerned! Young Will therefore entered the world as the boy child who replaced not one but two older sisters. Even in an age of staggering infant mortality, two such premature deaths must surely have weighed on both John and Mary and on William himself. Is it an accident that Juliet is the only certified replacement child in early modern English literature (at least, the only one that I can recall at this moment)?</p>
<p>Mulling these matters, I soon discovered that I had failed to register some additional facts about the Capulet family that by rights ought to have set my heart all aflutter. Listen to the Nurse nattering on about her surrogate daughter Juliet.</p>
<p><em>Even or odd, of all days in the year,</em></p>
<p><em>Come Lamass Eve at night shall she be fourteen,.</em></p>
<p><em>Susan and she -- God rest all Christian souls--</em></p>
<p><em>Were of an age.&#0160; Well, Susan is with God.</em></p>
<p><em>She was too good for me.</em></p>
<p>How could I have missed it?&#0160; Right at the heart of the Capulet family dynamics, and therefore at the heart of the play, is not just a dead infant and a dead daughter, but a dead Susan.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>I have to say that this discovery put my brain into quite an epiphanic tizzy. How could I not have recognized the parallels between the Capulet family and my own?&#0160; And also, given my near-compulsive interest in the bonds and affiliations among <em>Capulet wife</em> and Nurse Angelica and Juliet -- how could my conscious mind have ignored information that had so vexed my unconscious?&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Alerted by this 1595 play to my own personal being, I set out to learn about the Replacement Child Syndrome (RCS) in what is charitably called the &quot;literature&quot; of psychoanalysis. While almost everything I read was either obtuse or so encrusted with obscurantist jargon as to be indecipherable, it was not hard to distill the gist. According to the experts, a replacement is always vulnerable and at hazard, especially so if the deceased infant has not been properly mourned, or-- as they say -- if there has not been &quot;closure.&quot; Such a lad or lass goes through childhood constantly judged to be inferior to the idealized dead child. At worst, the love that is owed to the living child may be withdrawn and the replacement resented --&#0160; less loved, or even unloved; tolerated but undervalued.</p>
<p>Had she lived, the dead girl, let us call her Susan, of infinite and golden potential, would certainly have grown up to be an exceedingly dutiful daughter as well as a concert cellist and a world-class figure-skater who when just two years out of Yale would have created a state-of-the-art gynecological clinic in an underserved village in Moldova. The other, the replacement -- me -- bawls and pukes, bites a neighbor child on the cheek, throws a colossal shitfit over a missing puzzle piece, shatters an heirloom lamp, steals comic books from the local candy store, wastes weeks moping in his bedroom, totals the DeSoto, and fails trigonometry. No wonder he&#39;s a disappointment.</p>
<p>Well, maybe I&#39;m laying it on with a trowel, but that&#39;s the general idea.&#0160;</p>
<p>Now (this is still forty years ago) reconstituted as a Syndrome, I entered into my &quot;poor poor pitiful me&quot; period. I wasted kilowatts of energy and eons of precious time conceptualizing myself as a case of &quot;wrongful birth.&quot; I shifted the blame for all my emotional foibles onto my parents, especially, to be honest, onto my mother. Right at her doorstep I laid low self-esteem, intermittent depression, fear of success, disabling shyness and even (this was a bit of stretch) procrastination. But it didn&#39;t wash and it didn&#39;t last. I&#39;m ashamed and embarrassed that I allowed myself to attribute my personal problems to my willing but helpless mother. Not that there wasn&#39;t a smidgeon of truth to the RCS analysis. Freud says that &quot;a man who has won the love of his mother is always a hero in his own eyes&quot;; well, that kind of heroism wasn&#39;t going to be my lot. Of course I would have preferred to have enjoyed intimacy with a smiling supportive mother. Not what happened. But it was selfish and wrong of me to dwell on slights which were trivial compared to the traumas undergone by my parents.They, not me, were and are the heroes of this story.</p>
<p>The bedrock is that the RCS, though real, was only of middling significance to me. It was devastating for Juliet, because it led directly to her suicide, and it may have served as a spur to Shakespeare, who became Shakespeare and, incidentally, fathered a daughter named Susannah. For me -- well, it was it only important for the moment. I was a wounded child -- no, not wounded, scratched --but not a disabled one. I was healthy enough to pursue if not a distinguished, certainly a respectable career, to become a reliable father, to meet my obligations to my extended family and community and to form a long-lasting marriage -- and when that first marriage was cut short by disease and death, to achieve in old age a second mature and satisfying relationship. My parents must have done a great deal right, for I became what my father used to praise, without a shred of irony, as a &quot;proper, tax-paying citizen.&quot; At this point in my octogenarian life, there&#39;s no room for that old self-pitying me; instead, there&#39;s great admiration and regard for both Lil and Manny, who endured. And who, in the successes of their grandchildren and great-grandchildren, continue to thrive and prosper.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>An addendum: in the psychological &quot;literature&quot;, I found no mention, neither jot nor tittle, of the family configuration in which a male child replaces a female. No doubt such situations have by now been thoroughly researched by trained analysts, but not back then, when such a discussion might have been useful to me. The case of Juliet, where one girl replaces another, has been explored, but not Shakespeare&#39;s situation, or mine. I wonder sometimes whether the case of a boy succeeding a girl might lead to gender confusion, or as they now say, &quot;fluidity&quot; (if, for example, the parents unconsciously favor female traits in their son). I don&#39;t mean sexual practice, because I myself have never been (or wanted to be) anything other than a vanilla heterosexual. But I&#39;m not even slightly macho; I am strongly domestic, comfortable with roles that have been traditionally reserved for women. I&#39;m a gatherer, not a hunter; not the kind of person who goes to the fights with the guys or plays rugby and eventually, shunning the entrapment of wife or family, rides off on his horse into the sunset. I am much more likely to clean the bathroom, weed the garden, make some bad rhymes, play casino with the grandkids, and whip up a beef stew for dinner.&#0160;</p>
<p>Another addendum: I always wondered why Lil and Manny decided to give me an awkward obscure Biblical name. They had no interest in anything remotely smacking of religion. So why choose the name of one of Job&#39;s false comforters?&#0160; What were they thinking?&#0160; During my pitiful period, I imagined that they chose the name because they were disappointed with me. We can&#39;t name him Susan, said their joint unconscious, so let&#39;s give him an ugly name the diminutive of which is female. That was my theory, but now I have another idea. Perhaps, in March of 1939, to resurrect an obscure biblical name was to give the middle finger to Hitler. If so, it was an act of defiance. I hope I&#39;m right.</p>
<p>And finally: my younger brother Jonathan, who was as equally improbable a replacement as I, was born in July of 1942, seven month after the Day of Infamy. He too entered in troubling times. Jon was an extremely handsome youth, regularly gushed over by friends and family -- and slightly envied by me. One of his shaping childhood experiences is of my mother holding his head in her hands and saying, &quot;You would have made a very beautiful girl.&quot;</p>
<p>Jon too is a gatherer rather than a hunter, and when I&#39;m in the kitchen slicing the potatoes and carrots for a big pot of beef stew, it&#39;s his excellent recipe that I follow.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Let me guess that a modern reader coming upon Shakespeare&#39;s euphonious phrase &quot;vaulting variable ramps&quot; would be baffled as to its sense. Just WS being willfully obscure, one might complain. But it&#39;s not so; it&#39;s just that the language keeps on changing, making things difficult for audiences and readers.</p>
<p>The most obvious meaning &#0160;of &quot;vaulting various ramps&quot; -- hurdling a miscellaneous series of inclined planes, as in a steeplechase -- won&#39;t fly. &quot;Ramps&quot; takes us down a wrong path, because its modern meaning (a wood or concrete construction leading from one level to another) was unknown in 1611. It didn&#39;t enter the English language until 1778 -- as a borrowing from French <em>rampe</em>. (The entrance to a highway, as in &quot;take the ramp on the right&quot; is an Americanism dating only to the 1950s.)</p>
<p>A &quot;ramp&quot; is also a vegetable. It&#39;s an uncultivated, wild member of the onion family lately celebrated by fad foodies (or food faddies) as a great delicacy. But why Shakespeare would want someone to hurdle an individual ramp or even a field of ramps is less than obvious. Another false start.</p>
<p>Let us therefore examine the context of the phrase &quot;vaulting variable ramps.&quot;</p>
<p>It occurs in <em>Cymbeline, </em>the most magical of Shakespeare&#39;s last plays. Nasty Iachimo (&quot;little Iago&quot;) tries to persuade Innogen that her virtuous husband Postumus has been unfaithful -- that he has, in another splendid Shakespearean phrase, &quot;partner&#39;d with tomboys.&quot; The situation excites Shakespeare&#39;s exuberant pen. Iachimo embroiders &quot;tomboys&quot; and claims that Postumus has consorted with &quot;with diseased ventures/ That play with all infirmities for gold/ Which rottenness can lend nature; such boil&#39;d stuff/ As well might poison poison.&quot; Should she, that is, Innogen (and here Iachimo&#39;s rhetoric soars)</p>
<p>&#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160;Live, like Diana&#39;s priest, betwixt cold sheets,</p>
<p>&#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160;While he [Postumus] is vaulting variable ramps,</p>
<p>&#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160;In your despite. &#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;Ramps,&quot; therefore, are the opposite of Diana&#39;s priestesses, who live chastely; they are in fact loose women. Ramps who are neither architectural nor vegetable, but sexual and promiscuous. At least, they are so in this instance, because otherwise &quot;ramp&quot; carried a meaning closer to &quot;virago&quot; -- in 1611 an overbearing woman but not necessarily an unchaste one. The word &quot;ramp&quot; in this signification has disappeared but has bequeathed us &quot;rapscallion&quot; (which was earlier spelled both &quot;ramscallion&quot; or &quot;rampscallion.&quot;) There is no evidence to support the easy inference that rapscallion combines &quot;ramp&quot; and &quot;scallion.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Vaulting variable ramps&quot; means &quot;to engage in a series of athletic sexual encounters.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>To vault into a lover&#39;s bed might seem to border on the comic but I don&#39;t think that it does so in this case. Shakespeare elsewhere seems to imagine intercourse as a vigorous event. A brothel is in his language a &quot;leaping house.&quot; And surely it&#39;s not comic when Juliet hopes that Romeo will &quot;leap to [her] arms.&quot;</p>
<p>The conception behind &quot;vault&quot; and &quot;leap&quot; reappears in the contemporary demotic phrase &quot;jump his/her bones.&quot;</p>
<p>Ramps:</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>First of all, let us dismiss the notion that Charles Dickens invented a pair of persnickety punctilious accountants and named them Jot and Tittle. Sorry, it could or should have been the case, but it&#39;s not so.&#0160;Nevertheless, both &quot;jot&quot; and &quot;tittle,&quot; often found in each other&#39;s cozy company, have stories to tell.</p>
<p>Take jot, for example. In the&#0160;masterful &quot;seduction scene&quot; in Shakespeare&#39;s <em>Othello</em>, Iago first torments the Venetian general and then pretends sympathy: &quot;I see this (i.e. his nasty sly hints that Desdemona has been a-bed with Cassio) hath a little dashed your spirits.&quot; Othello responds defensively, perhaps a tad dishonestly: &quot;Not a jot, not a jot.&quot;</p>
<div data-dobid="dfn">The noun &quot;jot&quot; is not obsolete but it&#39;s not common either. What is a jot? A tiny bit, a shred, a whit, a speck, a scintilla, a mite, a trace, a skoch, an inkling, a dollop. Smaller by far than a mere smidgeon. But in its root meaning, was a jot a <span style="line-height: 1.3;">measure of liquid, such as an ounce? or of weight, such as a gram? A measure of distance? &#0160;A measure of time: &quot;I&#39;ll be with you in just a jot.&quot;</span></div>
<p>Professor Google tells me it&#39;s none of those things and that I am entirely off track. &quot;Jot&quot; is alphabetic; it translates the Greek &quot;iota,&quot; the smallest letter -- no more than a single straight line, a minimal minim. And therefore Othello might just as well have said (the words are cognates), &quot;Not an iota, not an iota.&quot; He might have said it, that is, if he hadn&#39;t spent his dearest action in the tented field engaging exclusively in broils and battles, but instead had studied at some North African classical academy.</p>
<p>In fact, Shakespeare either didn&#39;t know or didn&#39;t use the word &quot;iota,&quot; which seems not to have entered English until a generation after he ceased putting quill to paper. On the other hand, Shakespeare was mighty fond of the word jot, which he employed at least twenty times (though never so notably as in <em>Othello),</em>&#0160;always to denote a small quantity and frequently to appear as a partitive: &quot;jot of promise,&quot; &quot;jot of ceremony,&quot; &quot;jot of color,&quot; &quot;jot of pleasure,&quot; &quot;jot of blood.&#39;&quot; Shakespeare&#39;s &quot;jot&quot; can even signify a moment in time: &quot;No, faith, I&#39;ll not stay a <span class="keyword1">jot</span> longer.&quot; (His &quot;jot&quot; is always a noun, never the converted verb meaning &quot;to write a few words quickly.&quot;)</p>
<p>Shakespeare undoubtedly knew the word &quot;jot&quot; from its famous and mysterious appearance in&#0160;<em>Matthew</em> 5:18. Here&#39;s the familiar King James Version (1611): &quot;For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.&quot; The phrasing is almost the same in the Geneva Bible of 1576 -- the translation that Shakespeare himself knew and used. &quot;<span style="line-height: 1.3;"><span style="line-height: 1.3;">For truly I say unto you, Till heaven and earth perish, one jot or one tittle of the Law shall not escape, till all things be fulfilled.&quot;</span></span></p>
<div data-dobid="dfn">
<p>I don&#39;t know what &quot;all things&quot; are and I certainly don&#39;t know what is meant by &quot;fulfilled.&quot; But why should I, since Jesus&#39;s prophesy has long baffled trained professional theologians. But I do know that the pairing of &quot;jot and tittle&quot; has become proverbial.</p>
<p>What, then, is a &quot;tittle.&quot; No, it&#39;s not a very small female breast. Nor is it a diminutive seabird, though it&#39;s not difficult to imagine a rocky south Atlantic island frequented by the &quot;Lesser, or Little Tittle.&quot; In actual fact, it&#39;s a stroke of a pen -- and one that&#39;s even smaller than an iota. Specifically, it&#39;s the dot over the lower case &quot;i&quot; or lower case &quot;j.&quot; Or, in an extended sense, any simple diacritical mark.&#0160;</p>
<p>Shakespeare used &quot;tittle&quot; just twice. The first was in <em>Love&#39;s Labor&#39;s Lost</em>&#0160;in a passage in which Shakespeare makes game of affected language. Pompous Don Armado de Adriano compares little things (the woman he woos) to greater things (himself) &quot;Shall I entreat thy love? I will. What shalt thou exchange for rags? robes; for <span class="keyword1">tittles</span>? titles; for thyself? me.&quot; What a difference a &quot;t&quot; makes! &quot;Tittle&quot; makes its second, almost inadvertent, appearance in <em>The Winter&#39;s Tale </em>as an element in the dismissive reduplicative &quot;tittle-tattling.&quot; Both of Shakespeare&#39;s tittles acknowledge that the word is an inherently silly one. Is it accidental that a number of words that resemble tittle are frivolous or infantile: babble, toddle, tattle, prattle? &#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;Tittle&quot; smacks of triviality. It lacks heft. It would have been a literary disaster, a catastrophe of the first order, if Othello had responded to Iago not with &quot;Not a jot, not a jot,&quot; but with &quot;not a tittle, not a tittle.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>[October 29] &#0160;Otis Brown responds: &quot;Dr. M.: you&#39;ve forgotten the most famous Tittle of all: Yelberton Abraham. How could you?</p>
<p>[November 2] &#0160;Vivian de St. Vrain responds:</p>

                                <div class="original-line">Shakespeare took a few shots at depicting a hellish afterlife.&#0160;</div>
<div class="original-line">&#0160;</div>
<div class="original-line">The most extended, if I remember correctly, belongs to Claudio in&#0160;<em>Measure for Measure</em>. &quot;To die, and go we know not where;/ To lie in cold obstruction and to rot;/ This sensible warm motion to become/ A kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit/ To bathe in fiery floods,/ Or to reside in thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice;/ To be imprisoned in the viewless winds,/ And blown with restless violence round about/ The pendent world; or to be worse than worst/ Of those that lawless and incertain thought/ Imagine howling: tis too horrible.&quot; It&#39;s a damned scary vision, and mostly easy to understand, though it helps to be reminded that sensible = having sense, &quot;delighted&quot; = darkened, &quot;thrilling&quot;= piercing, &quot;viewless&quot; = blind, and that &quot;lawless and incertain thought&quot; refers to non-Christian speculation. Shakespeare gives Claudio a number of choices for eternal suffering, each one worse than the other.&#0160;&#0160;</div>
<div class="original-line">&#0160;</div>
<div class="original-line">When Othello realizes that Desdemona was innocent after all, he foresees a one-dimensional hot hell, one in which devils will&#0160;&quot;Blow me about in winds, roast me in sulfur/&#0160;Wash me in steep-down gulfs of liquid fire.&quot; Clear enough, painful enough.</div>
<div class="original-line">&#0160;</div>
<div class="original-line">And finally, Lear imagines himself &quot;Bound upon a wheel of fire,/ That mine own tears to scald like molten lead.&quot;&#0160;</div>
<div class="original-line">&#0160;</div>
<div class="original-line">I think the whole afterlife thing is a fraud, but if there were a hell, here&#39;s what mine would be like.</div>
<div class="original-line">&#0160;</div>
<div class="original-line">I&#39;m on a commercial flight, steerage class, cramped into a seat too narrow and lacking adequate leg room. A middle seat. On my left is a very large gentleman whose massive shoulders and thighs encroach upon my territory. He stinks of tobacco. He drinks too much alcohol and tries to engage me in conversation. On my right is a similarly-proportioned lady who reeks of cheap perfume and who glares at me whenever my bony elbow makes contact with her fat forearm. I&#39;m hungry and all there is to eat are some horrid plastic pretzels in a bag that only a safecracker could open. A scruffy fourteen-year-old boy sits behind me. Rap &quot;music&quot; leaks from his earbuds and he kicks the back of my seat at irregular intervals. My only reading matter is a airline magazine that advertises expensive gimcrack novelties that no sensible human would ever dream of buying. My bladder is distended and painful but the seat-belt sign is perpetually lit. This plane never lands. Sometimes it threatens to do so, but at the last moment it&#39;s diverted to another airport.</div>
<div class="original-line">&#0160;</div>
<div class="original-line">This continues throughout all eternity.</div>
<div class="original-line">&#0160;</div>
<div class="original-line">And it is much worse than vats of liquid fire. Far worse than anything that Shakespeare could possibly have imagined.</div>
                        </div>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Setting aside the suspicion that <em>The First Part of Henry the Sixth</em> is&#0160;a collaborative work or perhaps even a&#0160;&quot;prequel&quot; to Parts Two and Three, the play can be read&#0160;as if its first few lines were the earliest example of Shakespeare&#39;s playwriting.&#0160;If so,&#0160;then, what can be learned, right there at the very beginning, by looking closely at Act one, scene one, line one?&#0160;</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the first considerable&#0160;speech&#0160;in the play -- just about the very moment, let us imagine, in which Mr. W. S.&#39;s &quot;rough and all-unable&quot; goose quill touched paper. Thirty-seven or thirty-eight astonishing plays lie&#0160;in the future.&#0160;</p>
<p>The adventure begins&#0160;as&#0160;Gloucester eulogizes&#0160;the recently-deceased Henry&#0160;V.&#0160;The speech is not brilliant, not accomplished; in fact, it&#39;s just plain vanilla ordinary.&#0160;But it&#39;s a seed,&#0160;a kernel.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p><em>Gloucester:</em>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;England ne&#39;er had a king until his time.</p>
<p>Virtue he had, deserving to command:</p>
<p>His brandish&#39;d sword did blind men with his beams:</p>
<p>His arms spread wider that a dragon&#39;s wings;</p>
<p>His sparking eyes, replete with wrathful fire</p>
<p>More dazzled and drove back his enemies</p>
<p>Than mid-day sun fierce bent against their faces.</p>
<p>What should I say?&#0160; his deeds exceed all speech:</p>
<p>He ne&#39;er lift up his hand but conquered.&#0160;</p>
<p>A reader or playgoer would have to be superbly&#0160;insightful to predict that <em>this</em> Shakespeare would become <em>the</em> Shakespeare.&#0160;This opening speech is a&#0160;a mighty flat piece of rhetoric.</p>
<p>It&#39;s&#0160;formulaic&#0160; -- simply a litany or list.&#0160;First comes an item, a noun&#0160;(virtue, sword, arms, eyes, deeds) which is then amplified&#0160;by a hyperbolic qualifier (beams, wings, fire, sun).&#0160;It&#39;s open-ended; it could go&#0160;on indefinitely.&#0160;But because it&#39;s so much a formula, there&#39;s no surprise--there&#39;s no&#0160;mystery or excitement about where Gloucester is&#0160;heading.</p>
<p>Moreover,&#0160;for each element in the list,&#0160;there&#39;s&#0160;a congruence between the unit of thought and the unit of verse.&#0160;The sentiment&#0160;of each of the first four items on the list&#0160;is exactly contained in a&#0160;five-beat, ten-syllable line of verse--a pedestrian procedure&#0160;which Shakespeare would soon transcend. And finally, there&#39;s&#0160;an excess of&#0160;old-fashioned, traditional&#0160;alliteration:&#0160;&quot;His Brandish&#39;d sward did Blind me with his Beams&quot; &quot;affects the letter&quot; and browbeats the brain with the letter B. It goes almost without saying that there&#39;s nothing in this speech that is particular (Elizabethans would say peculiar) to either Gloucester or Henry.&#0160;This is Anyduke reciting sentences about Anyking.</p>
<p>But then something truly amazing occurs. &#0160;Although it looks as though&#0160;Gloucester is gathering his strength and his breath&#0160;for a speech that might go on for&#0160;forty lines and which would celebrate&#0160;many more&#0160;of the late kings&#39;s&#0160;amazing attributes,&#0160;he suddenly changes plans and truncates his intention:&#0160;&#0160;&quot;What should I say?&#0160; his deeds exceed all speech.&quot;</p>
<p>Gloucester seems to have run out of rhetorical gas. He is frustrated because he simply doesn&#39;t have the words. He throws in the rhetorical towel, so to speak. He surrenders. And he&#39;s right to do so, because at this early moment neither he nor Shakespeare has the power to generate a language that is equal to Henry&#39;s deeds. Better to stop speaking if you are utterly unable to say what you want to say.</p>
<p>Yet what is the task of&#0160;such a playwright as Shakespeare?</p>
<p>It is not to do exactly what Gloucester admits that he cannot do? -- to find the words that are commensurate with the deed -- as Shakespeare certainly will when he returns to Henry in the 1598 play which concludes and climaxes this sequence of eight history plays. In a decade, Shakespeare will move from the pathos of &quot;What shall I say?&quot; to a rich eloquence that is up to the task.</p>
<p>&quot;What shall I say?&quot; is therefore an important question -- the most important question of all, in fact&#0160;-- and the playwright&#0160;asks&#0160;it right here at the outset.&#0160;Readers&#0160;can&#0160;watch and learn as Shakespeare little by little, in play after play, gradually invents a&#0160;rhetorical style in which speech not only equals but eventually comes to exceed all deeds.&#0160;&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>&quot;Antres&quot; is among the rarest of&#0160;rare words. Shakespeare&#39;s Othello speaks of &quot;antres vast and deserts idle&quot;&#0160;in the magnificent&#0160;oration&#0160;in which he&#0160;takes issue with the Venetian bigotry&#0160;that claimed that he&#0160;was only able to win white Desdemona by employing&#0160;drugs and witchcraft. No, it wasn&#39;t because he was a sorcerer; it was because he was accomplished, heroic, romantic. &quot;Antres&quot; is one of the exotic words that defines the great&#0160;African general&#0160;as a non-Venetian --&#0160;an outlander, an &quot;erring barbarian,&quot; an &quot;extravagant and wheeling stranger.&quot;</p>
<p>Shakespeare coined &quot;antres&quot; just for the occasion, deriving it&#0160;from Latin <em>antrum, </em>a cave. He never used &quot;antres&quot; again, nor did anyone else until Keats fleetingly revived the word&#0160;two centuries afterward. &quot;Antres&quot; never domesticated into English and remains curious&#0160;and&#0160;remote,&#0160;eternally&#0160;in need of an explanatory footnote. It is&#0160;unlikely that Shakespeare expected that a popular or even a courtly audience would&#0160;grasp &quot;antres&quot; at first hearing. It&#39;s a risky word, but Shakespeare didn&#39;t become Shakespeare without taking risks.</p>
<p>The playwright coupled&#0160;the neologism&#0160;&quot;antres&quot; to another shiny new Latinism to&#0160;produce &quot;antres vast,&quot; a phrase&#0160;which translates into the&#0160;language of&#0160;2017 as &quot;really big caves.&quot; Yet no translation can&#0160;do justice&#0160;to the spacious resonance of&#0160;&quot;antres vast.&quot; The caverns to which Othello refers are monstrously huge -- grown grander and even&#0160;more inaccessible because&#0160;Shakespeare ingeniously placed the modifier&#0160;after rather than before the noun. &quot;Antres vast&quot; are a hundredfold more mysterious --&#0160;darker, more echoic, more glinty with&#0160;stalactites&#0160;and stalagmites -- than &quot;vast antres.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;Antres vast&quot; occurs in tandem with a second&#0160;and equally remarkable&#0160;noun-adjective combination: &quot;deserts idle.&quot; Othello reports that before he came to Venice, he&#0160;had not only traversed &quot;rough quarries, rocks, and hills whose heads touch heaven&quot;&#0160;but&#0160;had also&#0160;dwelt among&#0160;&quot;antres vast and deserts idle.&quot; Strictly speaking, deserts cannot be&#0160;&quot;idle,&quot;&#0160;but they can be vacant or useless.&#0160;&quot;Deserts idle&quot; reinforces and augments &quot;antres vast.&quot; Taken together,&#0160;the two phrases are infinitely more evocative than either alone.</p>
<p>As a structure of sound, &quot;antres vast and deserts idle&quot; pivots on&#0160;the &quot;d&quot; of &quot;and&quot; and&#0160;the &quot;d&quot; of &quot;deserts&quot; and it positions&#0160;&quot;antres&quot; and &quot;idle&quot; in&#0160;symmetrical opposition. The&#0160;two key words are dissimilar yet cleverly interlinked,&#0160;each&#0160;comprised of an open vowel (Antres, Idle), a dental (anTres, iDle), and a liquid (antRes, idLe). It is not by&#0160;accident&#0160;that &quot;antres vast and deserts idle&quot; is such a euphonious&#0160;and mouth-filling phrase.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Shakespeare not only&#0160;invented&#0160;&quot;antres&quot; for Othello&#39;s&#0160;oration but also&#0160;took care to&#0160;surround it with&#0160;other linguistic novelties. For example:&#0160;Othello claims to have encountered&#0160;&quot;cannibals that each other eat/ The anthropophagi.&quot; &quot;Cannibal&quot; is now a commonplace noun,&#0160;but in 1604 it was a newcomer to the language. &quot;Cannibal&quot; derives from &quot;Carib,&quot; the name of a&#0160;recently-encountered people--reputed to be man-eaters --who gave&#0160;their appellation&#0160;to the sea in which they lived.&#0160;&quot;Cannibal&quot; was sufficiently strange--it had only made harbor in England (arriving by way of Spain) in the 1550s--that&#0160;Shakespeare felt a need to define it, which he did&#0160;once in English (&quot;that each other eat&quot;) and once in Greek (&quot;anthropophagi&quot;). &quot;Anthropophagi,&quot;&#0160;a word that&#0160;had originated with&#0160;Herodotus, was as new to&#0160;English--and as seldom employed--as &quot;cannibal.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;Antres vast,&quot; &quot;deserts idle,&quot; &quot;cannibals&quot; and &quot;anthropophagi&quot; play crucial parts in&#0160;Othello&#39;s stirring autobiographical fragment.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; &#0160;I spake of most disastrous chances,</p>
<p>Of moving accidents by flood and field,</p>
<p>Of hair-breadth&#0160;scapes i&#39;th&#39;imminent deadly breach,</p>
<p>Of being taken by the insolent foe</p>
<p>And sold&#0160;to slavery;&#0160; of my redemption thence,</p>
<p>And portance in my travel&#39;s history:</p>
<p>Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle,</p>
<p>Rough quarries, rocks, and hills whose heads touch heaven,</p>
<p>It was my hint to speak -- such was the process.</p>
<p>And of the cannibals&#0160;that each other eat,</p>
<p>The anthropophagi, and men whose heads</p>
<p>Do grow beneath their shoulders.</p>
<p>It&#39;s an astonishing story, each element&#0160;more incredible than the one that precedes it. Hair-breadth escapes?&#0160; Every hero&#0160;can boast of them. Redemption from slavery? A bit less likely. Hills whose heads touch heaven? A pardonable hyperbole. Cannibals?&#0160; Surely,&#0160;less&#0160;believable still. The Othello landscape then crosses the border from exotic to fabulous when it adduces&#0160;&quot;men whose heads/ Do grow beneath their shoulders.&quot; These headless men&#0160;are&#0160;the <em>blemmyae --&#0160;</em>Nubian or sometimes&#0160;Ethiopian -- who&#0160;were&#0160;a feature of&#0160; pseudo-anthropological folklore from Pliny to Sir Walter Raleigh. The skepticism that these monstrous creatures ought to provoke is diluted because the&#0160;road&#0160;to the blemmyes&#0160;passes through&#0160;&quot;antres vast and deserts idle.&quot; If audiences had not been lulled and seduced by &quot;antres,&quot; they might dismiss&#0160;Othello as a mere&#0160;braggart soldier--rather than admire him for the near-magician that he becomes in his self-dramatization.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Shakespeare had yet another purpose&#0160;for&#0160;&quot;antres vast.&quot; In the sentence that treads on the heels of the &quot;men whose heads/ Do&#0160;grow beneath their shoulders,&quot; Othello abruptly turned his attention to Desdemona. His language&#0160;dulls. &quot;This (i.e. his exotic narrative) to hear would Desdemona seriously incline,/ But still the house affairs would draw her hence.&quot;&#0160;Shakespeare strategically contrasts Othello&#39;s vocabulary to&#0160;Desdemona&#39;s when he&#0160;juxtaposes&#0160;&quot;antres vast&quot; to &quot;house affairs.&quot; Only the tinnest of ears&#0160;can fail to be struck by&#0160;the difference between the two phrases. Antres vast--house affairs; house affairs--antres vast. The gap between these two most pregnant phrases&#0160;is small enough to allow the electric impulses of sex and&#0160;romance to&#0160;spark,&#0160;but is too wide&#0160;to allow genuine understanding or empathy to shoot the gap.&#0160;The tragedy of Desdemona and Othello arises out of the unbridgeable space&#0160;between &quot;antres vast&quot; and &quot;house affairs.&quot;</p>
<p>Shakespeare therefore knew exactly what he was about when&#0160;he invented&#0160;the word &quot;antres.&quot;</p>
<p>If he had been&#0160;in a more antic&#0160;mood, less determined to&#0160;characterize&#0160;Othello&#39;s&#0160;massive dignity, he might have&#0160;coined a word from another&#0160;Latin word for cave,&#0160;e.g.&#0160;<em>spelunca</em>.&#0160;&#0160;But&#0160;&quot;spelunkies vast&quot; -- or even &quot;spelunkies splendid&quot;&#0160;-- could not&#0160;possibly do the work of&#0160;&quot;antres vast.&quot;&#0160;</p>

		<a href="https://www.drmetablog.com/2017/05/enoughisasgoodasafeast.html">"Enough is as Good as a Feast" or Possibly Better</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <div>&quot;Enough is as good as a feast&quot; has become my very favorite proverb.</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>It&#39;s&#0160; a warning against crass consumerism, against materialism, against the excesses of capitalist acquisitiveness. Cold water in a jelly glass, it asserts, is as good as your $500 wine in crystal. As they used to gloss the proverb, no &quot;<em>avaricious scraping together that knows no bounds</em>.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>But for a fully &quot;mature&quot; guy like me, the proverb carries not only a figurative but a plain literal instruction, i.e., &quot;do yourself a favor, eat less.&quot; Enough is as good as a feast if a feast makes your stomach swell, makes you heavy-lidded and gassy and passive, and if you feel a heck of a lot better when you haul yourself away from the Table of Plenty long before you reach satiety.</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>I can remember, as a voracious adolescent, eating <em>three </em>large, overstuffed hamburgers at a single sitting -- the roll overflowing with tomatoes, onions, relish, ketchup, etc. Along with a bottomless bowl of fries. And craving more. Then as a vigorous young man, a good portion was two hamburgers. Nowadays, I go halves with a friend. Hold the fries.</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>When my grandmother dished up those glorious blintzes of my youth, eight was my number. Now my number is -- one. And I feel the better for it.</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>Digestion is slower and, I suppose, less efficient. And then there&#39;s the embarrassing fact that hamburgers and blintzes and everything else settles right in the enlarged belly, the &quot;front porch.&quot;</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>So here&#39;s a proverb for this latter age: &quot;enough is better than a feast.&quot; Much.&#0160;</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>By the way, I first encountered the proverb, believe it or not, as the title to William Wager&#39;s 1581 morality. And then in Latin in Shakespeare&#39;s<em> Love&#39;s Labor&#39;s Lost</em>,<em><em>&#0160;</em></em>where, Sir Nathaniel and the pedant Holofernes come on stage having just completed, apparently, a more than substantial dinner. &quot;<em>Holofernes</em>: &#0160;&#39;Satis quod sufficit.&#39;&quot; Perhaps Holofernes paraphrases and simplifies&#0160;Horace:&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div><em>Multa petentibus<br />Desunt multa.<br />Bene est, cui deus obtulit<br />Parca, quod satis est manu.</em></div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>(Those who seek for much are left in want of much. Happy is he to whom God has given, with sparing hand, as much as is enough.)&#0160;</div>
                        </div>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I wrote the following long ago, republished it once. Here it is, relevant again.</p>
<p><strong>What Doesn&#39;t Dick Cheney Commit Suicide?</strong></p>
<p>Why doesn&#39;t Dick Cheney put a bullet in his brain?&#0160;It would do him (and his reputation) a world of good. What could possibly stand in his way?&#0160;Once he sprinkles the ratsbane on his porridge -- and, of course, leaves behind a detailed and humble letter of apology --&#0160; he will begin to free his soul of sin and to enjoy some peace of mind.&#0160;When he has fallen on his sword, his lackeys and toadies will be able to claim that although&#0160;he was a black-hearted knave, at least he wasn&#39;t a shameless black-hearted knave.&#0160;They can try to persuade us that although he was egregiously and dangerously wrong, he was, like another suicide, Othello, &quot;great of heart.&quot; But if Cheney continues in his surly, obstinate, unapologetic lip-curling silence -- why then, he&#39;ll go down in the books as an unrepentant demi-devil like Iago (&quot;From this time forth I never will speak word&quot;).&#0160;</p>
<p>Cheney has brought disgrace upon our beloved nation and upon himself.&#0160;Using faked spy data, he suckered the ignorant, feckless Decider and almost the entire Congress into invading Iraq.&#0160;His war has been a monumental disaster.&#0160;&quot;Full of scorpions [should be] his brain.&quot;&#0160;At this moment of writing, Cheney is guilty of killing 3260 American soldiers and maiming (by official count -- who can possibly guess at the truth?) 24,314 others.&#0160;If Cheney has even the most rudimentary of consciences, on it lies the heavy burden of 60,000 to 100,000 Iraqi souls.&#0160;The Dickster has cost America $414 billion dollars, loss of prestige and the squandering of oceans of good will.&#0160;Like Anthony, he &quot;has lived in such dishonor/That the gods detest [his] baseness.&quot; But Antony took the proper course.&#0160;When Cheney dispatches himself -- &quot;after the high Roman fashion,&quot; let&#39;s hope -- he&#39;ll have taken the first step toward rehabilitating himself and the nation.&#0160;For him not to do the deed would be ignoble.&#0160;</p>
<p>Dick:&#0160; I know that you&#39;re hunkering in your bomb-proof shelter. I know that you&#39;re up late at night, sleepless with guilt.&#0160;You&#39;re cruising the internet, perchance googling &quot;Cheney + suicide,&quot; and you&#39;re wavering in your purpose.&#0160;Dick -- take my considered advice.&#0160;I&#39;m thinking of your place in history.&#0160; At this point, &quot;you have no friend,/ But resolution and the briefest end.&quot;&#0160; You&#39;ll immediately feel better. It&#39;s a no-brainer.&#0160;Go for it.</p>
<p><em>April 10.</em>&#0160; Spike Schapiro comments:&#0160; &quot;Dr. M. -- I&#39;ve read your exhortation to suicide. You are, as usual, falsely optimistic. Cheney can&#39;t off himself because a) he&#39;s shameless and b) he&#39;s a total coward, and c) he has no self-knowledge and d) he can&#39;t point a shotgun. You cite the precedents of Othello and Anthony but they&#39;re both great spirits and therefore irrelevant. Cheney is a slug. Moreover,&#0160;Cheney can&#39;t be &quot;great of heart&quot; -- he has no heart of his own --it&#39;s either a transplant or some mechanical contraption.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p><em>April 4, 2014&#0160; </em>Why is this man still alive?&#0160; Allowed to give interviews?&#0160; Is there no justice in our&#0160;sublunary world?&#0160;</p>
<p>December 22, 2016 &#0160;Only a silver stake in his heart is going to do it. Mirrors, garlic. Too late for prayers.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I&#39;m marvelously fond of the Italian word &quot;fango,&quot; which translates into English as &quot;mud.&quot; &quot;Fango&quot; is expressive of the matter which it describes. To my ear, the word fango sounds slimy and disreputable, perhaps even repulsive, while its English counterpart &quot;mud&quot; is bland and lacks character. And &quot;fangoso&quot; is so much more dramatic than &quot;muddy.&quot;</p>
<p>But why fango? &#0160;How did fango infiltrate the Italian language? The Latin word for mud is &quot;lutum,&quot; which would naturally yield Italian &quot;luto&quot;, which, as it happens, is a word that does exist, but, so far, one that I&#39;ve encountered only in dictionaries. Fango it is, and gladly. Let us revel in fango.&#0160;</p>
<p>Fango, according to my bank of etymological resources, appears to be of Germanic origin and a distant cousin to the English word &quot;fen,&quot; &quot;a low land covered in whole or part by water.&quot; Lots of fango in that there fen, obviously. There&#39;s also a rare (my dictionary says &#39;poetical&#39;) French word &quot;fange,&quot; for mud, but the more common word is boue. Boue is one of a handful of French words (other than toponyms) that are of Gaulish origin.&#0160;So that when it came to mud, both the Italian and French languages adopted indigenous rather than Latin words. And for good reason: if there&#39;s any substance that is common rather than learned, it&#39;s mud. &#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;Fango&quot; bears no relation to English &quot;fang.&quot; Fang is an oversized tooth, but not in its earliest appearances. Old English fang denoted&#0160;plunder or booty, &quot;a seizing or taking.&quot; The root meaning of grasp or capture is present in the name of Good Master Fang, an ineffectual officer of the law in Shakespeare&#39;s <em>The Second Part of King Henry the Fourth</em>. Yet fang as unquestionably tooth or toothy in Duke Senior&#39;s metaphor in <em>As You Like it</em>, where &quot;the icy <span class="keyword1">fang/&#0160;</span>And churlish chiding of the winter&#39;s wind,... <em>bites</em>&#0160;and blows upon my body.&quot;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>&quot;Orts&quot; is a rare but tasty word. Orts are the bits of bones, gristle, stems, skins, pits and other inedibles that are left on the plate after one finishes eating -- the stuff that is scraped directly into the garbage can. Orts are to be distinguished from &quot;leftovers&quot; which are the uneaten remains of the meal that are carefully sequestered for tomorrow&#39;s breakfast. Leftovers good, orts bad.</p>
<p>Shakespeare uses &quot;orts&quot; twice in the plays, both times metaphorically. The first instance is in <em>Julius Caesa</em>r, when Anthony tells Octavius how little he values his colleague Lepidus. According to Anthony, Lepidus is &quot;A barren-spirited fellow; one that feeds/ On abjects, orts and imitations.&quot; In this instance, orts seems to be prompted by the word &quot;feed.&quot; A second appearance of the word orts is in<em> Troilus and Cressida.&#0160;</em>Troilus has discovered that his beloved Cressida has been playing at fast and loose with Diomedes: &quot;The bonds of heaven are slipp&#39;d, dissolved, and loosed/&#0160;And with another knot, five-finger-tied,/&#0160;The fractions of her faith, <span class="keyword1">orts</span> of her love,/ The fragments, scraps, the bits and greasy relics/ Of her o&#39;er-eaten faith, are bound to Diomed.&quot; It&#39;s a strong speech and &quot;orts of her love&quot; is a powerful phrase, though rather obscure nowadays to audiences for whom the &quot;ort&quot; is a mystery --which certainly includes contemporary audiences.</p>
<p>Whether Shakespeare&#39;s first audiences would have required a footnote for orts I do not know. It was never a frequently used word, though the OED attests its presence in the language from 1440 to 1880. I don&#39;t know of any recent usages, but once, when I was at lunch with a group of professional Shakespeareans, I asked at the close of the meal, &quot;What do we do with the orts&quot; -- everyone at the table knew exactly what I meant. Rather a specialized audience, however.</p>
<p>Orts should not be confused with Oorts. The Oort cloud is the presumed boundary of the solar system, way out there, ten times further than Neptune, where the comets are thought to reside until they are dislodged from their proper home and come hurtling toward the inner planets. Orts and Oorts are both leftovers, in the sense that they are the remains of an original creation, in the one case chicken pot pie and in the other the universe. Orts are much smaller but more palpable than Oorts. Makes a guy wonder what could possibly be denoted by ooorts? Or oooorts?</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>When I was a boy, the word boob denoted a simpleton, a nincompoop-- what Shakespeare calls a mooncalf and what in an earlier life I might have called a schmuck or a schmendrick. &quot;Boobs&quot; was an everyday expression; so common and pervasive that The Three Stooges might just as easily have been called the The Three Boobs. There were other related uses of the word; &quot;booby hatch&quot; -- a semi-humorous appellation for what was formerly called an insane asylum, and also the &quot;boob-tube&quot; -- though whether the boob in that doublet denoted the machine itself or the schmendricks who stared at it was never clear to me. But at some point in my linguistic career the word &quot;boob&quot; re-emerged with a new primary signification. It now seems to have become the most common word for the female breast.</p>
<p>I do not like&#0160;it when a breast is called a boob.&#0160;It is disrespectful.&#0160;A breast is soft and nurturing but&#0160;also erotic and enticing.&#0160;A boob is neither;&#0160;it is a denatured object, stripped of its warm associations and joined instead to foolishness and&#0160;boobery.&#0160;&quot;Boob&quot; is&#0160;a deliberately unsexual and undignified term. It is also, as Shakespeare says in a&#0160;different context,&#0160;&quot;base, vulgar and popular.&quot;</p>
<p>And available. If a person should happen to google the word &quot;boob,&quot; perhaps searching for information of an etymological kind, the first, second, third and perhaps hundredth entry that he or she will encounter is for &quot;boob selfies.&quot; A &quot;boob selfie,&quot; for readers equally as naïve as me, is a photograph which a woman takes of her boobs and posts on the internet.</p>
<p>Jane Austen did not do this. Neither did George Eliot. I can&#39;t demonstrate that the word &quot;boob&#39; is responsible for such a decadent display of immodesty, but I do note that phrases such as &quot;breast selfies&quot; or &quot;bosom selfies&quot; are inconceivable.&#0160;</p>
<p>Nor did suicidal Cleopatra, when bringing the venomous asp to her breast, say &quot;Peace, peace/ Dost thou not see my baby at my boob/ That sucks the nurse asleep.&quot;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>My daughter&#39;s nephew-in-law, Zach Appelman, is a talented actor setting out on what might very well turn out to be&#0160;a terrific&#0160;career. (His ascent&#0160;would be more rapid&#0160;if he would take his aunt-in-law&#39;s father&#39;s&#0160;advice and change his stage name to Zach Barrymore or Zach Zellweger, but the young man has too much integrity to comply with aged opportunistic wisdom).</p>
<p>Zach recently played Hamlet at the Hartford Stage in Connecticut (Hartford Courant:&#0160;&quot;a career-propelling performance that at times takes your breath away&quot;).&#0160;I spoke&#0160;with Zach at the recent&#0160;family Thanksgiving and he told me that the director of this <em>Hamlet</em>,&#0160;Darko Tresnjak, made an effort to emphasize the play&#39;s comic passages.&#0160;It was a good idea, I think, because <em>Hamlet</em> is both&#0160;in reading and performance an intermittently hilarious&#0160;piece of dramatic art.&#0160;But, added&#0160;Zach, sometimes the audience laughed at moments that he did not anticipate.&#0160;He cited an example in the&#0160;so-called &quot;bedroom scene,&quot; where&#0160;Hamlet assails Gertrude&#0160;for marrying Claudius.&#0160;Hamlet&#39;s rebuke of his mother&#0160;is harsh&#0160;and dislocating. About her marriage to Claudius, he says&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>You cannot call it love;&#0160; for at your age</p>
<p>The hectic in the blood is tame, it&#39;s humble</p>
<p>It waits upon the judgment.</p>
<p>These lines&#0160;apparently caused quite a commotion among the seniors in the audience.&#0160;It is not hard to imagine why.&#0160;Hamlet, for all his sparkling intelligence, is callow.&#0160;He has&#0160;youth&#39;s&#0160;ignorance about middle-age sexuality -- as&#0160;the silver-threads-among-the-gold demographic must certainly have recognized.&#0160;How could Hamlet (or perhaps even young Shakespeare, a mere thirty-five when he wrote the play), know that desire and passion increase in middle-age as&#0160;impetuous adolescent oestrus and fumblings are superseded by mature appreciation and achievement.</p>
<p>I doubt that&#0160;Shakespeare meant Hamlet&#39;s lines to be funny -- there&#39;s no room for humor in the rhapsody of words that the prince&#0160;directs at his mommy.&#0160;Nevertheless, a modern sophisticated and wrinkle-deep-in-time audience cannot help but titter at Hamlet&#39;s grotesque misjudgment.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>These observations on sex in youth and age were still percolating in my waiting-for-wisdom brain while&#0160;I&#0160;re-read, for, what? &#0160;the fourth or fifth or sixth&#0160;time, Anthony Trollope&#39;s excellent 1857 novel, <em>Barchester Towers</em>.&#0160;My attention was caught, this time through,&#0160;by one of Trollope&#39;s digressions, very pertinent to the topic of autumnal&#0160;love, and which I now transcribe&#0160;in a slightly reduced&#0160;version and which I think is well worthy intense study, especially by my readers of certain late-hectic ages.</p>
<p>&quot;It is, we believe, [says Trollope] common with young men of five and twenty to look on their seniors -- on men of, say, double their own age -- as so&#0160;many stocks and stones -- stocks and stones, that is, in regard to feminine beauty.&quot;</p>
<p>(Let me interject that for &quot;young men of five and twenty&quot;, think &quot;Hamlet.&quot;&#0160;And when Trollope talks of &quot;feminine beauty,&quot; let us recognize that the phrase is a&#0160; euphemistic Victorian surrogate&#0160;for issues of human desire and sexuality that conventional taboos made it impossible for Trollope to address forthrightly.)</p>
<p>&quot;There never was a greater mistake [continues Trollope].&#0160;Men of fifty don&#39;t dance mazurkas, being generally too fat and wheezy;&#0160;nor do they sit for hours together on river banks at their mistresses&#39; feet, being somewhat afraid of rheumatism.&#0160;But for real true love, love at first sight, love to devotion, love that robs a man of his sleep, love [and here Trollope begins to quote from the famous passage in <em>Love&#39;s Labor&#39;s Lost]</em> &#39;that will gaze an eagle blind, love that will hear the lowest sound when the suspicious head of theft is stopped, love that is like a Hercules still climbing trees in the Hesperides, we believe that this best age is from forty-five to seventy.&quot;</p>
<p>Forty-five to seventy, ladies and gentleman.&#0160;Just the age of the men and women in the Hartford playhouse who snickered&#0160;at&#0160;Hamlet junior&#39;s&#0160;incomprehension&#0160;of his mother&#39;s passions.&#0160;</p>
<p>And then Trollope brings his excursus to conclusion with a great sentence in which he both&#0160;disses and dismisses&#0160;immature youthful ardor:</p>
<p>&quot;Up to that age [i.e. forty-five] men are generally given to mere flirting.&quot;</p>
<p>&#0160;As perhaps Hamlet flirts with Ophelia.</p>
<p>It&#39;s intriguing that Trollope recognizes that men of seventy summers may still be ardent lovers and appreciators of the flesh. If he had been a little older and more experienced, he would have increased his estimate to seventy-five, perhaps even eighty. After all, eighty is the new seventy, is it not?&#0160;&#0160;Or he might even have acknowledged that it ain&#39;t over until it&#39;s over.</p>
<p>Trollope was only forty-two when he wrote&#0160;<em>Barchester Towers, </em>so perhaps he knew that he was only capable of mere flirtation with Rose Heseltine.&#0160;But he was 67 when he proposed, in the nasty dystopia <em>The Fixed Period, </em>that 68 was the age at which all men should be required to give up the ghost.&#0160;<em>The Fixed Period</em> is a novel which, at least to this septuagenarian, provokes not titters but guffaws.&#0160;Poor Anthony T. had become so terribly sour, so unlike the Trollope of Barchester.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>There&#39;s a brief sentence in <em>The Second Part of King Henry the</em> <em>Fourth</em>&#0160;that continues to&#0160;move me no matter how frequently&#0160;I return to it.&#0160;I&#39;s a passage that&#0160;resonates in my latter-day soul.&#0160;</p>
<p>Falstaff and Doll Tearsheet (whose name, obviously, indicates her&#0160;profession) are old acquaintances and&#0160;old rivals who are evermore at odds. &quot;They never meet but they fall to discord.&quot;&#0160; They seem to delight in exchanging insults. To Doll, Falstaff is a &quot;muddy conger,&quot; &quot;a huge full hogshead,&quot; &quot;a poor ape,&quot; and even, when she is more&#0160;affectionate, &quot;a whoreson little tidy Bartholemew boar-pig&quot;.&#0160; Falstaff is equally abusive. But at one point in the play, there is a magical moment when&#0160;Shakespeare allows&#0160;Doll to propose a truce.&#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;Come,&quot; she says, &quot;I&#39;ll be friends with thee, Jack, thou art going to the wars, and whether I shall ever see thee again or no there is nobody cares.&quot;&#0160; <em><br /></em></p>
<p>I think that what electrifies me is the last phrase, &quot;there is nobody cares. &quot; &#0160;A less imaginative, less empathetic writer than Shakespeare would have ended the sentence more predictably: he would have written,&#0160;&quot;nobody knows&quot;&#0160;and would have therefore repeated the commonplace that the future is unknowable.&#0160;But Shakespeare raises the ante&#0160;-- as he so often does.&#0160;&quot;Nobody cares&quot;&#0160;is&#0160;demotic shorthand for &quot;nobody else but we two care&quot;-- which I take to suggest that Doll reflects not that the universe is dicey but rather that we are each of us isolated and unimportant except as we are valued by our nearest friends and the people with whom we have gone through life.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>The sentence is nostalgic in the best sense. It is not&#0160;sentimental;&#0160; Doll does not romanticize hers or Falstaff&#39;s past.&#0160;Instead she faces the aleatory universe bravely.&#0160;You are at risk,&#0160;it could turn out badly, let&#39;s be friends now, all that matters is the moment.&#0160;The sentence is valedictory and at the same time&#0160;extremely warm.&#0160;</p>
<p>Perhaps I&#39;m projecting my own feelings onto Doll Tearsheet.&#0160;I&#39;m at the point in my life in which&#0160;I value (perhaps even treasure) the people whom I&#39;ve worked with, or argued with, liked or&#0160;loved.&#0160; (I have even come to value some whom I&#39;ve not loved.)&#0160;They&#39;re all part of the fabric of my life and they are all disappearing, one by one -- going to the wars, we might say.&#0160;And nobody cares.&#0160;Except us.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I tried&#0160;the first three installments --&#0160;a netflix diskful of episodes&#0160; -- of <em>House of Cards</em>.&#0160;I plan to watch a few more, but I&#39;m deep into negative enthusiasm, not at all sure that I&#39;m going to continue.&#0160;<em>Cards</em> certainly&#0160;grabs you, and it&#39;s startling and theatrical, but it&#39;s also&#0160;far too cynical and depraved&#0160;for my rose-colored tastes.&#0160;I just don&#39;t believe in it. I know that it&#39;s all the rage&#0160;to assume&#0160;that politicians are horrid&#0160;and power-obsessed -- but every one of them,&#0160;all the time,&#0160;without a moment of relaxation or redemption?&#0160;&#0160;And so I&#39;m skeptical of every character, every twist in the plot, every nasty turn of phrase.&#0160;And because I&#39;m skeptical, I just can&#39;t, as they say, &quot;get into it.&quot; Or at least, not all the way in. &#0160;(Full disclosure:&#0160;during episode three I fell into a &#39;deep rest,&#39; sometimes denominated&#0160;a minor nap.)</p>
<p>The character who dominates <em>House of Cards</em> is&#0160;Kevin Spacey&#39;s&#0160;Frank Underbelly --&#0160;I mean &#0160;Underwood --&#0160; who is fascinating but not credible.&#0160;Or rather, he is not designed to be credible, because he regularly violates the fourth wall and converses intimately with viewers.&#0160;Underwood&#0160;is ruthless, implacable, ambitious, vengeful, depraved, vicious, malignant, and amusing. He turns his audience into his co-conspirators.</p>
<p>And where have we seen&#0160;this&#0160;curious concatenation of traits before?&#0160; Think back, fit audience though few,&#0160;to&#0160;your college class in the History of English Drama.&#0160;There you encountered the vice and his crossbred friend, the machiavel,who were&#0160;ubiquitous in medieval drama.&#0160;Shakespeare brought this semi-supernatural hybrid to perfection two separate times&#0160;-- once in the person of&#0160;Richard of Gloucester in <em>Richard III</em> and then again as&#0160;Iago&#0160;in <em>Othello</em>.</p>
<p>Richard of Gloucester winks to his audience that he &quot;can smile, and murder whiles I smile,/And cry &#39;Content&#39; to that which grieves my heart, /And wet my cheeks with artificial tears,/ And frame my face to all occasions.&quot;&#0160; Now if that isn&#39;t Frank Underhill to a T, first spotted killing a puppy and a few scenes later baldly and straightfacedly lying to his President. Richard can &quot;set the murderous Machiavel to school&quot; in order to gain a crown; our unFrank friend Frank once wanted to be secretary of state, but now he just wants revenge. Richard and Iago are capable not only of falsity but even of murder to get what they want. Both of them kill their own wives. &quot;I&#39;ll have her, but I wlll not keep her long,&quot; says Richard of Queen Anne.&#0160;</p>
<p>And therefore If I were to offer advice to Zoe&#0160;Barnes, the reckless young reporter for the <em>Washington Herald</em>, I would suggest that she steer mighty&#0160;clear of Frank Underwood. I would tell her&#0160;to read <em>Othello&#0160;</em>post-post-haste and take careful note of what happens to Desdemona&#39;s lady-in-waiting Emilia. Hint: &quot;Fie, your knife upon a woman.&quot;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Zoe, please, please, get out of there&#0160;while the&#0160;going&#0160;is good!</p>
<p>In Shakespeare&#39;s plays, Richard and Iago both overreach and come to grief.&#0160;Richard is left to die on the battlefield and Iago is subjected to the rigors of Venetian justice (&quot;Torture will ope his lips.&quot;)&#0160;And that&#39;s what is supposed to happen to&#0160;machiavels.</p>
<p>I&#39;m curious as to what will happen to Frank Underhill.&#0160;By rights he should be publicly humiliated&#0160;and&#0160;die a ghastly&#0160;death. But inasmuch as we live in an exceedingly&#0160;cynical age, we can guess that Frank will only die when Kevin Spacey is offered better work, or when ratings plunge, or when the series jumps its inherent shark.&#0160;&#0160;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I&#39;m enchanted by a sentence in <em>Othello</em> that is spoken by Desdemona&#39;s lady-in-waiting, Emilia. She&#39;s helping Desdemona to undress and the two women are engaged in informal chat. Desdemona, perhaps wondering why she had the misfortune to fall&#0160;in love with exotic Othello, allows&#0160;her mind to wander.&#0160;It comes to rest on&#0160;a countryman of hers, a good-looking man named Ludovico. And then her interlocutor Emilia praises handsome Ludovico in words that should compel every sentient being to gasp in astonishment and admiration.</p>
<p>About Ludovico, Emilia&#0160;makes a remarkable&#0160;claim:&#0160;&quot;I know a lady in Venice would have walked barefoot to Palestine for a touch of his nether lip.&quot;</p>
<p>All that needs to be said is, wow! But let me try to explain why the sentence so transfixes me.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>It&#39;s hyperbole, but not the ordinary hyperbole of largest or smallest or coolest or most awesome. It&#39;s a hyperbole beyond hyperbole. A lesser writer might have said, &quot;I know a lady who would have walked a long way to make love to him.&quot; Not Shakespeare. For &quot;a long way,&quot; Shakespeare give us &quot;barefoot to Palestine&quot;; for &quot;make love&quot; he offers &quot;a touch of his nether lip.&quot; It&#39;s extravagant and wheeling.</p>
<p>A hike, shod, to the holy land, would have been a long and exacting journey. Barefoot, beyond belief. The evocative word &quot;Palestine&quot; infuses religion and sanctity into a sentence about sex and desire -- and therefore generates a love-longing that is as powerful, as silly, and as ill-planned as a crusade. And for what aim? Not even, for this mythical lady hiker, a big, zonking, mouth-filling kiss; simply for the merest contact of lips. No, not even lips, just one lip -- the lower one. It&#39;s an hyperbole of minimalism.</p>
<p>In the poetry that Shakespeare knew from his childhood, it was men who would make the vows and undergo the trials to court their beautiful ladies.&#0160;But this lovely sentence&#0160;reverses the convention. It is, so to speak,&#0160;Sadie Hawkins day in Venice.&#0160;</p>
<p>Emilia elsewhere asserts that women have desires as strong as lovers of the other sex; here she demonstrates that women&#39;s love-longing can be as ridiculous (and as powerful) as men&#39;s.&#0160;</p>
<p>And everyone who knows <em>Othello</em>&#0160;will hear in the word &quot;Palestine&quot; an intimation of the violent act that once, many years ago, shook Aleppo.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>The new <em>Much Ado</em> is a charming, understated success. The actors are not trained Shakespeareans; they&#39;re tv series folk, and they say the lines conversationally and casually, paying scant attention to the verse or to the mannered prose rhythms. It works, on the whole, although some of the great lines are delivered so unemphatically that they&#39;re swallowed and lost. Whoever would imagine that Benedick&#39;s &quot;the world must be peopled&#39; could slip by an audience without e&#39;en a giggle. The text is judiciously pruned -- the only major omission the nighttime ceremony for presumably dead Hero -- but that&#39;s a scene that has always made me uncomfortable so I wasn&#39;t sorry to see it go. The Dogberry-Verges sequence is a brilliant deadpan triumph. There&#39;s very little added business, thank you, but what there is, is choice. The actress who plays Beatrice (Amy Acker) has borrowed so much from Emma Thompson&#39;s delivery (in the last filmed <em>Much Ado</em>) that if you were to close your eyes, you&#39;d think that you&#39;d time-traveled back to 1993.The director, whom I had never heard of but is apparently famous, is Joss Whedon. Thanks, Joss.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve seen many many modern films in which hero and heroine don&#39;t get on at first but little-by-little find themselves in love and in marriage. But Shakespeare was there first. Beatrice and Benedick are the mom and pop of a half-a-zillion subsequent comedies. It&#39;s good to see them as alive and thriving as they are in this realization.&#0160;</p>
