Title: November 22
Date: November 23, 2006

On November 22, 1963, we were living in a small third-floor walkup on Irving
Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  It was in the afternoon.  Some high
schools students (Cambridge High and Latin was just around the corner) were
walking by.  One of them shouted to another, "Kennedy's been shot.  In
Dallas."   I immediately thought "this is bad.  That kid shouldn't know that
Kennedy's in Dallas."  So we turned on the radio.  And began to grieve.

I don't think that this country's ever regained its balance.  Jack, and then
Bobbie and Martin Luther King  -- the heroes of the left taken out, one by one,
by assassins.  Without the murders, we'd never have had Nixon and Reagan and
Cheney and Bush and Rumsfeld.

If we ever can get the United States on track again, then, only then, can we
cease to grieve.
