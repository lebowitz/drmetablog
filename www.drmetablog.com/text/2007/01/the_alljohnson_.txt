Title: The All-Johnson Team
Date: January 26, 2007

Here's the eagerly-awaited all-Johnson NBA team:  Magic, Marques, Kevin,
Dennis, Gus.  Everyone knows the first four, but only those with a few years
on their backs will recall Gus Johnson, who averaged 17 points a game and 13
rebounds in nine season with Baltimore.  Johnsons in reserve:  Vinnie ("the
Microwave"), Larry, Joe, Avery.  There's not a last name that can compete
(there are 49 NBA Johnsons to choose from, including the three Eddies and the
three Georges).

I would lay odds that the Johnsons would easily defeat the Williamses (though
not in depth -- 54 Williamses played in the league).  The all-Williams team: 
Gus, Aaron, Buck, Walt, Deron, Jason, Herb.  All of them role players -- no
real stars in the group.  What about the 53 Smiths?  Could they compete with
the Johnsons.  I don't think so:  Elmore, Adrian, Joe, Kenny, and all three
Charleses (subsumed into one mega-Charles) could play, but they'd be better if
the rules allowed them to use Rik Smits at center.  Who else?  The Millers --
not much there beyond Reggie. The Joneses:  Caldwell, Bobby, Sam, K.C., Eddie,
Popeye -- good but not in the same league as the Johnsons.  It's Magic and the
guys by a landslide.  Anyone out there with other suggestions?  Search here
