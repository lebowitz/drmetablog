Title: Some Parallels
Date: March 30, 2007

Leonardo Sciascia's laconic and precise "metaphysical mystery" The Day of the
Owl (Il Giorno della Civetta, 1961) is set in unwholesome, Mafia-dominated
Sicily.  Captain Bellodi and Sgt. Major Ferlisi, dedicated and intelligent
police officers, investigate a series of horrific crimes. Their trail leads to
the local boss, Don Mariano Arena, but further searching opens the possibility
that an "honorable deputy" and a cabinet minister also may be implicated.
We'll never know the whole story -- Bellodi is recalled to Bologna and Ferlisi
transferred to Ancona, and the investigation languishes.

In Bush's America, Congressman Duke Cunningham is convicted of accepting bribes;
further investigation appears to implicate "Dusty" Foggo, third in the hierarchy
at the CIA. It's also possible that senior White House officials might be
involved  -- but Carol Lam, the efficient U. S. attorney in charge of the case,
is suddenly relieved of her position. The investigation languishes.

And also: Jack Abramoff is sent to jail for perjury. The trail of corruption
once again appears to lead to the White House -- but the prosecutor, Noel
Hillman, is offered a federal judgeship and the investigation grinds to a halt.

At the end of The Day of the Owl, Captain Bellodi, though exhausted and
disillusioned, resolves to return to Sicily. He will, it seems, try again.
Sciascia's unhappy novel offers a small ray of hope. It seems to say that it is
wrong to succumb to hopelessness and despair in the face of political abuse. A
useful moral, I think.
