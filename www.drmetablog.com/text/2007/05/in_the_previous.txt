Title: Another "Loyal Bushie."
Date: May 10, 2007

In the previous post, I recorded two archetypes of "Loyal Bushies" -- the
Moronotron and the Henchdoofus. Here's another one.

The Spoiled Rich Prick. Typically, the SRP attended boarding school at
Phillips something-or-other or at St. Somebodies in New Hampshire. Although he
learned nary a thing, and his SATs were under 1000, he was admitted to Yale
(which his father, grandfather, and great-grandfather attended) and in his
senior year was tapped for membership by Numskull and Boners. The SRP went
on to study at the Harvard Business School, where he graduated dead last in
his class. Although eligible for the draft, through his father's influence
he was able to secure a place in the National Guard, from which he was
frequently absent-without-leave.  For a decade or so after Harvard, the SRP
was distinguished for booze, cocaine and drabbing. Friends of the family set
him up in a business, which failed, and then bought him out for many millions.
Then the SRP's father decided that he was too incompetent to enter the family
business, so he had him elected governor. He still holds high political office
and is famous for his laziness, rhetorical incompetence, anti-intellectualism,
partisanship, ignorance, truculent stubbornness, petulance and bonehead errors
in matters of national consequence.

in mind."
