Title: What Happened in Our Precinct
Date: February 05, 2008

The big news is that our caucus drew unprecedented hordes of voters.  Our site
is the local elementary school.  We're a "super-site" -- seven precincts in
one building.  In the past, we'd have ten or a dozen or at an absolute maximum
thirty attendees per precinct.  Tonight, at 7pm, when we were supposed to come
to order, there were still long lines of folks of all ages waiting patiently
to register. Eventually, the super-site drew 707 people! When our precinct was
finally able to get organized, there were an astonishing 129 people in the room
-- breaking all records by a multiple of four or five.  We voted 92 for Obama,
37 for Clinton and we divided our delegates 4-2.   It was exhilarating to see
so many unfamiliar young faces.  It was also, as dem events are likely to be,
chaotic, amusing, and enthusiastic.

I asked new attendees what brought had them out.  I received two answers. 
Most frequently, George Bush, who, I was told, has driven the country into a
ditch, broken the treasury, ruined the civil service, shredded the constitution,
exhausted the military, ruined the environment, packed the judiciary, fought
a senseless unnecessary, and endless war, and put loyalty to his wing of the
party ahead of loyalty to the country.  The second reason:  Barack Obama.  No
question but that Obama has given people in our precinct new hope.

My conclusion:  Colorado is looking good for the Democrats in November.
