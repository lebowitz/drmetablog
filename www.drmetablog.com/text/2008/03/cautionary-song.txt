Title: "Cautionary" Songs of the 1950s
Date: March 03, 2008

A while back, I recalled that during the late 1940s and early 1950s, students
at P. S. 217 in Flatbush were force fed patriotic and religious music. I've now
remembered (perhaps it's the DHA) that we were also indoctrinated with songs
that could be called "cautionary."  For example: do not chase a bouncing ball
into the street, because while you could get a new ball, but "you can't always
get a new leg."

I also remember a lyric in which we were exhorted to solicit divine
intervention, and which contained these deistic lines: "Pray in any language, to
Him they all are dear/ Pray for it is music to His ear." It was this same song,
I believe, in which we were allowed the ecumenical freedom to pray "in temple,
mosque, or tabernacle,/ He won't need to search."  (I had heard of temples, but
the word "mosque" was beyond my ken and "tabernacle" was a complete mystery,
though it had warm associations with "pumpernickel.")

Does anyone out there in Bloglandia remember either of these songs?  Or other
cautionary songs from the old days? They don't google. Any information or
citations will be much appreciated.

Incidentally, despite the well-meant advice, I pursued many a rubber ball into
the street. Nor was I ever once moved to pray in a consecrated building, except
perhaps in Ebbets Field, and then only in tough ninth-inning situations.
