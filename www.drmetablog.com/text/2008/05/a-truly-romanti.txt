Title: A Truly Romantic Poem
Date: May 09, 2008

The poem that might entrance you when you're young might not be the poem for
your older years. In my "mature" phase, poems that I earlier ignored take on
new significance. I'm now quite taken with Tennyson's "Ulysses,'" a dramatic
monologue that meant nothing to me until a few years ago. "Ulysses" celebrates
perseverance, a late-onset virtue.

Another poem that I've latterly come to love is Robert Burns' jaunty "John
Anderson my jo, John." To me, in my present incarnation, it's the most romantic
poem in the English language (or, to be precise, the Scottish language).  While
most love poems celebrate desire and longing, "John Anderson," takes as its
subject continuity and longevity. As opposed to more conventional works that
come to climax with a wedding, "John Anderson" situates itself near the end of
life and glances happily backward over a life well lived. Its frankness about
bodily changes is comforting (especially to readers who may no longer glow with
first youth). John Anderson may be bald and gray and tottering, but he's still
loved and loving.

The cheerful woman who speaks the poem has lived "hand in hand" with John A. for
a lifetime.

John Anderson, my jo, John                            dear

When we were first acquent,                         
 acquainted

Your locks were like the raven,

Your bonnie brow was brent;                           smooth

But now your brow is beld, John,                      bald

Your locks are like the snow;

But blessings on your frosty paw;                     head

John Anderson, my jo.

John Anderson, my jo, John,

We clamb the hill tegither.

And many a cantie day, John,                          happy

We've had wi' ane anither.

Now we maun totter down, John                      must

But hand in hand we'll go,

And sleep thegither at the foot,

John Anderson, my jo.
