Title: Stepping Eastward
Date: June 14, 2008

It's just about 2000 miles from our residence in Colorado to our summer quarters
in Vermont.  Early this week I made my 33rd drive from the one to the other. 
We were lucky -- we sidestepped both floods and tornadoes, though fields were
flooded throughout Iowa and there was impressive and nasty twister damage in
Aurora, Nebraska.  There were the remnants of dwellings and big hunks of metal
roofing lying on the side of the road.  Nevertheless, it was one of our easier
trips:  four solid ten- to twelve-hour days of driving.  As usual, I was
impatient for the first hour  -- It takes a while to get into the swing. 
But after a while I went into a "zone"  -- otherworldly, attentive, resigned,
content.  It's another state of being.

It was only at the end of the trip, along narrow and undulating Route 4 from
Rutland to Woodstock, when for twenty miles I trailed the Executive Director of
the Slow Drivers of America, that I lost my equanimity.  I was just about to
metamorphose into the Incredible Hulk, vault from my vehicle and toss the guy
and his Plymouth into the Ottaquechee River, when I found an opening to drop
into third, floor it, and zoom by him.  Ah, what satisfaction!

It's an amazing trip -- an ever-changing and fascinating landscape.  Some
people claim that the mid West, with its astonishingly large cornfields, is
boring, but those who think so are just not paying attention.  It's a long
book, to be sure, but every page is different.  Despite the pleasure of it all,
I'm relieved to get out of the vehicle, stretch the old legs, and get going on
the gardens.   With nothing on the driving horizon except an occasional trip
to town for supplies.
