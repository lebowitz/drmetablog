Title: Road to Hannibal
Date: September 23, 2008

Stepping westward, we left St. Louis behind and detoured northward to enjoy
scenic Route 79 to Hannibal. Well worth it --lovely, well-cultivated bottom land
and wonderful vistas from the bluffs overlooking the Mississippi.  We toured
Louisiana, an old river town where a handful of century-old mercantile buildings
are hanging on precariously, waiting to be redeployed for modern uses.  I
recommend if, especially for those who are not fazed by a seventy-five mile add-
on to a twenty-four hundred mile jaunt.

While I'm dispensing advice, let me also commend Route 50 between and Bridgeport
and Parkersburg in West Virginia -- another less-well-traveled and very
beautiful highway.

Louisiana, Missouri (unknown to me until today) now enters that small but
distinguished category of cities that are named according to an unusual
template.  Others include Washington, Vermont (and many other states),
Delaware, Ohio  and Delaware, Wyoming and Indiana, Pennsylvania. Related but
Impure:  Kansas City, Missouri; Michigan City, Indiana.
