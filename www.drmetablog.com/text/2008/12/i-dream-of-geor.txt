Title: "I Dream of Georgie with a Whole Lot of Shoes."
Date: December 15, 2008

Just before pulling the blankets over me, I watched (via You Tube) the Iraqi
journalist wing not one but both his shoes at the Duck Most Lame. Not much of an
arm, I thought, but a symbolic act of courage nevertheless. A few hours later,
waking from troubled sleep, I realized that my dreamatorium had been working
overtime. I had imagined a White House press conference where at a signal all
the correspondents, led by Helen Thomas herself, unzip, untie, unvelcro and hurl
whatever was on their feet at the Great Incompetent. He weaves and bobs, takes
one on the shoulder.  Everyone is on board but Fox, whose "correspondents" lace
up even tighter. Next  thing you know, regular citizens start packaging pairs
of old shoes and mailing them to "W, The White House, 1600 Pennsylvania." Huge
mounds of shoes fill a nearby warehouse; the secret service refuses to estimate
the total but reporters guess fifty cubic yards. Someone creates a Facebook
application "One Million Strong to Hurl Shoes at George W."  Everyone visiting
El Lamo is now asked to remove shoes before meeting with him; but then, what
do you know, people start throwing their smelly socks. I dreamed of political
buttons: "I'm Shoeless for George." And songs: "I Threw A Shoe at You Know
Who."  A website springs into existence: send ten dollars from anywhere in the
world and we'll leave a pair of old shoes at the front gate of the White House.
It's a democratic movement: all shoes are equal. Sneakers, loafers, Blahniks,
boots, moccasins, babouches, buskins, pattens, galoshes, scarpines, clogs, air
georges. A protest movement with real soul.
