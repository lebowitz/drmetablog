Title: More on Sam Cooke
Date: December 08, 2008

Sam Cooke's "A Change is Gonna Come" condenses centuries of tangled racial
strife into a brief lyric. The song begins in rural, impoverished, perhaps
southern, America: "I was born by the river, in a little tent."  Then, with
a glance at the old man river who just keeps rolling, it alludes to African-
Americans as on-the-lam outsiders: "Just like the river, I've been running
ever since."  The third stanza, now shifted to an urban location, refers
specifically to the insult of segregation (shortly before writing the song,
Cooke had been barred from a Shreveport hotel): "I go to the movies and I go
downtown;/ Somebody keep telling me, don't hang around." The second stanza
is surprisingly confessional for a man who had started his career in gospel
and had sung lead for the Soul Stirrers;  it's about loss of faith. "I don't
know what's up there, beyond the sky." Nevertheless, despite all the reasons
for losing heart, including the lack of support from brothers of different
political factions, Sam retains an uncompromisIng optimism: he will "carry on,
yes I will." The song is a miniature allegory of a triumph over separation and
persecution. It celebrates endurance, perseverance, fortitude in the face of
long odds.No wonder that Barack Obama adapted Cooke's affirmative "Yes I will"
into "Yes we can."

Sam Cooke himself didn't get to the promised land; he was shot, under
"mysterious circumstances" in December of 1964. "A Change is Gonna Come" was
released posthumously.
