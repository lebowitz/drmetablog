Title: Nightmare Made Worse by Critique
Date: December 27, 2008

Last night -- another horrible dream. I was riding in the passenger car of an
old-fashioned railroad and there was this big puffy guy, a smaller version of
Oliver Hardy, who was brandishing a pistol. He was about to take hostages and
shoot us folks. I grabbed his gun arm and wrestled him to the floor, but he was
mighty strong. I called out to the other passengers, "Help me!"Â  Eventually, a
couple of people came to my aid and started to twist his arm. Then I yelled out,
"Hit him!" and a couple of people started to bang his head with books. Heavy
books. Then I shouted "Kick him!" and a crowd gathered and started in with their
feet. After a while, I realized that the gangster/terrorist/kidnapper was dead,
but I continued to punch to and kick him. I woke up with my heart beating 180 or
so.

It took a while to regain my equanimity, but it wasn't long before I returned to
sleep. I dreamed that I was reporting the dream to my daughter and son-in-law
and that they were totally uninterested and bored by my story. Which I took to
be a critique of my ability with narrative.

So if I tell any more dreams, I'll abbreviate (as I did above, where I left out
all sorts of interesting details) for fear of alienating my audience.
