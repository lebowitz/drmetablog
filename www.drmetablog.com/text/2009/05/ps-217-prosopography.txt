Title: P.S 217 Prosopography
Date: May 15, 2009

After the passage of oh-so-many years, I've become shamelessly curious to
know what happened to the friends and classmates who graduated from P. S. 217
in June of 1952. There were about 175 of these golden lads and lasses, and you
can see their pictures here.

I know just enough to pique my curiousity. Lester Silberman became a
gynecologist, Stephen Lewin an editor, Herman Bressel was career navy, George
Coven an entrepreneur, Fred Litto a professor in Brazil, Buddy Sogluizzo a
librarian, Melvin Polay a CPA.  Allen Guday emigrated to Israel and Stuart
Blickstein to South Carolina.  Nicky Antonucci died in Korea.  But I have
no information on 90% of the boys and 100% of the girls.  Hey, guys and gals,
check out the pictures and help me track down those missing members of the
class of 1952.  Where the heck are you?  What have you been doing since 1952?

We're all 70 years old;  It's now or never.

Am I the only one who's curious?
