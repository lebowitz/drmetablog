Title: Updike- II
Date: July 15, 2009

In Terrorist, Updike takes us inside the head of a young,malleable, soft-spoken
Islamist fanatic.  The protrayal is persuasive, in part because the horror
bigotry is understated and casual.  It's quite a feat of imagination on the
author's part.  It's a good novel -- a page-turner, as they say.  It's
most remarkable feature is that the hero of the novel is a tired and bedraggled
high school guidance counsellor;  What a breakthrough -- the guidance
counsellor, figure of o-so-much contempt and satire, as savio!.  Of course,
the contrived/dramatic ending in which the terrorist and the counsellor square
off is totally unbelievable, but at least it doesn't involve fistfights
or animatrons.  On the whole, Terrorist is a very readable, imaginative and
largely satisfying novel.  It's a bit spare, laconic  -- but perhaps it
only seems so because I'm also reading Doestoevsky.  It's not a novel for the
ages -- it's too obviously occasional.  And I must say, I'm suspicious of
a piece of fiction about the interaction of various ethnicities in which the
only two Afro-Americans are a whore and a pimp named Tylenol.

Off to the Bradford Public to see what else is in their Updike holdings.
