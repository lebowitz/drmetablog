Title: Salad Daze
Date: January 15, 2010

What would prompt a guy to dream that his carrots were growing upside-down?
Their abundant orange roots pointing straight into the air?  What point is my
dreamatorium trying to make?  In this particular nightmare, I'm absolutely
perplexed about photosynthesis. If they're upside-down, how do they..?

There's more. In the dream, my lettuce is growing right-side-up, but it's
encrusted with some sort of white stuff that forms a collar around the base of
the plant.

Courageously, I taste it. It's -- by gosh -- feta cheese. Salty, but still quite
good.

What the heck?
