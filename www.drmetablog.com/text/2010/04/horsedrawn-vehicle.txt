Title: Wow!  Still Another Nineteenth-Century Horsedrawn Vehicle
Date: April 09, 2010

It's a patache, and George Sand (in The Miller of Angibault [1852]) offers a
detailed account. The patache, it would appear, was a blast from the past even
in the early nineteenth century.

"Madame de Blanchemont left in a simple patache, that respectable relic of
our forefathers' plain tastes, becoming rarer with each passing day. The one
which it was Marcelle's unhappy fate to encounter was of the purest native
construction and an antiquarian would have contemplated it with respect. It was
as long and low as a coffin; no springs of any sort diminished its charms. The
wheels were as tall as the cowl. The cowl itself was made of a sort of wattle
and daub, so that every little bump rained clods of clay down on the travelers'
heads. A thin but ardent little stallion drew this rural carriage quite nimbly,
and the patachon, the driver, seated himself on the car-shaft with his legs
dangling down."

The patache, which seems to be aÂ country cousin of the "springless kibitka"
combined with elements of the basket-carriage, may now be added to the long list
of obsolete horsedrawn carriages.
