Title: Sign of the Times
Date: October 07, 2010

I had a prescription to fill for amoxicillin.  I noticed that there's a
new pharmacy on Pearl Street;  or at least I thought there is.  It's
called by the very pharmacy-sounding name Boulder Rx.  I walked in: 
very definitely not a pharmacy.  Not when there's a large illustration
of marijuana leaf and a sign that reads "Headies."  And a very thick probably
bullet-proof plate glass window separating customers from clerk.  Sign of the
times.  MMJ (medical marijuana) is now perfectly legal here in Colorado.

I took my prescription elsewhere.

From the Boulder Rx website:  "Menu: Bubba Kush, Tangerine Kush, Sour D,
Chemdog, Godfather, Sour Kush, Purple Cinderella, Mananuska, OG Kush." 
Different strains, not doubt designed to attack different diseases.  I wonder
exactly what is cured by Purple Cinderalla.

Toto, I've a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.
