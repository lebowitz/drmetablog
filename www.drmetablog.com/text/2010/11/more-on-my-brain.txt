Title: More on My Brain
Date: November 01, 2010

How come my friend Ken W. can hike for three days in the mountains, dig a hole
and cache his supplies, and then, the next summer, return to the exact spot to
retrieve his stuff, while I can't turn around twice without getting lost? 
Why is it that my college roommate, Allan K., could draw a detailed map of
any place on earth from memory, while my friend Ellen P., equally intelligent,
cannot remember whether Kansas is north or south of Nebraska or east or west
of Missouri, or whether Wales is on the east coast or the west coast of Great
Britain?  How come some people have perfect pitch and others can't tell if one
note is higher or lower than another?  Why is it that some people who can't tie
their shoelaces are brilliant at mathematics?

How does it happen that there are baseball players who can take a quick look
at a ball coming off a bat and run to the spot where it's going to land and
stick out a glove and catch it?  How do they instantaneously calculate and plot
their course?  Why did I, as a youth, start in, veer left, turn right, and
then circle about in hopeless confusion?

Why is it that the only act of the human brain at which I am
naturally superior, gifted even unto genius is one of the least important? 
I refer, of course, to speling!
