Title: Nineteenth-Century Vehicles Yet One More Time
Date: December 13, 2010

In order to illustrate the precarious social standing of Mr. Smouch, who takes
Pickwick into custody for debt, Dickens described his carriage as neither one
thing or another.

"The vehicle was not exactly a gig, neither was it a stanhope.  It was not what
is currently denominated a dog-cart, neither was it a taxed-cart, nor a chaise-
cart, nor a guillotined cabriolet;  and yet it had something of the character
of each and every of these machines.  It was painted a bright yellow, with
the shafts and wheels picked out in black, and the driver sat, in the orthodox
sporting style, on cushions piled about two feet above the rail.  The horse was
a bay, a well-looking animal enough;  but with something of the flash and dog-
fighting air about him, nevertheless, which accorded both the vehicle and his
master."

The original readers of Pickwick Papers would have known exactly what is meant
by a "guillotined cabriolet."  I suspect that there's a joke there, but the
joke has perished.  I certainly don't get it.

Is there also joke in "bright yellow?"  What is the usual color of a gig or
stanhope?

There might be all kinds of jokes in the following list of socially-
crepuscular horsedrawn vehicles, none of which precipitate hilarity, but
of which the sum amuses me greatly:  barouche, basket carriage, berlin,
britchka, brougham, buckboard, buggy, cabriolet, caleche, cariole, carryall,
chaise, chariot, clarence, concord wagon, coupe, croydon, curricle, cutter,
daumont, dearborn, dennet, diligence, dog-cart, fiacre, fly, fourgon,
four-wheeler, gig, go-cart, governess cart, hansom, herdic, jaunty car,
jersey-wagon, kibitka, landau, patache, phaeton, pill-box, post-chaise,
rockaway, shandrydan, shay, sociable, spider-phaeton, spring-van, stanhope,
sulky, surrey, T-cart, telyezhka, tilbury, tarantass, trap, troika, victoria,
vis-a-vis, wagonette, and wurt.
