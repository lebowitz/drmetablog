Title: "Rio Grande" (1950) Then and Now
Date: January 03, 2011

Last night, on the big HDTV, with the collaboration of Netflix, and peering
through our toes, we watched the John Ford cavalry movie "Rio Grande." I
first saw this film in the year of its release (I was eleven years old) at the
Leader Theater on Coney Island Avenue.

In days of yore, it was the custom for the neighborhood urchins to take in a
double bill on a rainy Saturday afternoon.  It was a good way for our harried
mothers to dispose of us for four hours -- and on the cheap, inasmuch as the
price of admission was only fourteen cents.

"Rio Grande" was a perfect kind of urchin movie. Good guys (cavalry) versus bad
guys (Indians), lots of action, no overt sex. It offered much too much singing,
but the slow periods would have been enlivened by hoots, whistles, popcorn-
throwing, banging the head of the kid in the seat in front of you with the heel
of your hand, primitive pre-flirting, and chasing in the aisles.

In 1950, Maureen O'Hara (John Wayne's estranged wife), was puzzling if not
inexplicable  -- merely an impediment to the action. Sixty years later, she is
beautiful, dignified, even majestic. The poor Apaches, who for me and for my
heedless comrades were nothing other than targets for cavalry bullets, are now
unutterably tragic. John Wayne was then an immensely heroic figure, but with the
passing of years. he has become a rigid incompetent dope.

The West, in those days, was part Monument Valley, part myth;  now I live in a
West that has nothing to do with Coney Island Avenue, even less with John Ford.
