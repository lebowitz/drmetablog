Title: Whores
Date: January 13, 2011

This reminiscence will not mean much to anyone but my born-and-bred-in-Brooklyn
readers.

One of my smart schoolyard buddies, Jimmy Nolan, won a scholarship to Columbia.
He was a year or two older than I, and the first of our gang/crowd to venture
out of the neighborhood. The summer after his first college year, we were
sitting in front of the candy store, drinking egg creams and practicing our
spitting, when someone asked Jimmy "what's it like up there." "Up there" was the
far north, Morningside Heights, in Manhattan, where Columbia was located -- the
end of the earth, kind of. Jimmy said, "You might not believe this, but up there
they pronounce "hua," "hor."

I remember thinking, why would they do so?  Don't they know any better?
