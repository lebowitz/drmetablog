Title: A Very Distressing Memory
Date: April 08, 2011

There's been a re-birth of nativism in the "give me your tired, your poor" land
that I love. The right-wingers, who need someone to hate, have decided that
anti-Hispanic and anti-Muslim noise-making is just what our beleaguered country
needs right now.

All of which brought to mind a painful memory. Sometime in the 1970s, I was
sitting in a coffee room at the U. -- a rare event for me -- and a group of
people were recalling happy moments from their various childhoods. One of the
participants was a grey-haired woman perhaps 15 years older than I. She was a
secretary or administrative assistant at not mine but some other department. She
was a kindly, competent, unpretentious woman with whom I occasionally exhanged a
few words of greeting or business.

I can't remember exactly what the other participants ibn the discussion
remembered from their early days -- probably hunting trips with dad, hitting
the winning single in a softball game, a romp with the family dog -- but I will
never forget what Masako recalled: "When I was in the internment camp in Utah,
one day Marian Anderson came to sing for us."
