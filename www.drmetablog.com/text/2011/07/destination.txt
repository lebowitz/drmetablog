Title: Another GPS Tale
Date: July 25, 2011

Hackett Hill Road is two twisty, depopulated, uphill-and-down miles long. It
is unpaved and seriously washboarded. If you didn't know for sure that it was
a public thoroughfare, you might think that you had accidentally turned into
someone's long driveway.

Most of our guests arrive from the South Road side of things, which is an easier
passage. We're just .2 from South Roadm a much easier ride than the long route,
off of Route 25. The GPS, which most people use nowadays, takes people the long
way.

Directly adjacent to the graveyard, which is the only obvious remnant of the
old community of West Bradford, lies our narrow driveway. It's inconspicuous
and steep, but we've posted a wooden sign with our street number. The number is
an innovation;  we didn't have one until 9/11 -- nor did we need one, because
there's no mail delivery on Hackett Hill. (We go to town to pick up mail; Muriel
at the post office takes good care of our occasional packages and flyers and
medical bills.)

Some friends, new to rural Vermont, traveling from Denver with their two teenage
daughters, came to visit us the other day. They were a bit intimidated and
possibly a little anxious as a consequence of their slow passage along Hackett
Hill Road. Although they were carefully following Sheila, which is what they've
named their GPS (ours is Dorcas) they missed our sign and overshot their mark.
Sheila, the idiot-savant, nevertheless announced, "You have arrived at your
destination, on left." On the left, of course, was only the cemetery with its
lichen-encrusted marble gravestones. They were surprised and amused --their
vehicle, I'm told, filled with hilarity -- but were poised enough to continue to
the end of the road, make a U, and initiate a most pleasant visit.
