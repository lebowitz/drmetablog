Title: Trollope on the Kindle
Date: September 16, 2011

My first purchase for the new Kindle was a "set" of fifty novels by Anthony
Trollope for $4.95 -- or ten cents for each spacious, digressive, leisurely
book, many of which I have read in the past as three-volume baggy monsters.
Initiating a 21st-century electronic device with classic Victorian novels
tickles me.

The Kindle fits nicely with my latter-day anti-clutter neurosis. No need to buy
a new bookcase. No need, even, to dust the volumes.

It's a new way of reading, but whether for better or worse I can't yet say. The
Kindle is portable and easy on the wrist. There's a built-in light for cloudy
days and the middles of nights. But I'm used to knowing where I am in a novel.
How many pages I've read, how many to go are elements crucial to the experience.
I miss, frankly, the heft of the book, the gratification of accumulating all
those turned pages. (The Kindle notes the percentage of the book that you've
read, which is helpful but not satisfying. And when you buy fifty novels in a
bundle, the K tells you only that you started The Eustace Diamonds at, say, 26%
and finished at 29% -- information which is utterly useless.)

Can You Believe Her? clearly signaled that it was coming to an end, but Phineas
Finn, this time through, came to a conclusion that seemed to be far more
hasty than in previous readings. I was surprised that Trollope left so much
unresolved. But then, perhaps he had a sequel already in mind.

I need to remind myself that the first readers of these novels didn't read
them in book form. They read them as periodic installments in magazines. The
experience of reading a novel in the course of a year or eighteen months was
profoundly different from zooming through 800 pages in a few days. While
there's  nothing "authentic" about "kindling," the kind of Trollope-reading at
which I've had a lifetime of practice is  equally artificial.
