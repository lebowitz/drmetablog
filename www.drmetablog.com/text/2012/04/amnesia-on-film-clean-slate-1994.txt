Title: Amnesia on Film: Clean Slate (1994)
Date: April 17, 2012

I imagine that the "pitch" went something like this:

"Ok, we have the star, Dana Carvey, who's hot right now. He's a funny man. He's
going to play a detective who watches The Maltese Falcon on the tv and thinks
he's Humphrey Bogart. And there's a coin that's worth seven million dollars and
a bunch of guys are after it. But here's the gimmick. Carvey has amnesia and he
doesn't know that he has the coin. And then the real kicker -- not only does he
have amnesia, but he has a kind of amnesia that starts over every time he goes
to sleep, so he doesn't even know what he did yesterday.. Ain't that terrific?"

Well, it must have been terrific, because someone decided to put some money into
the film, and someone managed to persuade James Earl Jones and Michael Gambon to
take supporting roles in this bird-brained turkey.

Did anyone say, "Does amnesia work that way? Is there a kind of amnesia that
begins again every morning."

If they did, I know what the answer would have been. "Who cares? This is not
real amnesia, it's movie amnesia"Â  --which is, once again, the most malleable
of maladies.

So here's a new genre, the amnesiac-gumshoe farce. A small, unpromising genre.

It's an unfunny movie that hovers between D (for dumb) minus and F (phony). I
doubt anyone's ever heard of it, except for hardcore amnesia fans. And even they
were disappointed.
