Title: Where We Are, 2012
Date: November 08, 2012

The Republicans now draw most of their strength from the former "slave states."
Here's the evidence and the map:

In 2012, Republicans won only 55 electoral votes from the free states. Obama
carried 332.

I don't think it's coincidence or merely an association.  I think it's a cause.

In order to support slavery, a person has to deform and distort his brain; he
has to learn to make or accept arguments that are innocent of fact and logic and
fellow-feeling.  He has to damage his intelligence and ruin his morals, and,
apparently, he must pass the consequences on to his children and grand-children.

And so the sins of slavery continue to be visited upon us, yea even unto the
seventh generation.
