Title: Baseball, 1955 and 2012
Date: December 13, 2012

In 1955, Duke Snider lived at 178 Marine Avenue (in Brooklyn's Bay Ridge). His
was the middle house in this picture.

Gil Hodges lived here, at 1120 32 Street. Two floors, 1400 square feet.

Harold "Pee Wee" Reese and family made their home in 970 square feet of 9714
Barwell Terrace. Carl Erskine's home, at 9318 Lafayette Walk, was even smaller,

just 910 square feet.

Sandy Amoros lived in Bed-Stuy, in this brownstone at 147 Bainbridge Street,
most likely on just one of the three floors. His was the leftmost building.

And here is Alex Rodriguez's 2012 house in Miami, Florida.Â  It's up for sale
for $38,000,000,

which is what 19,681 square foot waterfront properties go for nowadays. A
bargain, for all I know.
