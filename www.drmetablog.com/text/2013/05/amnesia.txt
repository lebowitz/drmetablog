Title: Amnesia on Film: The Vow (2012)
Date: May 20, 2013

Amnesia movies continue to thrive. This latest, The Vow, made a bunch of money
but was widely panned.  And should have been. It's a sad sad day when the
amnesia is more credible than the male lead.

The Vow purports to be based on the story of Krickitt (sic) Pappas, who lost
the memory of eighteen months of her life in a automobile accident. Her husband
re-courted her. and re-won her; they lived happily ever after. They're sticking
to the story that she never regained her memory of those lost months.

i have no particular reason to doubt the tale, improbably though it might seen.
The brain is another country; they do things differently there. And Rachel
McAdams, who plays Krickitt, is the most persuasive amnesia-victim I've yet
encountered. Because she doesn't take the amnesia for granted, Hollywood-wise,
but struggles to figure it all out, she seems to be genuinely afflicted.

Nevertheless, it's incredible that she should be in love with that lump of all
lumps, the lumpish Channing Tatum, who turns his character, Kim Carpenter, into
a affectless lump.  I've encounted talentless actors in my life, but Tatum is
something special.

Nor do I believe that the lovers either met or were reunited at the "Cafe
Mnemonic."

The Vow is pure, unashamed soap opera, although it is more credible about the
disease than most amnesia offerings, perhaps because it offers no cooked-up,
nonce oversimpliication of what's going on in the brain.
