Title: A New Much Ado (2012)
Date: July 04, 2013

The new Much Ado is a charming, understated success. The actors are not trained
Shakespeareans; they're tv series folk, and they say the lines conversationally
and casually, paying scant attention to the verse or to the mannered prose
rhythms. It works, on the whole, although some of the great lines are delivered
so unemphatically that they're swallowed and lost. Whoever would imagine that
Benedick's "the world must be peopled' could slip by an audience without e'en a
giggle. The text is judiciously pruned -- the only major omission the nighttime
ceremony for presumably dead Hero -- but that's a scene that has always made
me uncomfortable so I wasn't sorry to see it go. The Dogberry-Verges sequence
is a brilliant deadpan triumph. There's very little added business, thank you,
but what there is, is choice. The actress who plays Beatrice (Amy Acker) has
borrowed so much from Emma Thompson's delivery (in the last filmed Much Ado)
that if you were to close your eyes, you'd think that you'd time-traveled back
to 1993.The director, whom I had never heard of but is apparently famous, is
Joss Whedon. Thanks, Joss.

I've seen many many modern films in which hero and heroine don't get on at first
but little-by-little find themselves in love and in marriage. But Shakespeare
was there first. Beatrice and Benedick are the mom and pop of a half-a-zillion
subsequent comedies. It's good to see them as alive and thriving as they are in
this realization.
