Date: March 03, 2014

Charlie Dressen (manager, Brooklyn Dodgers,1951-53):  "You  know something?
I never read a book in my whole life.... I can read newspapers and magazines.
But I never read a book. You think I should?"

Jean Harlow (actress, on her birthday wishes): "Don't get me a book. I already
got a book."

Anatole Broyard (critic): "If it hadn't been for books, we'd have been entirely
at the mercy of sex."
