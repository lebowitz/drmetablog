Title: Rocks Out, Rocks In
Date: June 08, 2014

I'm late as usual getting in the vegetable garden. After many years of adding
manure and compost and leaves, the soil is soft and fluffy. But every year,
rocks and more rocks.  When I first started this garden in 1978, I was pulling
out boulders; then large stones, then small stones, now one-inch stones and
pebbles. Why do I continue to do so?

Because my father took the rocks out of his garden. I remember once, as a
small child, saying to him, "Dad, you'll never get all the rocks out of your
garden."  "True enough, he replied, "but I'll have fewer rocks"  From which
response I realized that he was not an idealist but a meliorist, as I am.
So every year, a new crop of rocks. I put the rocks on the driveway, in the
low spots where puddles accumulate after a rainstorm.  It's ridiculous, I
know;  we order seven cubic yards of crushed stone for the driveway every few
years, so a bucket of rocks makes very little difference.  But if feels good
to perform two useful services at once:  rocks out of the garden, rocks on the
road.
