Title: On the Kindle with Tertius and Rosamund
Date: July 11, 2014

I'm reading Middlemarch again. It's either my fourth or fifth time through the
best novel ever written in the English language. If you want to know about the
nineteenth century, start with George Eliot.

I had the oddest feelings fifty pages in. (Actually, "pages" is an anachronism
because I am reading on the kindle.)  Lydgate is flirting with beautiful,
empty- headed Rosamund Vincy.  I thought "this time let him be smart;  let him
not marry Rosamund."  I must have been in an unusally plastic frame of mind,
or in some sort of reading reverie. I know that novels are immutable, but I
was hoping against hope that Lydgate had learned something since the last time
I read the novel. Even though he made a fool of himself with that actress in
Paris. And then last night, just before I turned out the lights, Lydgate did
it again -- fell for the blonde curls and the glistening eye. He's learned
nothing, not a thing, in the last ten years. And now I have to live through
the saga as his crush turns into crushing disappointment and bitterness. Marry
in haste, repent at leisure. Poor Lydgate.

The kindle changes the input but doesns't do a thing for the outcome.
