Title: "Creating Space"
Date: November 14, 2014

If you listen to the announcers of the NBA games, basketball players defy the
laws and logic of physics. They "create space."

One of the greatest space-creators was Shaquille O. Others merely imitate his
technique. His most characteristic play was to drive his massive left shoulder
into the chest of the defender, knocking him backwards a couple of feet. When
he had gained a sufficient advantage and had room to maneuver, he would flip
the ball (awkwardly) toward the basket. HIs defender would as likely as not be
charged with a foul while the pre-Newtonian announcers would celebrate him for
'creating space.' And a beautiful game would be transformed into a brutal game.

And why is LeBron James allowed to create space on his every drive to
the basket?  He's gifted enough that he doesn't need the advantage; but
nevertheless, he routinely pushes off with his off hand, often lodging his off-
elbow in the chest of the hapless defender.

I often watch LeBron create space on hdtv where I've precorded the game. I can
therefore watch the same play again and again. In doing so I stop time, or run
time backwards. He creates space, I stop time.

So two can play at defying Einstein.
