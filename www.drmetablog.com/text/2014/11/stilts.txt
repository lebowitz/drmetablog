Title: Still Another Occupation Not For Me
Date: November 21, 2014

So far my list includes taxi-driver, trapeze artist, surgeon, dog-groomer,
monk, and hostage. Here's another.

Last week I had a room on the twelfth floor of a new downtown Brooklyn hotel.
From my window I could watch a new skyscraper being assembled. The basic I-beam
members were in place and concrete floors and ceilings had been poured. But
the structure lacked external walls!!  Where there will be walls sometime
it the future, preferably before the building is leased and inhabited, was
what looked to be an orange plastic mesh, perhaps reinforced with a thin
cable or two. From my vantage point, I could could see right through to the
interior of the building. There men on aluminum stilts were spreading on
the ceilings something that might have been plaster but was more likely some
sort of curing preparation for raw concrete. Let me make this clear: men
on stilts were plastering ceilings in rooms that had no exterior walls and
where a slip or trip would send them plummeting twelve stories to the hard
sidewalk. Frankly, I found it difficult to watch without vivid and horrible
imaginings flashing across my vulnerable brain. So without hesitation I can
add to the set of occupations in which I would fail ignomiously, stilt-walker
in high-rise construction. A terrifying way to make a living, especially for
people like me, pre-frightened by heights.
