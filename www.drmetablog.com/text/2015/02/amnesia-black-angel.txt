Title: Amnesia on Film:  Black Angel (1946)
Date: February 07, 2015

Black Angel is a good, fast-paced Cornell Woolrich mystery and certainly
one of the noiriest of all noirs. It features lots of grimy black-and-white
photography of seedy hotels and bars, and a nebbishy weakling who is falsely
accused of murder and who is rescued from execution by a last-second phone call
to the Governor. It also offers a blackmailing chantoosie and a hogshead of
red herrings. The plot turns on an unusual episode of amnesia. Martin Blair,
played by Cornellian Dan Duryea, has strangled his cheating ex-wife while in an
alcoholic haze but doesn't remember that he did so. He gets himself involved
with the attractive wife of a man who has been accused of the murder, abandons
alcohol for Coca-Cola and sets out the find the killer. Eventually he falls
off the wagon, and in a blackout suddenly "remembers" that he himself is the
perpetrator. "It's Korsakoff's syndrome," mumbles an authoritative doctor,
trying to add a glimmer of credibility to a doubtful turn of events.

I had never heard of Korsakoff's and I thought it was just mumbo-jumbo, but
it turns out there is such a condition: "Korsakoff's syndrome is a chronic
memory disorder caused by a severe deficiency of thiamine. It is most
commonly caused by alcohol misuse."

But Korsakoff's is not a come-and-go disease; it's a progressive deterioration.
Moreover, there's not the vaguest hint in the "literature" to suggest either
that a Korsakovian is likely to commit a murder and then forget it or that a
second bout of drinking can restore his memory.  That sort of stuff is strictly
Hollywood

Once again Hollywood amnesia proves to be the most flexible and variable of all
diseases.
