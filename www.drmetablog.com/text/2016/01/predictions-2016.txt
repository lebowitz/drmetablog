Title: Predictions -- 2016
Date: January 03, 2016

As is well known, Vivian de St. Vrain, fully accredited prophet (Senior
Fellow, American Society of Prophecy), has an unparalleled record of accurate
prognostication.  Vivian has once again retreated to the mountaintop and has
returned with a new set of predictions for the coming year.

Read and be dazzled, fit audience though few. Here's what's going to happen!

1)   there will be unusual weather patterns in North America;

2)  a famous Hollywood actress will sue for divorce;  moreover, another (or
possibly the same) Hollywood star will become pregnant; another (or possibly the
same) actress will gain and lose a great deal of weight;

3)  a well-known American or possibly European athlete will be accused of
taking drugs;

4)  a politician will be accused of taking bribes;

5)  questions will be raised about the safety of America's food supply;

6)  there will be either a monsoon, an airplane crash, or a capsized ferry in
Asia;

7)  there will be fluctuations in the stock market;

8)  there will be turmoil in the Middle East.

9)  a religious leader will be involved in either a financial or a sex
scandal.  Or perhaps both.

You read it here first. Loyal readers: check back at the end of 2016.  Let's
see whether a senior but world-class professional prophet still has enough left
in the tank to foretell the future one more time.
