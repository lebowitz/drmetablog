Title: Squirmish
Date: January 24, 2016

Sarah Palin, wordsmith, famous for her portmanteau "refudiate" (a blend of
refute and repudiate) has struck again with "squirmish," a coinage which
amalgamates "squirm" and "skirmish."  Here's the relevant sentence:

"Those are legitimate questions on both sides of the aisle, and another big
question that has to be asked is 'Are we at war?' I haven't heard the president
say that we are at war, and that's why I, too, am not knowing: Do we use the
term 'intervention'? Do we use 'war'? Do we use 'squirmish'? What is it?"

What, indeed?

I cherish the irony that the Governor is concerned with precision in language
and is troubled that our military actions in Libya lack proper definition.

I myself, an admirer of "squirmish," am puzzled by her use of the present
progressive "I am not knowing" where a native speaker of English would say, "I
do not know."  Is it an alaskanism with which I'm not familiar?  Did they
neglect to teach the present progressive at the University of Idaho, where Ms.
Palin earned her degree in Communication? Or is she perhaps an imperfectly-
trained foreign agent smuggled into the country by the Stasi or the KGB with the
mission of undermining the American polity?

Moreover, it is wonderful out of all hooping that "palin" means "backward" in
Greek.  As "trump" means "deceive" in French.
