Title: More New Orleans Dialogue
Date: February 06, 2016

At a restaurant at the corner of Jena and Freret, the over-tattooed waitress,
acknowledging our appreciation of the greens, fennel and kumquat salad, said,
memorably, "People do not understand the beauty of the kumquat."  An excellent
instance of found poetry. And all the more brilliant in context, because I
myself once asserted that "kumquat" is the most obscene-sounding word in the
English language.
