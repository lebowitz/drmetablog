Cheerful, lively 70ish woman:  "I was alone for thirty years. I didn't
even have a date. He (man in a Mardi Gras green bowler hat) grew up in a
French-speaking family in Rhode Island,  We shacked up for a couple of
years. Then he wanted to get married. At our age it's all about finances, so
I said, why not?  He's funny. He's very good to me. He likes to do things. We
live six months of the year in Arizona and six months in Alaska, fifty miles
south of Fairbanks. There's good fishing. We're just here for a couple of
days. We're going on a cruise in the Caribbean. Now we're on our way to
find a restaurant that has the best hamburger in the entire south, he says."
