Title: Amnesia on Film:  Love Letters (1945)
Date: April 17, 2017

Here's another film in the sub-genre that might be called a "Did I Do It."  And
still another case of "post-murder amnesia."

Singleton, who can't remember anything, even her own first name, is played by
Jennifer Jones with a kind of distant unfocused look about her. She is seriously
troubled; in addition to her amnesia, she's been the victim of a prank in which
Alan Quinton (Joseph Cotten) wrote her Cyrano-like love letters under the name
of the lout Roger Morland. She fell in love with the author of the letters, but
alas, deceived, married the lout. Now the lout has been murdered and Singleton,
blamed for it, is just out of the mental hospital where she was incarcerated.
Did she do it?  Of course not. She may not have a clue, but Alan and we the
audience suspect that she's too pretty and harmless to have done anything bad,
let alone committed a murder. Eventually, the truth outs and the real murderer
is revealed. Singleton regains her memory and gains the replacement husband (the
eloquent Alan that she wanted all along). It's a mighty unbelievable story but
whenever amnesia is involved, probability goes flying out the window.

Bosley Crowther, the New York Times film critic at the time, who never liked
anything, called it "sentimental twaddle." I myself, once disbelief is not only
suspended but obliterated, found it to be a quite an engaging mystery.
