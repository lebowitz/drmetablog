Title: Geological Words New to Me
Date: January 03, 2018

Unlike most sciences, where there are numerous pseudo-Greek or pseudo-Latin
coinages, geology offers all sorts picturesque and lovely words that have
been in the language for years  -- and are novel to me. So "graywacke" --a
muddy sandstone containing particles of quartz"; "fumarole" -- a small vent
emitting jets of steam; "sinter"  -- a crust of calcium carbonate; "molfette"
-- a vent emitting gases such as carbon dioxide; "coquina" -- a cemented mass
of debris of shells; "clint" -- a sharp ridge; "grike" -- a fissure or crack
opened by dissolving limestone; "knickpoint" -- a sharp step, up or down, in
a river; "gour" -- a calcite ridge formed when water rich in carbonate flows
over an irregular surface; "drumlin" -- an isolated mountain; "nunatak" -- a
projecting peak in land otherwise covered by ice;  "firn"-- a mass of ice
pellets compacted by the weight of snow above;  "cwm" -- a steep rock basin;
 "col" -- a narrow pass; "esker" -- a winding ridge formed by retreating
glaciers; "pingo" -- a cone, dome  or hump caused when freezing water expands
beneath the permafrost and pushes up the earth; "yardang" -- parallel ridges of
hard rock.

I'm not convinced that I could recognize any of these phenomena of my own
accord. I'd probably need a professional geologist or guide. But the words
themselves sure are magnificent.  And this is just a small sample of the
wordhoard.
