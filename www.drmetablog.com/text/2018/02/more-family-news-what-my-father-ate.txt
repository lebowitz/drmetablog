Title: More Family News:  What My Father Ate
Date: February 01, 2018

Sardines, a tin at a time. Herring, canned, either in wine sauce or in tomato
sauce. Whitefish. Lima beans, which came into the house dried but which
were soaked to plump up, then boiled and mashed (but not for me, if I could
possibly avoid them). Potatoes in any form, but usually mashed and buttered.
No chicken or lamb chops, but lots of tongue. (When I left home, I vowed never
to eat tongue again, and, trust me, I've kept the faith.) Chopped chicken
liver mixed with hard-boiled eggs and onions. Steak, when we could afford
it. Roast pork with applesauce. Delicatessen meats -- salami, baloney,
corned beef, frankfurters. Baked beans, courtesy of Heinz. Apples, seeds
and all, right down to the stem. Chocolate in any form, but especially white
chocolate. Halvah, a particular favorite. Dates and figs, dried. Black
radishes and onions, soaked in gribbinis. Tschav, borsht with huge helpings
of sour cream. Corn on the cob. Slimy canned Harvard beets. No alcohol,
nary a drop. On hot days, not beer, but instead iced tea or iced coffee.
Cheese, either Velveeta or Swiss. Good bread -- pumpernickel or rye. Crumb
cake direct from Ebinger's Bakery. Bacon and two eggs, sunnyside up or
soft-boiled. Cream o' Wheat cereal. Swee-Touch-Nee tea. On Sunday morning,
bagels and rolls, warm from the bakery, eaten while reading the the Times (25
cents) and the Eagle (10 cents). Ice cream, the more exotic the flavor the
better.
