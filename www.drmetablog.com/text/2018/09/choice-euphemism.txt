Title: A Choice Euphemism
Date: September 29, 2018

Victorian novelists had a hard time describing bodies, especially female bodies.
Their usual practice was to sidestep such subjects entirely though the more
daring of them might resort to suggestion or innuendo.

Here's an instance in which Thomas Hardy ties himself into comical  knots
trying to tell his audience that although Tess Derbyfield (in Tess of the
D'Urbervilles, 1891) is very young and almost childish she has already developed
a large bosom: "She had an attribute which amounted to a disadvantage just now;
and it was this that caused Alec d'Urberville's eyes to rivet themselves upon
her. It was a luxuriance of aspect, a fullness of growth, which made her appear
more of a woman than she really was. She had inherited the feature from her
mother without the quality it denoted. It had troubled her mind occasionally,
till her companions had said that it was a fault which time would cure."  So
very elliptical. It's distressing that frank-minded Thomas Hardy had to resort
to such circumlocutions.

A later novelist might simply have noted that she was physically mature and that
her emotions would eventually catch up but for now she was vulnerable.

Back in Brooklyn we might have said, "Though she's only a kid, he has a pair of
gazongas on her like you wouldn't believe and they're going to get her into a
whole lot of trouble"
