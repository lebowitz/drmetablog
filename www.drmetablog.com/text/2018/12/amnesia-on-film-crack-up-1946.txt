Title: Amnesia on Film:  Crack-up (1946)
Date: December 04, 2018

Ho-hum. Another day, another amnesia movie.

Crack-up offers still another variant on this most malleable of diseases:
amnesia that is chemically-induced.

George Steele (played by too-old-for-the-part Pat O'Brien) presents a danger to
a doctor-thief played by reliable Ray Collins. To discredit  him, Steele is
kidnapped and injected with "narcosynthesis" which causes him lose his memory
and act erratically. Too many silly plot complications and a couple of murders
follow, but eventually a second injection brings Steele round.

I'm not aware of another case of chemically-induced amnesia in film, but I know
that there is such a thing in medicine. Propofol and scopolamine are frequently
mentioned and I believe that even the common sleeping pill, Ambien, may have
amnesiac properties. So there's some limited scientific underpinning for Crack-
up's apparently fantastic premise.

In noir, amnesia is as common as the common cold. In the 40s and 50s, a guy
couldn't walk down a louche shadowy city street or take a dame out dancing to
 a night spot without encountering half a dozen cases. It was a regular plague.
