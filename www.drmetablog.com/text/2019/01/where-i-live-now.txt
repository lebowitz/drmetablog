Title: Where I Live:  Now
Date: January 14, 2019

1655 Walnut Street, Boulder, Colorado. On the second floor, just to the left (as you look from the street) of the main entrance. It's not a handsome building, in my opinion, but the condos are clean and comfortable and new. I've been here since 2009 and plan to stay. Going to go out feet first, as the cliche would have it. There's ample but not too much room and lots of sun (my living room windows are south-facing) and convenience. We're here more than half the year -- the rest of the time in Vermont (almost 5 months) and New Orleans (one month during the winter). We're one block off the semi-famous Boulder Mall, with all sorts of foody restaurants that we don't patronize as well as coffee shops and marijuana outlets. There's also an outdoor gear shop every few feet. Things could be worse.
