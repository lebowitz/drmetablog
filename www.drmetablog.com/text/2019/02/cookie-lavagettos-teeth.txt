Title: Cookie Lavagetto's Teeth
Date: February 10, 2019

But it's not the Montauk Club that's the subject of this paragraph -- it's the
"genial dentist" and lyricist J. T. McAteer who has quite something in store
for us. "Around the Town" continues:  "Dr James McAteer is the dentist for
the Brooklyn  Baseball Club and examines the teeth of each and every player
on the club.  Seems that Business Manager Larry McPhail is fussy about it and
insists on x-rays at least once each year. As far as McAteer is concerned,
infielder Cookie Lavagetto has a perfect set of teeth, while good ones are owned
by pitcher Van Mungo and infielder Johnny Hudson."

So now we know. Cookie Lavagetto had perfect teeth! What a revelation.
Information that has been hidden for 80 years. Everyone knows that Lavagetto
broke up Bill Bevan's 1947 World Series no-hitter with a double off the Ebbets
Field scoreboard. But who knew a damn thing about his choppers?  This is
neglected news of historic proportions.

And it makes a guy wonder about the other players on the team (aside from those
with semi-perfect teeth -- the legendary Van Lingle Mungo and unknown-to-me
Johnny Hudson). Were other Dodger teeth cavity-filled, crooked, misshapen,
stained with tobacco juice, busted, false, even missing. No wonder the '39
Dodgers were so bad. Twenty-five players and only three to write home about,
teeth-wise.

So here they are, the fabulous teeth of Cookie Lavagetto, bright and shiny,
glistening at us over the years (I'm sorry but I couldn't find a picture of
Cookie's molars).
