Title: "I could have been a better prairie dog"
Date: January 03, 2020

In a lifetime with pen in hand  or with fingers at the typewriter (or,
latterly, at the word processor), I've written a lot of bad sentences and a
handful of good ones. But last week, I composed my absolute best sentence ever.
It's pure Olympic gold; a bottom-of-the-ninth walk-off bases-loaded HR; a
sensational buzzer-beater. Deathless prose.

Let us pause to savor this extraordinary sentence. "I could have been a better
prairie dog."

Aficionados of Vivian de St. Vrain (fit audience, though few) will remember that
this mellifluous sentence appeared just a few days ago, right here. You can
appreciate it in context, if you will, but heck, the sentence stands alone.

It is beautiful in itself but one can only marvel at its delicate but meaningful
irony. Moreover, (bonus) it's near-perfect iambic pentameter.

It's become, for me, a mantra of sorts. Whenever I start to bemoan my fate, or
deplore my state, or bother myself over some missed opportunity or long-ago
failure, I mumble, "I could have been a better prairie dog."  And I immediately
regain perspective. So it's a sentence that's utile as well as dulce -- as
useful as it is sweet. Classic.

I'm absolutely confident that "I could have been a better prairie dog" will
help me through episodes of middle-of-the-night self-laceration. In fact, it's
working just as I write this.
