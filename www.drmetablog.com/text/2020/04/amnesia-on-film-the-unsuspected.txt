Title: Amnesia on Film: The Unsuspected  (1947)
Date: April 11, 2020

This time, amnesia minus the amnesia. Heiress Matilda Frazier, presumed to have
perished in a shipboard fire, returns home where she's met by Steven Howard who
claims to be her recently-wedded husband. She fails to remember him for the
good reason that she's never met him and hasn't lost her memory. It's a case
of "attributed amnesia." Not a disease at all -- merely a handy plot device,
credible in black-and-white 40s murder mysteries where amnesia is as common
as a slight cold. Matilda is temporarily deceived by Mr.Howard. So are the
spectators.

Terrific direction by Michael Curtiz, fine performance by luminous Joan
Caulfield, reliable work by steady Fred Clark, effortful ventriloquism by
Constance Bennett in a part originally written for Eve Arden.

The Unsuspected borrows much too much from Laura (1944). In addition to the
prominently-displayed portrait, there's Claude Rains channeling Clifton Webb.
Plus the heroine's return from presumed death, the curious sexless relationship
between an older man (the murderer) and a much younger woman. A smitten
investigator. Good thing there's a dollop of fake amnesia to help differentiate
the two films.
