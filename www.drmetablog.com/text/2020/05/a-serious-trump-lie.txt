Title: A Serious Presidential Lie
Date: May 09, 2020

No question but that he's a serial liar: just think of the birther thing, the
attendance at the inaugural, Sharpiegate, "the best economy in the history of
the world," that Hilary Clinton received 3 to 5 million illegal votes, "total
exoneration," the 16,000+ lies and misstatements since 2016 that the Washington
Post has catalogued. Enough falsehoods to circle the earth several times, or
more likely, stretch from here to Alpha Centauri.

Nevertheless, all these falsehoods pale in comparison to the latest revelation.

He repeatedly boasted that he was such a baseball star at the New York Military
Academy that he could have gone to the majors. Someone finally investigated. Box
scores from the 1950s show that he batted .138, with 3 rbi's and scored one run.
Said one baseball guy, “You don’t hit .138 for some podunk, cold-weather
high school playing the worst competition you could possibly imagine" and go
pro. “It’s absolutely laughable. He hit .138—he couldn’t fucking hit."

OK, he lies about everything. But about baseball? Some things should be sacred .
Off limits                                                                     .
