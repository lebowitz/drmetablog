Title: Who Knows, Who Remembers?
Date: May 07, 2020

I don't know what is signified by DBMs or EIDE. I am boggled by hard tokens.
Defragments leaves me all a-quiver. Shortcuts generally take me the long way
around. Does a firewall keep them out or me in? Kibibytes are things you would
feed to a pooch. A logic gate is beyond my capacity of reasoning. My netiquette
is primitive and when I have nodes I take them to the surgeon. Do I have a KVM
switch?Â  Dunno. My firmware, frankly, is not what it used to be. My warmboot is
frayed; my virtualization illusory.

I may not speak or understand the language of the present generation, but like
most members of my age cohort I can identify the skate key, "the cheese stands
alone," the alligator pear, a mustard plaster, "you owe your crowning glory
to,/ your something something shampoo," "L-A-V-A," "and away-y-y we go," House
Jameson, cod liver oil, Adrien Baillargeon the Canadian strongman, J. Scott
Smart, "close but no cigar," "the call letters of the stars," Mrs. Calabash, a
"rhubarb," bluing, "Well, King, this case is closed," Spider Jorgenson, Horn and
Hardart, "Pow, right in the kisser."

Alas for a youthful population who imagines that the Pontiac 13 was a group
of anti-government demonstrators or that Apples Kudelka was a middle European
dessert. And doesn't know the difference between Sparkle Plenty and Good 'n
Plenty.
