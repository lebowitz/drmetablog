Title: Deadline at Dawn (1946)
Date: August 31, 2020

Some very serious contributors to film art created this almost forgotten
whodunit. Deadline at Dawn was adapted from a novel by Cornell Woolrich and
the screenplay was written by Clifford Odets. Cinematography was by Nicholas
Musuraca and direction by Harold Clurman. That's some pretty good bloodlines.
Moreover, the principal roles were played by young, sparkling Susan Hayward and
by the always reliable Paul Lukas.
