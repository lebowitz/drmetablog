Title: My Life in Objects -- I (Tumblers)
Date: August 09, 2020

I bought these water glasses (sometimes called tumblers) about 35 years
at a long defunct antique shop in Lafayette, Colorado. They fall into the
large category known as Depression Glass in the trade and they were probably
manufactured in the 1940's or 50's -- but that's just an unsupported speculation
on my part. I don't know the name of the manufacturer so they are works of art
without provenance. I love the clean lines -- straight at the base and then
slightly flared at the top -- and also the way the glasses fit so elegantly into
the human hand. The tumblers are entirely unadorned and if they have a style
other than vernacular I suppose they might be called Art Deco. I once had a few
more of these tumblers -- perhaps as many as eight, but because they are in
constant use there have been losses. There's no saying how long these beauties
will survive -- the rims are a bit fragile and vulnerable in the dishwasher.
Although they have no monetary value, they are in my opinion both classy and
classic.
