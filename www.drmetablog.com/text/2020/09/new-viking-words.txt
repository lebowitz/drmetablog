"Haptic" -- relating to the sense of touch. A "byre" is farmhouse in which
humans live in contact with livestock. A "volute" is a spiral or scroll-like
ornament. An "allodium" is land held absolutely and not subject to feudal duties
or burdens. A "skald" is a Norse poet. "Theophoric" refers to words, often
place names, that embed the name of a god or goddess. "Futhark" is an early
or older form of the runic alphabet. A "quern" is a simple mill for grinding
grain and consists of two stones, one on top of the other. A "dirham" is an
Ottoman coin; the word derives from the Greek drachma. "Tephra" is fragmental
material produced by volcanic eruption. A "sigil" is a symbol used in ritual
magic. "Lamellar" is the adjectival form of "lamella," which is a thin flat
overlapping scale, in this case used to describe a kind of leather armor. A
"hydrarchy" refers to the rule of a piece of land from shipboard, and also to
"a pseudogovernmental system of law between pirates at sea." "Emic," a fire-new
word, describes the analysis of a culture from the perspective of a member
of that culture. And my favorite (how could I not have encountered this word
before?) -- an "ogonek" is a diacritical hook placed under the lower right
corner of a vowel.
