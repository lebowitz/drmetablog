Title: New Light on Vikings
Date: September 19, 2020

I read all 599 pages of Neil Price's just-published Children of Ash and
Elm, a detailed history of the Vikings, and I'm mighty proud of myself for
persevering.  It's a long book bristling with details and data. The author,
an archeologist, has made his own original contributions to Viking research.
To produce this synthesis, he seems to have read every relevant article and
monograph of generations of scholars. An impressive feat. I wonder, how much
will my intermittently faulty memory retain?

Has my understanding of the Vikings changed? Yes, I think it has. I knew that
the Vikings were famous for cruelty, plunder, pillage and rape, but I had no
idea that they were so deeply involved with human sacrifice and slavery. 
"The Vikings," says Price, "were not only slavers, but the kidnapping, sale,
and forced exploitation of human beings was always a central pillar of their
culture." Slaving was "the main element" of commerce with Russian and Ukraine.
The chapter on Viking slavery is grim reading indeed. It won't make you proud of
your species.
