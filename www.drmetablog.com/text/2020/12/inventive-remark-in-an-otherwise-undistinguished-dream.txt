Title: Inventive Remark in an Otherwise Undistinguished Dream
Date: December 09, 2020

Once again, I was lost, this time in a strange city -- apparently, I was trying
to drive from somewhere down south all the way to Vermont.  We park the car
and my companion (a guy totally unknown to me, by the way) asks a traffic cop
the name of the city at which we've arrived. The policeman says to my friend,
"ay, ya" and my friend says to me, and I quote this lunatic absurdity absolutely
verbatim, no embroidery whatsoever, 'He says we're in  ay-ya, which is West
Indian for New Brunswick, New Jersey."

"West Indian for New Brunswick, New Jersey?"  Goodness gracious, is that
creative, or what? Another brilliant achievement of my dreamatorium.
