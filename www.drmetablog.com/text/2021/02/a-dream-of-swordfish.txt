Title: A Dream of Swordfish
Date: February 06, 2021

I was on a rubber raft in the middle of an ocean.  Three or four swordfish
surrounded me. They were about to spear my raft and drown me -- because they
wanted my pension.

I wondered how I was to transfer my wealth to them -- could they take it out in
small, edible fish?

And so my dreamatorium continues to exceed expectations.

[February 13.  Still another "I am lost" dream, but this one with an unusual
feature. I am at a subway kiosk, trying to get a token or change for a $20 bill
so I can board the train, and the attendant says to me, "do you want your change
in money or in spaghetti?" Honest to Pete, that's what she said. I say, of
course, "I'll have it in money, please," but nevertheless she hands me a pound
of dry spaghetti, wrapped in cellophane or plastic, but already falling apart. I
walk away with the pound of spaghetti and try to get rid of it by placing it on
a window ledge, but a passer-by retrieves it and hands it back to me. "You
forgot your spaghetti," he says. Soon after I find a garbage can and stow the
spaghetti, and the dream continues in predictable channels.

I think the question, "Do you want your change in money or in spaghetti?" is one
of the best sentences my dreamatorium has ever generated.]
