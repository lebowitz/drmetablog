Title: Today Let Us Celebrate the Blanket
Date: February 07, 2021

What an excellent invention! Imagine life without the blanket. At night, we'd
still be keeping warm with hay and leaves. Yeesh, defective insulation. Hay and
hayseeds in our noses and mouths. Leaves, leaflets, thick main ribs and petioles
poking and imprinting our skin. Constant renewal problems: "Have remembered to
fetch the hay for tonight yet?" Cleanliness problems -- small insects in the
hay and leaves, however carefully processed. And then frequent trips to "Hay
and Leaves" -- the chain of stores that dominates the market. "Do you know what
they're asking this year for a half bale of leaves?"

When we pull that luxurious blanket over our shoulders, do we remember to thank
the inventor or inventors of the cotton or woolen blanket?Â  Are we sufficiently
appreciative of the luxury in which we live?
