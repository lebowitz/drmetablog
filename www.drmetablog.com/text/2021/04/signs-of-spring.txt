Title: Signs of Spring
Date: April 25, 2021

Pictured is a variety of daylily called the Charles Johnston. Looks good,
doesn't it?  First introduced by Gates in 1981, it won an award of merit
1988 from the American daylily society. I ordered a couple from a nursery in
Tennessee because they are VE (very early), tetraploid, fragrant, and reputed
to be accomplished re-bloomers (although daylillies that rebloom in the upper
south don't always do so in Vermont). It's the VE part that interests me because
I don't have any early reds. "Rich burgundy blooms."  Sounds delicious. I think
I'll put them in the vegetable garden temporarily, where the soil is, as LERM
says, "like chocolate cake" and plant them out in the perfect place, yet to be
determined. Somewhere where the large VE blooms can make a statement.

I wonder how my gardens survived my Covid 2020 absence. We'll find out in three
weeks.
