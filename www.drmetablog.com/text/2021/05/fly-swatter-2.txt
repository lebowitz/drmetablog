Title: Fly Swatters
Date: May 31, 2021

For many years, we've had to make do with this inferior fly-swatter:

It's made of molded plastic and extruded metal wire. It's not handsome -- a
ghastly inappropriate pink-purple color for the flapper and a small gauge
white- coated wire for the handle. Is there a name for this  styleless style,
other than dime-store cheap. Mid-century modern in its least attractive
manifestation. Not only unbeautiful, it leaves much to be desired in function.
The flapper is inflexible and rigid, which makes it difficult to kill the fly
without splattering it. Moreover, the wire handle lacks integrity and offers an
uncomfortable grip.

Now feast your eyes on this newly-acquired fly-swatter. It's a thing of beauty.

Notice the turned hardwood handle (maple, I believe, or possibly birch),
perfectly suited to the human hand. The heavy gauge shaft leading to a genuine
metal screen flapper. It's a fly-swatter to savor;  a classic. Many a graceful
swat in it.

An anniversary or a birthday in the offing? Nothing says "I love you" more than
a fly-swatter of distinction. It's also unsurpassed as a wedding present. If
you're in a generous mood, "his" and "hers" fly swatters will get that marriage
off to a great start.
