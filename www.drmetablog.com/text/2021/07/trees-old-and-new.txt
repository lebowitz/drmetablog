Title: Trees Old and New
Date: July 03, 2021

When we arrived here 54 years ago, the land was heavily forested but with a
limited pallet of northern conifers and deciduous trees. In the first category
were pines both red and white, three kinds of spruce, balsam fir, larch and
hemlock. Among the hardwoods were sugar maples and red maples, ash, beech, red
oak, black cherry, white, yellow and gray birch, quaking and big tooth aspen,
and alas butternut and elms, which have both now succumbed to plagues. Common
in the area but absent from our particular property were red cedar, cottonwood,
basswood, walnut, and black locust. In the 70s of the last millennium, I planted
cedars and cottonwoods; they are now mature and replicating themselves. The
walnut that I planted fifteen years ago is now 25 feet tall and very handsome.
I have only one basswood, which I found as a seedling and transplanted to to a
prominent place;  I've been waiting all these years for its descendants. The
black locusts that I grew from seeds harvested in Colorado are now starting to
make an impression on the landscape. I've also added some trees that might be
able to survive our warmer winters: a hickory (growing very nicely), a swamp
white oak, a bur oak (and its lone offspring) and a sycamore (which has survived
two winters).  I've also experimented and failed with some trees that grow just
a bit south of us: catalpa, horse chestnut, "Crimson King" maple, little-leaved
linden, and ginkgo. Perhaps I'll try again now that the weather has warmed. One
of my neighbors has successfully reared a metasequoia; it's tempting to try but
I think on the whole I'd rather stay with north American trees. On the other
hand, we'll need some new trees to take the place of the ash, which are soon to
be decimated.
