Title: The Ocellated Turkey
Date: September 25, 2022

Turkeys, I was recently surprised to learn, come in two distinct species. The
familiar one is the "wild turkey", Meleagris gallopavo, the big bird that in
broods of twenty or so, wanders around my house and garden, eating seeds,
insects, acorns and apples and occasionally leaving behind a fancy feather or
two.

They're new to the neighborhood. Until about twenty years ago, I had not seen a
single turkey; now, they're everywhere. And bold. Or perhaps just indifferent to
me.

And then there's the second kind of North American turkey. It's rare -- found,
nowadays, only in the Yucatan peninsula. It's the "ocellated turkey,"Â  and it's
one heck of a fancy bird.
