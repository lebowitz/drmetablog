Title: World's Ugliest Building
Date: November 04, 2022

The world's ugliest building, or at minimum a top competitor for the title, is
located just a block or so down the street from our present abode. Too damn
close, in fact, because it broadcasts its miasma of aesthetic gloom directly at
me. It's a large ungainly brick cube -- windowless, characterless, featureless,
probably designed by an untalented deadwood kind of guy who drew his inspiration
from a childhood of toying with Legos. "A doctor can bury his mistakes", said
Frank Lloyd Wright many years ago, "but an architect can only advise his clients
to plant vines." Vines is what this shameless structure needs -- thick ropes of
kudzu and lianas, whole Jurassic jungles of them -- but no such luck.

It's a CenturyLink building nowadays, but for what purpose it was originally
created is unknown to me. CenturyLink is an "internet provider." No doubt its
insides are more beautiful than its outside. How strange! Magnificent images and
lovely turns of phrase, unknown and invisible to its neighbors, portal in and
portal out!

I can't get a good picture of the entire building, but, please, take a good luck
at this street-side ornament:
