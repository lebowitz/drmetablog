Title: Turtles and Metempsychosis
Date: December 13, 2022

I would not want to be reincarnated as a turtle. Not at all.

Should it happen that I were to be reincarnated, I would prefer to return as one
of those great sea birds -- the Wandering Albatross or the Great FrigatebirdÂ 
or the Northern Fulmar -- that cruise for hundreds of miles over the Pacific
-- soaring effortlessly, joyriding the thermals, blissfully savoring the salt
spray at dawn and dusk. It would be glorious -- although not entirely without
a downside, because if I were such a bird I would have to sustain myself on a
repulsive sushi diet of raw fish. Yeesh.

But to live the next or a subsequent life as a turtle -- what a grim unpleasant
prospect! Turtles do not soar; they're earthbound, and they move so slowly that
they're almost immobile. At very best, they slog or plod. It's not that they're
unsuccessful in their own way; after all, they've been around for 200 million
years. Generations, therefore, have plod, have plod, have plod. But is there a
creature on earth whose bodily configuration is more limiting, more dictatorial?
Turtles spend a lifetime schlepping carapace and plastron up and down hills or
over the desert sands. How can an animal constrained to eternally lug an outsize
ponderous shell experience any kind of freedom or joy?

Besides, turtles are ridiculously ugly.
