Title: Roux/ Rue/ Rue/ Rubaboo
Date: April 07, 2023

"Roux" is word that everyone seems to know but me. To the best of my
recollection, "roux" had never crossed my personal threshold until last week
-- perhaps because I have never taken any special interest in fine cuisine.
I've now enlightened myself, but at the cost of blundering into a bewildering
etymological thicket.

"Roux," to reprise the obvious, is "a mixture of flour and fat cooked together
and used to thicken sauces.... Butter or lard are commonly used fats." But
why "roux," with its excrescent French x? Un nom étrange. Roux, if I have it
right, means brown, or more precisely, reddish brown (as opposed to "brun" or
"marron." In the case of the sauce, roux is an abbreviated version of "beurre
roux," or brown butter and, curiously, comes unbuttered into English as simply
"roux." Roux derives from Latin russus or ruber, reddish, both of which ancient
words originate in the same Indo-European root. I've now learned of a kind of
surgery called a Roux-en-Y, probably pronounced "ruin why," which is a kind of
"anastomosis"--  or gastric bypass -- in which blood or intestinal vessels
are configured into a Y shape. But although one may suspect so, this "roux"
has nothing to do with sauces, thank goodness, but is named for the Swiss 
physician who originated the surgery, César Roux. I suspect that Roux's roux
does not descend from ruber but from rufus, red-headed, as in William II, aka
William Rufus.
