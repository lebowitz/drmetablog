Title: In Which I Do a Good Deed
Date: September 30, 2023

We were sitting on a metal bench in front of the Boulder Public Library, resting
up for the half mile walk home. It was unusually peaceful; families in and
out, borrowing or returning their bags of books. Once in a while, there's a
discordant note: a homeless, drugged, or deranged person, muttering or sometimes
shouting incoherently, dragging a dirty blanket or wheeling a stolen supermarket
cart or bicycle. But yesterday there was an event. A large young man, 40ish, had
lost his child. He asked us, "have you seen a boy with a red hat." No we hadn't,
but we said we'd pay attention. The poor distressed guy ran from place to place
in the park and in the adjacent parking lot, shouting "Zack."Â  As he became
increasingly agitated, so did I. Is there a worse feeling of powerlessness than
when you've lost contact with your child. As he became more and more frantic,
I remembered Florence Dombey and Mrs. Brown, and Etan Patz, and Leiby Kletzky.
After a few moments, I said to LERM, "if the boy with the red hat had come out
of the library alone, we would have seen and noticed him. He's got to be inside
the library and I'm going to find him." I walked into the building and almost
immediately heard some high-pitched crying from somewhere in the stacks. In a
few seconds I located the boy (four-years-old, I would guess). I said to him, "I
know exactly where your father is and I'm going to take you to him." I took the
boy's hand and walked out of the library -- almost immediately to encounter the
crazed parent coming our way. I released the child and in a second he was in his
father's arms. Father and son consoled each other. I sat back down on our bench,
knowing that I had done a good deed. It was a very satisfying, human feeling.
After a brief while, we walked home uneventfully.
