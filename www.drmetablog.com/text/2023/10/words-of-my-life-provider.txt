Title: Words of My Life: Provider
Date: October 20, 2023

I first encountered the word "provider" in its positive sense as a virtual
synonym for "mensch": "he was a good provider; he took care of his wife and his
kids and his aged parents and even his employees" (if he had any).

But nowadays the word has been stripped of its warm associations and has emerged
as a cool or neutral term. I encounter the word most often when I need medical
attention. A doctor is no longer a doctor; he's been renamed a "provider." I
believe this usage to be the invention of the nefarious insurance companies that
govern and distort our medical system. "Doctor" and "nurse" are praise-words,
rich in significance. "Provider" has no resonance. It reduces your doctor to an
index or reference number and is therefore of great utility to the bureaucracy.
I can't imagine that a doctor, asked what he does, would be happy to respond, 
"I'm a provider."

The word "teacher" has, for many, a positive resonance. I was a teacher; I was
not an "education provider" -- nor would I have embarked on a career with the
aim of being considered such.

I believe that nowadays the most common use of the word "provider" occurs in the
internet phrase, "content provider."  And so the word continues on its long
downward path.
