Title: Words New to Me Once Again
Date: February 05, 2024

A dvandva compound is a formation in which two individual nouns are joined
to form a new word. Wik offers the example "singer-songwriter." I think that
"barber-surgeon" is therefore a dvandva, although I am confident that I am the
first person ever to denominate it as such. Anaptyxis is a term in linguistics
for the demotic insertion of a vowel between two consonants, as in filim for
film or realitor for realtor. A calque a word-for-word translation from one
language to another. Clausula is a term in ancient rhetoric for a consciously-
contrived rhythmic ending to a long sentence. If I've ever employed a clausula,
I am sure that it's been entirely fortuitous.

A suffete was a Carthaginian official or magistrate. A groma is a Roman
surveying instrument that had plumb lines hanging from four arms at right
angles. I do nor know how it was employed but it must have worked very well
because the Romans did some remarkable surveying. A gromatic text is therefore
a record of a survey. An ostracan is a fragment of ancient pottery onto which
writing has been scratched or incised. Since ostraca are durable they are a
primary source of archeological information. A cippus was a cylindrical stone
used as a gravestone by the Etruscans and as a boundary marker by Romans. Here's
a handsome old cippus.
