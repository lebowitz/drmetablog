Title: My Onion Heart
Date: September 15, 2024

Last night I woke from a dream with this peculiar phrase repeating itself in my
half-conscious brain: "it fills my onion heart with fear and trembling."

I have a couple of questions to ask of my capricious dreamatorium, which
although obviously capable of creating passable iambic pentameter is rarely
self-explanatory.

a) What is "it?"  What is the nameless dread that precipitated this piece of
blank verse, and b) what in the living heck is an "onion heart."  And why am
I accused of having one?  Is an "onion heart" pungent and tasty, when eaten
either raw or sauteed?  Or is it constructed of layers of scales and therefore
mysterious and perhaps unknowable.

Frankly, I don't have a good theory, except to say that I don't feel that to be
described as having an "onion heart" is complimentary. If my dreamatorium wanted
to say something nice about my heart, it had such relevant and easily available
alternatives as "lionheart" or "braveheart." Or even "sweetheart," for goodness
sake.
